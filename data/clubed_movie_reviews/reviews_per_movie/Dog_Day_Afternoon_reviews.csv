Pacino's legend.,"A brilliant movie, and a mesmerizing Al Pacino. If u thought he was spectacular in GF I, II, and Scarface....then just watch him in Dog Day Afternoon. Quite simply one of the greatest performances in movie history. Definitely my favorite. The depth with which he plays Sonny is such a treat to watch that I lost count of how many times he left me in AWE. There's this indescribable nervous energy to his performance that there's no way he'll leave u NOT feeling sorry for Sonny.Sadly, for some reason this movie is kinda forgotten when discussing Al's greatest movies/performances. That's because not many people have watched it. So please, if u consider yourself a movie fan, then go rent DDA and watch a fine movie with the legendary Al Pacino performing his art at the absolute peak of his career.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
My Ten Commandments of Dog Day Afternoon! ;-),"I've watched this film for the third time in a few years last night. Instead of writing a straight review, I'd like to jot down ten thoughts just off the top of my head concerning this exquisite movie:1) Watching this film will change forever your perception of the bank heist genre, making you question the contrived cinematic conventions these films usually make use of.2) The source of this film's paradoxical and/or farcical elements spring from life itself, not from film or pre-existing cinematic conventions. Sometimes, the absurdities of life are so great, they dwarf those included in any form of fiction. Without even trying to make that point, this film captures that concept beautifully.3) Its tone in relation to the homosexual theme is ahead of its time. In fact it's ahead of OUR time, even, in hardly making an issue out of it at all - it just IS.4) It captures the climate of the 70s in a manner so sober, you'll remember its unshowy yet authentic feel forever.5) Lumet's film brings to life the concept of the distorting lens of the media and how different groups with different agendas will turn an outlaw into a hero, with far more efficiency than Oliver Stone's brash, bloated, childish and repetitive Natural Born Killers.6) Watching this film will illustrate to the younger generations exactly why Al Pacino has earned himself the legendary status he probably no longer would deserve with his performances of the last 10 years alone. **SPOILERS**: Just watch those last ten minutes of him handcuffed against the bonnet of a car, where he doesn't say a word, but speaks volumes with his eyes and his soul just oozing out of every frame at the end of the movie; you'll remember those eyes for as long as you live!7) Watching this film, you'll realise that firing a gun-shot is a BIG DEAL in real life, and that other films make too much use of gun fire in a highly contrived way.8) All that tension deriving from pointed guns unable to fire a shot OR move away you realise Tarantino must've taken notes sometime along the way.9) No genre is old or done too many times before if it's handled with this amount of freshness, inspiration and talent.10) Watching Dog Day Afternoon for the third time has filled me with the same amount of wonder at the power of truly inspired but unobtrusive film-making as it did first time round.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
great character study and a masterful actors' showcase,"Sidney Lumet's ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is one of the most highly enjoyable and wildly funny movies I've ever seen - smart, sharp, complex, witty (and often quotable) dialogue, and superbly acted. Al Pacino stars as Sonny, an optimistic loser who decides to hold up a bank with his friend Sal (played by the late, great John Cazale) to get money for his lover Leon's sex-change operation.The film is only worked around a few sequences, and may seem overlong to some, but it works excellently because it is held together by the fantastic acting. Al Pacino is astounding as Sonny, and his work here even eclipses the excellent work he did as Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather"" (and that's saying something, because I adore that movie and his portrayal). Pacino has the facial tics and the energy and the wide-eyed optimism down pat, and his performance is extremely engaging and entertaining. Take, for example, his scene where he rouses up the crowd against the police by chanting, ""Attica! Attica! Put your f---ing guns down!"" A lesser actor would have made it insipid, but Pacino makes it oddly poignant and hilarious at the same time. (And he was robbed of his Oscar for his role.) The late John Cazale is also superb as Sal, the dopey-eyed follower, the quiet laid-back calm to Pacino's maniacal energy. It's a less flashier role, but Cazale still brings on all the laughs, especially in his deadpan delivery of the line, ""Sonny, they're saying there are two homosexuals in here...I'm not a homosexual.""Frank Pierson won an Oscar for his script for a reason - the dialogue is hilarious, sharp, and witty. Many of the lines in this movie are extremely quotable (and you can check some of them out under ""memorable quotes""). This is intelligent writing, in the sense that you will laugh and be moved at the same time.Great movie! It belongs in your VHS or DVD collection. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Al Pacino is brilliant,"'Dog Day Afternoon' tells the true story of Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale). These two guys went into a bank in 1972 in Brooklyn to rob it. They could have been out in five minuted but things went terribly wrong. Instead of a robbery it became a hostage situation. And a media circus as well.From the first second you will be totally in the movie. Afterwards I wanted to write my review and I was not able to remember how the music was, if there was any. It says something about how much the movie grabs you. The first part is very funny, I laughed a lot of times. The second part is more a drama and a thriller. Great director Sidney Lumet creates a certain atmosphere for the movie that is just right. Pacino in one of his best performances is surrounded by a great supporting cast. He was nominated for an Oscar but didn't win it. He lost it to a guy named Jack Nicholson in a movie called 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest'. The chances were probably fifty-fifty and the Oscar went to the better movie, I have to admit that. Still, one of the best performances I have ever seen. With any other actor this movie was a nice one, with him it is a great one.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Engaging at first, but later runs out of steam","What can I say about this movie?  Pacino's performance was excellent, and he definitely deserved acclaim for his great work in this movie.  I also liked Charles Durning, who did a fine job as the hostage negotiator.  Sidney Lumet is a talented director, who specializes in intense dramas and is good at stirring up the atmosphere for moments of intrigue.The film starts out very engaging, with a premise that locks you in.  The opening scenes are handled really well.  I like how we get to know the characters in the bank on an almost-intimate level.  But the film stretches. It stretches itself a little too long, with scenes that could've been considered for the cutting room floor.  The intensity just seems to dampen as the film passes the halfway mark.  The intrigue is lost, and we're watching soapy interactions between Sonny and his gay lover, as well as his angry wife.  The climactic scene is a little disappointing and could've been more exciting.I wouldn't rate ""Dog Day Afternoon"" as one of Lumet's best--though it does contain one of Pacino's best performances.  There are some memorable moments, but the film--as a whole--is less-than-memorable.My score:  6 (out of 10)",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
D Day for Pacino,"By the time Sidney Lumet's ""Dog Day Afternoon"" came around he had already learned to let Al Pacino loose. Forget the holdbacks of ""Serpico""; here we get a glimpse into the real Al, the actor who would bring Tony Montana to life in the years to come and the same man who provided Michael Corleone with such heartfelt warmth that was lacking in some of his lesser characters.There's essentially the Al Pacino as an actor and the Al Pacino as a character, and here he's the character, and it works splendidly. Al Pacino the actor comes into play when he is given a recycled script and a talentless director, which has been happening a lot lately, although fortunately his comparison, De Niro, has been lucky enough to generally avoid these blunders of older-age film-making.This is based on a true story, like ""Serpico,"" only it's better and more involving. It connects with the audience more than ""Serpico"" because it doesn't jump through the same old hoops; it goes for the long trek and comes off better than it would have had the team behind it been lazy. The clichés are gone and the originality creeps in early on. Watch Pacino indulge himself in character and let the plot sink in. It's more touching than it seems at first.Pacino is Sonny Wortzik, a Brooklyn man who takes a bank hostage in order to pay for his ""wife's"" operation. The wife is actually Leon Shermer (Chris Sarandon who was Oscar-nominated for this, his first role in a mainstream film), Sonny's gay lover who doesn't have the money for a sex operation.The bank robbery was going to be what one of classic cinema's greatest bad guys once described as a quick ""in and out,"" but Sonny gets held up inside the bank and soon he's all over the news and police are standing outside the building with guns drawn. It's like Denzel's movie only better and more original. Oh, and true. This one actually happened and we can tell.Sonny's partner in crime, Sal (John Cazale), is worried that he'll be treated as a homosexual by the media outside. His fretting is comic relief and one of the connections between the film and the audience. Charles Durning is the frustrated cop handling the situation. His performance is as subtly convincing as Cavale's.Pacino's performance is exceedingly excellent, manic and energetic. He'd display this same talent in ""Scarface"" again eight years later; only he would be bashed by the critics for going over-the-top. (Although they really just had problems with the excessive profanity and violence, just like Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" will soon become a well-known classic and people will laugh when they hear that someone once called it the most violent film ever made.)There's also one of the best scenes of all time in this movie that rivals Montana's Last Stand in ""Scarface"" or the Baptism Scene in ""The Godfather,"" which involves Sonny speaking on the phone to his ""wife,"" carefully concealing his motive from any listeners nearby. Watch Pacino delve into character here and you're immediately hooked. We like his character because he seems real and Pacino makes him real, and that's why this will go down as one of the best tour de force performances of all time.Is this Hollywood trying to ease our culture onto homosexuality and sex change operations? Is Hollywood trying to gradually introduce us to gay characters in the hope that the uptight American families will be increasingly invaded by the images of gay men? No. This is Hollywood showing us a true story, regardless of the homosexuality. Pacino could be playing a frustrated postal worker and it would still work because it all settles down to the fact that the suspense and dramatics of the movie affect us, not the background of its characters.Sarandon's Oscar nomination was more than worthy; here he displays the smarmy talent that would shine through in his characters in the years to come. Prince Humperdink from ""The Princess Bride"" is equally memorable but less realistic. Here he seems more real, which is good for this film and would have been quite bad for ""Bride."" We don't like real characters in fantasy tales, do we?Lumet, who ruined ""Serpico"" with his bad editing, out-of-place music, clichéd dialogue/events and unnecessary scenes, directs ""Dog Day Afternoon"" with style and flair and good pacing and a surprisingly heartfelt sense of emotion and care. This isn't exactly a good example of a perfect motion picture but it's pretty close.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Intense but Overlong,"This is based on the true story of a bank robbery that went awry. It gets off to an intriguing start, jumping right into the robbery with great intensity and moments of humor, but it soon loses the momentum. It seems the filmmakers had a beginning and an end in mind, but didn't know how to fill the middle. The middle, featuring interactions with the robber's family and gay lover, is just soap opera, causing the film to drag. The film opens with about five minutes of random shots of NYC, serving no purpose other than to pad the running time when it's already overlong. Although Lumet tends to encourage overacting, Pacino is very good and the supporting cast is solid.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Brilliant, Funny, Touching Film.","Personally, this is one of the most touching films I've seen.The acting is superb, both Al Pacino and John Cazale deliver outstanding and memorable performances as the unexperienced bank robbers Sonny Wortzik and Sal.I should highlight the late John Cazale's performance of Sal, a character that says more with his face than he does with dialogue. Perhaps the most realistic character ever portrayed on film.Al Pacino as usual delivers a great performance as was nominated for an Academy Award playing the role of Sonny.This is a very entertaining film, filled with humor, social issues and moral issues, definitely a must-watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Al Pacino at his best,"Al Pacino stars in this film based on the set of historical events that took place in Brooklyn, New York during the early seventies. Dog Day Afternoon retells the story of these events when Sonny and Sal decide to rob a bank in Brooklyn, but their efforts seem to have failed when they realize most of the money has already been collected for the day and soon the police have the entire bank surrounded. The remainder of the film reveals Sonny's interactions with his hostages, the large media crowd that has gathered, and Detective Moretti who attempts to negotiate with Sonny. I think Al Pacino is exquisite in his role, revealing the truly human personality of someone who decided to disobey the law. I found it impossible to not feel sorry for Sonny's character, as he brought realness and a true New York feel to his role. This film also showed how the media can take something and create an enormous spectacle of it, to the point that even the people in danger are caught in the televised web and forget their potential danger. If you want to see Al Pacino at his prime acting career, Dog Day Afternoon should be on your list.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Boring Movie,"I know I will get bashed for saying that and maybe it is just that I was expecting so much with all the positive hype I was getting from friends and other students but I was definitely very disappointed with watching this movie. There was not much action and Pacino and the other robber were both good actors but it was a bit over the top and there wasn't much interesting action in this. I kind of knew everything that was going to happen so it just seemed predictable that way. I guess maybe it is possible that people long ago told me the best parts of the movie and I forgot about it but knew it was going to happen once I started watching the movie. The scene where they leave the bank is pretty cool with some good tension but other than that I was just really bored most of the time, very disappointing to me because I was expecting such a great movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Underlying Motive,"The late John Wojtowicz whose mad exploit on one afternoon in Brooklyn probably never dreamed his life would result in an awarded picture. But I suppose the Oscar that Frank Pierson won for Best Original Screenplay kind of verified his time on earth. Not to mention the five other Oscar categories Dog Day Afternoon was nominated in, Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Director for Sidney Lumet, Best Actor for Al Pacino and Best Supporting Actor for Chris Sarandon.It all happened to be sure on Avenue P in Brooklyn, the location that the film was shot on 10th Street was not where it happened, just the same borough. But the film sure comes close to graphically illustrating the bizarre carnival of events that happened in the summer of 1972.Al Pacino playing Sonny Wojcik is a gay man who has left his wife and kids and is now living with a man who has confessed to him he's a transgender individual and the doctors have recommended a sex change for him. The sexually confused Pacino and at that time he was hits on this mad move to rob a bank to get enough money for sexual reassignment. At that time the cost they're talking about is $2500.00 which now wouldn't pay for the scrub nurse. Then as now medical insurance companies won't cover it.So Pacino goes in with buddies John Cazale and Gary Springer and pulls a robbery at closing time at a Brooklyn bank. They're supposed to be in and out, but these guys aren't professional criminals. One thing leads to another and law enforcement has Pacino and Cazale trapped, Springer having opted out of the crime real early.Then the media freak show begins, at first with crowd actually on Pacino's side as he gives lip to the law. Then when they find out what is the underlying motive for the robbery, good old homophobia takes over. The cheers turn to jeers when Pacino comes out in the street for the police and the cameras.Dog Day Afternoon is a key film for the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender community in the USA. It's one of the first that explores a gamut of issues like the closet, internalized homophobia, being forced into marriage for convention's sake, even same gender marriage. It's exploitive to be sure, but does have its tender moments as well. The highlight of the film for me is the phone conversation with Pacino and Sarandon who had no idea what Pacino had in mind. Sarandon gave one of the first performances of a transgender person in a major motion picture.John Wojtowicz, Sonny Wojcik for the film did a stretch in the federal pen for the bank robbery and after he was released I met him. By the time we met, both of us were comfortable in our sexuality, I was most closeted when this incident happened. When we met it was the late Eighties. If I was comfortable, John Wojtowicz was positively reveling in it.Dog as he was then known because of the film was a character in the Greenwich Village bar scene where I met him. Dog used his celebrity, notoriety if you prefer, to get himself a fabulous share of rent boys whom he paid nominal monies for services. He carried ever ready copy of faded clippings from the crime and some of those dumb kids actually thought of him as something special. As a character Dog certainly was.When I moved out of New York I didn't see Dog around any more and he died a few years ago. The man had his fifteen minutes of celebrity and worked it to the max. This review is dedicated to John Wojtowicz as one unforgettable individual.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A spark called Pacino,"It was so freshening and attractive to see His Majesty, Mr. Al Pacino, in this breathtaking movie of 1970s. The first thing that a discerning eye would notice throughout the film is the undying uniqueness of Pacino's originality. This was just another movie destined to reassuring viewers of Al's status of an icon. The movie itself is endearing and entertaining. Though the movie is supposed to appear like a bank robbing, and in a sense it is, but deep in the heart robbing is simply a way to achieve a totally different goal, of course other than money! It is about affection and mutual caring. It's about what situations a person is ready to embark into in order to show how much he cares for another one. And I guess this is the point of the whole movie, which is stylistically decorated with dozes of sarcasm and pleasantry with sporadic undertones of bravery. The characters are all innocent which innocence seems to relate them to each other. What I deem as very courageous here are the thematic elements, homosexuality. I guess the time when the movie was made the society had still been ruled by prejudiced mentalities that could really ruin this innocuous piece of art. For this, I praise the very daring Sidney Lumet, one of my favorite directors. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Didn't quite work (for me)...,"Quite a daring film for its day, showing events almost exclusively from the point of view of the robbers. There seems to be a little Stockholm Syndrome going on where the hostages begin to identify with their captors, but this isn't explored too closely. All the performances are very good with Pacino doing some of his very best scenery chewing with Cazale consequently playing it down and very understated (I liked that). It didn't work for me though because I never bought into the stories we learn about Sonny; it's him the film concentrates on mostly. He seems quite savvy when it comes to banks and police/FBI procedures and yet still panics when the police first arrive. I never had any connection with for either of the robbers and so found it quite a bumpy road to go down. Having said that I thought it was well made but certain scenes came across like a bit of an improvised scene in an acting class. I doubt I'd watch it again, but at least it's another I can cross off 'The List'.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (just)My score: 6.1/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stand & Deliver...,"... which it does, in buckets. Founded on a very interesting true story, embellished by Al Pacino who turns it into gold, albeit not in the quantities his character would have hoped for. With a stonking supporting cast, non better than John Cazale, you'll be drawn into the events presented as if you were there on the day, or afternoon, and quite probably investigate further as the titles start to role. Without question one of the best films of the 70s and one of few that retains its progressive and powerful impact all these years later.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Definite Masterpiece,"What transfixes me throughout every scene of this sinewy, offbeat film is the extraordinarily pragmatic realism of the hurtles Sonny and Sal confront inside the bank. Not even twenty minutes into the film, we find we're already seeing things absolutely no other crime film has ever included that are astonishing in their dramatic persuasiveness. The head teller and the bank manager picking apart Sonny's plan with him. One clerk's husband calls and asks what time the robbers will be through so he knows if he has to cook for himself or not. While ordering the bank manager to help him block the back entrance by moving a big desk, Sonny asks offhand why he'd hire a diabetic as a guard, and is told in ordinary person-to-person terms what a guard's salary is and why poor old Howard has that job.And when does Mulvaney the bank manager, played by captivating unknown character actor Sully Boyar, tell hostage-taker he'd like to see his family again but if someone must be taken, take him? When he's helping his captor move a big desk to block the back. They sound like regular working urbanites so caught up in the daily grind of city life that they might as well be making small talk in an elevator. Later, the phone rings, Sonny picks up, it's a sicko telling him to kill 'em all. Sonny hangs up after four seconds, moving on. The female tellers sit and sweat while giggling about the same silly things---""He said the f-word."" ""Well, I'm a Christian and my ears are not garbage cans.""---in the thick of a hostage situation and a media circus. Poignant, real.Every nuance of Pacino's performance is incredibly realistic. He practically possesses the audience, as we can begin to expect certain things from him and care about him because he's played by an actor who completely subsists as him. At points when characters speak of him off-screen, speaking of things that we are surprised to hear about him, that take us aback and color his image, Pacino has prepared the size for those turning points to fit in. His improvised scenes are exceptional as well, and are in fact some of the most riveting, nail-bitingly intense scenes in the entire film. In such scenes, he is matched by the great actor Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon's becoming fulfillment of his role.Indeed, this is by far Durning's most riveting performance. He works so well here because in shouting matches with Sonny, he looks and sounds entirely his age, not a movie character. He's fat, middle-aged, tired, just as surprised as everybody else. He runs short of breath, trying desperately to keep up with the pressure cooking higher all around him. As Det. Sgt. Eugene Moretti, Durning epitomizes the thankless job of a police officer more candidly and perfectly than any other movie cop I've ever seen. One of this stunning succession of brilliant scenes is the first time Sonny emerges to talk face-to-face with Moretti in the street, which begins with a protracted pin-drop silence and slowly, steadily, invisibly culminates in deafening, ear-splitting chaos.Lumet opens the film with a montage of city scenes in NYC with a good getting-up-in-the- morning song like Elton John's Amoreena and with the same indifference ends up on Sonny, Sal and their friend waiting outside a bank in a car, an image that just happens to continue. This is a great way to demonstrate the it-could-happen-anywhereness. Lumet's overall direction of the film is beautiful, indicative once again of the masterful mainstay of cinema in the 1970s. The climactic final ten minutes are ruthless in their steadily unraveling, almost unbearably intense tragedy. It's not only one of the most effective uses of sound to create drama I've ever seen, but everything concludes exactly as it would in reality.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Just End Already,"This movie was insanely boring. Two hapless, wannabe bank robbers hold up First Brooklyn Savings Bank to have it thwarted almost immediately. One of the robbers, Sonny (Al Pacino), besides being a bleeding heart criminal he was indecisive.

In the beginning the women who work in the bank are afraid, but once the situation escalates into a sideshow, some the women become comfortable with the situation. Basically, the entire movie is in the bank and all types of comedy and drama surrounds it. This is Al Pacino early in his career and for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, I definitely recommend it. Just keep in mind between all the madness you see in the film that this is a true story, and very entertaining!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An interesting true story made a good film with great performances,"Brooklyn, New York. Sonny, Sal and another man walk into the bank and hold it up.  Seconds into the job, the third man changes his mind and leaves. The job starts to go wrong when Sonny discovers that the truck he was told was dropping off money, was actually picking it up, meaning the vault is nearly empty.  Things get worse when the police arrive outside and trap the two inside with a handful of hostages.  As Sonny and Sal try to keep control, a circus breaks out on the street with the police, the public and the media all involved.I have seen this film several times but it has been a few years since I last had the chance to see it.  I watched it again today with the memory of it being good but not really as truly great as many seem to think it is.  The plot is all the more fascinated for it being true but it is not an easy subject to bring to the screen.  While morally most people can accept robbers in films as characters to support, it is a bigger step to accept the sexualities and complexities of these characters and to get behind them. However the film actually manages to make this quite moving and difficult - not only do we feel for Sonny but the film is fair to him and, more impressively, Leon. It would have been easy to turn this relationship into a joke but the script allows it to be done with sensitivity.  The rest of the film captures the sense of circus and media feeding frenzy well as well as being quite tense and enjoyable to watch.The film's strength is it's performances and, in particular, Pacino in a performance that is both showy and understated at different times.  He is a real person and it is to his credit that, no matter the revelations about Sonny, he never loses the audience.  Cazale is good here too but in a different way - a simple, sympathetic character.  His hit rate is amazing when you think that he was only ever in a handful of films and they were all pretty amazing, but it's hard to tell how good an actor he was really. Durning is good in support and the rest of the cast are pretty good but it is Pacino's film and he manages well with the shouting, the silence and the complexities of his characters.Overall this is not one of the best films ever made but it is certainly a very good telling of this true story.  The film deals very well with both the tension of the situation but also the underlying stories and characters - even more surprising for the period it was made in, it makes a very balanced presentation of the homosexual characters.  The direction is very good and the performances are all good, but it is Pacino's film and he does very well with it.",,Anonymous,Biography
Most realistic film I've seen,"This amazing film somehow manages to capture the dense texture of real life. Improvisational acting, no artificial lighting, no costumes or makeup other than what was essential to the character, and no musical score help make it that way.  So do intense performances from Al Pacino, John Cazale, and Charles Durning.  Frank Pierson's screenplay was well-constructed, although 60% of the dialogue was improvised.  It allowed room for moving drama, so-surreal-it-could-only-happen-in-real-life comedy, and quite a bit of suspense.  The characters are sketched out incredibly well, with even minor ones having their own ""moments.""  Director Sidney Lumet deserves kudos for orchestrating the whole thing, and proving himself a master of the open form.  The film also carries an excellent message of tolerance.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another masterpiece from Al Pacino (DVD),"As in each of his great performances, there's a always great story , a great director behind and amazing co-stars (look at John Cazale in his ghostly role!!!)So if Pacino seems lately to repeat in bad guy roles in second zone movies, blame his choices of scripts & directors but not his talent of acting.""DDA"" is really the kind of movie I like, because it is: - anti-conformist - deeply humanthe bad guys are maybe not models but they show sensitivity. The police are depicted as blind, cold and Machiavellian. It is the only movie I recall in which the gangsters seem to appear as victims.As it's happening in New-York at summer, it's a Brooklynian precursor of ""Do the right thing"" 10 years before.In conclusion, a must-see !",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Finally, a 'great' 70's film that lives up to the hype","Being such a big movie fan, I discovered there were still many ""great"" films, especially from the 70's, I haven't seen yet. ""Love Story,"" ""The Way We Were,"" ""Straw Dogs"" and more, I check them out and they're all overrated tripe.I was hoping ""Dog Day Afternoon"" wouldn't fall into that category, and it hasn't. It's actually a very gripping tale and filmed just beautifully, and casted even better. Al Pacino of course is great, and even though he does walk a little close to the ""overacting"" line (a line he crosses throughout his entire career to some degree) he just stays safe here.Charles Durning was excellent as the head cop trying to keep things cool, and the scene with him and Pacino simply bickering back and forth is priceless. When the FBI take over at one point, he pretty much disappears for the rest of the movie and it's very noticeable.This was actually filmed just blocks from where I grew up in Brooklyn so that's another reason I always wanted to see it. I'm shocked this hasn't been on the list for potential remakes, another decent movie ready to be ruined by today's Hollywood.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Dog? Where?,"I saw a bit of Dog Day Afternoon when I was about nine years old and left it this long before actually focusing on watching the whole film. Despite claiming to be the film expert that I am, I had little knowledge of what the film is actually about.Sonny and Sal (that's Pacino and John Cazale) and some other guy enter a bank in Brooklyn with the intention of robbing it. But they simply couldn't be less prepared. One second into the robbery the third robber chickens out and runs away, leaving Sonny and Sal to do it on their own. The staff are jaded and cynical but politely put up with their bumbling and are only too happy to see the back of them. But the police surround the building at the last minute and a hostage situation suddenly arouses.With nowhere to go Sonny can only make the usual demands but the media circus outside makes him a nationwide star and the crowds outside cheer for him whenever he makes an appearance at the doors. I guess that in the 70's (a decade I never witnessed) public morale was so low that a failed bank robber could actually be a kind of hero for even attempting to stick it to the man.Based on a true story, the dialogue is mostly improvised, giving it a raw, realistic feel. Despite this, the script still won an Academy Award. A young Al Pacino seems to disappear and you end up seeing him only as Sonny. Why he never won the Oscar for Best Actor that year is beyond me. But I guess they thought that Jack Nicholson as McMurphy was more iconic/important/worthy or whatever. In fact, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest took almost all the Oscar's DDA was nominated for. Having never seen that film, I can't really judge if it deserved them. It was also competing with Jaws for Best Picture that year. Man, 1975 sure was a good year for movies. Something that simply cannot be said for any year in the past decade.One my favorite actors (Lance Henriksen, the man with the coolest voice in the world) has a small role as one of the FBI Agents. I never spotted him for a while (he's still quite young in this) and he has very little dialogue, but it still a pivotal role.It's hard to define the genre that DDA fits into. On the one hand it's a hard-hitting real-life drama but on the other it's a satirical black comedy that's not without several moments of laugh-out-loud humor. Not a film for action junkies, I assume this is more for film buffs of students more than anyone else, but it's certainly an important film and it marks one of the many turning points in Pacino's never-ending career.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ignore all the hype and give it an attentive view !,"A ton of hype surrounding pretty much anything can cut both ways. Too many things are given an amount of attention that seems far out of proportion to to what is deserved or warranted. This has a way of souring people on anything in general that seems to be getting a lot of attention,as they are skeptical. And rightly so! This movie here,for example has been hyped and praised so much that it is inevitable that some may be disappointed when they actually see what they have heard so much about.How many movies have you seen that were nowhere near as good as you had heard and maybe expected?Dozens I'm sure,right?Which brings us back to this movie here.

A Good Enough Movie But How Honest Is It ?,"This follows a true life incident where two characters called Sonny and Sal rob a bank in New York . Luckily Sonny used to work in a bank because this means that he knows all the tricks like if you use a certain key it'll trip the alarm in the vault and if you take all the notes from a register this too will raise the alarm . Yeah Sonny knows his stuff so why then I wondered did he and his colleagues wear masks ? As his other accomplice gets cold feet why does he continually call him "" Stevie "" in front of the hostage opening the door and keep calling his partner "" Sal "" in front of everyone ? Is there anything more incompetent than criminals calling each other by their names while robbing people ? This tends to contradict Sonny as being a pre meditated robber and paints him more as a lovable klutz doomed to failureThis is my major problem with DOG DAY AFTERNOON . It's a film that unreservedly manipulates the audience into feeling great pity for Sonny and Sal . I don't like being manipulated . It's this lack of ambiguity that stops DDA from being one of the best movies from the 1970s and I doubt if the real life characters would recognise themselves as the people in this movie and I feel too much artistic license has been taken with a bizarre true life storyTo be fair it's an entertaining and well made film . Sidney Lumet does as good a job here as he did in THE ANDERSON TAPES but it's the performances that really stand out . Al Pacino is the best American character actor of the last quarter of the 20th century and he keeps up his very high standards here but it's an unrecognisable John Cazale who steals the acting show with his very understated performance as Sal",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Plodding and predictable,"Dog Day Afternoon, in which Michael and Fredo Corleone rob a bank. Just a year after The Godfather: Part II Al Pacino and John Cazale are together again. This time they play two bank robbers, Sonny and Sal respectively, whose robbery does not go at all according to plan. With Pacino in the lead role casting Cazale was probably a mistake. For as great an actor as Cazale was when you see him with Pacino your mind can't help but go to Fredo. Again Pacino's the star while Cazale plays the quiet, somewhat dim-witted supporting figure. It's Fredo all over again and thinking about that takes you out of the experience of enjoying this movie. Then again there isn't necessarily all that much to enjoy here. The fact that Cazale's presence may lead you to think of the Godfather movies is not Dog Day Afternoon's biggest problem. This movie disappoints in other ways. Ultimately, despite a very good performance from Pacino, it proves to be quite a letdown.So the robbery goes horribly bad and Sonny and Sal find themselves trapped in the bank, surrounded by police, holding a bunch of unfortunate bank employees hostage. And then...nothing. Nothing much of consequence anyway. The movie plods along, incredibly slowly paced, rather devoid of drama. A crowd shows up, television broadcasts the unfolding events live and Sonny becomes an unwitting media star while Sal whimpers in the back of the bank. The story doesn't really move forward. Sonny and Sal are trapped...and they're still trapped...and they're still trapped...and can I get this two hours of my life back? There's a sense of inevitability to the whole thing. Once the situation has been established there are very few potential outcomes. This is all based on a true story but even if you know absolutely nothing about the real-life events it's not hard to guess how this is all going to turn out. Really the only twist in the tale comes when Sonny's wife shows up, revealing the motivation for the robbery. And well, that's quite a twist. So bizarre you wouldn't believe it if it weren't actually true. If it weren't true any screenwriter trying to pitch it would be laughed out of the room. If nothing else at least this provides for a bit of story and character development after all the time spent with Sonny staring at the cops and the cops staring at Sonny and absolutely nothing actually happening. Aside from the introduction of the wife the movie is a rather monotonous, predictable crawl towards the finish line. Pacino is very good but he doesn't have much material to work with. There's not much story here and what little story we have is hard to believe even if it is true. The robbery fails. The movie largely does too.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Pacino's Greatest Ever Performance,"Not only is one of our greatest actors of all-time at the top of his game in this great film, but one of our greatest directors, Sidney Lumet is also on the top of his game. Dog Day Afternoon tells the story of a bank robbery gone awry. The planner is a former bank employee named Sonny, who needs money to pay for his boyfriend's sex change operation. When you hear that plot, you think comedy. Indeed, this movie is a black comedy, however, as we see in various scenes, it is also very serious. In fact, the tragic ending is a sober dose of real tragedy. Pacino makes this movie, he is that bankrobber, way over his head, trying in vain to make everything work out in the end. However, Sonny and Sal (his bankrobbing buddy) are just in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, I am glad I was able to see them there, trying in vain to make it all work out. **** out of ****.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Stupid, boring, overrated","This movie sucks, plain and simple. Every review written thus far says the same thing, ""Pacino is brilliant,"" ""great directing."" If good acting and good directing was all it took to make a movie good, then I would agree with everyone. Unfortunately, I also like an interesting plot, something this movie sorely lacks. Dog Day is over 2 hours long. In less than 30 minutes, Sonny and Sal have already held up the bank and the cops are waiting outside. That's when I realized that I had over 90 minutes to watch Al Pacino yell at the cops outside while the cops yell back at him. BORING. It took great discipline to sit still for the whole thing. This movie is proof that not everything that happens in real life is interesting. Too bad the makers of Dog Day Afternoon didn't realize this.",,Anonymous,Biography
"""I'm robbing a bank because they got money here. That's why I'm robbing it.""","It was supposed to be quick robbery  go in, steal the money and get out of there. However, from the moment that Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) and Sal Naturile (John Cazale) step into the Chase Manhattan Bank in Brooklyn, New York City, their well-laid plans begin to unfurl. Within just minutes, the bank is surrounded by a ""militia"" of policemen and FBI agents, accompanied by a curious crowd of onlookers and a scurry of eager television journalists. With nine hostages as his only bargaining tools, Sonny must think of a way of getting himself and Sal out of this situation alive and free. But has he already come too far?'Dog Day Afternoon' is based on a real-life incident. On August 22 1972, John Wojtowicz, Salvatore Antonio Naturile and a third unknown accomplice attempted to rob a bank on the corner of East Third Street and Avenue P in Gravesend, Brooklyn. The eventual result of the real-life siege is best left unknown for those who are yet to see the film, but certainly director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Frank Pierson took a certain artistic license with some of the film's events, which have been described by one significant person at the scene as ""only 30% true."" Nonetheless, this very same person praised the performances of Al Pacino and Chris Sarandon (as Sonny's ""wife,"" Leon) as being accurate.Al Pacino is superb in this movie. Fresh off the phenomenal success of 'The Godfather (1972),' 'Serpico (1973)' and 'The Godfather: Part 2 (1974),' Pacino truly was on his way to becoming one of the most outstanding performers of his generation, and his turn as Sonny Wortzik is most definitely no exception. Strong performances from his 'Godfather' co-star John Cazale, Chris Sarandon, Charles Durning, James Broderick and Sully Boyar make this a solidly-acted film.Lumet's decision to keep the film largely free of any musical score was a good decision, and certainly added to the realism of the plot. However, the one exception  Elton John's 'Amoreena' during the opening credits  simply didn't sit well with the tone of the remainder of the film, and he would probably have been best to leave it out. Also, though many of the film's scenes prove extremely riveting, there were certainly times when I noticed my attention somewhat wavering. Sonny's lengthy (and apparently improvised) telephone conversation with his ""wife"" Leon was one example of this  though it was definitely important to the story, and certainly showed off the skills of the two actors involved, I simply thought that it brought the film's steadily mounting suspense to a grinding halt.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A strong movie done in a minimalist philosophy,"""Dog Day Afternoon"" is an example of how a simple story can make a movie.Although the entire movie is about a bank robbery in Brooklyn (in the year of 1972) and despite almost the whole movie taking place inside a bank, it is involving and entertaining. This is a crime movie which is also a thriller. Besides, it is thrilling, intense, very energetic, dramatic and full of tension. There's also lots of language, particularly the ""F"" word. The movie is often hilarious in many ways too. It has very funny lines and comical moments, such as when Sal thinks that Wyoming is a country. Even the most tense and intense sequences full of screams are made in a hilarious way.The title makes perfect sense: it really is a dog day afternoon for everyone in the whole story.Solid performances by the actors is another strength. A young Al Pacino gives an extremely energetic and amazing performance as Sonny Wortzik, the leader of the bank robbery. John Cazale doesn't talk much but he is excellent as Sonny's crime partner Sal. A funny fact is that the actor who plays Sheldon (James Broderick) looks like George W. Bush. Charles Durning plays Detective Moretti, another interesting character.Sonny is one of the most interesting robber characters ever. Although he is a criminal, he's actually quite kind to the hostages (despite his use of language): he gives them what they need when they need something and he helps them when they need help in something. And his screams are incredible, as well as his funny facial expressions and his lines. We end up liking him. Sonny also makes a reference to the Attica scandal. He even calls ""squirrel"" to one of the women in the bank.Aside the opening song ""Amoreena"" by Elton John, there is no soundtrack at all in this film. Also, the opening credits have little to do with the rest of the movie. They show lots of places and activities in New York city, probably to show that the story takes place in a hot Summer day (a dog day afternoon).The best Al Pacino's movie I've seen so far and clearly better than the 1997 remake ""Mad City"" with John Travolta and Dustin Hoffman.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Successful and outlandish drama about two offbeat men involved in bank robbering,"On one of the hottest days of August 1972, on a hot summer afternoon, Sonny and two cohort, Stevie and Sal, go to rob the fictional First Savings Bank of Brooklyn . Stevie soon gets nervous and flees. Then the two amateur bank robbers (Al Pacino , John Cazale) carry out the twisted hold-up in the Brooklyn bank . At the beginning it seems to be a nice simple robbery: Walk in, take the money, and run , but things get worse . Unfortunately, the supposedly uncomplicated heist suddenly becomes a bizarre nightmare as everything that could go wrong does. The robbery should have taken 10 minutes. 4 hours later, the bank was like a circus sideshow. 8 hours later, it was the hottest thing on live T. V. 12 hours later, it was all history. And it's all true . In August, 1972, Sonny Wortzik robbed a bank. 250 cops, the F. B. I., 8 hostages and 2,000 onlookers will never forget what took place. Nobody could dream him up. His incredible bank robbery is all the more bizarre...because it's true !. In the middle of a robbery - Pizza for everyone !Anything can happen during the dog days of summer !.Stunning and high recommended film with Al Pacino once again proves himself to be in front rank of America's finest actors . Based on a true story : The most bizarre bank siege ever , on August 22nd, 1972, everything did , this taut , yet fantastic thriller centers on bi-sexual and his slow-witted buddy who rob a bank to obtain money to fund a sex change operation for the ringleader's leader . This movie was not dreamed up by a screenplay writer , it couldn't have not with all the strange things that actually happened that day in a real bank, with real hostages and with Sonny Wortzik/Al Pacino the most unreal person who ever wanted to rob a bank . Dog Day Afternoon is a masterpiece of contemporary commentary . Pacino is terrific in his character as the frustrater robber , caught in a trap of his own devising. Very controversial for its subject matter and strong language when premiered , it nevertheles became a huge hit . The four main actors : Al Pacino , John Cazale, Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon are magnificent , being nicely accompanied by decent secondaries , such as : Sully Boyar , James Broderick , Lance Henriksen , Dominic Chianese , Carol Kane, among others.The motion picture was competently directed by Sidney Lumet who keeps up the pace , fills the screen with pathos without gross sentiment . After starting an off-Broadway acting troupe in the late 1940s, he became the director of many television shows in the 1950s . Lumet made his feature film adaptation of directing debut with ¨12 Angry Men¨ (1957), which won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival and earned three Academy Award nominations. The courtroom drama, which takes place almost entirely in a jury room, is justly regarded as one of the most auspicious directorial debuts in film history . Lumet got the chance to direct Marlon Brando in ¨The Fugitive Kind¨ (1960), an imperfect , but powerful adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play. One of the best films was ¨Network¨, giving powerful scenes and providing a lavishly mounted vehicle for three great actors , Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway and William Holden .Lumet was one of the best American filmmakers, including important films such as : ¨12 angry men, Fail safe, The pawnbroker, The hill, The deadly affair, The group, The offence, Serpico , Equus, The wiz, Prince of the city , Deathtrap , Daniel, Power, The morning after, Family business, Night falls on Manhattan, Gloria, Before the devil knows you are dead¨, among others. Rating 8.5/10. Above average . Essential and indispensable watching for Al Pacino fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing Filmaking,"Dog Day Afternoon is a brilliant mix of strong drama, riveting suspense and amusing humor. The direction of the film is astounding, since the film used less than 5 locations. It still was interesting till the end. Development of the characters was outstanding, Sal and Sonny were two dimwit robbers where their characters really shined out and made the movie attractive.

Supposed classic is actually rather dull,"I was not alive in the seventies to see this movie the first time around. In 2002 when I did finally first watch part of it on video, I felt myself becoming more and more depressed about the world.  The setting of the film, the pacing, the seemingly directionless progression of events, all seemed to leave a bitter, stale taste in my mouth.  It was, in a way, fascinating to see Al Pacino at a much younger age than the movies I have always seen him in.  And the dynamic of the crowd jeering during his scenes outside brought some energy to the film that began to interest me, but I turned it off, somewhere near three quarters of the way through the film, because frankly, it didn't entertain me enough.  I still believe in Al Pacino as a great actor, but Dog Day Afternoon left me feeling as though I had wasted my time. My advice would be that you don't waste yours on it, despite rave reviews of so many self-important critics of the classics of movies.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Pure insanity, 70s classic still holds up great.","This movie is crazy. It's even crazier when you think about the fact that this all actually happened. Such an awesome story about a bank heist gone wrong. Al Pacino's performance here is among his best, as I'm sure many of you would agree. This was super interesting to watch, especially due to the fact that this was made in the mid-70s when society was a lot like it is in this film. Something about the 70s and 80s man... just makes a movie better. I try not to let the decade a film is released affect my opinion on it, but I just can't help it for 70s/80s. The aesthetic and setting of them are strangely nostalgic (even though I was born in 2004). Other than that, I thought this film was great, apart from some of the scenes that really dragged. The movie definitely felt longer than 2 hrs 5 mins. If I were you though, I'd definitely check this out.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Still ""Dogging' Us 30 Years Later","Here's a modern-day ""classic"" that endures, is still extremely interesting thanks once again to Al Pacino's intense performance and some humor mixed in with a tense crime story.

The only warning I would give parents is the profanity gets a little rough at times, especially with Charles Durning, the negotiating cop who uses the Lord's name in vain about every other sentence. All the other characters were definitely interesting, especially Pacino's partner ""Sal"" (John Cazale). ""Sal"" doesn't have to say much; just the looks on his face say a lot. The story certainly is a memorable one and a big hit when it came out.Notes: The character "" Sheldon"" is played by James Broderick, the father of Matthew Broderick.

Masterpiece,"Dog Day Afternoon (1975)**** (out of 4)This Sidney Lumet drama is one of the best films of the decade IMO. There have been countless heist/robbery movies since the early days of film-making but this one here hits all the right notes. I think the greatest thing about the film is that we get to see one of the best character developments in film history. The Al Pacino character goes through all sorts of emotions throughout the film that by the time the movie ends we can't help but feel as if we've followed him his entire life. Pacino's performance is one of the greatest of his career and what he does with this character is really something amazing to watch. The supporting cast is terrific as well. What I also love about this film is that there's no music score being used, which makes the film seem all the more real. Another great aspect is the comedy, which is used off and on throughout the movie. There are countless great scenes, including the most famous one but I think the highlight of the film is when Pacino is talking to his ""other"" wife.",,Anonymous,Biography
My Favourite Film,"Dog Day Afternoon is without doubt my favourite film of all time.  When recommending the film to friends I found myself thinking the plot was unbelievable, and to be honest it is hard to imagine when told cold.

It also has moments of extreme comedy and to say that Al Pacino has never bettered this performance shows the brilliance of the acting. He is never let down by a superb support, in which Charles Durning shines. It makes me yearn for the pre Star Wars hey day of American movies. Please see this movie",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Boys In The Bank,"""The medium is the message"", said media critic Marshall McLuhan in 1964. The presence of cameras, news equipment, and news reporters changes an event which may, as a result, take on the characteristics of a circus. Participants in the event get their ""fifteen minutes of fame"". Viewers get to gawk at reality and be entertained, no matter how tragic the event.An in-progress robbery turned media circus is the main theme of this true-life story about a Brooklyn man who, with an accomplice, tries to rob a bank. The man's name is Sonny. He's a guy with a heart, an interesting twist to our stereotyped image of bank robbers. Sonny's reason for the holdup would make for an ironic plot point in the film ""The Boys In The Band"" (1970).But from the get-go, Sonny's plans unravel quickly. A third accomplice chickens out at the last minute, embarrassing Sonny in the presence of the bank hostages. The amount of money in the vault is far less than expected. Some of the women hostages need to use the restroom, a development that our kindhearted criminal can't ignore. And an inquisitive storekeeper across the street gets suspicious. Soon, cops surround the bank. And what Sonny had envisioned as a simple easy-in, easy-out holdup evolves into an hour-after-hour ordeal, involving negotiations with the police.""Dog Day Afternoon"" is alternately funny and sad. The script is rather talky. Some of the dialogue is improvised, which adds realism. Al Pacino, as Sonny, gives a fine performance. But he's rather nasal, and a little of his shrill ranting with the hostages and cops goes a long way.The film has no score. It opens with an Elton John song, presumably coming from Sonny's car radio. Color cinematography is fine. Most of the lighting is natural.I do think the film is about twenty minutes too long. After a while, those hours inside the bank become as tedious for viewers as for the hostages. This is a film that can leave you exhausted.The circumstances of this story are so outrageous that they would have been deemed too silly had they originated in the mind of a Hollywood scriptwriter. Viewers would not have taken the film seriously. But the events did actually happen, and for a reason that only someone as complex, driven, compulsive, and altruistic as Sonny could have dreamed up.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Gritty, realistic...'70's movie making at its very best.","""Dog Day Afternoon"" is a movie that works on several levels. As a thriller it is good. The tension in the movie is at times really notable and has a very realistic feeling. Also as a character study this movie works. Not that often do we get to see the side of- and sympathize for a bank robber in a movie. The character of Sonny Wortzik gets really deepens out in the movie and we get to see him from many different sides in the movie. That he also has an homosexual affair is really daring for the time when this movie was made but director Sidney Lumet doesn't make this a prominent element in the story and is just one of the sides of Sonny Wortzik. I think that is a really good approach towards the character which works really well for the movie. If it was made a big deal in the movie that Sonny had an homosexual affair, it would had only worked distracting from the main story and for the character as well. The fact that everything in the movie is also based on a true story only makes the movie more interesting.The movie sounds heavy but thank goodness it isn't. ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is a very fun movie that is filled with some comical situations and dialog, without making this movie look ridicules or entirely comical. It makes ""Dog Day Afternoon"" a light movie to watch, even though it still has some heavy moments in it of course. Therefor this is a movie that should be appealing and watchable for everyone.The movie is filled with a very realistic atmosphere- and camera-work by Victor J. Kemper. The movie has a gritty depressing like atmosphere which makes the movie its story work really well.There is no holding back Pacino! He puts lots of effort and passion in his character. It truly is one of his most memorable roles. I especially like the scene's between him and actor Charles Durning who plays Det. Sgt. Eugene Moretti, there is a certain thrust but also rivalry between them. John Cazale also plays one fine role but his role is rather limited. It was also fun to see Lance Henriksen in this movie, in one of his very first movie roles.Yet another perfect masterpiece from the golden age of American cinema; the '70's.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A good film, but not as memorable as some people say.","Director Sidney Lumet created this film based on a true incident that is still the subject of study by police cadets today: a homosexual who decides to rob a bank to pay for his partner's sex change, but who takes the manager and the employees as hostages when things get complicated, and desperately tries not to be killed or arrested by the policemen, who surround the place and try to control a maddened crowd, who are not sympathetic to the authorities. The film was made and released in 1975, and it could not be more appropriate to the time in which it was made: the great decade of civil disobedience, of challenge to authorities and the affirmation of the gay movement.I confess that I'm not quite aware of the real incident behind the script. For that reason, I prefer to focus on this very well done dramatization. In addition to the design of sets and costumes, and an intelligent choice of the filming location, the cinematography is very well executed, and the film has very good visual qualities. The pleasant pace is reasonably fast at first, but slows down midway through, perhaps emulating the back and forth of negotiations between the authorities and the clumsy robbers. And if history is a mirror of its time, the same can be said of the dialogues, where swear words are used with a liberality previously unthinkable.Although many consider this film a must-see, I honestly disagree. It's a must-see for fans of Al Pacino or Lumet, it will certainly be a good suggestion for a 70s film cycle, but that's basically it. It's a pretty good film, but it can hardly be classified as memorable. Al Pacino is a great actor and is experiencing a particularly happy moment in his career when he makes this film, but I have to recognize that he made several better films, before and after. Just think of ""Godfather 3"", ""Scent of a Woman"" or ""Devil's Advocate"", to name a few. John Cazale is good in a more understated role, and Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon both deserve praise for a job well done.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Two outstanding performances are unable to support the entire film.,"A film of solid reputation, having all the signs of being a classic, but which ultimately falls down on a number of levels, resulting in it being good but slightly disappointing.The story is based on fact, about a bank robbery in Brooklyn which becomes a media event, heightened when it is discovered the lead robber needs the money for his gay lovers sex-change operation. The action takes place over the course of one day and 90% of the action is played out inside the bank, where the employees are kept hostage and outside where the police and a growing crowd of onlookers have formed in numbers.The two bank robbers are big-time losers, both played quite brilliantly by Al Pacino and John Cazale. Pacino gives the performance of his life as the sweaty, agitated, nervous Sonny, while Cazale is if anything even better, as the forlorn, quiet, desperately sad-looking Sal. The tragedy of the two is summed up in a hopelessly optimistic conversation when discussing where they want the jet, which they have demanded for the release of the hostages, to take them. Sonny asks ""Is there any special country you want to go to ?"", to which Sal replies ""Wyoming"".The film suffers though in its supporting characters, none of which have any depth to them. This is due mainly to the script which gives them little to do, although most performances apart from the two principals are routine at best. The bank manager and the female hostages are not developed to any degree - as the audience, we care for the two robbers, but not at all for the hostages. The police officers, and FBI agents, are all stereotypical and are unable to force either a positive or negative reaction.Many of the scenes in the latter part of the film only repeat characterisations and themes which have already been addressed. The scenes involving Sonny outside the bank playing up to the cheering crowds are good ( repeatedly shouting 'Put your guns down' and 'Attica' to the armed masses of police ), but they go on too long and there are too many of them.It is unfair to criticise 'Dog Day Afternoon' too much, as it is still very good. The film should have been much tighter, more evenly paced, at least half an hour shorter, and, like Lumets earlier classic '12 Angry Men', concentrated on dialogue for character development. What should have been a genuine early 70's classic is instead something of a missed opportunity.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A true crafty masterpiece!,"One of the greatest films I have ever seen! Al Pacino is a legendary actor! The best heist film ever made, I am ashamed I didn't see Dog Day Afternoon sooner.

"Pacino's Best, Lumet's Best","This is a love-it-or-loathe it film. I love it. It ranks very high on my all-time best list.Pacino has (rightfully) received two-and-a-half decades of accolades for his role as Sonny, the loser bank robber without the wit to hold up a Dunkin' Donuts, let alone a bank. Pacino may have won his Oscar for ""Scent of a Woman"", but this is the role he will be remembered for.But there are two key points to this film that often go overlooked. The first is John Cazale as Sal. Slow-witted and along for the ride, he is just as prepared to kill anyone who moves as he is to take a nap. Cazale was a gifted actor who only made five films before his untimely death - all five were best picture nominees and three of them won. This rivals his roles as Fredo for his best work.(Nods also go to Chris Sarandon and Charles Durning for their crucial supporting roles).The other fascinating point about this movie is its simplicity. It is essentially played out on one set and told like it is in real time, but it never really drags and it always finds a way of keeping your interest. Director Sydney Lumet creates an uneasy tension throughout this film that gnaws at you and makes you writhe in your seat. It has a walloping impact that lingers with you for days.This is a great story, skillfully directed with astonishing performances. **** out of ****.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best Pacino. If De niro has a pass for life with taxi driver then pacino has a pass for life with dog day.,"This is my all time favourite film. why? Because this is the film that to me has the best acting i have ever seen, pacino is god in this film. the story is so amazing and you don't know whats going to happen next. cazale is fantastic and to me the best thing he has done since the godfather 1 and 2. We have lost true talent with cazale, he deserved the Oscar for this. But pacino dazzles in a form that a normal actor cant explain, the passion in the mans eyes soar from beginning to end. He is the reason why i want to become an actor, the phone conversation is magic, pure magic which to many people is the highlight of the film.Attica! Attica! the words can move you. The true story makes you think, homosexuals, heterosexuals. How you see the world and society today. Way ahead of its time.All in all an amazing film which should still be mentioned today.

Only by the '70s would filmmakers dare to make this film...,"Homosexuality was still such a taboo subject for audiences to accept as a part of film entertainment that it took courage for Sidney Lumet to bring DOG DAY AFTERNOON to the screen--but by the mid-'70s audiences were already getting used to a lot of subject matter once considered taboo. This is the kind of rough-edged film that could only have happened in the Hollywood of the '70s.Basically, it's the story of two New York men attempting to rob a bank until everything goes wrong and it becomes a botched job. Motive is not just money, it's money for AL PACINO so that his love partner CHRIS SARANDON (in his film debut) can have money for his trans-gender operation. During the course of the robbery, we learn a lot about Pacino's character and he plays him in such a way as to gain a lot of audience sympathy. It's one of the best roles he had during the '70s which was a particularly good decade for him. Both he and Sarandon were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor performances.Summing up: Not for the kiddies. Plenty of profanity and adult elements that sophisticates can take easily but others beware.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Another one of Pacino's best(and one of Lumet's best),"Dog Day Afternoon had all the ingredients for at least a great movie. There's Al Pacino, a wonderful actor who has given some fine performances, and there's also Sidney Lumet, who directed 12 Angry Men and Network, which are brilliant movies. Dog Day Afternoon lived up to that and more, almost certainly one of the best heist movies out there. The script is excellent, the story is compelling even with some slow spots which I actually didn't mind and Lumet's direction is superb.The cinematography and editing are also top drawer and the sound is just great. I have little to criticise the acting about either, Al Pacino gives yet another wonderful performance that is also quite multi-layered, while John Cazale and Charles Dunning give fine support.All in all, an excellent film and some of the best work of a fine director and actor. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Superb Film and Flawless Performance from Al Pacino,"Al Pacino gives what I think is the best performance of his career in this stellar Sidney Lumet film. Pacino plays an amateur bank robber who wants to use the stolen money to pay for his lover's (Chris Sarandon's) sex change operation. All goes wrong and the robbery becomes a media frenzy, and Pacino becomes a sort of hero, winning the sympathy of the crowd against the authorities. This anti-establishment story is so bizarre that it's no surprise that the film is based on true events. Truth is stranger than fiction, indeed.Pacino plays his character as a lovable, frenzied, desperate regular Joe, and our hearts go out to him. He's not a bad guy, but he's a guy who has made a lot of bad decisions and trapped himself in a corner. Charles Durning gives a fine performance as the chief of the police who develops some sympathy of his own for the hapless crook. And John Cazale, the poor perennially overlooked John Cazale, plays Pacino's right-hand man.Lumet directs with a fast, breathless pace. It's easy to see how his background in television work makes him a perfect choice to direct this kind of ""reality T.V."" material. Indeed, as is the mark of many a classic film, the situations portrayed in ""Dog Day Afternoon"" could all too easily play themselves out for real today without much alteration.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
This film shows why Al Pacino is rightly regarded as one of the finest actors ever.,"Say what you like about the direction of Lumet, which is great, or the performances of the other supporting characters, which are also good; this is Pacino's film.  His portrayal of a jittery bank robber who becomes overwhelmed by the pressure his stunt generates is simply magnificent. There are not enough superlatives in the English language to describe it, but here's one more: Masterful.His performance reels you into the film and never lets you go for the entire running time.  It has to be said that some of the credit for this must go to the great script he was given, but it was truly a tour de force from the great man.He is entertaining whether in scenery chewing mode (""Devils Advocate"", occasionally here when the script calls for it) or oozing brooding intensity (""Donnie Brasco"", ""The Godfather's"")  Eminently watchable.I hate to turn this review into a gushing Pacino love-fest, but honestly, the film wouldn't be the true classic it's known as without him.  Great film maybe, Classic?  No, Pacino elevates it to that level.An object lesson as to how one man's performance can energise an entire film.  Don't believe me?  Think of the film without Pacino at its hub and tell me that that particular finished product wouldn't be much the poorer film.  Go on, I dare you...!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Two idiots rob a bank,"Based on a true crime and a notable media circus, Dog Day Afternoon retells the tale of John Wojtowicz (Al Pacino) and Salvatore Naturale (John Cazale), two Vietnam War vets, who have been beaten down by life and one day have a bright idea: ""Hey, banks have money, right?""The movie takes us through the events in a slow, deliberate manner. Almost no music is used, the set is almost just the bank and the street outside, the actors were given a lot of freedom to improvise their lines - especially the heated parts - and all in all the film tries to really take you there.And it works. Especially because Pacino and Cazale are two such memorable, identifiable actors. Their characters are two simple idiots, who really didn't have a plan beyond walking in with guns. But that's what makes this movie stand out. These two feel like real people, with their odd idiosyncrasies and short-fused tempers. They're certainly not the criminal masterminds you usually see in heist movies.That being said, the film can feel a bit slow, but then again, that's sort of the point. Once they end up taking hostages, it becomes a waiting game, and that's reflected in how the story is told. Could the narrative be a bit tighter? Maybe, but then again, just as I was about to become genuinely bored, the film picked up the pace and threw in some now plot developments. So it's a measured amount of slowness. Can't really argue against it.Dog Day Afternoon is a great watch if you're a Pacino fan or you're looking for a film where it feels like you could round a corner and walk straight into it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

It really is a classic,"""Am I the only one who cares about this? I mean, at least I watched Dog Day Afternoon."" So says Mena Suvari in the hilarious teen comedy Sugar and Spice when she and her fellow cheerleaders prepare to rob a bank. For years, that was my only knowledge of the famous '70s heist film, and for the sake of Mena, I finally decided to rent it.To be honest, I really only watch heist movies if there's a handsome man among the cast. Guns and violence and certain imprisonment aren't my ideal story elements, because I'm not a testosterone-raging male. Dog Day Afternoon is one of the classic bank robbery movies, so if you do love this genre, you're going to want to make sure you've seen it. It's sure to satisfy all the men in the audience, and the ladies who love Al Pacino's gorgeous, feathery hairstyle.While I was amused, decades after this movie's release, to see all the bits that are now famous-the gift-wrapped guns, ""Attica,"" among others-I can imagine the tension felt while sitting in the theaters in 1975 as Al Pacino and John Cazele hold hostages inside the bank and their plans start unraveling. There's a reason this movie has become one of the standards all other heist movies are measured against: it's good. There's tension galore as the wild, emotional star of the '70s has to improvise to try and get away with his terrible crime, so perch yourself on the edge of your seat and don't get up for more popcorn.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's starting to show its age.,"""Dog Day Afternoon"" was a big movie when I was a kid. Over these many years, the bloom has come off the rose a little bit. Not a lot but a little bit. I've never been that big a fan of Al Pacino. He can be a very good actor when the director keeps the reins on him. An unleashed Al Pacino wears out his welcome pretty quick. Pacino has some nice moments in ""Dog Day Afternoon"". There's no doubt about that but he also over does it a little bit at times, too. As far as the supporting cast goes, they're all terrific. Another knock on an otherwise good movie is it's length. It goes on a little bit too long. There were a couple of times when I felt like one of the hostages.

Does Loving a Transvestite Make You Gay?,"As with other films on the Top 250 list, I often find myself asking, ""Is this picture ranked too high or not high enough?"" In the case of ""Lord of the Rings"", the answer is they're ranked way too high. And ""Dog Day Afternoon"", while not a bad film, seems a bit odd to be ranked so high (although most Pacino fans would disagree).The movie is a telling of the true story of a man and his friend who rob a bank to try to get funds for a very just cause. I won't say what that cause is, because this is what makes the film really interesting. Al Pacino is the perfect bank robber. This should be no surprise, as Pacino is great in basically everything he does (""Scent of a Woman"", ""Scarface"", ""Gigli""). And pairing him with his ""Godfather"" co-star seems a logical choice.If you want an emotional film where you sympathize with the bank robber, this is your film. It's hard to be against Sonny (Pacino). At points, he even had the crowd and media outside the bank cheering him on.With all this praise, you're wondering why I doubt it's a Top 250 film. And the simple answer is pacing. This film takes place 99% of the time in a bank, in one room. Very little happens in this room. So, what we saw in 2 hours could have been trimmed to 90 minutes without really losing anything, in my opinion. There is a fine line between ""suspense"" and ""waiting around"". Also, this film has no music or background sound. That makes the pacing seem even slower than it already is.But it's still a good movie. And if you like Al Pacino, at some point you really must watch this movie because there's never going to be one like it again. Recommended for Pacino fans, and preferably you shouldn't watch it alone.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Dog Day Afternoon Night,"Sidney Lumet's intriguing character study, intense atmospheric thriller or a tragic comedy satire is a one of a kind film of its genre. Heist movies tend to run the risk of being predictable and formulaic and even though one can expect the outcome of 'Dog Day Afternoon' to not be a happy ending, it's pretty much what goes on in the bank to what's happening right outside that sets it apart. Based on a true story, this movie just goes to show that fact can be weirder than any fiction.Lumet wonderfully balances comedy, drama, irony, intensity and suspense. He actually merges them in such a way that it enriches the experience for the viewer. There are plenty of twists. The movie opens with a few glimpse of summer in New York city and then it quickly switches to Sonny and Sal taking over the bank. The reaction of the hostages is one of the most amusing sequences. At first they are in shock but this gradually follows with excitement. The hostages later on enjoy the attention.The theme of homosexuality is also introduced in a subtle way. Thankfully, it's not presented as an issue, it's just there. The relationship between Sonny and Leon is just like any other souring urban relationship.Al Pacino delivers yet another outstanding performances that easily ranks among his finest works. There are several sequences where he displays his gift through sheer raw acting. A restrained John Cazale is equally remarkable. The way he conveys fear through his eyes gives the viewer a sense that he might explode at any time or have a nervous breakdown (and he probably may have had the standoff proceeded any longer). The rest of the cast, especially the actors who play the hostages, are brilliant.Lumet and Pacino had done it again. Easily, 'Dog Day Afternoon' is one of the best heist movies (if not THE best). 'One that's not to be missed.",,Anonymous,Biography
Wyoming,"Yet another film that displays Al Pacino's superb acting skills, Dog Day Afternoon does not disappoint. A true story in which two friends, Sonny (Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale), have decided their luck has ran out and that the only way to solve that is by robbing a bank. I found the reasoning behind the robbery to be quite sincere although very unorthodox from what we're used to. What should have been a simple snatch and grab job turns into a media frenzied nightmare for the duo, mostly because of their naivety, lack of judgment, and a tad bit too much compassion.Dog Day Afternoon is a different bank heist movie in that for one, it's a true story, and two, the robbers involved aren't all that up to the task for their seemingly lack of planning and conviction to do what needs to be done in order to achieve success, which treats us to scenes that aren't typical in other films with the same premise. Filled with humorous moments and glimpses of their ineptitude, DDA keeps us guessing as to what will happen next. John Cazale as Sal is particularly intriguing as the quiet killer and is more enjoyable here than in The Godfather films and The Deer Hunter, mainly due to the difference in his characters. And as mentioned earlier, Pacino is Pacino...no need to really elaborate there. Chris Sarandon as Leon is also worth mentioning.The beginning of the film is particularly interesting as we see the mistakes the robbers begin to make early on, which preludes to the media and law enforcement frenzy that ensues. It continues in this fashion until about 3/4 of the way through where it slows down a bit and could have used a little more editing. The ending is slightly anti-climatic but this is due in part to it's basis on a true story. It could have been slightly better, but overall a great film. Although typically inconsistent, I feel Lumet did a great job.I just wish Chris Saradon as Leon would have said, ""Jesuth Christht."" That would have killed me.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Most Original and Interesting Heist Movie,"It's a truly special experience to watch Sidney Lumet's masterpiece, Dog Day Afternoon. It's possibly the most fun, interesting, and original heist movie ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Dog Day Afternoon,"If you have been a fan of any Al Pacino role and you have not seen Dog Day Afternoon, you have not yet experienced all that Al Pacino can offer. Dog Day Afternoon is by far Al Pacino's best work, and yes, I've seen The Godfather films. Sidney Lumet's 1975 feature Dog Day Afternoon showcases a depth of Al Pacino that I was unaware existed. Also starring John Cazale, Dog Day Afternoon explores the debilitating feeling of being torn in two directions by the world around you. The crisis one may confront by not being able to live their identity pushes Al Pacino's Sonny to rob a bank in order to get the money for his lover's sex-change operation. Gritty, raw, and soul-crushing, Lumet proves his directorial force while bringing out the best in Al Pacino to illustrate the depths one will go through to save himself by saving those around him.On a hot summer day in Brooklyn, New York, Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) set out to execute their plan to rob the Chase Manhattan Bank. After weeks of combing over their plans, coordinating delivery times, casing the outside and learning the best times to attract the least amount of attention, they finally enter the bank. Sonny is at a time of extreme desperation in his life. He experiences a listless home life with his wife and two kids, and he desperately wants to rob enough money from the bank to afford his partner Leon's (Chris Sarandon) sex change operation so the two may live together full-time. Sal, the understated partner in crime, an apathetic man, seems to have no direction in his life and is easily brought into the scheme by the promise of riches from the heist. The bank manager and teller staff agree to not interfere with the robbery, even helping the downtrodden robbers as best as they can. Thinking it will be a quick in and out affair, Sonny and Sal are rushing through the job until they realize that there is little money in the bank, as a majority of the money was taken out of the bank that same afternoon. Before they can escape, a call comes in from the police department that they have the bank surrounded. What began as a robbery quickly develops into a hostage situation as Sonny sees his plans foil all around him. Eventually, feeling sorry for the men who continuously vow not to hurt anyone, if they even could, a kinship develops between Sonny, Sal, and the bank employees. Now seeing the only way out as a jet out of the country in exchange for the safe release of hostages, Sonny unwillingly turns into a captor continuously negotiating the release of hostages and listing demands. At the depths of his own despair, Sonny prepares for the worst while hoping that he can still manage to make a life out of the mess he had before he ever stepped into the bank.This is one of those films that you watch and you hardly realize there are any other actors in it besides Al Pacino, he steals the show that much. Within the first 10 minutes, you could see the nuance brimming over the top of Pacino's characterization of Sonny. The most incredible part of this film, which also shows the directorial prowess of Sidney Lumet, was that by the 10-minute mark the duo had already entered the bank. A film that jumps into the action so early in the film may easily fall victim to poor pacing, especially considering that this is a film that takes place largely in one place. The pacing was never a problem in Dog Day Afternoon; each wrenching minute that elapsed emerged the audience even deeper into the mindset of Sonny and the desperation he was experiencing. I am a huge fan of films that take place in one setting, and I never thought I would like one more than I liked 12 Angry Men, also by Sidney Lumet, (obviously it's time for me to watch even more of his films) but Dog Day Afternoon takes the crown of best one setting film, in my book anyway. One setting films are so hard to do well, oftentimes, they come off stiff or too theatre-like, but Lumet knew what he was doing behind a camera leaving audiences with the best in the genre. You feel the desperation of Pacino's portrayal in such a way that stays with you days after viewing. Dog Day Afternoon is a standout, more than earning all of its critical acclaims. What a miss for Pacino from the Academy that year!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unique,"I believe this movie is what you call a ""sleeper"". It is not a hugely popular movie (i.e. it's not played verbatim on cable) but it is a moving, if not humorous, film.The main reason why I enjoyed it was the relatively small cast of characters. There was Pacino, brilliant as always, his co-horts, the hostages and several members of the police squad. Granted, the streets become filled with onlookers, but they are extras-we do not know any of them personally. A small cast makes for less confusion and more attention is paid to the core story.John Cazale, who was previously scene with Pacino in ""The Godfather"" and later with Robert DeNiro in ""The Deer Hunter"" is wonderful in his role of the troubled and nervous bank robber, Sal. Poor, poor Sal. Mr. Cazale was a gifted actor and it is a shame that this one was one of his last movies. But it's probably also one of his finest.Al Pacino, a terribly gifted actor, turns in another stellar performance, riding high off the success of the ""Godfather"" movies from the previous 4 years. He is constantly under pressure, nervous, confused, but very believeable, sometimes humorous. The scene in which he screams ""Attica! Attica!"" at the police is the most moving moment in the film and also one of the most powerful scenes in all of cinema history.Do yourself a favor and sit down with this movie. The story line will capture you from the moment you start watching. No time is wasted on preliminary scenes or planning. You start watching and Boom!, there you are, in the middle of it all. The film will take you on a ride of emotions and feelings and will not let you off until the credits start to role. Then, you will be utterly stunned at what you have seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just when you thought it couldn't get any better...,"Al Pacino and Sidney Lumet teamed up for the excellent corrupt cop drama SERPICO in the early '70s, and they followed that successful collaboration with DOG DAY AFTERNOON, the true story of a bank heist gone wrong on a sweltering New York afternoon in the 1970s. And, unsurprisingly, it turns out to be a top class production, one of those tough '70s classics that never grows old.This review will be short because I don't want to spoil any of the plot, except to say that this is the best bank robbery thriller ever made. The whole film is a huge set-piece full of fantastic actors giving excellent performances; of the ensemble, it's clear that Pacino is the best in the shouty, showy role, but John Cazale also excels as his somewhat depressed partner in crime. Watch out for Charles Durning, Lance Henriksen, Chris Sarandon, and James Broderick in smaller, but crucial roles.Of course, DOG DAY AFTERNOON isn't really a bank robbery film at all, instead a piece of left-wing social commentary exploring police tactics and brutality in the wake of the then-recent Attica prison massacre. Inevitably, the scenes with Pacino outside the bank are the highlights, but it all builds up to a truly gripping climax. This is a great film of its era that sits happily alongside the likes of THE GODFATHER, THE TAKING OF PELHAM 123, CHARLEY VARRICK and SERPICO as the best of its time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant,"If you haven't seen this film, go out and rent it right now.  Just sit back, relax, have a beer, and watch a terrific movie.  It has drama, humor, great acting, a great story, and an ending that hits you right in the gut.A few weeks from now, maybe a few months, see it again.  There is so much of what I like to call ""meat"" in this film.  It's a true story, and a compelling one, but look beneath the immediate to see what this film tells us about the culture of New York City, of America, in the early 1970s. American society was sick and rotting from the inside.  Watergate was festering, but had yet to explode into the orgy of political pus which destroyed the Nixon presidency.  Vietnam was still being fought in the jungles of Asia and on the streets of America.  Generations were clashing, and American culture and society was divided against itself.None of this context is directly provided by the film, but it is all relevant.  Look at the attitude of the mob to the whole situation.  That mob is the most fascinating character of the picture.  First, they totally support Sonny.  They make him a celebrity.  He's the classic noble outlaw. Robbing the bank, sticking it to the man, and making the police look at the same time inept, ridiculous, and utterly corrupt.  But when a shot is fired, the crowd realizes, for the first time, that their celebrity misfit criminal could be dangerous, and things begin to change.  Mulvaney, the bank manager sees it.  ""That was a foolish thing you did, back there.""  When it is revealed, shockingly, that Sonny is a homosexual, the mob divides against itself.  A small, vocal core of homosexuals begin supporting him, while the rest of the mob, the ""mainstream"" of American society, turn viciously against him.  By the time he is escorted to the airport when the siege is over, the crowd has turned wholly against him, and the cops protect him from the public, rather than the other way around.The mob is America.  Sonny is crime.  Not just any crime, but crime born of desperation.  Sonny is an outcast from society.  He has worked all his life (so we are told), but has never been able to provide adequately for his family.  He talks frequently about the pressures he is under (and the pressures he faces on screen mirror the pressures that drove him into his predicament in the first place).  He is trapped by a hopeless, helpless urban nightmare, and he's being drowned by the expectations of wife, lover, children, parents, and society itself.  He is a Vietnam veteran, and still there is nowhere he can turn for help.So, he robs a bank and takes hostages.  Suddenly, everyone cares about him. The Establishment, suddenly, becomes terribly interested in Sonny's problems.  Oh, they despise him, to be sure, and they want him dead.  Sonny knows that.  But suddenly, he is being listened to.  Imagine what might have been if someone out there had been interested in Sonny's problems *before* he robbed the bank.Imagine that.",,Anonymous,Biography
Classic Hostage Movie,"Yeah this movie ain't bad folks. Al Pacino acts in a way that we really don't see again after the late seventies. His voice was much more nasal and sympathetic. John Cazale was not as good as I hoped he would be. He was terrifying in the scenes he was in though. This is also one of a string of many New York movies made in 1970s. Hollywood started to shoot the city differently after the 60s.

A Look at the Soul,"One must look beyond the natural inclination to judge these guys as serious criminals and wash our hands of them. Yes, it's a bank robbery. Yes, these guys are small timers and deserve to be punished. But what we have here is an actual look into the souls of the men. They reach a point of no return. We get to look at them as a study in the psychology of a couple of lost souls. Acting is about capturing a character. We can hate Hannibal Lecter and still admire the performance of the actor. That's what we have here. We have one of our most successful and talented actors, Al Pacino, playing the role of a lifetime. As if that were not enough, he is engaged with a partner whose mind is a scattered mess. Watch this and see what true characterization is. In some ways, it is a heartbreaking film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Look deeper to see the real Dog,"An incident/procedural drama studying all roles in its unfolding--perpetratorss, hostages, cops, the media, and spectators. The sum of the parts is greater than the whole, and all parts have a responsibility in any moral judgement of its outcome. Especially criticized is the relationship between the perpetrator of actions and the media, and the media's position to both report to and represent the spectator public. What starts out as an act of personal desperation escalates into public forum as self-described ""good Catholic"" Sonny instigates his own gladiatorial trial of grievances using the loudest voice in the land--media--to build camaraderie and incite sympathy. ""Attica! Attica!"" is the mantra of the day. Sal, Sonny's fellow perpetrator, has no such self-cleansing need. His inner demons have never heard of the Geraldo show.The film quickly takes an hysterical tone. Most of the dialogue is shouted. As the heat increases, Sonny's neuroses are paraded out.Halfway through the Nixon years, the steam ran out of the protest movement. Why? One reason was that the powers that be--government and big business--had re-gained control of the media by learning the lessons taught by the radicals in how to manipulate it. Demonstrating became passe. Counter-culture was absorbed into the mass media--Mod Squad, Laugh-In, Alice B. Toklas, etc--and its idealism trivialized. TV sees only surface. It does not have the attention span to unearth deeper thoughts.Sonny is a good man using the wrong means for his hopes and dreams. He becomes a symbol of a larger body of protest and anger.As a result, the movie negates the moral crux of its time by making Sonny subject to such hysterical judgment. It is saying it was all a temper tantrum collectively thrown by a bunch of neurotics who couldn't work out their personal problems. Sonny, as a character and a symbol, is finally deemed pathetic and small, his power diminished to nothing more than the deafening but harmless noise of jets at the airport.Ultimately, this film constricts the art and possibilities of cinema into the confines of its bastard child--TV.",,Anonymous,Biography
A Truly Well-Made Film!,"Sidney Lumet's 'Dog Day Afternoon' is a truly well-made film, that also packs in Magnificent Direction & Extra-Ordinary Performances from it's cast. It's surely among the better films of 1975.'Dog Day Afternoon' Synopsis: A man robs a bank to pay for his lover's operation; it turns into a hostage situation and a media circus.Inspired by P.F. Kluge's article ""The Boys in the Bank"", 'Dog Day Afternoon' is an engaging cinematic experience. Frank Pierson's Screenplay is focused & always on track. However, the film definitely could've been trimmed, by at least 15-20 minutes. Lumet's Direction is Magnificent. He handles every sequence with unmatchable style. Cinematography is accurate. Editing is fair.Performance-Wise: Al Pacino delivers a performance, that can easily be credited as a 'Masterpiece'. Chris Sarandon is astonishing. John Cazale is first-rate. Charles Durning is absolutely terrific. James Broderick is very convincing. Penelope Allen is equally good.

A mix of great and dull scenes for me.,"This is my second time watching this film and my opinion of it is about the same as it was last time. I think the film is at its best when it shows the reactions the civilians have to Sonny throughout the day. Those scenes are all great. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the scenes which occur inside the bank. Sal isn't that memorable as Sonny's accomplice and the other bank workers are pretty bland as well. I do like the rare bit of tension in the bank (mainly in the first act) and how both groups eventually get along with each other, but even those elements grow a bit tiring as the film goes on, especially in the second half. But yeah, whenever Sonny exits the bank, the film gets me on board again. Whether you're referring to how Sonny becomes a celebrity amongst the civilians, the iconic ""Attica!"" scene, or how the civilians remain supportive of him after they learn he's from the LGBT community (I'm curious how well those scenes were received back in the day), those parts of the film are full of life. So much texture and detail is thrown into that one street, it feels like a vivid portrait of New York in the 70's which you could step into. Though yeah, all things considered, the film is a mixture of great and (somewhat) dull which provides a ceiling to my enjoyment of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""Shouldn't let something like that spoil your fun""","Film adaptations of true events will inevitably get slammed from some quarters. In the case of Dog Day Afternoon it was attacked by its own lead subject John Wojtowicz (renamed Sonny Wortzik for the screen), who described it as ""only 30% accurate"". His gripes were mainly about portrayals of secondary characters such as his mother and first wife, as well as his belief that the film implies he sold out Sal – which it doesn't. But such is the nature of cinema – reality is a myriad of single events from a myriad of perspectives, without explicit beginnings, endings or crescendos. A movie, on the other hand, must tell a story.And movies have to take a form. Dog Day Afternoon, oddly enough, often takes the form of a comedy. Whether this comes more from Frank Pierson's script or the many improvisations made during rehearsal I don't know, but either way it seems to originate from very absurdity of the situation. Although it's based on true events, it's like a ""what if?"" sketch. What if a naïve and essentially nice guy tries to pull off a bank robbery? You get situations like the robber asking the hostages if they need the bathroom. And of course, as any Charlie Chaplin fan knows, a comedy basis makes serious scenes even more poignant.This is why Al Pacino's performance is so vital. Far more animated than he was in the Godfather movies, he displays both a knack for comic timing, deepened by the touching simplicity of his character. John Cazale too is almost childlike, speaking tough but acting timid, and this is by far the best of his half-dozen film roles. Chris Sarandon gives a sublimely naturalistic performance, for what is definitely a difficult part to get right. Penelope Allen is also excellent, full of the gutsy personality that makes her the key to the fraternization between the robbers and the hostages. Above all it's the sheer likability of these players as they present themselves here that enables us to laugh, cry, and be enthralled by their antics.Dog Day Afternoon is at least faithful enough to real events that it mixes the public with the personal. After all, the real Sonny was not just some money-hungry hoodlum, and it was essential to balance the FBI operation and the media circus with the character's background and humanity. Who better to handle this balance than director Sidney Lumet. Lumet was already something of a specialist in movies confined to single locations (12 Angry Men, Murder on the Orient Express), and the way he approached these problems was to create different kinds of space within the limitations of the set. In Dog Day Afternoon we have everything from the grand scale outdoor shots, to simple group mid-shots, to the intimacy of the close-up. But there is far more variation going on here than simply how far the camera is from the action. There are, for example, close-ups which don't feel entirely private, with other characters seen in the background, and those which are totally personal, against plain backgrounds with no movement other than that of the actors being focused on. Even in some of the outdoor shots Lumet sometimes arranges things so that those thronging crowds are cut out of the shot. The greatest moment of genius is perhaps the conversation between Pacino and Sarandon. It begins with Sarandon amid loads of cops, and he is awkward and stilted. However as he eases up and the conversation becomes more personal, so too does the space around Sarandon. Sarandon has not gained privacy, but he has forgotten that he doesn't have it.On a purely cinematic level, Dog Day Afternoon is a masterpiece. And yes, some small details had to be changed to make it that good a piece of storytelling. It is not a documentary. And as such a great work, the film has been loved by millions. We come away from it with the feeling that Sonny and his associates were misfits rather than villains, good in their intentions if misguided in their actions, and that the events of that day were a kind of social tragedy. John Wojtowicz, the real Sonny, could hardly have asked for a better tribute.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing. I Loved It.,"A really intense film that was brilliantly filmed and written. The acting is amazing from Al Pacino in this one. Definitely worthy of that Oscar nom. I was entertained from the second the film started to the end. It's hard for a film that takes place in less than 5 locations to do that. But I thought this film managed to be emotionally investing. I was interested in the characters, what they were doing, why they were doing it, and what was going to happen because of it. The film really does take you down one dark road to another with twists and turns you won't see coming. The whole concept of the bank heist was executed brilliantly in this film. The screenplay was definitely deserved its Oscar. The scenes with Sonny going back and forth with Moretti were crazy. And all the scenes with Sonny trying to figure out wtf he needs to do was were also great.Overall, I thought Dog Day Afternoon was an amazing film. It was really well written and it was extremely intense as well. The acting from Al Pacino was immaculate and the dialogue from all the characters was not only intelligent but intriguing. I really recommend checking this film out. It's crazy and I'd definitely buy it on Blu-Ray tbh. Might be one of my newest fav films.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Who said it was a heist film?,"I have never considered this terrific social drama as a crime or even heist film, no, NEVER. ANDERSON TAPES, from the same Sid Lumet, is definitely a heist film, though the purpose is somewhere else, as this very one: DOG DAY, but in thi case, the heist is just a pretext to talk about social issues in the Amrican way of life and society. In ANDERSON, it was about surveillance thru cameras and taping offs, and the heist had a bigger place than in DOG DAY. It's not a bank robbery where you are glued to your seat, as in ANDERSON TAPES. But besides this, Al Pacino gives here one of his best performances, no problem. It will remain a classic movie for the history of world wide cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great piece of Al Pacino's early work,"This movie was a joyride. All I knew beforehand was that it had Pacino in the leading role and Cazale supporting. I also knew about the hostage situation being the main plot. Everything else was new to me and Al Pacino being one of my favorite actors I was more than thrilled when I noticed that Dog Day Afternoon would be on TV tonight. And it wasn't a disappointment. Right from the start, when the third robber with Pacino and Cazale gave up, I knew that this is going to be interesting. For me that was a totally new way to start a bank robbery. And it got interesting, I can say that. The dominant feeling during the film was that the two robbers were completely out of their element and in the wrong place. The whole time I had a feeling that Cazale's character Sal would do something hazardous and blow the whole thing. Pacino's Sonny was also a big question mark. What would a nice guy like him do in a situation like that? And I couldn't get a straight answer to that question. Although he had big problems with money and family he didn't seem that desperate. Well, they say that the quiet ones are the most dangerous and unpredictable ones in reality. This quiet and odd pair got my sympathy right from the start and had it all the way till the end. Sonny was the one who exceeded himself time after time (or so it seemed) and Sal was only trying to hang on and do what Sonny tells him to. It was a surprise that they got as far as they did. Also the other people in the movie were a bit different than in most of these kind of crime movies. There were no panicing and screaming hostages or cops with a too heavy trigger finger. The usual and annoying cliches were left out. The cops and the crooks had an unusual understanding between each other, for example in the negotiation situations. I've never seen the cops saving the villain from a raging civilian when the villain has come out to negotiate. Maybe I haven't seen enough these kind of movies or then it's just one of the particularities of this one, I don't know. Anyways, the great suspense and atmosphere lasts all the way till the end of the film when the final solution takes place. Also the solution feels really realistic (well, it is based on a true story) and it also seems to be the only right one to end the story. As a whole, Dog Day Afternoon is a great and entertaining film with all its unconventional characters and situations. Pacino also makes a convincing performance while other performances stay in the background much because of Pacino's great work.",,Anonymous,Biography
Intense and Uncomfortable,"You squirm at amateurism of some of the characters because the film draws you in so successfully. Al Pacino typically does a lot of screaming. He also defies the viewer to think he's acting. You find yourself feeling a little sick, knowing that something has to go wrong, but not knowing when or how. Being based on a true story it comes off as a period piece, but actually the film does not post date the actual events so much. There is no sense of dated film-making or performances. The question for the potential viewer is just what kind of film experience they want to have. Sure, there are times you mentally cheer or laugh or find some victory, but this hopeless situation takes a poke at society from a number of angles. It's not light viewing by any means, but is an example of film-making that one rarely sees these days. A must for anyone who watches films for more than just an entertaining way to kill time.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A masterpiece as an entertaining thriller,"Dog Day afternoon is simply a superbly organized film. It begins with the fact of being a real story, and that is the strong point of having told the story. After that we begin having something like a comic-thrilling surrounding the film, and you get kept laughing and at the same time expecting for something bad to unfold. What gets better about this part is the fact that you get really in touch with the main character, Sonny (Pacino). The great acting behind this weird character is what lets you know about his part intelligence/part ingenuity.A great historic context is also involved in the film; the left outs of the 60 are also important in the movie, as they will make you laugh and at the same time reflex on the impact of this decade over the Americans.What else can I say...just watch Dog Day Afternoon cause you'll not feel sorry for it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hard to Believe It's a True Story,"Obviously for movies based on true stories, certain liberties are taken to make the experience that much more thrilling. But for Dog Day Afternoon it didn't seem like many truths were twisted at all. In fact, for the most part it stayed true to the source material. But to me it's still hard to believe all of this happened. Pacino and Lumet make a great actor director combination in this dark comedy about a bank robbery gone bad.To me, crime dramas are often better when it's all taken seriously as most of the time lives are in danger. It just bothers me a bit when the crowd is chanting and cheering for Sonny when he is holding a handful of people at gunpoint. I wonder if that's exactly how it happened back in 1972. I tend to like crime films like The Town and Gone Baby Gone much more because kidnapping and murder are things that people should take seriously.Besides that, Dog Day Afternoon is a good film. The supporting cast is flawless. It was also interesting seeing Fredo and Michael Corleone in the same movie again. It's truly unfortunate that Cazale didn't live longer. Each of the five films he completed were masterpieces. So with a few minor complaints here and there it comes out to be a pretty solid movie, although I don't think it needed to be a full two hours.+Pacino & Lumet+Cazale is dynamite in one of his few roles+Script-Can we take this situation a bit more seriously?-Length7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Over-rated and overblown.,"Perhaps I'm missing something here but I grew rather bored with ""Dog Day Afternoon."" I found the film to be overblown nonsense and irritating. Al Pacino made far better films during this decade, like the first two ""Godfather"" instalments, ""Scarecrow"" and ""Serpico."" His character here comes across as being buffoonish and totally ineffectual. I found the setting to be wrong as well. The only redeeming quality about ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" is the cast. The fine character actor Charles Durning is very good as the police officer. There are plenty of 1970s American films that overshadow this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
What starts as a crime drama evolves into something more,"What Sonny and Sal thought would be a quick bank robbery turns into something more-- that's the premise of ""Dog Day Afternoon."" At the same time, however, a film that convinces you that it falls somewhere within the lines of conventional crime drama, also turns into something much greater and infinitely more meaningful than that. It takes you deep into the psyche of a desperate man turned criminal and simultaneously broadens the scope to critique society.You can pretty much tell from the start that Sonny (Pacino) is not a run-of-the-mill bank robber. He knows a lot about banks, but he has a nervous, frenetic energy about him. The film wisely dives straight into the robbery, not setting us up to know any of Sonny's motivation, which is slowly revealed and even then not clearly understood over the course of two hours. The writing is so terrific in the way that it starts with a small event but then expands and becomes richer through small, dialogue-heavy scenes. ""Afternoon"" sort of has the soul of a work for the stage in that sense, which makes it unique immediately.Sidney Lumet is just an absolute master of the craft. Much like in ""12 Angry Men,"" he uses strategic camera-work to convey time, intensity and pressure. He wants to get you sweating like the characters, unsure of what might happen next and paranoid about it. You wait for something to go horribly wrong, yet instead you are subjected to learning about the interesting lifestyle and behavior of Sonny.""Afternoon"" in a sense becomes both an individual and group psychological study of a particular situation in which there is a very clear conflict with very clear implications. From the cops negotiating outside the bank to the ladies trying to pass the time inside, the circumstances of the event have a definite bearing on the characters and also our experience of the film.It's not a traditional film involving a bank robbery and that's easily the best part of this film. It is more than just the mystere surrounding bank robberies. Instead of painting a cool portrait of a professional criminal, it jumps into the mind of an average person who might actually commit a random crime to get money. Instead of nearing its climax with some sort of police break in and fight, it takes a much more reasonable turn. At the very least, ""Afternoon"" deserves respect for being a great film despite un-fulfilling our Hollywood bank robbery fantasies.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A highlight from the 1970s,"Dog Day Afternoon is probably one of the best paced and most gracefully aged movies from the 1970s. It focuses on a true story about a bank robbery that happened in New York City, and is consistently tense and engaging throughout almost all of its runtime.Al Pacino is phenomenal here. I was wondering how he didn't win an Oscar for his performance here, but then remembered this came out the same year that Jack Nicholson won for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, which is admittedly another legendarily great performance. 1975 was just a particularly strong year for American movies (Jaws also came out that year).I love the way this movie's shot and also how authentic it feels. On top of being a great movie about a bank robbery, it also looks at the media's role in the whole story, and touches upon some LGBT themes in a way that makes the film feel ahead of its time. The way it tackles those themes still feels grounded and respectful, and it must have been groundbreaking for 1970s standards.I think there are a couple of moments that feel a little slow in the second half, which may be a consequence of having the core story kick off so quickly - I do otherwise love how that happens, which much of the character development happening whilst the situation is unfolding, rather than showing it all before the main event. It's just a great movie all around, features one of Pacino's best performances, and is also among the best films from director Sidney Lumet.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Dog Day Afternoon,"I once walked out of the cinema in tears. Not because the movie was so emotional.It was the realization that director Sidney Lumet had been reduced to directing garbage such as Guilty as Sin.Dog Day Afternoon is Lumet at his best. You have to keep reminding yourself that it is a true story.Lumet has brought comedy and absurdity to what was a terrifying bank robbery.Set in 1972. Al Pacino is Sonny Wortzik. A Vietnam vet and former bank teller. Along with his friends Sal Naturile (John Cazale) and Stevie they go to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank.Only for Stevie to lose his nerve and dash out. The the other two discover that there is hardly much cash in the bank.When Sonny sets a trash can on fire, the smokes arouses suspicion and the police are called.In a panic Sonny and Sal hold the other bank employees hostage. Before long Sonny is overwhelmed with the police, FBI and members of the public who have gathered and instilled a carnival spirit.Sal is edgy and volatile who is prepared to kill the hostages. Sonny tries to remain calm but then his wife and lover contact him.It turns out that the motive for the robbery was so Sonny could pay for a sex change operation for his lover Leon.The movie has a tour de force performance from Pacino. He is in his element as he rouses the crowd surrounding the bank. It is theatre rather than movie acting. By the climax, it is just silence from Pacino has he conveys mood and confusion with his eyes.Cazale has a quieter and less showy role as shy and dim Sal. He is embarrassed and upset that people might think he is also gay. Sal is the loose cannon with an itchy trigger finger.Lumet played a blinder in reuniting Pacino and Cazale on screen again.The cast is uniformly excellent. Charles Durning as the exasperated police captain who is the negotiator, Chris Sarandon as Leon who is transitioning. Lance Henriksen as the mostly silent FBI agent, Susan Peretz as Sonny's wife.Dog Day Afternoon starts out as a comedy of errors but you know it will get darker as they head off to their getaway plane.It has a gritty and chaotic New York summer atmosphere. Hot and sweaty with an urban stench of losers driven to desperation.Dog Day Afternoon is outrageously funny and also drenched with humanity. For a movie made in 1975, it had a more sensitive portrayal of gay and trans characters.One of the great movies of the 1970s.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Robbing banks is a very common theme or event in American film, but this is quite different.Since this is based on history, there's only so much creative license a writer can exercise.It has some twists and turns, but so many are left unfinished that the story feels very frayed.It would have been better to embellish sub-plots than to leave so many dangling events.The story, in itself, is not that satisfying.

a higher quality flow, but that's life. Aside from it being a sort of ""coming out"" excuse, the story
just arrives, stirs things up, and then ... ???ACTING:

Dog Day Afternoon,"Based on a true story, Al Pacino is riveting as the main character who is Both an egomaniac and lunatic. This was a poorly planned robbery turned circus that due to poor hostages went on for hours. The story gets weirder as it goes on with the revelation of a transsexual love triangle. Also, some of the hostages and media seem to start to like The robbers as they treat the hostages with respect. The tension was well held through out as you never knew what was coming, but I couldn't help feel it was missing something especially towards the later half. I knew as soon as the fbi got in on it playing mr nice guy with this madman was over.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Roller coaster,This move should not have work if not for Al Pacino's great performance and all the other actors. None of the characters feels fabricated they're all very convincing and well acted. The movie take place in one place basically and the runtime is two hour but at no point it ever felt boring. All the different characters clashing together creating this intense emotional roller coaster. And while it is intense it is also unintentionally funny.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great balance of suspense and comedy,"From minute one, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" doesn't let up. Al Pacino and John Cazale give classic performances, oozing charisma, false bravado, and mounting anxiety, leading to a near perfect crime-thriller.""Dog Day Afternoon"" follows Al Pacino and John Cazale, two bumbling first-time criminals that decide to pull off a bank robbery in the middle of the afternoon. While they thought they planned their heist to perfection, things, of course, don't go to plan, and the audience gets treated to two hours of non-stop white knuckle suspense. I was on the edge of my seat for the entirety of this film - most thrillers have periods of slow down to let the audience breath; you won't find that here. The characters don't get any respite, and neither do the viewers. This leads to a relentlessly entertaining and nerve-wracking cinematic experience that carefully grasps the viewer and never lets go.Al Pacino and John Cazale are masterful in this movie, each giving their own very distinct performance. While Pacino is very outwardly intense, acting out and yelling at whoever is in his path, Cazale delivers a subtle type of intensity, always keeping calm and quiet on the outside while, no doubt, freaking out on the inside. There is one fantastic scene where Cazale quietly talks to Pacino, explaining how he is ready to start shooting the hostages in retaliation if Pacino is. It perfectly encapsulates the type of people we're dealing with, and does a great job of ramping up the tension.Another thing I loved about this movie is how unpredictable it is - from the moment the heist starts, things never go as expected for the characters, or for the viewers. I promise you that you won't be able to predict what's going to happen next. Nothing happens in a cinematically glossy way; this isn't a heist movie that glamorizes the robbers or the robbery, but instead simply shows what's happening, as it's happening. Also, there's a really good undercurrent of unexpected dark comedy throughout the film. Subtle lines and character moments make for good chuckles, and never reduce the tension or cheapen the experience. ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is a thriller, and even with its comedy, it never stops being what it sets out to be.""Dog Day Afternoon"" is, without a doubt, a classic in the crime genre. It features fantastic performances, a riveting plot, great comedy, and non-stop suspense from beginning to end. If you're looking for a crime caper and haven't seen this, you owe it to yourself to give it a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not what I expected!,"I've never seen this all the way through before. I've seen clips, but I've got the gist... right? Bank robbery goes wrong, based on a true story. Pacino chewing the scenery. Nope, there's a whole lot more going on here and as always with great films, it's the details that make them shine. We're in Brooklyn, New York in it's 1970s squalor. Summer heat, dirty streets, that undercurrent of slight desperation. Desperation that leads Sonny (Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) to walk into a bank in broad daylight, sporting classic cheap 70s suits, concealed guns and in Cazale's case an iconic haircut. They're in over their heads from the get go, the panic palpable even in the opening lines of dialogue. It's not supposed to be funny, but they're so shambolic it's hard not to chuckle a little. They're small time, nice guys really just doing something stupid for what turns out to be very little money. This is America though and some things don't change. How do you resolve a fairly minor criminal situation... yes, more guns! Enter the cops. All of em I think. If Sal wasn't jittery before, he is now. It's got a weird tone to it. Grimey and lo-fi, but with a bizarrely large cast, one that rallies with our two assailants, siding with the little guy oppressed by the gun crazy police authorities. But it's clear pretty quickly that it's much more than a mere stick up and more a commentary on haves, have nots, the role of the family, societal structure, celebrity culture. For what's essentially a bit part, Sal pulls focus whenever called upon. It's the Sonny show though and Pacino really does go all in, playing the trapped and troubled wannabe bank robber. That's just it though. He doesn't really want to be there at all and neither does Mulvaney (Charles Durning), the cop he's negotiating with. They both want it over, but Sonny does have a purpose. The money is for his husbands sex change. I really didn't expect that and it seems like a interesting role for Pacino in 1975 to go for following The Godfather and Serpico. He pulls it off though, the whole cast do, normalising the situation remarkably quickly, everyone keeping cool. Time is a weird thing in cinema. I often look at older films, the simplicity in the storytelling, in the production and wonder would it work as well today. Can modern filmmakers do this, or do we simply expect more, certainly in production values, but I think a modern take would bury it in grit, blood, serious drama. This is enjoyable entertainment. People are waving guns around, but it doesn't exactly feel dangerous. Again because it's much more than a heist movie. The hostages become friends of a kind. There's emotional depth, both in Sonny's reasoning for the robbery and in the way it plays out. It's hard to believe it's a true story or based on one and I certainly was well wide of the mark on my assumptions going in. It's great. You might want to take a shower after though, it's one of the sweatiest looking films I've watched in quite some time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Riveting film, and not dated at all","I have trouble watching most films from the 70s because they date themselves so badly, and because I despise 70s aesthetics and fashions.  Here's a film that doesn't seem dated at all -- in fact, it seems ahead of its time in many ways.  As far as I knew, crime films of this tone, with ""bad guys"" who are likeable, funny, and basically the guys next door didn't come around until Quentin Tarantino.Besides content, 70s films bug me due to their generally dismal production values and terrible prints -- the print I saw of this film on the USA Network, though, was crystal clear (though unmatted).  The dialogue track has a few creaky places production-wise, but visually the film could have been made last year, in terms of camera technique, editing, lighting (by contrast, I can't even watch ""The Sting"" (1973), with it's HORRID flat TV lighting), and so on.  I guess what helps is that the movie was based on a true story (funny to see the credit ""based on a magazine article by"" ;^>), and the director was going for a very cinema verite approach.  In this spirit, there is no music in the movie past the opening credits (and that song becomes one that's playing on the principals' radio), and this helps the movie attain its riveting tone and avoid becoming dated due to the soundtrack.Other high points are of course the writing, Sidney Lumet's direction (I was not previously familiar with his work), and Al Pacino's always inspired acting.  It's also neat to see the young Lance Henriksen (who looks surprisingly non-different from today's Lance Henriksen ;^>).  The frank treatments of subjects like sex changes and the gay community (a term I would have assumed was coined more recently) are also interesting to see for a mainstream movie of this long ago.Oh, if by any chance you're checking out this movie because you're a Carol Kane fan (my ""Carol Kane"" TiVo wishlist recorded the film for me), don't watch it solely for her -- she doesn't get to do much.  There are plenty of other good reasons not to miss the film, though.",,Anonymous,Biography
Al Pacino's Golden Streak,"The 1970s was a magical time for Al Pacino where he dished out one mesmerizing performance after another. Being based on an actual story, this one is more grounded in reality than his other movies.The movies depicts the events of a single day where a group of 3 men lead by Sonny (Al Pacino) try to rob a bank and get out as quickly as possible. However, matters quickly spiral out of their control as they are locked in the bank.This is not your typical heist movie where a better part of plot will be spent explaining the intricacies of the heist. The movie jumps into action right away at the start. You can feel the anxiety and dilemmas faced by the Sonny as he tries to navigate his way out to safety.Al Pacino is once again brilliant in the movie. He is given the task to carry the movie from start to finish and he does it splendidly. The supporting actors are good too. Many of the scenes felt improvised which added to the quality of the movie.Overall, it was a good movie made great by the acting performance of Al Pacino.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pacino Looms Large,"Adapted from a magazine article about an actual occurrence, the film is the story of an inept bank robber, and his friend, who thinks their robbery will be quick and easy. Sonny (Al Pacino) miscalculates in his plan and his estimation that he has a temperament for the crime. So the thwarted robbery results in a protracted hostage situation.Plenty of improvisation lends cinema verite to the narrative, which was filmed on location rather than in a studio. Also, there are moments which add little to the drama, but feel authentic---like the conversations Sonny has with his wife, his mother, and others.This is an entertaining film due to the mystery that surrounds the motivation for the robbery. And Pacino chews up the scenery like a man possessed. But there are no heroes or anti-heroes here, just a sad sack whose life is a mess, motivated by feelings of impotency and confusion, trying in desperation to make at least one person in his life (besides his adoring mother) proud.We have seen other films where real events become impromptu circuses, especially where the press shamelessly and ruthlessly intrudes. Like ""Ace in the Hole"", for example, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" demonstrates this phenomenon. It also shows how hostages can come to identify with their captors over time.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of them is scared and runs away. The remaining 2 takes hold of the situation, The bank manager and clerks are kept hostages. The robbers get disappointed to know that the bank was almost empty.

MY REVIEW: A Crazy Day!!,"Dog Day Afternoon. Based on a real incident which happened in Brooklyn, New York, Sonny played by the acting maestro Al Pacino robs a bank to pay for his lover's operation; it turns into a hostage situation and a media circus. The whole story claimed to be real always seems so unconvincing like hostages playing with the gun of Sonny, public cheering for Sonny, cops never seem too serious about the situation and so on. But what keeps you glued till the end is the unpredictable nature of events and remarkable performance by Al Pacino. His expressions, dialogs and whole persona is just irresistible. Supporting actors; John Cazale playing the eccentric crime partner and Charles Durning playing the brave cop who has to negotiate with Sonny before FBI takes over do their part quite right. Sidney Lumet tries hard to keep you engaged but story losses its juice because of lack of back story and a rushed climax. Nevertheless, watch it once for its unpredictability and Al Pacino's powerhouse performance.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Confused and alienated youths going some way to produce a dog's dinner of a robbery, in what is a brilliantly executed drama piece.","Dog Day Afternoon begins with a montage presented to us in a relatively upbeat fashion, a going over and presenting of tidbits of New York-set summer iconography as people enjoy tennis matches; time on a beach and young lovers' company with one another. The music is uplifting and upbeat, the weather warm and welcoming as various people of whom have dressed down to coincide with the climate totter about the streets and parks. The soundtrack is meaningfully toned down when we come to focus on the American flag, itself being lowered from a pole, before cutting to a car housing some shifty looking individuals outside a bank: the iconographic, or 'romantisised', view of the city comes to a bit of crashing halt as we zone in on a new band of youths of whom do not conform to the various groups of kids and youths most certainly on display in the 'outsider' montage. The flag's physical lowering is systematic with the film's own lowering into a part of New York the tourists don't see, and their clicking off of the radio thus killing the song we were actually hearing, is the ultimate act that confirms both their and this New York existence's presence.Dog Day Afternoon has this attitude towards New York and its inhabitants, keeping a distanced perspective of more typical New York City imagery and instead focusing on those inhabiting the undergrowth within; those with issues, problems, flaws and feelings as the actions and consequents of those that undertake the desperate deeds are observed. ""The robbery should have taken 10 minutes. 4 hours later, the bank was like a circus sideshow. 8 hours later, it was the hottest thing on live T.V. 12 hours later, it was all history. And it's all true"" reads the film's tag-line; its 'hook', if you will. Not knowing a thing about the true-to-life events the 1975 released Best Picture nominee is based on may have added an extra layer of dramatic effect, but I've a feeling the film would work just as effectively with the knowledge of said events in mind.The film sees Al Pacino's Sonny Wortzik and John Cazale's Sal hole up in a bank much in the same way a certain John Wojtowicz did in reality with his accomplice Salvatore Naturile, on whose exploits the film is based. Of all the physical things wrong with what they do in conjunction with the robbery, the oral mentioning of their names out loud is probably the worst of the early stages; Sonny's general incompetence masked by Sal's real inability, we feel, to deal with what he's got himself involved in, and consequently coming across as more attributed to the scenario than he actually is. Sonny takes charge of the situation when the preplanned three of them is reduced to two after the bailing of an additional robber, Sonny does the talking and thinking as Sal inherits the characteristics of the sub-machine gun he wields: a short, small and sinister looking individual whom does very little and feels just as concealed from the action. You get the additional sense he could do some serious, rapid and biting damage if provoked. As one thing leads to another, a large crowd gathers outside and soon police negotiators representing their true-to-life incarnations, with altered names, are doing their utmost to defuse the situation.If Lumet is presenting the inhabitants of New York in his opening montage as the average, every-day New York City dwelling every-men as youngsters enjoys sports and one another's company; then the zoning in on the car of bank robbing youths might be seen as a marginalisation of said inhabitants as the disconnection they have from everyone else is made aware: their chosen activity is anything but of the populist or indeed legal variety. But rather than marginalise, or demonise, these people as nothing more than petty thieves or, as it transpires through one means or another, emotionally confused freaks involved in bizarre extramarital affairs; the film chooses to explore their plight and, crucially, if we are to compare them to the match-made youths in the opening montage, their straining relationships with wives and partners.While the true aims of why it is they are after such a large stash of money are more humbling than those of what most other thieves might have done it for, Lumet's film does not excuse the perpetrators of this crime, nor does it glamorise or idolise the characters. Instead broadening the study into a sort of collective struggle blended in with some other youngsters of the day: youths confused and alienated with both the system and authoritarian figures in general, in a nation whose government is supposedly corrupt-to-the-core given the shadow of Watergate still looming large, and whom were expected to go off and die in Vietnam on demand for phony ideologies of said government. The attention seeking, disillusioned youngsters that gather around the bank when the media circus kicks off sees many-a youngster heckle the police officers guarding the area and often crave meek fame for having seen around an event such as this, offering somewhat gleeful reactions to the result of being on display in front of a television camera and an (in)consequental few seconds of fame when they are not feeling as if they've achieved something by simply delivering a pizza to the crime scene. The film is rich in drama, the stand offs between Sonny and the police officers pushed right to the brink of which of the two sides might come out on top, and Lumet inches out as much heightened tension as possible in a film that is thoroughly worthwhile in its explorations and detailing.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A fascinating study of criminal behaviour, police action and reaction and media invasion; ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is the epitome of the crime genre","One of the three primary themes of Dog Day Afternoon is a study of criminal behaviour. Taking Sonny Wortzik (performed exquisitely by Al Pacino), the protagonist and lead character involved in the bank robbery of the plot, as the sole representation of the 'criminal' – the crime follows conventions that apply to reality more so than film in general; plan, operation, getaway – the film skips plan, heads straight for operation and gets stuck before getaway; with the events occurring unbeknownst to the characters' expectations, despite their ability. Sonny is not a cliché – a character motivated by greed and ruthless compassion but rather a man with an understanding of the system and his place in it – that being he needs to bark attention his way to be a part of it, or at least, get a share, if not fair. The main factor is how common morality affects the criminal sense of communication and compromise in order for a successful operation. This is demonstrated by the key art of intimidation they need to force upon the civilians in order to get what they want, except in this film, many issues interrupt their threatening attempts such as the hostages needing to go to the bathroom and Sonny with his accomplice Sal (played by an edgy John Cazale, an actor of which could be considered to have the greatest filmography of all-time) obliging to these miniscule demands. One of the first ideas presented are acts of bravery; contrasting the criminal with the hostage, during the first few moments of the robbery one of the accomplices (of which we never see again) chooses to coward out – in doing so, he appears to lose all rational thought and makes illogical decisions whilst the bank manager remains calm and follows procedure. By giving this initial impression, it enhances all the pressures that later take place. There's even an instance in which Sal sharply threatens the hostages and gets taken aback by their screams. Even though there is a prominence of the artillery in the film with both the criminals and police, rarely being a scene without one – two shots in total are fired; both having significant impact among everyone.The iconic scene and most important quote in Dog Day Afternoon is Pacino screaming ""Attica"" in the street. This scene pretty much sums up everything the film stands for as Sonny riles up the crowd. But mostly a study of police reaction and action involving co-operation – as in Attica, of which was a real event, police killed 42 guilty and innocent people. Sonny understands their routine and how much they value a crime – and due to how much he knows, he refuses to trust them even more, especially the chance of unpredictability within their compromises – expertly contrasted with the compromises Sonny and Sal make with the hostages in the bank, concerning their safety. Blending the images with a montage of footage between the police and criminals, it's revealed that their motives are not too different, in an effort for credibility. There are two representative figures of the police; Moretti (Charles Durning) and Sheldon (James Broderick) – both of which use methods of intimidation much like Sonny and Sal; even coming to a point where Sonny recognizes the limits the police will go since the event has an audience he can abuse and alter their intentions; such as using no weapons to get some officers to move back. The entire power Sonny has gained is entirely blamed on the police – and this frustrates the police during their negotiation. It proposes the suggestion that irrational behaviour is only acceptable within the system, ignoring emotional disposition whilst doing everything to retain a sense, even if false, of professionalism and control.Media plays the most important part as to why these events are significant – or enough to base a film on it. If it weren't for the media, these events would be irrelevant. The media completely invades the situation. In the second act, there's a subplot that centres completely on Sonny and his personal life – involving both his spouses; one a man and one a woman. This bisexuality allows the media to blow the discovery completely out of proportion, making the crime seem motivated by this preference – to the point where they claim that there are two homosexuals robbing the bank (Sal of course, resents this statement) which has the consequence of gaining a crowd of gay rights activists, almost with the idea that Sonny's criminal action is stimulated by this (as the chant ""out of the closets and into the streets"" comes from). The media considers these proceedings as nothing more than entertainment, without a care of whom or what gets hurt just as long as it gets ratings – even prompting Sonny to go ahead and kill the hostages. It's even demonstrated in how the paparazzi immediately and physically intervene, trying to grasp full on interviews as soon as possible. This is also expanded as to how the public – or the live audience – reacts to Sonny and his actions, celebrating and encouraging him, especially in a scene where he throws some money out to the crowd, almost completely making his bank robbery attempt seem utterly pointless. Also, aside from Sonny, every character that gets the slightest bit of attention gets a sense of euphoria and feels impressed with them for no real reason. And again, it's all the media's fault – and this applies to real-life situations as shown by how the news mentions negative stories far more regularly than positive ones; or at least, as the cliché suggests.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Kiss me. When I'm being f*cked, I like to get kissed a lot.","Does the media make the news or do they report the news. The media presence has an effect on what is happening.

Good Film,"A very tight character drama - in which Al pacino successfully shows a new dimension to his acting reportoir - With a very brave performance as a bisexual.  Coming after brooding masculine performances in the best film of all time - the Godfather, along with Godfather part Two and Serpico. This role came as a surprise to me but Pacino with his often usual shouting role was brilliant (by shouting i mean all the yelling he does in films like Serpico, Scarface, Godfather Three).  John  Cazale a personal favourite actor of mine - his stunningly brilliant performance in godfather part two is something i will never forget, also his performances in the deer hunter and godfather one were EXCELLENT (The elusive ""5th"" Cazale film - the conversation is something i can't find anywhere) Cazale's performance was pretty good - ""But i'm not Homosexual""!!!  The most heartbreaking line of the film is when Sal says - ""because i don't want to get cancer"" (he says of smoking) - is that poetic justice or what as John Cazale died of bone cancer in march 1978!!! .

"The kind of day where everything that could go wrong, goes wrong 7/10","Dog Day Afternoon is the kind of movie to showcase how everything that is supposed to go according to plan doesn't, and just gets messier.From a writing p.o.v, it's wise and justified to stuck the protagonist and challenge him during his journey. In case of the film, Sonny (Al Pacino) is dealing with a bank robbery that goes wrong and must control the situation all by himself. Thus dealing with challenges in his journey.The thing is that Sonny isn't a bad person, he's just a man who's a bit lost with his life, he's married and has two kids, he's also married to a transsexual person. He needs to afford money for himself and many around him, so obviously he would lose his mind and try something daring such as a heist.Although still with everything Sonny does during the movie it just didn't make me emphasize with him. When I compare this movie to John Q (starring Denzel Washington) than I find myself emphasize more with John Q and his actions, he means no harm to anybody. Unlike Sonny and Sal who are dangerous and immature.While I did enjoy the acting of many of the cast members, I wasn't attached to the story. Sure it may be inspired by true events and is supposed to stick to the material but throughout the movie I didn't really enjoy the story, I felt disconnected from everything.So in terms of screenplay, the writers did a good job of challenging the protagonist during his arc, his journey.

very real on a big screen,"Three years back I had the opportunity to see Dog Day Afternoon on the big screen. Perfect illusion of being real, events really happening where you saw only the screen during the commercials. The excitement stays on all the way thanks to a very clean perspective. The spectator is placed as a bank robber inside the bank. Almost all outside shots are in a style you would see the events during a live TV coverage. The bank robbers actually do watch TV while in the bank so the perspective stays intact.Practically all characters in the story are way beyond people I would ever know so I cannot comment on the actor's performance here. However the bank robbers do change as the events approach one climax after another in a way that is believable.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Authentic Cinematic Moment In Time & Culture,"After seeing Al Pacino at the 2024 Academy Awards, I was inspired to finally watch Dog Day Afternoon. While I certainly saw an iconic acting performance and just an overall gritty feel in this unique flick, I also feel that for a first-time viewer it plays a bit better in its 1975 era than today.For a very basic overview, Dog Day Afternoon tells the based-on-true-events story of Sonny (Pacino), a bank robber who has everything go wrong with his operation right from the start. His partner Sal (John Cazale) is a loose cannon, he almost sets the building on fire, and his nerves do not exactly strike fear in the hearts of his hostages. But as the situation progresses, director Sidney Lumet begins peeling back the layers of the onion that is Sonny and making him an ""empathetic criminal"" with the outside support of thousands.There are some unforgettable cinema moments in Dog Day Afternoon, to be sure. Pacino gives an inspired performance, the ""Attica! Attica!"" scene is one of the most quotable movie lines ever, and Lumet impressively imbues the film with a hot, claustrophobic, gritty-1970s-New-York-City feel.I can completely understand how and why 1970s viewers view this as an all-time classic. The themes of identifying emotionally with the ""bad guy"", pushing back against police presence/authority, and the different sexual orientations portrayed within would all have been relatively ahead of their times (especially at the cinema) in 1975. Combine that with the story being ripped from news headlines and filmed on-location in downtown Brooklyn and it is truly ""1970s culture personified"".Does that all carry over into a first-time 2024 viewing? Not necessarily. Pacino's performance largely does, but the themes that were startling to 1970s moviegoers are more commonplace and less-controversial today. For a film that relies so much on emotional identification with the multi-faceted protagonist, this can be a bit of a problem from a modern lens.Overall, though, I enjoyed Dog Day Afternoon and can understand its place in cinematic legacy. It brilliantly captures a moment in time & culture even if some of that luster may fade the further away we get from it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unconvincing by today's standards,"While the acting is good, the story is more of a political statement than anything else.The cops are depicted as a ruthless unorganized gang of thugs unable to contain the situation and the hostages and public appear prejudiced to the view of bankrobbers as good guys from the start.This is emphasized by cowboy cops trying to engage the robber leaving the viewer somewhat bewildered as it takes quite a lot of courage to assail an unknown number of rifle-armed robbers with only a suit and a peashooter.Another point of confusion is that the group of thug-cops do not seem powerful or dominant in any way other than numerical presence; it takes a good 2 hours of soft negotation and media coverage where the robber is in complete control and where civilians and professionals are put in harms way without further thought.The robbery itself is justified by a weak reference to working-class struggle and a hint of then controversial sexuality issues.That may have satisfied the Oscar critics at the time, I'd hope the viewer have a more honest and realistic perspective of the morals of two heavily armed men pointing their guns at innocent civilians, whatever decade you live in.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
My brief review of the film,"An intensely realistic crime drama, the at times shaky camera-work suits the project perfectly, Al Pacino is believable in the lead, and John Cazale shines as his partner in the heist. There is an ambiguity over just what is motivating Cazale's character, and this makes him a very interesting element. In contrast, the film explores the character played by Pacino quite well, so that one can understand and sympathise with his motivations. Both are therefore interesting elements. Another factor of interest is the contrasts in intensity that Lumet sets up. Outside the bank it is heated and intense while inside it is generally cool and calm. The film touches on many different ideas, such as trauma for Vietnam vets, police tactics, the media and homosexuality, but unfortunately none of these are explored too well, which leaves the film with little to say. Still, it is generally gripping, or at least until towards the end when it starts to become repetitive, too talkative and at times too much like a shouting match in which one can easily tune out. Maybe the two-hour length is the problem? It is slightly more than what is needed by the film to get through the material. But even if it is flawed, this is still something quite remarkable, and one of the best from 1975.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Moving Right Along, Folks","Al Pacino never had a role as tailor-made to his gift for over-the-top, on-the-edge histrionics than he did in ""Dog Day Afternoon."" His Sonny is unique for the way he mixes comedy and pathos, screaming profanity one moment, quietly sympathetic and almost soulfully gentle the next. ""I speak what I feel,"" he tells a teller who asks him to watch his language, but he's obviously sensitive to what people think of him, even when he's pointing a gun at them.""Dog Day Afternoon"" is really Pacino's baby. The film exists to serve his art. The fact he's great in it is almost incidental. Of course he's great in it, he's a great actor in a movie that puts all the focus on him. But how good is it otherwise?Pretty to very, depending on which part of the movie you are watching. The film is better at the outset and in the middle than in the end, where it gets sloppy in its emotions and reaches beyond the bank for its storyline, dulling the focus. The central premise, a holed-up duo of ne'er-do-wells taking on the city, works as underdog formula for a while, especially when Sonny faces down the police by screaming ""Attica"" and making them put their guns down. The bank employees are fleshed out nicely with the help of Sully Boyar as the bank's manager, Penny Allen as the head teller, Marcia Jean Kurtz as a gum-snapping teller, and Carol Kane as the ""squirrel"" who gets a call from her husband asking what he should do for dinner while she's a hostage.Pacino's ""Godfather"" mate John Cazale, in a velvet suit of fire engine red in case you were wondering what decade this was made in, is there as buddy Sal to provide steely backup as Sonny holds up the First Brooklyn Savings Bank. When John Cazale is the muscle man, your plot is definitely in trouble, and Sal and Sonny quickly find themselves surrounded by about four thousand members of New York's finest.The dialogue has a very improvisational feel to it, which along with the strong characterization and frequent humor gives ""Dog Day Afternoon"" much of its watchability. You really feel like you are seeing this botched robbery happen as it goes down, in real time.There's a nice use of suspense, too, the first time you watch it. Sonny's so out there that you never know what, if anything, will set him off in a homicidal rage. And you know Sal really wants to start dumping those bodies out the door. So even though you can count the number of gunshots in this movie with one hand (and have enough left over to snap your fingers with), you are nervous all the way through.It does feel like the New York Police Department are a little too much out in force; was August 22, 1972 a good day to commit a crime in one of the other four boroughs? The police and the FBI are seen as unreasonable heavies, but Vietnam veterans and homosexuals probably come off worse, not to mention former Goldwater campaign activists. As far as the gay thing goes, it comes across as a bit silly when we see a group of over-the-top drag queens show up at the police barricade to cheer on sister Sonny, but the phone conversation between Pacino and Chris Sarandon as his lover Leon is among the movie's most affecting scenes. Sarandon is really good at playing a total human mess who actually is a voice of relative reason in Sonny's world.Can't get over how young Pacino looks. He reminds me of Matthew Broderick in ""WarGames."" Funny that one of the FBI agents here is played by Matthew's father. Matthew's father is in another classic '70s New York crime movie, ""The Taking Of Pelham One-Two-Three"" which has a similar feeling to ""Dog Day"" but a much heavier vibe. No question the 1970s were a great decade for crime dramas, and ""Dog Day"" is one of the best.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very gritty and realistic,"I think that this film is a bit overrated (I would never place this within the top 250 films ever made and I know it is a critical favorite), though it still is a very good film. That's because it gives such a gritty and realistic portrait of a bank robbery gone bad and is totally unlike any cops and robbers film made before or sense. Part of this gritty realism is the amazingly ""colorful"" dialog. You'd never expect to hear this many f-words used in a film back in 1975. I didn't love this, but understand that real criminals in such a situation would probably not worry about offending people with their use of expletives--so I can't fault this either.While I often give longer reviews, there are frankly so many good reviews for this film already as well as synopses of the film--so I won't bore you with these details. Instead, I will point out that this largely improvised film worked well due to excellent direction and acting. I have no complaints at all but also didn't see the film as THAT exceptional. Sure, it was a very, very good film but not one that I would put in the category of MUST SEE.If you haven't guessed, this is NOT a movie for kids but for mature adults who can handle the subject matter and aren't turned off by the realism, then it's an excellent and worthwhile film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
2nd best film of 1975!,"I say it is the 2nd best because I think One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the best, I mean, you can't beat Jack when he gives it all he's got, but this came in a close second.First off, I usually like any Al Pacino movie, but this one is particularly good. He plays his character like he is Sonny Wortzick! John Cazale gave an absolute knockout performance as the paranoid, nervous, and unsafe behind a large machine gun character of Sal. He truly made me wonder how stable he could be under that much pressure.The movies intensity can only be measured in the amount of sweat on the arm of you chair. O-kay, so I'm being a little overly dramatic about this movie, but it is extremely intense.Although the whole thing is good, what makes it so extraordinary is the last two or three minutes when you see weather they make it..... or don't! What made the film all the more better was the fact that no background music was in this (which gave it a creepy extra touch); but most of all, the whole story is TRUE!!!!!! I will not give away the end because I'm just not about that, but trust me, you will be surprised! 9/10",,Anonymous,Biography

Based on a true story.I wanted to like this film but for whatever reason it just didn't quite hit the mark for me.

"It was perfectly planned, I mean in and out in 30 minutes? How easy can it be?","Well, I guess not that easy. ""Dog Day Afternoon"", one of the best films from the 1970's. If you notice, there are only really a few excellent and terrific movies from the decade: The Godfather, Jaws, The Exorcist, The French Connection, Blazing Sadles, Young Frankenstein, Star Wars, etc.In my film appreciation book, it mentioned ""Dog Day Afternoon"", my sister had the movie and I asked if it was good, she said that if I didn't like this, I have no appreciation for movies what-so-ever. To me, the cover didn't look anything special. Al Pacino, yeah, he's a great actor, but does that make a good movie? I was so wrong about ""Dog Day Afternoon"", it was a great movie. Al Pacino, why didn't he win the Oscar? It also is amazing what they showed intense and some very hush-hush topics of the 70's: homosexuality, media attention, and the anti-hero. The funny thing is, you want to love Al Pacino's character, even though, yes, he's robbing a bank, he doesn't hurt anyone. He even makes that clear that he just wants money for a situation he has with his boyfriend.Although I was a little disappointed with the ending, I felt as if it was cut too short and if you see it, you'll understand why I was very angry with the way Sal's character was dealt with. I'm sure that there are a few agreements with those who have also seen the movie. Still, I will highly recommend this movie for film fanatics. It's a great one!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Never in life i thought that a Bank Robbery Film could be so FUN yet CLASSY !,"Dog Day Afternoon (1975) :
Brief Review -Never in life i thought that a Bank Robbery Film could be so FUN yet CLASSY ! I am stunned actually. Not because it's a Stunning Film but because this something like never before. I can't say it's unique but it is something of its own kind i mean yes it is unique but not the way we define Uniqueness. And after all it's a True Story that is shaking my mind so hard that i can't get over it. In a brief, Dog Day Afternoon is about a Bank Robbery happened in 1972 and how it turned dramatic and sensational. Two guys hold hostages after Bank Robbery attempt and it turns into weird situations that catch attention of people and media. The film begins right on point for what it is made without losing any time at all. Then the dramatic conflicts take place and all of sudden entire disaster situation looks like Real and seriously intresting stuff. It has a perfect touch of comedy and that too a real funny comedy coming out of disaster situations. The screenplay deserved Academy Award as it is fantastically driven by the screenwriter. It perfectly blends all the necessary elements of any Good Film such as Comedy, Drama, Seriousness, Sense and Top Notch Climax. Well of course very much credit goes to the real incidents for that. Al Pacino looks so handsome and he plays the lead so effortlessly as it was just a daily morning walk for him. Not just him but each and every actor in the film plays the character so effortlessly. Dog Day Afternoon is like a Magnetic sphere, it attracts you and never repel until the show is over. And who creates that Magnetic field? Director Sidney Lumet. His '12 Angry Men' is one of my favourite film of all time for many reasons. And even though i didn't like his 'Network' much because of wrong ethics, Dog Day Afternoon has recuperated that loss for me. In short, Dog Day Afternoon is something you're gonna love more than any ordinary popcorn film.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bunch of guys screamin' n shoutin',"This poo-pile is somewhat funny. It's about a bank heist gone wrong right off the bat. The characters act all in a completely illogical way and chaos ensues from the moment they drive up to the bank door. Not in the good way. The ""movie"" is one long rant delivered by ensemble cast, everybody wants to pee every 5 minutes, the protagonist just comes out of the bank and goes back in every 10 minutes, why on earth is there no revolving doors? 2 stars for some unintended laughs and silly lines. Come to think.. this drivel IS a heist gone wrong.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Film at it's finest.,"Dog Day Afternoon is a perfect example of a character drama that slowly builds into something much more. Sidney Lumet's finest film starts off as a simple bank robbery but eventually becomes not only the shattering tale of this true story but also a commentary on the media and the public. Al Pacino's Sonny Wortzik is essentially a normal guy who has been put into circumstances to commit a crime, but he is quickly turned by everyone else into something much more. An idol to some and a monster to others, the public create this figure who stands as something to them beyond anything that he actually is.We hear tales from the people in his life, from his wife Angie to his lover Leon (played so well by Chris Sarandon), of what a bastard he is, often falling victim to an explosive temper, yet the public sees him as a hero. He screams obscenities at the police and forces them to recall the Attica Prison riot, feeding off the attention that he is given by the public. They turn him into something else, but inside the bank he's just a cornered man who doesn't know what to do. Pacino's portrayal is his finest work and stands as one of the finest performances I've ever seen in a film. He is fascinating, empathetic and always commanding.Sonny is a significantly flawed man, but Pacino makes it easy to see why the hostages he takes were so enamored with him. The real life workers of the bank commented after words that they had a great time and if Sonny and his partner Sal (John Cazale) had been over at their house for a dinner party it would have been one of the best nights of their life, and Pacino shows this side of Sonny in his performance. The people who knew him tell a totally different side of him than what we see in the bank, but as the walls close in on him you can see those other layers start to creep out.It's a grueling experience for Sonny, lasting over an entire day inside that bank, and Pacino makes you feel every minute of it by the end. He starts off on fire, exploding off the screen in the opening scenes, but as the day wears on he becomes beaten and exhausted, perhaps not thinking as clearly as he should and maybe even wanting to be arrested just so that the whole disastrous experience can be over. Pacino creates a performance as sensational as the media and public turned Sonny into, and it's a wonder to behold and made even more impressive by the fact that most of the dialogue (including the lengthy phone conversation between him and Sarandon) was improvised.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The ring of truth,"A serio-comedy can't get better than Dog Day Afternoon. At the time this movie was made, the taking of hostages for political and/or criminal reasons was a regular occurrence in the USA as well as in Western Europe (one should remember that now, in the days of ""war against terrorism""). In 1973 the public experienced the birth of the so called ""Stockholm syndrome""; hostages in a bank began to sympathize with their assailants. A year later, Patty Hearst was kidnapped by a group of self styled political terrorists and somehow converted into a member of that gang. I think Dog Day Afternoon was created in the light of such events  it's all the more admirable that the movie stands its own ground, reporting in a matter-of-fact way the story of a badly botched bank robbery with a hostage situation. It gives every involved character its due, but does not take sides and reports the event with a convincing faithfulness in a realistic cinematographic style.Why is this story in most parts funny  funnier in fact than many ""invented"" comedies? I think, even if it sounds strange, this is due to the sense of responsibility of people on both sides show. The ""brain"" of the robbery, a role for which Al Pacino received a n Academy Award nomination, may be stupid and disoriented, but he instinctively feels that the fates of the hostages depend on him. And he actually cares. He has to act, but has no clue how (he actually starts complaining to the hostages that he has to take care of everything!). On the other side there is the police, led by an officer played by Charles Durning  a performance that actually was equally worthy of an Oscar. He is in a similar situation and under pressure from the authorities as well as the street mob who show hostility towards the forces of order. There is a stalemate with many strange and funny situations ""written by life itself"". Until the pros step in.The behaviour of the police officers who bring the hostage situation to an end are a major asset of this movie. These are the men who enter the scene with determination and stop the comedy  which is, let's not forget, cruel and deadly dangerous. They know what their job is and how to do this job. I must say that the way they calmly analyze the situation, assess the characters of the involved, decide on a course of action and ""execute"" it is utterly convincing. As a viewer I felt that their conclusions and actions were dead right. They appear to be expert craftsmen who are not afraid to risk their own lives, and one shudders at the thought of what would happen were their expertise used improperly by those who command them.",,Anonymous,Biography
Superb!,"Definitely the best movie about bank robberies. This movie is very complex and deals not only with the issue of robbing banks but with the prejudices that people carry.

If you love new york, the opening montage during the credits gives some great shots of new york in the 1970's. It's a cool movie that really puts you in the moment. I'd say more but I want to keep this spoiler free. Watch this movie when you are in the mood for a character driven movie.

"Like the commenter from Harbin said: ""Good Movie, Bad Message"".","Several messages, actually, all of them bad.As an old-line Marxist, director Lumet is a stalwart partisan of the working class-- theoretically. Yet Bath Beach in Brooklyn, NY, an actual working class neighborhood where the movie is set, is depicted as a disorderly community of layabouts and hooligans, solidly on the side of the bank robbers, who try to keep the police from doing their job.Perhaps it is because Bath Beach is a **white** neighborhood that it is so negatively depicted by the politically correct.Not that Lumet is any friend of the forces of order, either. If the thoroughly anti-police ""Serpico"" and ""The Anderson Tapes"" didn't make this director's views clear enough, note here how the F.B.I. agents are shown as treacherous, evil men because they quickly and professionally bring to an end a dangerous situation which the local police struggled with for ten hours without a resolution.Maybe Hollywood wasn't trying to sneak in some pro-gay propaganda, but Sid Lumet certainly was. The character Sonny, sympathetically played by Lumet regular Al Pacino, neither acts nor sounds homosexual. You do not have a clue that he is gay until a good half way in the movie when the motive for the bank robbery is revealed. This subtle bias takes up the theme begun in the earlier ""Anderson Tapes"", where a prior physical relationship between the Sean Connery hero and a very young Christopher Walken is suggested.Made in the mid seventies, this picture embodies the sixties in its alienated social attitudes. See how Lumet has the all white crowd absurdly shouting ""Attica! Attica!"" to show his own sympathy for the rioting convicts at that upstate prison whose murdering of every white person they could reach, guards and fellow inmates, was ended only by police gunfire.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

I once saw an art exhibit about the robbery.,"Hot off ""The Godfather"" movies and ""Serpico"", Al Pacino got another great role in ""Dog Day Afternoon"", also based on a true story. Lovable, manic sap Sonny Wortzik (Pacino) and his uptight friend Sal (John Cazale) try to rob a bank one day, but it turns out to be a totally lousy robbery, with no one actually knowing what to do. Before too long, the whole thing is a media circus, at which point it comes out why they were robbing the bank in the first place: Sonny wanted to get some money for his gay lover's sex change.Sidney Lumet directed this during his prime, when he also directed ""Serpico"", ""Murder on the Orient Express"", and ""Network"". Like in ""Do the Right Thing"", one gets the feeling of New York on a hot summer day, when tensions run highest. As in ""Bonnie and Clyde"", we root for the outlaws, and against the police (Sonny even gets the people on his side by shouting ""Attica! Attica!"" at one point). As for the debate over whether Al Pacino was snubbed by the Oscars...well, at least Jack Nicholson won for ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""; and Al Pacino eventually won for ""Scent of a Woman"".

The best '70s heist movie I've ever seen,"Directed by Sidney Lumet and written by Frank Pierson, this film tells the apparent true story of a bank robbery that would turn into a media sensation. The movie stars Al Pacino from, of course, the Godfather trilogy, as the antihero, Sonny (who, as it turns out, is based off of the real-life bank robber, John Wojtowicz) as well as John Cazale, who was also in the Godfather films, as his partner, Sal, based off of Salvatore Naturale.Now let me start out by saying that I DID watch the trailer for this film, like two or three weeks ago (yeah, it showed many important scenes of the movie, which is why I immediately stopped watching it). But after actually viewing it, I will say that this film had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.This film has the best cinematography I have ever seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey. Not only that, this has the most stable audio out of any 1970s film I've ever heard. I'd also like to add this film is loaded with f-bombs; I have not heard this many uses of them in a film from the '70s since Punishment Park.Last, but definitely not least, Pacino is, of course, the one who steals this movie. This guy gives the greatest performance I have ever seen from him, more so than, there I say it, in pretty much all of the Godfather films combined. Every single moment he was on screen, I sympathized with him to no end. To those who have not seen this film, do yourselves a favor and do just that.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good but flawed,"Quite an intense experience. Lumet's direction is quite good, and this is easily one of Al Pacino's best performances. Seeing it makes me mourn for what he used to be. He really needs to fire his agent right now so he can land himself better material than The Recruit and S1m0ne. While Dog Day Afternoon is very entertaining and well made, it does have some major problems. I think its depiction of gay characters, the ones besides Pacino's, that is, is dated if not offensive. It's almost like you can hear Lumet standing behind the camera telling Chris Surandon to ""queer it to the max!"" and ""get that wrist limper!"" You know he actually got an Oscar nomination for that?! The hostages are all over the map, too. Sometimes they're as scared as hell and sometimes they're having a ball. It's never consistent, not even within individual characters. There are a lot of interesting social issues raised, but the politics are a bit murky. Still, Pacino holds the film together so well that these things, even though they are pretty big flaws, seem small. I can't see how the Academy could choose Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest over Al Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon. The two films are about equal in value, but Pacino comes off as a full character.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Different Kind of Afternoon    ***1/2,"Al Pacino's mesmerizing performance highlights this action filled movie which is a true analysis of character.The film is ""Dog Day Afternoon."" Pacino, the bank robber, is doing this to pay for an operation for his homosexual lover. This is certainly a new one for perpetrating bank robberies. I wonder what Bonnie and Clyde would have said?The robbery goes awry and quickly becomes a hostage situation.Carol Kane, as one of the bank tellers, produces an hilarious line. With the robbery in progress, she gets a phone call from her boyfriend. The latter asks her how long this is going to take? There was such laughter when she said this by the audience, I did not hear Pacino's response.Plenty of foul language goes around especially by Charles Durning, who plays the police detective.John Cazale is a Pacino cohort who invariably winds up shot to death for his ""day's"" work.An off-the-wall film that succeeds because of its dealings with human emotions, even when the latter are not deemed normal by society. Why has this great film become a cult legend? It deals with many societal problems and we see Pacino, the late Cazale and others as merely societal problems. Charles Durning, as the police officer, is magnificent here. He is brutal and yet can show some compassion as he learns about Sonny's twisted life. Pacino was totally memorable here and should have tied with Jack Nicholson for the best actor Oscar that year in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" Ditto for the movie.

I find it better to go into the movie only knowing it's a 'bank robbery' and just that. As the movie goes on, you get the sense it's about more than just money.Speaking of which, another great aspect of the film is how it captures the anti-establishment mood of the 70s, as well as portrays the terror even the criminal goes thru in a tense situation (""Don't take the car, we need the car."").

The media quickly picked up the story, and within an hour of the report going out, dozens and dozens of New Yorkers and news vans flooded the area to catch a glimpse at the unfolding crime scene. After 14 hours, the standoff ended, resulting in one fatality and a crazy story that would eventually become one of the 1970s best movies.Al Pacino is Sonny, a young Vietnam veteran who is attempting to rob a bank to pay for his gay lover's sex-change operation. His partner, Sal, and him really don't have much of a plan, and when it all goes wrong, they demand the FBI send a limo and an airplane to get them out of the country. Sonny is not a bad person, per se - he's emotionally unstable and has had an extremely difficult time re-entering civilian life after fighting in the war. Sal is a bit more disengaged altogether, and has no real backstory other than that he has had several run-ins with the law before.The surprising part of this movie is that the audience comes to sympathize (in a strange way) with the robbers as well as the hostages. In real life, the tellers and bank manager reported to news outlets that they actually enjoyed their time with the robbers, saying they were very funny and surprisingly good conversationalists. This comes through in the movie, especially at the end when a teller, being let go as part of an agreement between Sonny and the FBI, gives Sal a cross and tells him not to worry - even if it is his first time on a plane, it'll be all right. ""I'll pray for you,"" she says, almost sad to be leaving him behind.The performances are all top-notch. From the rowdy mob in the street to Sonny's gay lover, Leon; from the goofy teller who seems to be enjoying the hostage situation to Pacino and Cazale themselves, everyone does a terrific job of keeping the audience engaged and entertained. With the exception of a song played during the opening sequence, there is no soundtrack, which is shockingly effective and adds to the vivid realism of the movie.If you've never seen this movie, please watch it. It wastes no time, pulls no punches, and has a great ending. I don't care if other viewers hated this or didn't connect with the characters... they're sociopaths. Watch this movie with an open mind and just take from it what you will. You won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"One of Pacino's best, most satisfying portraits. The crowd's blind support for criminals is very of its time.","Al Pacino gives one of his most vibrant characterisations as eccentric and very strung-out gay bank robber Sonny, in this film where an accidental siege in a bank becomes a hotspot for all the power tensions of 70's culture.Its obvious from the construction of the film that homosexuals were not seen on screen very much up to this point - so here we have a very penetrating look into the eyes of one, courtesy of Pacino. Its a very big performance, which is great to watch, but it does not feel mocking or unsympathetic on Pacino's part. I think we like Sonny very much - probably not as much as the crazy 70's crowd who are shouting ""power to the people"" and other desperate demonstrating phrases.8/10. The social politics of this movie (the function of the crowd outside the bank) are very dated and unfashionable today, but this movie is very suspenseful, and one of the best siege-dramas i've seen. Its a must see for anyone who wants to know what Al Pacino is great.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great work, on a true story, by both Lumet and Pacino!","Recently I have gotten on kicks for both watching and appreciating the works of director Sidney Lumet and the classic (i.e., 70's) performances of Al Pacino. Thus I came across this film, which I had on DVD forever. It'll interesting to watch the recent documentary on the character Pacino portrays, 'The Dog'--just found out about it earlier today. I loved Lumet's films he made before this that I've seen--'12 Angry Men', 'The Fugitive Kind', 'The Hill', 'The Anderson Tapes' and 'Murder on the Orient Express'--and he's superb at getting the gradual self-destruction of his characters that just seethes through the screen.At this point, Pacino could do no wrong in his work--he had that firm grasp on his immense talent and just what he needed from it to do remarkable work, some of the finest characterizations in contemporary cinema. Do both he and yourself a favour and don't bother with anything he's made since 'Heat'.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best film ever; Pacino's performance is sublime,"Based on a true story: on a very hot day in August, 1972, Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) are reeling from a very botched robbery attempt at the First Brooklyn Savings Bank. They hold the bank staff hostage as they negotiate transportation to leave the USA.Pacino's performance in this film could easily be used as a benchmark. There is so much to love with many special highlights. They include his many energetic scenes walking back and forth on the sidewalk in front of the bank as he is negotiating with the authorities. One of those scenes includes one of the best movie lines that is unlikely to show up on certain ""Best Movie Quotes of All Time"" due to its profanity. Hint: it follows a police sergeant (Charles Durning) asking Sonny why he has asked him to kiss him. The line is delivered with such Pacino panache that it is likely only this genius could get away with it.Other scenes include Sonny dictating his will to one of the bank staff (sensitive and touching) and his one-on-one conversations with three different people in his life: his mother (Judith Malina); his wife (Susan Peretz); and his lover, Leon (Chris Sarandon). The latter conversation is rightly praised as one of the film's highlights. It was very rare at the time for man-to-man relationships to be portrayed seriously without being mocked. The same can be said of the characterization of Leon who has the intention of transitioning to a woman.Director Sidney Lumet is at his best in this film as well with so much action seemingly taking place in real time. The film's beginning amazingly captures crowded chaos. And there is even comedy within the high drama. Some of the bank tellers seem to be thrilled at being part of the mayhem and media attention (Penelope Allen plays the head teller and has a few important scenes). In a fascinating way, the hostages bond with their captors.The climactic powerful final scene, including its build-up, is the perfect conclusion for a perfect film. The cast is great and Lumet's direction is greatly aided by the editing by Dede Allen. - dbamateurcriticRATING: 10 out of 10OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:Directing by Sidney LumetActing by Al PacinoEditing by Dede Allen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tell em to put their guns down . . .,"This is a very, very decent movie.The reason being is Al Pacino's unbelievable performance. He held this movie together. He knew his character and you could tell he was having fun playing him. He took you on this ride as though you were there as well. You even start thinking about what you would do if you were him, in that bank, under that much pressure.The late John Cazale is very good, as well. He doesn't say much, but you can understand his character by the very expressions on his face. It is fun to watch, like the entire movie.The overall plot and storyline is thin and I feel that they notched up the the homosexual sub-plot for more effect on the whole story.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest deserved the Oscar for Best Picture, but Pacino deserved his Oscar as Sonny.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Brilliant, one of the best New York movies","A truly amazing and brilliant drama with Pacino in one of his greatest roles as a married man with children, who holds up a Brooklyn bank so he can pay for his lover's sex-change operation.  If it sounds amusing to you, it certainly is, but this film is filled with lots of drama and tense moments along with some laughs.  Being focused on one specific location and story, one would think it would be boring, but this manages to grab your attention all the way through until an exciting, semi-predictable finale.  Keep in mind that this really happened in August 1972.",,Anonymous,Biography
Everyone praises the criminals,"To quote a line ""What the F$ck is the matter with you??"" Great performances and all accords BUT this movie goes above and beyond to make the perp the victim, the victim the reason for felonious behavior and the law as the perp that violates the REAL perp to justify these crimes. Another quote ""his body might have committed these crimes but that was not my Sunny"" and so many people will agree with this, flash forward 2023. In a scene they released the 1st hostage and clearly in the film the police had no awareness about ANYONE coming out, so they proceeded with full caution... yet the director displayed ""HE'S A HOSTAGE OH MY LORD STOP"" being screamed by other bank employees that in one of DOZENS of disgusting dishonesty displays by this film that law enforcement is an enemy. ""ATTICA ATTICA"". How sad and disgusting to use this horrible event to make a statement that provided AND CONTINUES TO provide the production company with revenue. HOW MUCH MONEY HAS DOG DAY AFTERNOON GIVEN TO THOSE AFFECTED BY ATTICA? But yeah, great acting and acclimation for the the industry, sheep BAH BAH BAH.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Al Pacino cementing his role as the greatest icon so early in his career,"One word! WOW! Dog Day Afternoon is an amazing classic enduring the test of time. I find the movie one of the greatest tragic-comedies interspersed with pathos leading towards the sublime tragic heights. And one of the greatest factors in gaining that status is the unparalleled acting by Al Pacino. I really wish that this movie is watched by everyone today to appreciate what brilliant cinema is like and to watch in awe & understand as to why Al Pacino received 5 successive Oscar nominations in only his first 6 years into movies- a feat that leaves me awe-struck even to this day- The man is BRILLIANT in DDA to say the least.The way Pacino conveys his innermost fears, intensity, love, vulnerability, strength, optimism and innocence (all at one and the same time) with his eyes and his body language is a treat to watch. He leaves you wonder-struck and enchanted. I truly believe it was highly unfair on the part of the Academy not to have awarded him an Oscar for this. He genuinely deserved an Oscar for such a riveting performance.I highly recommend the movie to everyone. It should be a 'must have' DVD in one's movie collection to appreciate and treasure Al Pacino's excellence in Dramatic Art.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The SNL of films about bank robberies,"The prime goal of a bank robber, besides immediate financial gain, is efficiency, and this is for a number of reasons. Nobody wants to hear the story about a successful bank robber for the very virtue that he was successful and, on that particular day, evil won. The immortalized stories and the ones that get repeated through generations, or, in this case, get movies made about them, are those that were peculiar or not-so successful. An inefficient bank robber has more of a probability of their identity being discovered, their alibi in case of indictment being compromised, or their ultimate goal of getting the money and running being corrupted by the police, who's prime goal is also efficiency. The issue is that robbing a bank can go a number of different ways and nobody really knows what will happen until it is happening.These reasons and more are why the story of John Wojtowicz is so intriguing. Based on the true story - a story so absurd that it must be reiterated time and time again that it is indeed rooted in fact - of a bank robbery taking place in Brooklyn back in 1972, Dog Day Afternoon follows three men, Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino), his friend Sal Naturale (John Cazale), and another accomplice named Stevie (Gary Springer). The three men attempt to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank one morning, and the plan goes awry almost immediately when Stevie loses his cool and abandons the two men after Sal first draws his gun. In another unfortunate circumstance, Sonny and Sal realize they've chosen to rob the bank right after the daily cash pickup truck has arrived, meaning the bank only has around $1,000 in the vault.Sonny attempts to make up for this circumstance by stealing the bank's traveler's checks and burning the bank's ledger that keeps track of all of them. The smoke from the small blaze alerts nearby businesses and law-enforcement of suspicious activities, and what was supposed to be a routine, by-the-numbers robbery becomes a hostage situation and a media spectacle. The incompetent and defeated Sonny winds up attempting to hold the young, female bank tellers hostage, as well as maintain his cool long enough to request enough supplies and transportation to get him and Sal to safety as quickly as possible.The problem is that, throughout the course of Dog Day Afternoon, nothing happens as quickly or as conveniently for the characters as possible. The result is like watching a pathetic bank robbery put on by a band of Saturday Night Live cast members, as both Sonny and Sal are stuck between a rock and a hard place throughout the entire film. This also makes this particular film so interesting because of its constant situational humor that seems to keep building and developing as the film goes along. Nothing goes right for the characters, despite their efforts to make things work, and that's one of the fundamental building blocks of comedy that director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Frank Pierson constantly toy with.By classification and its inherent nature, Dog Day Afternoon is a crime drama. It centers around a bank robbery and, regardless of how ill-conceived and managed such the bank robbery is, its narrative is ultimately fixated on a crime. Having said that, it's worth noting how seamlessly Lumet and Pierson interweave comedy and dry wit into the film's narrative, not turning the contents of the story into a laugh riot desperate for uproarious reactions from the audience, but allowing the pathetic characters and the poor circumstance to work for themselves and create comedy very naturally. It's only right that Al Pacino, an actor who can play both low-key and over-the-top, often in the same film, lead the cast as a character who, throughout the course of the film, looks like the personification of an unattended pot left to hopelessly boil over on the stove with nobody in sight to save or cool it down.Dog Day Afternoon's sole setting and slight number of characters allows for familiarity in faces and locations to build very elegantly. Neither Lumet nor Pierson get too caught up in the spectacle of the entire event and shift the focus away from the interior meltdown to the commotion occurring outside. I'd actually be hardpressed to believe, at least after seeing this, that a short film centered around a successful bank robbery captured in one setting would be as tense as this. The unpredictability and the sheer lunacy of all that is unfolding really assist the film in creating something so crazy without gratuitous shock value that it's truly something to behold for all of its one-hundred and twenty minutes.Starring: Al Pacino, John Cazale, Gary Springer. Directed by: Sidney Lumet.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

It is a bizarre tale with lots of black humor.Al Pacino, John Cazale, Charles Durning, James Broderick, the women hostages and even Lance Henrikson all do a great job in this movie.

The Dog of the Day,"Made in the 1970s it has the feel of many 1970s movies. It tries to be there, with the acting being realistic instead of cinematic.The story is ""true"" (Quotes for anything from hollywood) and compelling.A bank robbery that goes wrong and becomes a 1970s phenomena. Why are they doing it, how can they be so nice and so terrible at the same time.There is the problem. The character of Sonny Wortzik is portrayed by Al Pacino as a nice guy. But looking beyond the portrayal you see a horrible manipulator of people who wants the easy answer. He doesn't care about anyone, just the power he holds.However it is the 1970s and so he is portrayed as merely misunderstood and oppressed.Good movie, bad message. The truth of the movie is the characters and that is where the movie sadly fails.",,Anonymous,Biography
A wonderfully peculiar illustration of Murphy's Law,"Sidney Lumet, the legendary director of 12 Angry Men and Network, is operating at the upper echelon of his ability in Dog Day Afternoon. Based on a true story of a bank hostage situation gone incredibly wrong, this film shows us that ""anything that can go wrong, will go wrong."" This film is brilliantly conceived with much of the brilliance stemming from the sheer quirkiness displayed at every turn. The script (which earned Frank Pierson an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay) is extraordinarily nuanced and brought to life by many electric performances from its cast.Al Pacino is magnificent as Sonny Wortzik, the inexperienced, bumbling criminal. He absolutely throws himself into Sonny's mind and perfectly captures even the smaller mannerisms and body language that likely go unnoticed by many. His wired eyes sharply contrast his physical state of exhaustion and you physically observe the fatigue both Pacino and his character are enduring throughout this film.Ultimately, you feel for Sonny because Pacino is able to masterfully force his vulnerability and compassion - the humanistic side of him - into some semblance of bravado. In scenes like when a teller needs to go to the washroom or when the bank guard has an asthma attack, Sonny shows a genuinely caring side to him. This is a bad man performing an act of evil and, yet, we feel some degree of sympathy for what Sonny has endured until this point. Along for the heist is Sal (played by John Cazale), who regrets his involvement in it all the second the two step foot into the bank. The man was simply excellent in every film he was in.Overall, this film is a masterpiece from a director who was always so deft at using the camera to feel like a kind of onlooker; as it subtly observes the events unfolding before it, we too are immersed into the story and thus given a more tangible, relatable story. Like in 12 Angry Men, we are not a moviegoer; but rather a silent bystander enduring the tense, overheated conditions with its characters. And of course, further life is breathed into the plot by excellent supporting performances including those from Charles Durning, Chris Surandon and James Broderick. An entertaining and perfectly executed story.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A small masterpiece,"The problem with a lot of modern movies is that have a message, is they tend to really whack you over the head with it. Either that or they are hopelessly obscure.No such problems with Dog Day Afternoon. It doesn't even have a ""message"" necessarily, but its still one of the most thought provoking movies ever made. It's also probably one of the saddest, and the funniest.I could give endless praise to everyone involved ( except for Chris Saradon sort of struck a wrong note with me ), I could say how brilliant John Cazale is (RIP), and Charles Durning and every one of the hostages. But I really can't think of anything I could say to give everyone their due. They are portraying individual people, but they are all also saying something about people in general and how we operate and communicate with each other. They are perfect.And there is nothing I can really say about Al Pacino here. All I can give you is that this is probably one of the greatest performances of all time. Thats going to sound funny to those who have seen it because its not that kind of performance. Its almost a small performance, actually. Sonny's just not that kind of person. He doesn't draw attention to himself, but you can't take your eyes off him. He is a small spark of manic energy and constant movement. He lights up the screen, but he doesn't fill it up. This isn't something Marlon Brando or Jack Nicholsen or somebody like that could have done in a million years. The extent to which he makes Sonny exist, that he shares his nerve endings, as I like to say, is simply extraordinary. People always love to say ,""you can't see them acting"". Here it's really true.Pacino and his costars also seems to share with the screenwriter a mischievous appreciation of the absurd and an understanding of the overwhelming pathos, joy and humor of normal, unimportant little things. And its precisely those little things that make the movie.It did have its big-scale effect though. Besides laying out a pattern for most bank heist movies today, it also gave Pacino his first opportunity to exercise his vocal chords on camera. American cinema would never be the same.Dog Day Afternoon is certainly one of the best movies of the seventies. its as good in its way as some of the most beloved movies ever made. But while most great movies seem to share a certain sweeping, epic feeling, Dog Day afternoon feels personal, real and unpolished and thats what makes it so fascinating and wildly entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Sal, Wyoming is not a country""","One of the most wild stories of a bank robbery to ever grace the big screen...and its all true.Al Pacino and John Cazale are 2 of the best actors in the 70's, appearing in great movies like The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, and The Deer Hunter. So when I began watching Dog Day Afternoon, I knew I would not be disappointed. I laughed at parts, sympathized at others, and over all enjoyed the movie.Al Pacino stars as Sonny Wortzik, the leader and mastermind of the bank robbery that was supposed to take no more than 5 minutes. Sonny is quick-thinking and not afraid of the cops and media mounting around him.John Cazale portrays Sal, Sonny's right-hand guy. Sal is much quieter than Sonny, and possibly more volatile. Sal's history is much shadier than Sonny's.Along with the stars is a cast of a variety of side characters including Detective Eugene Moretti, the lead cop who constantly tries to trick Sonny and Sal into giving up. There's the bank manager, Mulvaney, whose only interest is the safety of his employees. There's Sylvia, a tough, leading employee who does not take abuse from Sonny and Sal. There's Sonny's ""wife"" Leon Shermer, who is panicky for Sonny's safety.With a talented cast of moderately unknown actors, Dog Day Afternoon is a moving, interesting, unique film.

The Dog Days Are Over!,"This film was brought to my attention on the Rotten Tomatoes 200 LGBT films to watch list. As such I thought it might be worth viewing, but when it started I thought that I must have got the wrong film or a film of the same name. Having checked it out, I realised that it was the right film and that I was going to have to wait to see what made it LGBT and while I can see that it has a connection - Chris Sarandon's performance in particular is brilliant - I don't think it would rate so highly on my list of LGBT films to watch. I'm not sure I would even classify it as such.There was a lot of shouting and screaming and I do appreciate that a lot of it was deliberately ad-libbed and done very well in most places - I did like the phone conversation with Leon - all this hollering just gave me ear ache. I did like the way that the whole day was shown as hot and stuffy to depict the tension of the situation however.I'm not sure that Lumet was right when he decided not to film it as a comedy, as apparently it was one of the funniest nights the hostages had ever had and I think the ending may have been more poignant has there been more humour throughout. Although they must surely have exaggerated the over the top Police presence, even if the robbery cock ups were actually true?I won't be rushing to watch it again or necessarily recommending it to friends, but it would be a talking point as it is a true story.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

Instructions on how not to rob a bank.,"Dog Day Afternoon is an on-reel embodiment of Murphy's Law - anything that can wrong will. Three men decide to rob a bank. Nothing seems to have been premeditated; it is almost as if they were going for lunch but make an impulsive detour. They go in and brandish their guns. One chickens out, leaves, while the two hold fort. Murphy springs his evil trap. The bank is found to have been emptied the same day, leaving only $1,100. And the cops have surrounded the building. The cops cannot storm the place since the two men Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) are holding hostages - the bank manager, an asthmatic guard and a bunch of female recruits. The situation is precariously balanced on a knife's edge. One wrong move and the whole thing blows. It's a deadlock; a stalemate. Despite bleak hopes of making out, Sonny refuses to surrender. He and his partner don't want to go to jail. The cops too are willing to play ball, for it is a hostage situation. Placing everything neatly on a landmine, the story unfurls. That is Dog Day Afternoon for you.Easily the most distinctive feature of the film is Pacino as the flamboyant Sonny. He is not a professional thief and does try to be one. He is a street-smart war veteran with almost no experience of working on the other side of the law and it succinctly shows. He is amateurish in every way possible – his clothes (brown tuxedo, pale yellow shirt with a stripped red and orange neck-tie), his demands and his behavior under pressure are all marred by the lack of professionalism. He is awfully kind to his captives and tries to keep them under the utmost care, perhaps a symptom of Stockholm syndrome. He isn't a cold-hearted, callous thief, and that is why you feel sorry for him. Pacino plays his role so delightfully that even watching him is sheer ecstasy. He does not impersonate Sonny. He slips into his skin and adopts his identity with perfection.John Cazale as Sal too does not get overshadowed under the imposing stature (at 5'7'', not literally of course) of Al Pacino. It is unfortunate that Cazale got to do merely five feature films (The Godfather, The Godfather: Part 2, The Deer Hunter, The Conversation and Dog Day Afternoon) before his untimely demise. Though in demeanour, he is quite the opposite of his partner – dark, silent and brooding with a foreboding air about him, the two get on pretty well, except for trivial disagreements when the look in Sal's cold, black eyes makes you fear that he will convert the entire bank into a slaughterhouse. He is the one who holds the hostages when Sonny, ever the people's man, negotiates with the cops under the sign of truce. He maintains his character with dignity, never letting the viewer slip from the impression that this is a dangerous man.Another highlight of the film is a trademark Sidney Lumet move – the way in which he has treated political issues, a thing that further adds to the drama and the taught, uncertain atmosphere. The director is popular for such twists in the tale. While in 12 Angry Men, he took on racism and darker sides of human idiosyncrasy and in Network he tackled the media, this time he has brought to light Attica prison riot, homosexuality and media, the latter in a different manner.Sonny cites the example of Attica when asked to surrender, which was a similar hostage situation in a prison where the prisoners demanded for better living conditions. Around forty people were killed by the State police, the innocent with the guilty. The memory of this incident helps him incite the masses who suddenly begin sympathizing with him and makes him something of a messiah. Around the middle of the movie, Sonny is revealed to be homosexual. Though not much has been said about the rampant prejudice against homosexuality, this fact helps him gain support from the homosexual community of the town. They appreciate that Sonny hasn't kept his secret closeted. It isn't long before almost all the throngs of people waiting outside the bank back Sonny. But it certainly makes us hope that Lumet wasn't trying to insinuate that all homosexuals should start grabbing guns and robbing their neighbourhood banks to gain recognition and popularity. That would be slightly inconvenient.The media plays a crucial part through this tumultuous roller-coaster ride. The thing about robbing a bank that appears so tantalizing so everyone, except the police, is the instant stardom, which is beautifully highlighted by a scene in the movie, where a delivery boy delivers a pizza to Sonny and yells excitedly to the cameras, 'I'm a f*****g star!'The concept is simple; nothing fancy, nothing extraordinary, but the prowess with which it has been portrayed constantly keeps the viewer on tenterhooks. The movie has a nonchalant, almost caustic sense of humour. It does appear overdrawn (125 minutes), but a Scorsese-like ending which gives the viewer the impression that the director suddenly decided to pack up makes up for it. The movie, however, might put you under the belief that the tale is too far-fetched to be feasible ('no one robs a bank just like that!'), but then again, this is a real-life story.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Incredible film !!,"I saw this film for the very first time a few days back. It was considered to be a landmark films amongst my parents as it was filmed during the 70's.My first impression was that this was going to be a great film for one reason. Al Pacino...I was wrong.Al pacino was amazing as ever in his role ,but also it was the story ,the plot, reflection of society on an individual and the human nature within the characters that really made the film amazing.The story wasn't very complicated ,but it was still a very insightful story .It focuses on Sonny ,the protagonist and the kind of man he his .Sal was also great .On the exterior it has a base for violence as a bank robbery is something that one cannot really relate to anything humane. On the interior it focuses on issues related with how an ordinary individual can make an impact and become a someone from a no one in a few hours (the ATTICA scene) ,homosexuality is a also a theme in this film and it is portrayed in way in which gay people are also human and have to accepted into society n most importantly the entire movie was not just carried by sonny but also by sal ,whose character I cannot forget.This is an excellent film .See it .See it Again n again till u learn something about society was in the 70's n how it is now",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The funny heist gone wrong,"""Dog Day Afternoon"" is about an inept bank robbery that leads to a hostage situation. It sounds like a humorless premise, but humor is the prominent element in the film with moments of drama and tension mixed in.Al Pacino is Sonny, the leader of the heist turned hostage situation. Pacino is perfect in his role as a nervous improviser. His character is multi-faceted and interesting, proving sometimes knowledgeable despite being engaged in an inept operation and sympathetic. John Cazale is also notable as the accomplice of few words, Sal. Cazale is at his best with his expressions during the tense final sequence. The hostages and police forces are well-played as well. It was interesting to contrast the styles of Moretti, initially representing the police side and trying to cobble a solution together and Sheldon, the organized chess-master FBI agent.On paper the hostage situation story sounds typical, but this film rises far above any clichés. The film gains strength from its humoristic approach to the situation, which uses irony and absurdity to great effect. However, there are a number of great dramatic moments as well and an interesting consideration of Vietnam, trans-sexuality and other social issues. I found that after the initial hold-up gone wrong I slowly calmed to the hostage situation before the effective and tense end sequence. I didn't find the film's second half aside from the ending to be as consistently engaging as the first, but overall this film has a novel and interesting approach to portraying a hostage situation.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Possibly Pacino's best performance and simply a great film,"Dog Day Afternoon is the story of Sonny an incompetent bank robber and his partner Sal as they bungle their way through their first heist to an ultimately tragic conclusion.Pacino is at his best in this film in a career filled with legendary performances (The Godfather, Serpico etc) this ranks for me as his best. Some how from the outset he makes us feel sympathy for Sonny who more than likely isn't actually a very nice guy (he is after all robbing a bank!). Backed up by by a similarly excellent performance by John Cazale (a tragedy he died at 43 leaving only five performances on film) as Sal his un-stable partner. Veteran Charles Durning is perfect for the role of the in over his head Policeman who has to deal with the media storm as well as the hostage situation.As the heist spirals out of control all involved lose the plot with the highlight being the arrival of Sonny's 'wife' to the scene. It's then we find out his true motivation and how his struggle to break free from the everyday mundane life he leads has lead him to such a drastic course of action.Direction and script are superb with everything just right always serious in tone but there are moments of laugh out loud madness. That it's based on a true story makes it's emotional punch even stronger.Entertaining, involving and thought provoking everything a serious movie should be 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Did that really happen?,"I really enjoyed dog day afternoon, and afterwards was glad to read hat it generally enjoys appreciation from audiences and of course that it has made its way towards IMDB's top 250.I think it success has to do with the fact that performances are very personal and the audience will not find it hard to relate to characters. It makes an interesting watch and it will make the viewer wonder as to what will happen next and like the participants we do too like those criminals who thought robbing a bank would be like taking on a defenseless old lady on the street.Al Pacino is brilliant as the great thief without a plan. Needless to say what I found most fascinating of all is the fact that it is based on a real story.Overall this is not a movie to miss!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A refreshing new take on a bank robbery,"First off, I'd like to say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Probably my absolute number one. The reason I liked it so much was how the bank robbery was portrayed. Yeah, yeah, Sonny *was* robbing a bank. He was a criminal, obviously. But the way the movie twists and turns, it makes you kind of forget about that, and sympathize with him. It takes you through the rocky road of his life and really kind of lets you see with his eyes. Al Pacino, who has never let me down in delievering an unforgettable performance, is a genius, and really brings the character to life. The light tone of the film in general, a mixture of every detail in the whole movie really, makes it something you would not want to miss.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great portrait of New York in the 70's, and Pacino is captivating","I love the wonderful sense of New York in the 1970's that this film gives us. The characters, dialog, and shots on location in Brooklyn are all highly authentic. It's Al Pacino who really makes the film though, with a performance that is captivating and endearing. He's bumbling and ill-prepared as the leader of this bank heist, yet he's cagey and street-wise as a New York rat.We first get a glimpse of how amateurish these criminals are when one of the three bails early on in the robbery, which is a comical moment. We also smile at Pacino's handling of the situation. He realizes the importance of the hostages he suddenly finds himself holding, but far from being heavy-handed, he tries to be decent with them. He whips the crowd up into an anti-establishment frenzy by shouting ""Attica!"", throwing wads of money into the air, and paying for pizza delivery. He gets into a shouting match with a police sergeant (Charles Durning). He talks to his wife, mother, and transgender lover (Chris Sarandon), and each conversation is touched with pathos, and fantastic. To his mother he says ""I'm a fuck-up and I'm an outcast. If you get near me you're gonna get it. You're gonna get fucked over and fucked out."" It's the outcast underdog that we find ourselves rooting for.I love the simple acceptance of his sexuality, which is incidental and doesn't devolve into some type of stereotype - well ahead of its time. Director Sidney Lumet shows the seamy side of New York, but at the same time, its humanity. The characters are blunt, but understanding of one another when they simply say what they want. The relationships in this tense stand-off are fascinating.I also liked how Lumet gets us into the story immediately. We learn the backstories and characters of the criminals, including Pacino's henchman (John Cazale) gradually, and in little moments, such as finding out he fears their escape plan because he's never been on an airplane before. The film works as both a hostage drama and as a character study. It may be a teeny bit too long at 125 minutes, but has held up well over the years, and is definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Such a great film,"Sidney Lumet had an extraordinary talent for making movies that kind of sneak up on you with their greatness. I have seen this film at least a dozen times, and I know I love it, but I'm consistently surprised by just how great it really is and how many different things this film tackles and how well it accomplishes everything. It's a character study and it contains what is easily one of Pacino's greatest performances. (I was struck by how much you can just enjoy staring at Pacino's face on film.) It's about the relatively new phenomena of a media circus surrounding an event, and it's probably never been dealt with in a better way on film. It's pretty much a perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
More than classic.,"This one's one of the greatest Pacino movies ever. Generally, I'd say that the 70s were very kind to him, since he starred in many great films: ""The Godfather I and II"", ""And justice for all"" and this one. On the other hand, Lumet was also at his artistic peak during that time. It was such a combination; Nothing could possibly go wrong.The plot is based on real facts: Two miserable guys intend to do a robbery, but everything goes the wrong way. Before they split, the police arrive. Being quite desperate, they search for a helping hand in the mob that surrounds the bank, who see them as anti-heroes. All of a sudden, they are the heroes of the day; but they are also desperate.The movie goes through a lot of major issues, which appeared in the 70s, but continue to concern us even today: the press exploitation, the human desperation, the need for working-class heroes, the good and the wicked cops. It's all here. And to be more pleasant about it, it's not a sheer drama. Once the transvestite appears, comedy starts slipping in.I have to admit that it's not a flawless movie. I was quite shocked when that transvestite came in. But I still adore the whole atmosphere of the film, the fact that it's full of energy going on, even though it's generally a slow movie. And the finally scene is quite astonishing. It's a fast, surprising, but silent, scene. It captures the atmosphere of feeling disappointed exquisitely. I recommend it to anyone who'd like to see a great, but demanding, film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
In the flesh,"I love movies since I was a kid. I think I even loved them more when I was a kid because it was easy for me to abstract myself from reality. Watching a movie was like being inside it, and that was extra-cool.Of course, time goes by and you grow up, and as you change you learn to watch and value films in different ways. It's not just a roller-coaster anymore. You admire the actors, you appreciate the direction, the story, you try to look at the details, there's a lot to learn by watching a movie. But now and then, a movie comes by that makes you be a kid again. You forget all about yourself and when you realize you're shaking, you're nervous and scared about what's going to happen to this guy, like your very own life depends on it.Dog Day Afternoon is like that.You know what I'm talking about. Those movies that make you stop and realize that this is why cinema is a great form of art. In the times we live in it's like there's a pop-video infection out there, all movies have to be slick and fast, no time to talk no time to think, it's all action and boom, there you go again... Moviegoers are becoming addicts to this new visual style. All action movies must look like Matrix to be cool. Hell, I loved Matrix, but let's get real now okay. We even have a `matrixized' version of the three musketeers for that fashionable new look. What the hell! Let's rewind please...I'm not going to bother you with the story. It's a bank robbery but it's so much more than that. It's the story of a desperate man trying to set things straight when all has gone wrong. It's about the media exposure, it's about politics, it's about sexuality and incomprehension. It's about a society that has no answers for you and me man, a machine in motion with no soul and no forgiveness (and what a contemporary view of the world it still is today). And if you have doubts on why Al Pacino is a fantastic actor, just look at this! I don't care who you are, this man is great and always will be!Finally, if I were to choose my favorite directors I probably wouldn't remember Sidney Lumet at all. Still, Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico stand, to me, as two monuments of that big american movie-making legacy we all grew up with. A reference and a lession that movies should, at their core, be about people and the complexities of the human spirit.So, let's rewind...",,Anonymous,Biography
WTF did I just watch?,How this has so many high reviews I may never figure out. Is this a comedy? Sure felt like it to me. And not just the fumbling robbers at the beginning of the film. So much over the top dialogue there is no way this incident happened the way this film describes it. So much so I don't see how one can take it seriously. It was a great role for Pacino but other than that this movie is worthless. The wife with his kids is pure comedy. The new wife is off his (or her) rocker as well. The negotiator? And cops? Give me a break. So pitiful how they're portrayed. The pizza delivery guy was great though. Honestly I tried to get to the end twice but couldn't stay awake.

"Tragic comedy-of-errors with Brooklyn, New York the central character...","Director Sidney Lumet does possibly his very best work here and star Al Pacino is at the top of his game for this fictionalized account of a real-life incident in 1972 Brooklyn wherein a crazed, frantic, yet relatively good-hearted local man attempted to rob a neighborhood bank. The story, based on the botched robbery concocted by John Wojtowicz, makes for one hell of a loose, shaggy, kinetic comic-tragedy, with Frank Pierson's screenplay winning an Oscar and Pacino and Lumet receiving nominations. Chris Sarandon (also Oscar nominated) has a small, heartfelt role as Pacino's suicidal lover, while John Cazale as Pacino's nervous partner and Charles Durning as the first cop on the scene are perhaps equally fine. The film isn't hard-shelled or raw; instead, Lumet brings Brooklyn alive, kicking and screaming, to form the heart of the piece, and the film is equal parts acerbic satire, sad commentary, and acute observation that is at times howlingly funny. ***1/2 from ****",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant movie,"This is one of the classics.  Worth watching a few times -- it's still as powerful today as it was when it came out.  I remember this film as a child -- seeing it, could it be, on t.v.?  I didn't understand everything then, but it inspired me.  Now, the idea of making a film with this story is unthinkable, because films are so large, and the risk too great.  DOG DAY AFTERNOON is an example of a time when filmmaking that took risks, expressed a voice, and was unafraid to be political also had the ability to get wide awareness by audiences.  Terrific performances.   Superb writing.  Subtle, gutsy, and refined directing.  I admire most anyone involved in this film. A Great American Film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Top-notch drama,"Al Pacino delivers an outstanding performance as somewhat incompetent bank robber Sonny Wortzik, who, along with his partner Sal (played with understated melancholia by John Cazale), decides to knock over the First Brooklyn Savings Bank to pay for his 'wife's' (Chris Sarandon) gender-reassignment surgery. The heist quickly goes wrong, leaving the bemused and unprepared criminals and their hostages stuck in a stinking-hot bank, surrounded by cops, the media, and crowds of on-lookers. Based on a true story and once again affirming the adage that 'truth is stranger than fiction', ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is one of the best films to come out of the early 70's, with fantastic acting, tight direction and an excellent script (although much of the dialogue was improvised). Notable for being one of the five full length films Cazale starred in before dying of lung cancer, all of which were nominated for a Best Picture Oscar (three of which won the award).",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
not one wasted frame....buy this DVD,"astonishing directorial and literary work > story itself is engrossing and when Pacino and Cazale (both from THE GODFATHER, II) lock-in, it's an instant perennial.although the premise and plot have universal application, this is very much ""New York"" > all pomposity aside, we original Easterners have met these characters somewhere, on the subway, in a coffee shop.the audience's empathy (and that of the supporting characters at the bank) pull us in...we almost forget these guys are fooling around with loaded rifles in a tight space.I was drawn in right to the point when the police ""manipulated"" the surrender...no spoiler here.Pacino is understated, as is Cazale...which brings out the underlying, physical and emotional tension.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
As real as it gets,"""Biography"" is a genre tag that generally indicates a story of dry fact and dull predictability, but Dog Day Afternoon convinced me otherwise. Having seen the relatively recent Joker (2019), a few minutes of digging brought me to a clip of Todd Philips citing this movie as an inspiration for his own script, and that was all I needed to hear.Starting out with a montage of 70's New York that shifts from grand panorama to unbecoming filth, Lumet clearly leaves no stones unturned when it comes to revealing the candid truth. Only the first minute or so of the film is accompanied by a score and the rest is a saga of silence, giving a documentary feel to the gripping events that follow. Portraying a true story is admittedly a challenge, and despite protests from the real life ""Sonny"" concerning certain aspects of the narrative, the story we see succeeds to a great extent in encapsulating the truth of the actual incident while also retaining an engagingly dramatic tone. Especially commendable is the handling of the homosexual theme of the event, which in the period of its release, was a much controversial topic.Taking the viewer through a wide range of emotion, the story evolves from an almost goofy comedy to a chilling tragedy, with the claustrophobia of the closed bank space bringing out the peculiarities of each character. Pacino's performance as Sonny is a masterpiece of method acting, each nervous twitch a measured decision on the part of the actor, bringing us ever closer to the complex character he portrays. Cazale maintains a mostly mute presence, yet a disturbing sense of determination and fear shines through his aura of silence.With outstanding acting, perceptive directing and a surprising story, this is a movie that belongs at the top of any crime/biography genre listing.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
classic Al,"Attica! Attica!This was probably the first 'R'-rated movie I was allowed to see (or maybe it was DEATH WISH?). And I really haven't seen too many better ones in the succeeding thirty years. Pacino was still relatively fresh in the eyes of the American public, as we (and when I say ""we"", I'm speaking for the U.S. audiences of 1975---I caught up with his earlier work later on through the wonder of VHS) had only witnessed his cooler & less manic acting performances of SERPICO & the two GODFATHERS. But he was allowed to cut loose here, and cut loose he did. It's pretty much a non-stop roller-coaster ride of emotions as the DOG DAY unfolds.John Cazale (who will always remind me of Mike Krzyzewski {""Coach K.} from Duke U.) does a fine job in his own understated, 'psychoish' way. But this is really Al's show, and he doesn't disappoint. So pull up a chair and watch ""The Midget"" (as he's referred to in Robert Evans' autobio.) at the top of his game.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Dog Day Afternoon,"A very funny film when you watch closely. Pacino's Sonny is a complete idiot. He goes in to rob a bank with no real thought how he's going to get out with the money or if he's going to make it out alive at all. No planning. No idea how to deal with the situation. Don't have any intention of killing anybody. Don't even know why they're robbing the bank in the first place. That's what makes the film a masterpiece. Lumet and Pacino are poking fun at the Fox-TV phenom called ""America's Dumbest Criminals"" : These characters who rob banks or 7-11's, get in a bind and then turn the entire ordeal into a tragedy about their lives and their hopes and dreams...not of the people being held up at gunpoint. That's brilliance!",,Anonymous,Biography
Performance by John Cazale was one of few highlights,One of the most overrated movies of the 1970's. Dog Day Afternoon is too deep for its own good. The long dialogues did not help to make it a very entertaining experience. Neither did it felt believable - even thought it is based on the true story. The performance by John Cazale was one of few highlights.,5.0,Anonymous,Biography
An excellent film,"'Dog Day Afternoon' is definitely one of the finest films of the 1970s. It perfectly captures the pessimistic view of America at the time, and succeeds in creating the ultimate anti-hero whom people across America turned to. The film has a very simple storyline. Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) attempt to rob a bank, but only manage to get $1100. To make matters worse, the police arrive and the duo are trapped in the bank with 12 hostages. Sidney Lumet had already proved his ability to direct long conversational scenes with his masterpiece '12 Angry Men', but Dog Day Afternoon', as mentioned before, does so in a much more sympathetic manner. The audience feels real sympathy for Sonny, despite his criminal intentions. The character struggles through life as so many Americans did at the time. Sonny is kind hearted, and his inexperience and struggles only earn him more sympathy. Al Pacino portrays Sonny in a very realistic manner, based upon the real life Sonny whose attempted robbery inspired the film. The sympathy and support for Sonny is intensified further when crowds in the film cheer him on, and the issue of homosexuality was raised, being a controversial topic. These make 'Dog Day Afternoon' an almost unbearably realistic film, and this only enhances the quality of its direction. The mixed pace of the film, sometimes fast and sometimes slow only intensifies the confusion experienced by Sonny, and again intensifies the sympathy toward him. The film is intense, and this is a result of the pace as the audience feels the anger and frustration that the characters do, unaware of what will happen. This is a very successful feature of the film. However, this does remove the ability to revisit the film regularly as the impact is not the same the second time around. Nevertheless, I consider 'Dog Day Afternoon' to be one of Pacino's best films, and also John Cazale's second best performance. The chemistry between Pacino and Cazale (real life friends) is clearly visible on screen and adds massively to the film's emotion, especially at the end. Had the film not been up against 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' for the Best Picture Oscar in 1976, I am sure that 'Dog Day Afternoon' would have won. This is a must see film guys, and definitely as fiercely relevant now as it was in 1975 in my opinion!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
funny and original,"Amateur criminals Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino), his friend Sal Naturale (John Cazale) and Stevie try to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank.

Then they get a call from police Sergeant Moretti (Charles Durning). The bank has been completely surrounded. It becomes a media circus and they become instant celebrity. The police finds Sonny's lover Leon Shermer (Chris Sarandon) in Bellevue. Sonny needs the money for Leon's sex change.The hostages and bumbling robbers are hilarious.

That's a life filled with great performances. This is my favorite Sidney Lumet movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A lesson in amazing acting and writing.,"Dog Day Afternoon is loosely based on the true story of John Wojtowicz (called Sonny Wortzik for the movie) and his 2 friends who attempt to rob a bank in Manhattan in order to fund Sonny's homosexual lover's sex change operation. The plan is to go in and get out, 10 minutes at least, but before Sonny knows it he's facing the FBI, the NYPD, and the media. We focus on Sonny and the decisions he has to make over the 14 hour period.This is probably the best Hollywood heist story there is. No matter how many they've brought out over the years, none of them have been as thrilling and as well thought out as this. Dog Day Afternoon completely defined the Hollywood heist film. Of course, director Sidney Lumet takes liberties with the true story, but the basic facts of the event are here. Another thing that makes this movie so great is the mix between many different genres that the film goes through. There's heart wrenching drama, there's thrilling action, and there's a dab of light hearted comedy here and there.I personally think they should show this movie in high school drama classes to show what it means to be a good actor. Al Pacino gives his most realistic performance in this movie. Every other actor in the movie gives an explosive performance as well. John Cazale is great as Sonny's partner in crime, Sal. Chris Sarrandon gives an Oscar nominated performance as Sonny's lover.For anyone that is a Pacino fan or a fan of good movie making, this is an essential for your collection.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very Realistic. Lumet is a genius. Pacino is a legend,"What I liked most about this movie is that its very TRUE and REALISTIC . And I mean in all the ways, the hostages' feelings and reactions, the relationship between the hostages and the rubbers, the rubbers reactions and how do they handle the situations. It was all very realistic. And that means the great directing from Sidney Lumet which I think should have won the Oscar instead of Milos Foreman for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. But above all the great and unbelievable performance from the legend Al Pacino which I also thing should have won the Oscar instead of Jack Nicholson for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, although Nicholson was great !! We also shouldn't forget John Cazale and his wonderful performance. At the end, Dog Day Afternoon remains as one of the best classics ever made and unforgettable film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great,"The acting in this movie was the thing that held it together. Al Pacino was fantastic. You really saw the stress that he was feeling through out the whole movie. I thought reinacting Dog Day Afternoon was a great idea because it shows how nice they were about stealing the money but it all went wrong when one person saw what was happening and then everyone knew about it. It's a great story to show in a movie and I thought the movie was fantastic. Al Pacino is one of the best actors who ever lived. He got most of his reputation from the Godfather Saga even though he never won an award for the Godfather but there were a lot of other movies that he was in the deserves recognition like Serpico, Scent of a Woman (Academy Award Winner) and Insomnia. But I think Dog Day Afternoon was one of his best ACTING movies he was ever in. Overall, I think this movie was fantastic and I recommend this movie to all viewers who like Al Pacino and like very interesting storylines.

Great writing & direction provide a wonderful setting for Pacino to deliver an excellent performance worth of the accolades which he has deserved for years. There are moments in the film's dialog which seem dated today, but nonetheless, the intensity of the performance is present in the staged setting portrayed in this high quality film. There are great supporting efforts by many actors, but the energy of the film is driven by the performance given by and cinematic focus upon Al Pacino.

Great acting for a widely entertaining bank robbery,"Dog Day Afternoon is by far the most accomplished movie about a bank robbery gone wrong. The plot is based on a true story and is pretty much filmed as if in a theater stage only comprised of a small urban New York bank and its immediate surroundings. One of the highs is found in the amazing cast that so naturally portrayed what was a set of challenging roles. Al Pacino is not only convincing, but in his lunacy and rhythm finds a way to charm us with his wit and the natural quality he manages to give his character. His male lover Leon makes another convincing short presentation that never makes us doubt about the truly dysfunctional lifestyle they have. Sonny's partner Sal played wonderfully by the late John Cazale speaks with the same frailty and emotional instability he gave his famous Godfather character. The movie does well to seem natural, far from the flamboyance that tends to haunt Hollywood when making films about cops trying to take down bad guys. The 2 hour long film also keeps you at the edge of your seat, giving you sufficient thrills along the road to keep you guessing and wishing for the best. The only criticism I have are the unnecessary shots of New York City at different moments in the movie as if watching Manhattan will helps us understand anything more about the movie and its characteristic New York characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This movie ages well,"As a movie production, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" has a lot going for it already - excellent directing, editing, good improvisational dialogue, and Al Pacino's recent star power coming from both ""The Godfather"" successes. What makes this a gem is we get to watch Al Pacino's remarkable intensity in his younger years which has catapulted him to legendary status today. Simmering underneath the simple crime plot are worthy social commentaries still relevant in our day and age of social media. Idol worship of criminals. Pizza delivery guy celebrating his likes. Cops snickering when the gay/pre-trans lover is being interviewed. Black man hostage assumed as the perpetrator, threatened and handcuffed upon release. Sal's main worry of being called gay in the news. Heavy-set wife blaming herself for being big. ""Dog Day Afternoon"" cannot be made today, so cherish this gem of a movie and be in awe of Pacino at the top of his game.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The magic of words,"Based on something that really happened and was put down in words in an article, Frank Pierson wrote a wonderful screenplay that required putting down the first words in words again. It's a wonderful thing, words. You would never imagine the important part they play in a bank robbery: what to say to the hostages, how to treat them, what to discuss between partners, what to discuss between partners, what to tell the police or the FBI when they want to negotiate.Fortunately, Sonny (Al Pacino) is very good with words. He's so good that he manages to achieve a good relationship with the typical public that gathers in the streets every time there is a robbery. Sidney Lumet's ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is the tale of Sonny and Sal (John Cazale), two guys who enter a bank and plan to rob it quickly but end up staying the whole afternoon, and night.The movie is a harsh declaration against the role of the media in robberies, with cameras and reporters all over the place, not knowing exactly what they're doing but knowing they have to do something; against the role of the police, who say one thing and do another and keep their guns up while Sonny is constantly coming out of the bank with a white flag.Of course it all revolves around Pacinos's frenetic performance, in his first major role after ""The Godfather Part II"". At one point he comes out of the bank and goes ballistic, demanding detective Moretti (Charles Durning) to tell the police officers to put their guns down, and screaming to the public about an event that happened in Attica. He didn't expect it, but he wins the public and becomes your 'freak show' of the day (as he would say); a kind of 'hero of the moment' everyone wants to talk to, which brings problems for the police to work properly.Did Sonny want this? We never know, but he uses it in his favor. We actually never know quite exactly what Sonny wants, and Sidney Lumet is kind enough to let us figure it out. The director focuses on the tension, establishing a clear difference of what's going on inside and outside the bank and then translates all this to Sonny's changes of mood. ""I'm dying here"", he says to several people in different moments of the film; and we don't know if he's serious or if he's saying it to appear as a victim to the police.Because Sonny (and Sal, if you pay close attention) is not the guy who would enter a bank and rob it; that's something we can deduce because he knows things and he's, in general terms, kind and worrying. What Lumet does is putting us through a horrible experience as viewers, where we can never exactly decipher what the main character will do next and why he acts the way he acts and why people say something about him we can never get to see. It's frustrating that there's a human side of the movie and that we want to know all about it but we never get chance, unless we want to elaborate an own theory.I'm making a wild guess here, but how much could have Pierson known about this man in order to put it in his script? Probably nothing. And then we go back to the magic of words; because everything we can find out about Sonny, we do through his words. And his words are managing three expectations at the time: what the hostages expect, what the police expect and what his partner Sal expects.It's marvelous to see how he manages it and how Lumet never loses the tension, and how among all of this unpredictable things, the film never stops creating unexpected moments.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The eyes have it,"Sidney Lumet directed the magnificent ""Dog Day Afternoon"" in 1975, but the story could be done just as is today and still be fresh. Thus is one mark of a classic.Al Pacino is Sonny, who along with his friend Sal (John Cazale) and another man brazenly walk into a bank and attempt to rob it. Here it's somewhat of a black comedy, because the third man decides he can't go through with it and leaves - but before he does, Sonny gets the car keys from him.We later learn that Sonny, a husband and father, is robbing the bank to get money for his other spouse, Leon (Chris Sarandon), who wants a sex change operation.Sonny is nice to the hostages. He doesn't lock them in the vault because there won't be enough air, he lets them go to the bathroom, he tells them to call home, he gets food brought in - and when one of the women has an opportunity to leave, she doesn't, nor does the lone man.This is first of all one of the world's loudest films that must have used as many extras as ""Cleopatra"" did. They line the Brooklyn street outside the bank yelling for Sonny, and later the crowds are joined by the gay community yelling ""Out of the closet and into the street!""The harried police, who are having trouble figuring out this guy, are led by Charles Durning, with James Broderick (Matthew's dad) there for the FBI. It's an incredibly circus atmosphere, with helicopters flying overhead, television cameras, reporters, and police.Through it all there's Sonny and Sal, with Sonny hoping that Sal doesn't start shooting as he tries to figure a way out of the mess he's gotten himself into.Al Pacino gives a tour de force performance as Sonny, a man with an hysterical mother, an hysterical wife, and a lover in Bellevue who wants to get away from him.It felt as if much of the dialogue was improvised; it sounds very natural. Pacino's eyes tell a story, particularly at the very end of the film. When he was young, his eyes dominated his face, and they were mesmerizing.Chris Sarandon gives a terrific performance as Leon. Everyone is good, well directed by Lumet with a hand that gives the entire film authenticity. Look for Carol Kane was one of the hostages and ""The Sopranos"" Uncle Junior, Dominic Chianese, in a tiny role as Sonny's father.A must see, and a film that showcases Lumet's great talent and why Al Pacino is one of our greatest actors.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ironic,"The adaptation of real events makes the film a bit playful. A smart and kind robber, a dumb and fierce robber, plus a bank employee who is not nervous, the surrounding crowd, the more than 200 police detectives surrounding the house, these characters set up Theatrical stage, sang a big show. The film is ironic. Sonny's impromptu speech to the masses, bank employees and pizza brothers face the ecstasy of ""famous"" on the camera, gay groups support Sonny's move, and even Sonny's behavior of selling his companions, perhaps with the seventies American politics of the age. The plot inserts a close-up shot of Sonny talking to his two wives and mother, which is completely Al Pacino's personal performance stage, and also uses these three paragraphs to enrich Sonny's character and motivation .",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mesmerizing and Pacino and Cazale Rock!,"What a great film. Where to begin? The opening Elton John music--perfect to help set the mood, which is the only time there is ""background music"" so that the effect is like watching a real-time documentary with hidden cameras. Theacting--what acting?? The characters all feel so real and so perfectly drawn from the tour de force of Pacino's Sonny to the unbelievably intriguing Cazale's Sal (what a tragic, tragic shame that his acting career was cut short--but he sure left us with some of the most memorable characters in the history of American Film) to all of the ""bit"" players, each a living breathing recognizable person. The New York feel to the film is perfect. The directing of Lumet is just astonishing. As has been commented on--we feel that we are experiencing each and everymoment of this hostage scenario--to the extent that by the end of it we are also exhausted, hungry and sort of in an altered state. Much of the film is like a roller-coaster ride--we do a lot of laughing, and watch the story unfold inamazement--and then that look on Sonny's face in the airport , filled with so much anguish, that the film also becomes incredibly poignant. Have a great,rollicking time--and see this absolutely top-notch film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is American cinematic gold from this era and an absolute must see,"Dog Day Afternoon (1975) is a movie that I recently watched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a group of associates who planned a robbery in New York City one hot summer day. Unfortunately for them nothing goes as planned and the police quickly swarm in and surround the bank. As they negotiate their way out of this circumstance they leverage historical bank robberies mismanaged by police to get what they want; meanwhile, details about the robbers circulate the airways complicating matters.This movie is directed by Sidney Lumet (12 Angry Men) and stars Al Pacino (Scarface), John Cazale (The Godfather), Penelope Allen (The Thin Red Line), Sully Boyar (Car Wash), Carol Kane (Scrooged), Lance Henriksen (Pumpkinhead) and Charles Durning (The Sting).This movie is so well done and contains a unique storyline with incredible twists and turns. The characters are fascinating and unpredictable. The cast delivers tremendous performances and Pacino is awesome. You can see how his characters gets lost in the both the notoriety he receives but also in what to do next. The settings, heat and circumstances are perfectly depicted. The feel of the era and pressure on those involved is perfectly on display and the outcome is in doubt all the way until the final scene...you know it isn't going to happen the way Pacino wants, but you don't know what is going to happen.Overall, this is American cinematic gold from this era and an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Screwball, Goofball, and Laughable","The best part about this, is that it was from the library, so it it didn't cost money to watch it.Firstly, this is really a cross between Woody Allen, The Marx Brothers and the Keystone Cops.This movie is terrible.It's a comedy, in reality.It is inane.The crooks, police, hostages, crowd, etc., are all acting silly and ridiculous, even for the plot, and location.--Profanity.

Amazing,"This film is simply superb. It is so refreshing to watch a movie that is so entertaining and captivating without being filled with the usual high-speed action, flashing lights and violence that you would normally expect in a movie of this genre.The brilliance of this movie lies in the performances of the characters- it undoubtedly has one of the best casts in any movie ever made. Every word spoken, every action, every look by every character is immaculate in its intention. The film also gives us what I believe is one of Pacino's best performances, from start to finish he is utterly enthralling, particularly in the famous 'ATTICA!' scene, the scene where he is speaking on the phone to Leon and then his wife and of course the scene where he is creating his will.To conclude, I loved this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Inside Look At A Botched Bank Robbery,"Al Pacino puts on a brilliant performance here as Sonny Wortzik, a desperate man who tries to rob a bank - an attempt that just keeps going more and more wrong as each minute goes by. Apparently based on true events (with the real names having been changed) the movie provides a fascinating look at both the bungled bank job and Sonny's extremely complicated personal life. Divorced from his wife (with whom he had two children) Sonny had begun a relationship with a pre-operative transsexual (played by Chris Sarandon) who was becoming suicidal over not being able to afford a sex change operation. In partnership with Sal (John Cazale) Sonny robs the bank, but the police respond very quickly and Sonny ends up with a bank full of hostages. An interesting aside in the movie is watching how the various hostages handled the situation. The only real weakness I can see in this movie is that there's no explanation of who Sal was, or of how he was connected with Sonny. Sal provides a bit of humour to the movie. He comes across as completely lost, and begins to worry when he finds out that the media are reporting that the robbers are ""two homosexuals."" He wasn't a homosexual, and he wanted the world to know that! Charles Durning also put on a good performance as NYPD Detective Moretti, who's handling the robbery, and who comes across as a pretty decent guy who really wants to find a way out of this for everyone.Essentially what we have here is a fascinating story complemented by excellent performances all around. It's a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great acting by Al Pacino,"A homosexual man wants money for his lover to have a sex change operation - the film shows his attempt to rob a bank and the hostage situation that follows.If I had known in advance what the film is about I would certainly never have watched it, which would have been a great pity. It is a most engrossing film with an absolutely great, very high-energy performance from Al Pacino.It's been a long time since I saw the film but I cant imagine it getting dated. The power of the acting would keep it fresh.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Main character Sonny is fascinating,"Why do I like Dog Day Afternoon so much? First, because it contains one of the most fascinating movie-characters I've ever seen: bankrobber Sonny, wonderfully played by Al Pacino. Yes, he robs a bank (or tries to, that is), but that doesn't mean you'll dislike him. I felt sorry for him, the way he was jammed in between all those people who expected different things from him: the hostages, the police, his partner Sal, his wife, his mother, his lover. And, not to forget, the audience outside the bank. Sonny really fascinated me, and every now and then I still wonder how the real Sonny is doing nowadays. Second, I liked this movie because of the way the atmosphere in and outside the bank was presented. It's great to watch the New York crowd. And the humoristic elements all just had the right touch. Third, the casting was perfect. The woman playing the hostages were very good, Chris Sarandon was great. And I especially liked the way John Cazale played Sal, you'll always wonder what is going on inside that man's head, whether he will become violent or not. Although this movie is almost 25 years old, it's still one of my favourites (in fact: it was my first 'favourite movie' ever, I started to become a movie-fan thanks to this one!). My vote: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Uncanny resemblance between young Chris Sarandon & Mark Ruffalo,"I couldn't get over the resemblance between young Chris Sarandon, who played Leon, and Mark Ruffalo (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""You Can Count on Me"").When Leon first appeared in the movie, I was freaked. I thought for a moment it was actually Ruffalo in the role, but that didn't make any sense, since the movie was made in 1975, and Ruffalo was born just eight years earlier, in 1967.I never would have thought that Leon was played by the same guy who played Prince Humperdinck in ""The Princess Bride.""Anyone else notice this, or is it just me?---Terry from Seattle",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Film Like the Stage,"That's what I like about it - it's a movie that works within the small physical scope and silence (soundtrack? what soundtrack?) of a stage play. Raw character soup at its best.  (Pacino gives us the alphabet letters; Cazale the meat and veggies.)  This is like Twelve Angry Men in character development, but with two brought forward, close to the lens.  It is very sharp on them and just as fuzzy on the rest (love the head teller!).But.  Anyway.  Why so many cops?  Nothing else goin' on in Brooklyn '72?",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fueled by a gripping performance from Al Pacino,"A man robs a bank to pay for his lover's operation; it turns into a hostage situation and a media circus.Framed by great work from director Sidney Lumet and fueled by a gripping performance from Al Pacino, Dog Day Afternoon offers a finely detailed snapshot of people in crisis with tension-soaked drama shaded in black humor. As much as it is about a deeply troubled individual, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is about a shift toward exploitation in the American media via live television.
Strong performances and forward-thinking situations make this political thriller an exceptionally vibrant film experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Somehow, I missed a whole bunch of stuff","I saw the film for the first time (June 16, 2023) on the TV screen and saw it primarily as a character study of people (bank robbers & police) under stress. Somehow, I missed completely any and all allusions to homosexuality & transgender. (Partly due to hard of hearing...)I also kept wondering why Police didn't take down Sonny Wortzik (played by Al Pacino) when he was outside of the bank and take a gamble that Sal Naturile (played by John Cazale) would not kill the hostages. And I kept wondering, what police would do differently if presented with the same opportunity. According to the Wiki article, this movie is used for training purposes of Hostage Negotiators. I could believe that. It had a sense of reality docu-drama to it and apparently, the director, Sidney Lumet, allowed actors to improvise so long as the improvisation was consistent with the story line and characters. That sense of reality, explains why one of the hostages practicing military drill with a rifle, didn't use it to take down the two bank robbers.I knew nothing about the movie, that it is apparently based on a real-life event; in the end, Sidney Lumet and the actors created a believable character study of people under stress.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb,"Easy to dismiss initially as just another bank heist caper, it gets better and better the more it goes on.

Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale)'s attempt to rob the bank is so bad it is hilarious.

1970s cinema at its best,"Al Pacino plays Sonny who with a couple of pals try to rob a bank. However, instead of making their planned quick get away, they are soon besieged in the bank and nerves begin to fray. This is a great piece of 1970s cinema. Pacino is excellent as the anti-hero who loses control of the action and sees everything spiralling out of control. The direction by Sidney Lumet is focused and spot on - there are only one or two scenes that are not set within the bank or its immediate vicinity. My only complaint is that especuially in the middle third of the film the action moves slowly. Very slowly. Other than that, this is a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant and Witty!,"The 1970's have been kind to Al Pacino because that was the decade that brought him to fame. He struck gold with the Godfather films but her also starred in Serpico and now this film, Dog Day Afternoon. This film is not like you would expect. I thought this film would be a thriller/action kind of film but this is actually a comedy, and a quite funny one. This movie is well-paced, sharp, witty, and features very good acting.Sidney Lumet's film is about a guy named Sonny and his dim-witted friend who decides to hold a bank hostage in order to get an operation for his gay lover. But when this plot is discovered, he won't go down without a fight.This film is well-acted. It has a great character study and it shows wide ranges of emotions. Al Pacino is excellent and makes a serious case on why he should have won Best Actor. He has some zany energy and his role comes across as realistic. The late John Cazale is really good and has some great one-liners.Overall, this is what cinematic gold is. It's a film that is all about the characters and what they do/how they feel. Not many films analyze in-depth on their characters as Dog Day Afternoon does. Some people may not like this because they wanted hardcore action. But those who expect cinematic beauty, this is for you. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Attica!,"Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon is the true story of a bank robbery that turned into a media circus. The films stars Al Pacino and the late John Cazele doing, what I say, the performances of their life's. Sidney Lumet does an exceptional job at directing and I think should of taken home the gold for Best Director. Making it so it's like news coverage and as realistic as possible, he decides to have 60% improvised and no music or colour scheme. He also makes all the actors where clothes from their own wardrobe. But this isn't a mockumentary. Everything about it cinematic. The shots are great, the acting is great and the ending is powerful and perfectly executed. I also love the opening scene of New York with a classic tune by Elton John.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Iron Cast,"""Attica! Attica!"" is, along with ""Say hello to my little friend!"", perhaps one of the most memorable film quotes. Not many classical film quotes are popular among younger generations, but these two film quotes-which come from a single actor-are among the very few that are.This fact alone speaks volumes of Al Pacino's strength as an actor, a strength matched only by few. It is also testimony of his versatility as an actor, for the characters he portrays in DOG DAY AFTERNOON and SCARFACE only have their controversiality in common.Al Pacino may be the star in DOG DAY AFTERNOON, but one must not forget that the strength of an actor's performance is a reflection of the film's entire cast and director. Al Pacino delivered extraordinary performances in these films because he worked with extraordinary people. DOG DAY AFTERNOON is a film that will stay with you.I can not conclude this opinion without mentioning the director's full name: SIDNEY LUMET. A legendary director who will, undoubtedly, only rise in appreciation. If you have not watched any of his films yet, I suggest you start with any of them.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Al Pacino's solid performance and Frank Pierson's superb screenplay are what really makes this film work so well,"Dog Day Afternoon is a true story about two men who rob a bank in Brooklyn in 1972.Most of the heist films that I've seen are slick and well-orchestrated (think Oceans 11 or The Bank Job). However, with Dog Day Afternoon the opposite is true when we witness Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) making mistakes and being careless - such as not timing the robbery before a large sum of money has already been collected OR drawing unnecessary attention to themselves by lighting a small fire within the bank. It's evident from the start that Sonny and Sal had not really thought things through and this is what gives this film its human element.I personally think that to categorise this film as a heist film is incorrect as it probably acts more as a character study on the human mind. To me, Sonny was more misguided than bad and this becomes more evident when you look at his motivations - his reasons for robbing the bank are to help someone he loves make a life-altering decision in order to make them happy. Whilst, there's no condoning his actions I think it's easier to feel for him as a person when you learn his reasoning behind the heist.Frank Pierson's screenplay is excellent here and I think what makes this work so well is that he offers us so much insight into Sonny as a person. A good character study can only really work if you afford your character some depth - I also think it helps if both good and bad aspects of the character are represented. Here Pierson initially presents Sonny as a hard-edged character, but gradually as the film progresses we start to feel for Sonny and start to understand some of the problems that he's faced in life (the conversations that he has with his two lovers help to highlight this point). Also, despite its running time of 120 minutes, Pierson keeps things moving quickly right from the initial heist, to the negotiation with the cops, to its resolution there is not a minute wasted. It's also a relatively suspenseful and intense film that rarely loses any momentum.Pierson's screenplay is strong enough on its own, but what really brings this picture to life is Al Pacino. His performance here was terrific and although there are a couple of occasions when he perhaps goes a little overboard I think this is one of his best performances.As a side note, there was one point in the film where Sal (John Cazale) is discussing smoking with one of the hostages and he mentions that he doesn't smoke because he doesn't want to end up with cancer. In a sad twist of irony, Cazale succumbed to cancer and died 3 years after this film was made. I think this is a good point in the review to also acknowledge Cazale's performance and whilst he wasn't given as much to do as Pacino, he was still very good here in a more low-key way and Pierson also manages to handle his character with sensitivity as well.Dog Day Afternoon is a superb film that is well worth watching. Despite the fact that the story is about a bank heist, it's much deeper than that and is a film that focuses more on Sonny's reasoning behind the crime he's committed and his emotional and psychological mind-set. It's a very involving and compelling story that was excellent from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Thrilling Story but with an Unnecessary Element,"Dog Day Afternoon is a thrilling and intense film, especially thanks to Al Pacino's outstanding performance. He portrays a complex character with remarkable depth, and the film keeps you engaged with its suspenseful plot and constant tension.However, I felt that the inclusion of the homosexual aspect was unnecessary to the core narrative unless the film was strictly following the true story. Even then, certain elements-especially the ending-could have been adjusted to enhance the impact without emphasizing a detail that doesn't add much to the main events. That being said, the film remains a powerful cinematic experience worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Still a superb true-tale heist drama even after 47 years,"Based on a true 1973 tale, 1975's ""Dog Day Afternoon"" sees Al Pacino (stellar) & John Cazale (understatedly good) rob a small Brooklyn bank (staffed by Sully Boyar & a few ladies) which becomes an unintended hostage situation swamped by press, cheering onlookers & a mass of armed cops (including Lance Henriksen) led by tough New Yorker Charles Durning (brilliant) & the FBI's James Broderick. As his family (including Chris Sarandon) 'try' to talk Pacino down, his wider situation becomes clearer as the compelling saga draws to it's decisive end. Excellently written (Frank Pierson) & directed (Sidney Lumet) it's still a superb heist drama even after 47 years.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Life Cycle of a Cult of Personality,"""Dog Day Afternoon"" asks several difficult questions about the roles celebrity, money, media and responsibility play in our everyday lives. Al Pacino puts so much into his portrayal of Sonny, the stressed-out intellectual pressed a few steps over the edge, that it's no surprise he nearly suffered a nervous breakdown on set. It's genuinely amazing how much quality characterization the filmmakers were able to fit into this regular-sized package, and not just for the lead parts. By the time Sonny, Sal and their hostages are ready to leave the confines of the bank behind, we know more intimate details about every one of them (and, perhaps, ourselves as a society) than we ever could've guessed going in. Throwing out the script and using largely improvised dialog was a key decision, transforming a film that could have easily become a thin piece of exploitation into something much more vivid and real. It does slow down quite a bit just before the climax, but in the grand scheme that only adds more tension to the rapid-fire conclusion.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I was bored at times.The acting is flawless but you can't expect much else from the great Al Pacino, of course. The story was well thought out and portrayed and there were a lot of great action sequences.

Works so well on so many levels,"The robbery should have taken 10 minutes. 4 hours later, the bank was like a circus sideshow. 8 hours later, it was the hottest thing on live TV. 12 hours later, it was all history. And it's all true.This tagline says it all perfectly. In 1972 a bisexual man robbed a bank to pay for his gay lover's sex change. It should have gone smooth and simple but exploded into a media extravaganza that ended up taking twelve hours to get sorted out, just as the tagline states. Dog Day Afternoon is the film that came out of these events. Al Pacino plays Sonny Wortzik, the man robbing the bank with his friend Sal, played by the late and great John Cazale. The entirety of the movie is set during the robbery with no setup of the characters or backstory. Everything we need to know unfolds amidst the action. The movie is tremendous in its claustrophobic and limited setting in a small bank on a New York street corner.Al Pacino is the shining star of this film. He plays his character to perfection, and is absolutely fascinating and exciting to watch. I couldn't see anyone in this role except for the vulgar and fast talking Pacino. John Cazale as Sal is also an excellent casting decision, despite the fact he has few lines in the film. But what he does for the film is eerily excellent. Sal remains at a level of high strung paranoia the entire film, restoring its harrowing attitude when it starts to dwindle. Other major players include Charles Durning as the police chief who tries to subtly out wit Sonny throughout the movie, maintaining his calm and collected attitude so as not to stir up any unnecessary excitement from his armed counterpart. Chris Sarandon plays Leon, Sonny's gay lover who appears in one of the most intimate and sincere scenes of the entire film. Every bit of his scene had my eyes glued to the screen. It was one of the many places we got to see the different intensity levels of Sonny, who was loud and frightening in some scenes, then calm and sentimental in others. It all added to his perfect characterization.The entire cast of the bank, which includes the bank manager and a number of female bank tellers also do a fantastic job at driving the intimate character interaction at the heart of this film. Their response to the bank robbery is complete and utter cooperation, so as to protect their own lives. But as media attention grows around the robbery, they seize the opportunity for their own 15 minutes of fame, and even end up befriending Sonny who doesn't want to hurt anybody, he just wants money. It's a fascinating study of human interaction under extreme pressure that bares some interesting and even comical results when we see how the friendly relationship unfolds between Sonny and the teller girls. Then of course we see the reaction of the outside to this situation. Sonny becomes an instant draw of attention for anybody looking for some good reality television on a hot summer day in New York. But more interestingly, he even molds into a hero to the anti law enforcement advocates in the city who come to the robbery scene and cheer him on. People with all sorts of opposing opinions come to watch this robbery unfold, and it makes for a brilliantly played out character study.Fascinatingly enough, Dog Day Afternoon covers a lot of societal ground for being such a limited plot and setting. It deals with law enforcement influence, mainstream media and its effects on society, and even gay rights. The reveal that this tough bank robber is gay stirs up so much confusion in the accumulated crowd. There are people who immediately turn against Sonny when they learn this, but he also then inspires a whole other community, those who support gay rights and transexuality. As the movie unfolds Sonny's stardom branches to so many places, and the way we see him deal with it all is incredible, due to the fact that he is still worrying about how to get away with this bank robbery.Despite its limited resources, this movie stays very exciting the entire way through, and it was one of those movies where I was so drawn in by everything that was happening that I never wanted it to end. The film stems across so many different genres, and it all flows together so seamlessly. It begins as a typical heist film and develops into a smart crime thriller with some bits of comedy splashed in there, but never overplayed or forced. It then morphs into a deeply emotional drama at points as well as a sentimental and highly unconventional romance. It is amazing how well this blend of genres works in perfect motion together with no aspect of the film becoming overbearing. Everything comes together exquisitely, and I enjoy it all anymore.Dog Day Afternoon works as a character study, a crime thriller, and a drama. It is a fascinating story that covers so much ground, but doesn't force feed any one idea to you.

"Great editing, acting, and a sense of realism make this shine","(77%) One of the better bank robbery crime movies featuring Al Pacino in unstoppable form as the stressed-out thief with somewhat different intentions than the regular hold-up guy. The basic premise of bank robbery is a text book big Hollywood staple, and this looks and feels like a big Hollywood film; but it also has something extra that most movies of this type don't, which is that this actually happened, so there's a distinct element of realism running right the way through the entire film. It takes not very long at all to realise that Pacino and John Cazale aren't going to pull off the heist successfully, but this is still an engrossing watch that's well worth tracking down.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A surprising and entertaing masterpiece.,"This film is legendary, I have so much to say. First of all, the whole movie keeps you captivated because it so entertaining and you will never know what to expect next. Some scenes are comedic but some scenes can become quite dramatic and the mix between them is great. The acting from everyone is stellar and Al Pacino is so incredible and creative in this film. Lumet produces yet another great film. Overall, this film is by far one of my favorites and one of the most entertaining and fun movies ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Incredible Performances From Al Pacino and John Cazale, But Slightly Let Down By A Couple Plot Points","Pros:
1. The humour works to great effect, and it prevents the film from becoming too serious, whilst never becoming overbearing.
2. Al Pacino (Sonny), John Cazale (Sal), and Charles Durning (Moretti) give incredible performances.
3. The pacing is superb, and it never loses steam.
4. The movie really benefits from a scaled-back cinematography which allows the film to feel preponderantly more raw.
5. The lack of a soundtrack/ score helps to keep the movie grounded, and it adds a certain grittiness to the scenes.
6. The scope of the movie is truly impressive, especially considering its anchoring to one location for most of the run-time. The extras, also, really help to breathe life into the story.
7. The ending is beautifully tragic, and it miraculously entices the viewer to sympathise and empathise with Sonny and Sal, even though they're bank robbers who took hostages.Cons:
1. The tension is undercut as the hostages, as characters, are underdeveloped, and they never feel to be in any danger.
2. The sub-plot featuring Sonny's gay transgender husband, Leon (Chris Sarandon), just feels out-of-place and rather pointless.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Personal Favorite,"It's real cool that this film could even be made. There's not a lot of in-depth information about the incident, but they managed to make it a cohesive film. The longer you watch, the more amazed you get that it's a true story. Pacino has this skill to become a character and not himself. Several of his films get the treatment like this and this is one of them. He becomes Sonny. He has all the ticks, the mannerisms, and you feel like he's lived his whole life as the character. All of this film just works and you start to wonder how far they take it. My advice is don't look anything up while watching it. It's better without spoilers.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It's OK to be Gay! It's not OK to rob banks, though","""Dog Day Afternoon"" definitely belongs in the category of: ""this must be based on a true story, otherwise it's completely implausible"". The idea of a failed and amateurishly executed bank heist turning into an absurd media-circus and a giant metaphor for overkill situations in recent American history, I can still believe. But the crazy revelation that the whole scheme was thought up because money was needed for the sex-change operation of the homosexual robber's lover, well that is so surreal and far-fetched that it simply has to be true! If any aspiring scriptwriter would present this type of idea to a random producer, he/she wouldn't receive a single penny for it. But you know what? The biggest accomplishment of writer Frank Pierson, director Sidney Lumet and – of course – the phenomenal actor Al Pacino – is that they managed to keep the essence of the story rather small and personal. All the socially relevant themes are downgraded to mere sub plots while the private story of Sonny is gradually put forward. He's intelligent but insecure, anxiety-ridden and utterly self-destructive. The way Al Pacino depicts him is righteously referred to as one of the most powerful and persuasive performances in the history of cinema. John Cazale gives away a nearly as impressive performance as Sal, the somewhat simple but loyal partner-in-crime, although obviously less expressive and energetic than Pacino.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of AlPacino's Classics,This is a classic performance from AlPacino and his co-actor.

I watched this movie after watching the documentary Dog on the broader life of Sonny Wortzik. In the movie Dog Day Afternoon, Sonny (Al Pacino) needs some money so he goes to the source, the bank. In his head the plan was simple, he and his other two accomplices were going to go in and walk out with a cool stash but his plan got a bit murky. With the advantage of time for me, this film really captures the 1970s and it's a time capsule to the decade of my birth. The clothes, hair, and an attitude made me more curious of this broader bank heist. It is a heck of a story.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The last time I saw a movie this acidic was De Palma's Hi MOM!Once you've embraced the Al Pacino-esque villain, it's hard not to be mesmerized by his noblesse oblige performance, and of course Lumet's plotting here is a credit to the film, even if there are some structural problems such as the choices made in the second half of the film dragging on a bit, it's still a great opportunity to see the characters jump out of the pages of this fictionalized tale based on a magazine: Sarandon's homoeroticism is just right, Sonny's clowning around in front of thousands of cops and media (right in the middle of the craziness of the time), and the indoor performances at the expense of all the ""quiet"" scenes are accompanied by just the right amount of humor (Pacino holding a gun and being out of reach) and extremely intense theatrical performances.No soundtrack, two exteriors and one interior, great long takes, great performances, intense drama, and what Pauline Kael calls ""one of the best New York movies ever made"".",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I love his acting since the day I saw his masterpiece ""Scarface"". So when I started watching this movie I was thinking it would be like most of the other crime movies with some highly trained professionals and all, but I was wrong. This film showed a common man who tried to do what he is not trained for to help his friend with some money.This film is based on a true story.The movie also showed the behavior of society and people in conditions like bank robbery how they are influenced by television and media. Even though he just started at that time acting wise Al Pacino as always was superb next to scarface, godfather and scent of a woman. It showed his two faces of Al Pacino his good side and also the bad side. In short this is a great movie worth a watch. You won't be bored even for a moment. On top of that it will leave an impression on you about the good side of criminals and how situations change the mentality of a person.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A classic,"Dog Day Afternoon is another brilliant collaboration between director Sidney Lumet, and actor Al Pacino. The story's pretty simple, two guys rob a bank, something goes wrong and they're caught in a shitty situation with a ton of cops. The film's strong point is in it's characters.Al Pacino plays Sonny, a young guy who along with his partner, Sal execute a bank heist. The cops get wise to what's going on and a job that should have taken ten minutes goes from the afternoon and long into the night.Based on a true story, this film makes you root for the bank robbers. Without glorifying what they're doing, Lumet is able to show a sympathetic side to the criminals.One of Pacino's best performances, this film is a must see for any crime film fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant,"No one handles drama in confined spaces, conveys New York atmosphere, or directs actors better than Sidney Lumet. This fascinating, suspenseful film was one of the two masterworks of screenwriter Frank Pierson (see ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967)). The casting and performances are wonderful. Based on a true story makes it an even greater challenge. It is, by turns, comic, tragic, and, simultaneously comic and tragic. Coming off macho roles in ""The Godfather"" (1972) and ""The Godfather, Part II"" (1974), many actors might have balked at playing a confused, bumbling homosexual, but Al Pacino rose to the occasion brilliantly. Viewing this movie is the least expensive visit to New York City that you'll ever take.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I love it!,"Sonny, played by Al Pacino, is in constant motion throughout the entire film, desperately trying to avert disaster. His manically anxious performance evokes the essence of New York City. Even when he is standing still, his eyes are darting around the room, looking for the next inevitable problem. The combination of Sonny's can-do initiative and why-me? Futility reads very specifically NYC to me. The film's matter-of-fact acceptance of gender dysphoria, which was barely acknowledged publicly at the time, also feels very NYC. The character of Leon is not reduced to a cheap punchline, and even the police take this development largely in stride. Lumet deserves enormous credit for creating this vibe by shooting the film's first half almost in real time. The camera is mobile but not flashy, always in the right place at the right time. Dede Allen's measured pace allows plenty of breathing room, making sudden deviations from that aesthetic really count. The ending is frustrating as it feels unnecessarily beholden to the real-life story and detached from the anti-authoritarian dynamic that fuels most of the movie. Dog Day Afternoon imposes an abrupt ending as soon as we know everyone's fate, which could be my pet peeve. However, the sheer blunt finality of that denouement did make me experience a little frisson.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Certainly not a 'dog's dinner',"Perhaps if you sat down to watch 'Dog Day Afternoon' you may come away claiming that it's totally unbelievable to be a good film. I might have done if it weren't for the fact that I was alerted to it being based on a true story by someone else. It's about a bank robbery in the seventies that was carried out in broad daylight. It's safe to say that it would be a pretty bland film if everything went according to plan. However, in this case, nothing went according to plan and it was a total mess from beginning to end. That's what makes it such a damn good film (well, that and Al Pacino).
Pacino plays the lead robber (well, out of the two of them) who managed to bungle his way through raiding a bank and taking hostages at the same time. Of course his ineptitude means that the police have plenty of time to show up and Pacino is forced to hold out in the bank with little idea of how to escape a secure building surrounded by marksmen. The film clearly rests on his shoulders and, as the majority of his performances show, he can more than handle the responsibility (which is probably more than can be said for his character!). He clearly enjoyed himself on set and much of the dialogue ended up being improvised as he almost becomes institutionalised over the period of a matter of hours, before almost succumbing to the brief stint as 'minor celebrity' that his dodgy deed affords him. There are a few twists and turns which I won't go into for fear of giving plot points away, although I will say that it's an interesting commentary on the issues of the time and would be equally interesting if something like this happened today - I'm guessing plenty of #bankheists would be posted from bemused onlookers. 
If you're in any way a fan of bank robbery/heist movies, or just a fan of Al Pacino then you really have to watch this. It is a little long and may have benefitted from a harsher editor here and there, but apart from that, it stands the test of time.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great movie with a well-paced storyline,"It's a psychological crime drama set in Brooklyn, New York, during a 14-hour bank robbery/hostage-taking on August 22/23, 1972. It is based on a report about that crime in ""Life"" magazine a month later. The film altered many of the actual names.Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino), Sal Naturile (John Cazale), and Stevie Westenberg (Gary Springer) try to rob a Brooklyn bank. Sonny is a complex, sometimes erratic, Vietnam War vet with a wife, Angie (Susan Peretz), two children, and a transgender husband, Leon Shermer (Chris Sarandon), who needs money for sex reassignment surgery. Sal is a petty criminal determined not to return to prison. They assume the bank has just received a sizeable amount of money, not realizing that an armored char has already picked up most of it.""Dog Day Afternoon"" follows events after the police have surrounded the bank, and Sonny and Sal take the bank employees as hostages, including Manager Mulvaney (Sully Boyar) and Chief Teller Sylvia Ball (Penelope Allen), and eight others. Stevie chickened out and escaped just when the robbery began. Sergeant Moretti (Charles Durning) negotiates with Sonny by phone and in person while moody Sal guards the hostages. Eventually, FBI agent Sheldon (James Broderick) takes charge. Sonny's mother (Judith Malina) and both of Sonny's spouses speak to him. Sonny also enjoys the live news coverage that gives him a public stage to rant about things like the previous year's riots at Attica. Negotiations finally lead to an arranged trip to JFK Airport for Sonny and Sal to escape, but there is a final confrontation at the airport.""Dog Day Afternoon"" is a great movie with a well-paced storyline. Pacino is excellent as a borderline personality that wavers between cunning and self-delusion. However, I wish Cazale, who is one great character actor, had been given a better-developed character.Then there's the reality of the movie. The timelines are accurate, but most of the dialogue is pure fiction. The bank manager tipped off his head office, leading to the police's quick arrival. Negotiation leadership by a police sergeant is unrealistic and untrue; the FBI led from the beginning. Sonny had been divorced from his wife long before he met Leon. Sal was actually an 18-year-old kid. The movie says it was a terribly hot August day; the actual temperature reached a maximum of 80 F. If the screenwriters had stuck to the ""Life"" article, they would have had just as good a movie. Instead, they created a good story that wasn't very true.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of the great movies of all time.,"Great performances are all over the place here. This is a tour-de-force for Pacino, even by his standards, as the bungling crook who has instantly become the biggest media star in the city. There are more twists and turns we won't go into here. This is a great work by Pacino, Lumet, and most of the other actors in the film. I loved it.Pacino's performance is exceedingly excellent, manic and energetic. He'd display this same talent in ""Scarface"" again eight years later; only he would be bashed by the critics for going over-the-top. (Although they really just had problems with the excessive profanity and violence, just like Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" will soon become a well-known classic and people will laugh when they hear that someone once called it the most violent film ever made.)In a nutshell I would say that it is one of the great movies of all time. Anyone who calls himself a movie buff, this movie is a must watch for him.This amazing film somehow manages to capture the dense texture of real life. Improvisational acting, no artificial lighting, no costumes or makeup other than what was essential to the character, and no musical score help make it that way. So do intense performances from Al Pacino, John Cazale, and Charles Durning. Frank Pierson's screenplay was well-constructed, although 60% of the dialogue was improvised. It allowed room for moving drama, so-surreal-it-could-only-happen-in-real-life comedy, and quite a bit of suspense.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lumet and Pacino DELIVER,"Where to begin? Lumet's direction is as strong as ever, Pacino gives a masterclass in energy infused mania, Cazale steals scenes with very few lines, the story is always gripping. This is just a well crafted film on all fronts that never lets the audience have a break (maybe besides that awesome Elton John opening song). I love films that take place in NY and this is undoubtedly one of the better ones. Really loved the texture brought out from the fact that Lumet shoots on location in Brooklyn. This movie is unforgettable, and I will be sure to revisit it every once in awhile. ""ATTICA!!!! ATTICA!!!!""",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Bank robbery - reality TV style,"A unique and deeply emotional drama, which shows a bank robbery gone awry. The movie's great tension comes from the fact that even though it has a time span of only few hours, the mood changes constantly as the exposure of the character's inner fears and needs gradually comes to fruition. Al Pacino is great as the clumsy, yet determined bank robber, who became sort of a celebrity through all his wrongdoings. While the robbery doesn't go as planned, Sonny slowly shows his true self, as his insatiable desire to become a star exceeds the urge to steal the money. Unfortunately, his friend Sam isn't as strong and charismatic. He starts to crack, and feels weaker and weaker every minute, and wants for this nightmare to end. And it ends, but not nearly as perfect as the boys imagined. A clever play on clichés, with an emphasis put on the society's reaction to a horrible event, which actually comes as more entertaining that harrowing in the final evaluation. An iconic movie, supported by electrifying performances by Al Pacino and John Cazale. A bank robbery that turned out to be a reality show for the masses. Intriguing.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
What an afternoon this turned out to be,"What a dog day afternoon this turned out to be, even simple job like robbing a bank can go in so many unexpected directions A very young Al Pacino in a true story about a man Sonny robbing a bank in New York City 1972 holding hostages only to have the whole plan go astray. It even garners the attention of the media lasting 14 hours. The FBI steps in to address the crisis. The situation keeps changing as the day goes by, it appears that Sonny didn't think this all the way through. At one point his mother gets wind of the whole thing and tries to appeal to him. The plot thickens as one of Sonny's closest friends ends up sharing eye opening information to the police force. This makes it more clear why he needs the money badly. Even during this holdup the movie finds an unexpected hero in Sonny being as flexible as he can. He's an anti-hero but also a human being like any of us. This was the quintessential 1970s movie since it reflected the tipping-point anxieties of battle-scarred and pissed-off Americans at the mid-decade mark. They even referenced the Attica 1972 prison riot that left 43 people dead. It bottled the mood of a nation, as cynicism became a normal way of life. Even a Vietnam vet can get backed into a corner when the country itself has failed and discarded him. Director Sidney Lumet crafts a tense movie and a surprisingly sympathetic anti-hero.

A fantastic film,"Lumet has never been constrained by the demands of genre, and just as Serpico was far more character piece than thriller, as Dog Day Afternoon is more drama than comedy. Pacino's passionate performance is awe inspiring stuff, not only does he have the conviction and passion to deliver a performance that feels like a real man, but as in Serpico, he fully embraces the real life character on screen. The drama is thoroughly involving, as Sonny becomes an icon of rebellion and a symbol of the power of the common man as the media circus unfolds, and the bank robbers situation becomes more and more certain. The Cinematography is dull, as frankly all of Lumet's films are, but the performances are spellbinding. Overlong, underwritten and visually staid, it is still a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Wild Ride Through Chaos,"If you're looking for a classic film that blends tension, hilarity, and a touch of heart, Dog Day Afternoon is an absolute must-watch. This 1975 classic, directed by Sidney Lumet and starring young Al Pacino, is based on a true story that'll keep you glued to your seat and constantly guessing what will come next.First of all, Pacino absolutely kills it as Sonny, the hapless bank robber who just wanted to get a little cash to help out his partner. But what starts as a straightforward heist quickly spirals into chaos, and you find yourself rooting for this chaotic mess of a character. Pacino's energy is infectious, and you can't help but feel for him as he tries to navigate the madness that unfolds. The setting is quintessentially gritty, with the whole movie taking place over the course of a single day. The way Lumet captures the tense atmosphere outside the bank and the emotional turmoil inside is gripping. You can practically feel the sweat and desperation radiating from the screen. The supporting cast is fantastic, too. They each bring a unique flavor to the story, from the hostages trying to cope with their bizarre predicament to the cops who are just trying to manage a situation that's quickly getting out of hand.One of the things I loved most about the film is how it keeps you on your toes. Just when you think you know where it's headed, it throws in unexpected twists that make you rethink everything. And it's not just about the heist, but also explores themes of love, identity, and the struggles of the everyday person. You'll find yourself laughing one minute and holding your breath the next. Plus, the 70s vibe is just so nostalgic. The fashion, the music-it all adds a layer of charm that makes it even more enjoyable. It's a snapshot of a different time, and as modern as it feels with its raw emotionality, there's something timeless about the story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Attica! Attica!""","Seventies classic ""Dog Day Afternoon"" recounts the true story of a failed bank robbery that took place in Brooklyn on August 22, 1972. Small-time crooks Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) & Sal Naturile (John Cazale) get caught in the act and end up taking the bank's employees hostage. As the situation builds to a media frenzy Sonny tries to bargain with the authorities, who have their own ideas about ending the standoff.Unsurprisingly, the script deviates from fact somewhat but it still maintains a sense of authenticity. The real-life Sonny was already an intriguing character and the commotion surrounding the event makes for compelling cinema. Screenwriter Frank Pierson ended up taking home the Oscar for best original screenplay, though I'm not sure why it wasn't in the adapted screenplay category since the story was based on a Life magazine article. In any case, the film was a deserving winner.As for the acting, Al Pacino delivered one of the best performances of his career and was justly rewarded with an Oscar nomination. Chris Sarandon snagged another well-deserved nomination in support while John Cazale and Charles Durning also turned in standout supporting performances. Meanwhile, the remainder of the cast is consistently dependable.Sidney Lumet's Oscar-nominated direction is, in a word, impressive. Most of the action is tied to one location but he keeps the narrative flowing with a documentary-style approach. Editor Dede Allen (who also received an Oscar nomination) also deserves credit for this. Musically, the film is pretty sparse, featuring an Elton John tune over the opening credits and little (if anything) else besides. However, this relative lack of music suits the picture.In conclusion, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" grabs the viewer's attention early on and doesn't let go until the closing scene. The fine writing, acting and direction made it worthy of its Best Picture Oscar nomination in 1975 and it remains as vibrant today as it was thirty-six years ago.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brooklyn is Burning,"""Dog Day Afternoon"" is the more-or-less true story of an inept Brooklyn bank robbery by Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale). The robbery is comically inept from the start, with a third accomplice getting cold feet and leaving, and Sonny's massive bag for the cash dwarfing the few thousand dollars the bank has in the vault, as the mid-day pickup has occurred already. After starting a fire to burn records of the traveler's checks they're stealing, neighboring business owners are tipped off and the chaos begins.This is definitely a movie about chaos. A crowd gathers to enjoy the drama, at first cheering on Sonny as he famously chants ""Attica! Attica!"". The movie is about so much more than just an inept bank robbery, as clearly we are seeing a society in confused, quasi-rebellion against corrupt authority, but as in real life, the rage in this movie doesn't really go anywhere, with the crowd more interested in cheap thrills than politics. The media is on hand in droves, turning the standoff into the night's feature entertainment for the entire city, especially once they learn that Sonny was married to a woman-in-a-man's body by a defrocked priest. The crowd turns to homophobia and gay liberation protesters show up as darkness falls on the scene.Meanwhile, Sonny is manic as he tries to keep his hostages in check, manage the emotions of his dim-witted accomplice Sal, negotiate with police for a helicopter and jet to the tropics, or maybe Algeria (or Wyoming). He also has to deal with no less than both his wives and his mother, in conversations that in a darkly funny way show that even amid a hostage standoff his basic problems with the people in his life are inescapable.The movie is shot in a cinema verite style aside from a musical intro, with no background music. It is effective for the most part. I found that the movie drags as it goes on, unfortunately, especially over the very long phone conversation between Sonny and his new wife. The movie starts out so wildly unconventional, based on perhaps the most preposterous bank robbery ever committed, but its ending seems to be done more in the style of a typical crime film of the 1970s. Perhaps that is how events really unfolded, but I found the way it was presented to not quite live up to the film's tremendous start.This is nevertheless definitely a film worth watching, it is as quintessentially a movie of 1970s New York as Taxi Driver or anything by Woody Allen. It is also one of Pacino's greatest performances, and some of Lumet's best work.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Something Special,"It's rare that a performance such as Al Pacino's Sonny Wortzik in this film is matched. Others like Jack Nicholson's Randall McMurphy in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest or Heath Ledger's The Joker in The Dark Knight give young actors a chance to prove themselves and show exactly what great talent they possess.Dog Day Afternon is about a young bisexual man Sonny(Al Pacino)and his friend Sal (John Cazale) who try to rob a bank to get the money for Sonny's male lover for his sex-change operation. However, things get out of hand when the police get involved and surround the bank with armed gunmen.The film's most famous sequence shows Sonny walking up and down the pavement unarmed with policeman all around screaming ""Attica! Attica!"". Attica in question is a prison where, according to the main character, guards killed at least 100 people, innocent and guilty.This movie certainly is very different from other Al Pacino movies in the 70s (With the exception of the two Godfathers) and the direction from Sydney Lumet is very well structured.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Dog Days of the 1970's,"IMDb Top 250: 180Dog Day Afternoon is a unique film. It's a heist movie, but a special kind of heist movie. There are no gritty stand-offs; this is a smart, tell-it-like-it-was kind of film, and it can seems a little silly at times. That's because it actually was silly at times. The summary almost reads off like the start of a joke: 'So a gay man walks into a bank...' In real life, Sonny (real name John) robbed a bank to pay for his lover's sex change operation. I won't spoil anymore, because spoiling the truth is spoiling the movie.The direction is perfect. The tone of the film is almost light-hearted: Sonny fumbles his gun, one crook cracks... it reminds me of Goodfellas in a sense that while not being funny, you can't help but smile.A big part of this is Sonny. Al Pacino, in one of his best (unfortunately underrated) roles, play the rookie bank robber AMAZINGLY. When you look at great actors, it's easy to say ""Oh yeah, he is the character, he's real good"" but here it's incredible. His eyes, facial expressions, the way he walks and talks, its an absolute sell. You feel for him, all he wants is to help someone he loves but things just went to #%@*. He's the best part of the film.Everyone else does their job, but are unfortunately in the same movie as Al Pacino. Sal isn't a lovable guy, he's kind of dumb (Wyoming) and a follower. He could've been fleshed out a little more.One thing of interest is the crowd. If you are like me and like to know NOTHING going into your films, skip this paragraph. If you've done even a little reading, you know Sonny is gay. I did not, which is why it was a little surprising, but then not: he subtly conveys it throughout the film. I found it interesting to see the crowd's love of Sonny before the reveal, including the small things like flipping off the officers, as well as cheering for him. But after they learn, there's more subtle movements: you can here ""He's a queer?"" in an offensive tone, as well as see members of the crowd doing a ""package-grab"" gesture in the background as Sonny pats down the FBI agent. Seeing this in 2011, it's an interesting time capsule, seeing the social norms of the 70's towards a gay man. He's a hero if he's straight, but just a gay man if he's gay.Dog Day Afternoon is a really good film, highlighted by great directing and a very strong lead that makes everyone weak in comparison. It's also a time capsule to when things were different, in the long-ago time of... the 70's. 8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Amazing cautionary tale of a miscalculated bank robbery.,"The best thing this film has to offer is, undoubtedly, Al Pacino's authentic performance, and his very well-written character, Sonny Wortzik. ALTHOUGH, the best part is also the cause of the worst: next to Pacino MOST other performances felt mundane. There were important scenes, while still great, would've been far more impactful had both actors been on the same level, rather than just being carried by one.Now I did emphasize ""most"", because there was an exception: Mulvany played by Sully Boyar. Boyar delivered a solid supporting performance, and while others beside Pacino felt bland, Boyar was able to play off of him very well and vice versa; The acting and dialogue during their intense confrontation scenes were Electrifying! -- Not really important, but Boyar was totally snubbed. Chris Sarandon (Leon) was okay (I guess), but he was not worthy of a Best Supporting Actor nom, Boyar was though.--Anyways, in addition to Pacino's and Boyar's great performances, the film is successful at getting you to understand the criminals. By showing you Sonny's struggles, altruism, and possible mental disorder (PTSD), you're able to sympathize with, worry, and in a way root for him. There were moments throughout the film where I found myself actually becoming annoyed with the police's slick attempts at trying to capture Sonny, AND THEY'RE THE GOOD GUYS! More credit needs to be given to Sidney Lumet, whose craftsmanship was Excellent! Every new complication that arose felt organic, the developed relationship between the hostages and robbers felt believable, and the characters actions felt reasonable; nothing felt contrived.So, aside from a few uninspired performances, this film is pretty freakin' fantastic. While other bank robbery films make robbing banks out to be sexy, it's pretty refreshing and unique, to me at least, to see how one can go wrong. It's a pretty great deterrent.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Landmark in Bank Robbery Amateur History,"In 1972, a Brooklyn bank robbery and hostage situation from low criminals John Wojtowicz and Salvatore Naturile failed catastrophically and was chronicled in Life magazine. Fast forward to three years later when a film inspired by the events took place (albeit with creative liberties) entitled Dog Day Afternoon, starring Al Pacino and John Cazale as the main robbers and directed by acclaimed dramatic filmmaker Sidney Lumet, and the result was a critical and commercial darling. To this day, the film remains culturally and historically significant for its anti-authoritarian take on the establishment, as well as its LGBTQ themes.The film follows an amateur crook named Sonny Wortzik (Pacino) and his friend Sal Naturile (Cazale) as they attempt to rob a bank and run out with all the money. Unfortunately, everything that could possibly go wrong goes haywire as their heist generates enough buzz to bring in multiple voices on the scene. With the scenario of a bank robbery going from bad to worse in a matter of one day, the film becomes quite a gripping case of survival of the thickest (brain wise). Given how many people end up being involved in this disaster, from the held hostages inside the bank to the police to even familial acquaintances of Sonny himself, the tone can get very paranoid and anxiety-inducing in the blink of an eye. The lack of experience Sonny and Sal have in robberies is shown through hysterical banter between them and their held captives, aided by some appropriately stressed performances from Pacino and Cazale from their facial expressions alone. More often than not, when a failed heist occurs, the most relatable aspect is seeing the tension rise from those who started it in the first place.As for what kinds of obstacles our antiheroes have to face, the police and relatives of Sonny make one wonder who the real antagonists are supposed to be. While the cops represent the moral conflict that will come from attempting such a big crime, they also reflect the scapegoats and monsters common in the grander scheme of societal realism and economic decline, which is both applauded and ranted on ih the film. Given the dire situation Sonny and Sal end up in out of their other personal problems, they are seen as both icons for the anti-establishment rebels and devils for how low they would sink just to help themselves out. The held hostages themselves are hilarious examples of both sides, in which they only interact with the robbers out of their own will while also understanding the pain and torment they're all going through. It doesn't help that the people Sonny knows personally, from his estranged wife to his transitioning partner, are all suffering in their own way and they count on Wortzik to actually do what's right for once. Conflict over resolution is all that comes up.On an added note, the choice to not have a score accompany the feature was a brilliant choice on the filmmaker's part to allow the story to speak for itself. Where most heist capers today would have even their quietest scenes have some unneeded background music or even some catchy jazz song played here and there, this film respects its audience enough to follow the storyline concisely; it also adds to the crazy tension as well. Although the editing is pretty routine for the type of heist flick this is, it can occasionally become quick paced and sporadic to aid a given scene with tons of craziness happening all around. On a side note, the added addition of news reported videography makes the film feel far more accurate than it already is, displaying what the untrained viewer at home might witness instead of the people witnessing the event live. While there are a lot more highly intense crime thrillers out there with a heavier emphasis on the editing and action, this film is secure enough in its presentation to let the case play on its own and leave it up for viewer interpretation.With a strong blend of the horrid reality and relatable characters, Dog Day Afternoon deserves all the recognition and acclaim it's received. After almost 50 years in the spotlight, the film remains a staple of modern tensions over law, media, society and even sexuality, and it might be one of the quintessential Pacino flicks out there as well. If you're yet to check it out, by all means give it a watch, but understand that what you're getting into is a cinematic classic less for its filmmaking ambitions and more so for its social commentary. In today's era of anti-establishment rebellion, this film has aged like fine wine.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

How could I have missed this ?,"This was such an enjoyable movie to watch. Superb acting. After I watched the movie I did some research on the events it was based upon and found out that it was highly accurate. Something you would doubt when watching this story evolve.

Certified classic,"A bank robbery that devolves from comic disaster to full-blown hostage crisis, Dog Day Afternoon is kind of a weird ride. It's not just a crime thriller but also a social comment on poverty, the disenfranchised and abusive police. It also sags in the middle, which would normally be a negative, but one I can easily overlook because the film's benefits are so damn good.From minute one, you can feel the hot summer atmosphere just as much as Al Pacino's clear-as-day exhaustion. From what I've read, there was a good deal of improv on the set and that adds to the overall unpredictability; these are scripted characters but they don't fit neatly into boxes. The onlooking crowd will root for Pacino as a populist hero one minute and then turn to jeering the next; the bank employees go from victimized to moralizing; and then there's the enlightened matter-of-fact handling of gay characterization. Fifty years ago? I have to commend the filmmakers on that, no question.Dog Day Afternoon is an excellent drama, hugely benefiting from acting and direction. The question of how it will all end burns for much of the running time; and the final ten minutes, from motorcade to tarmac, is a nail-biter.This is Lumet in the '70s and it is terrific.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Committed Performance By Al Pacino!,"I have a confession to make. As I was watching Dog Day Afternoon for this review, I realized my DVD copy was scratched and it would not play the last half of the movie. But luckily, I have seen this movie before and I am fortunate enough to remember how the movie ended. Both times I watched the film, I enjoyed it very much. Given the talent behind and in front of the camera, that comes to me as no surprise. Sidney Lumet is a very talented director who directed incredible films such as 12 Angry Men and Serpico. Lumet reunites with his Serpico star Al Pacino to create a very fine portrayal of a real-life story about a Brooklyn bank robbery. The film is more subtle and quiet when compared to other Lumet films, but the film has an unexpected lighter tone. The film has some funny lines and I was surprised how much I laughed given the subject matter, but then I realized Lumet was not trying to make a serious film. The thematic issue of gay marriage gave the movie a political edge which also surprised me. I was expecting a straightforward movie about a bank robbery, but I got something more in-depth. There is motivation behind what the characters do and that caused me to sympathize with them, despite robbing a bank and holding people hostage. You may have figured by now, but I really enjoyed this film very much.Believe it or not, but this story is based off real events which occurred at the Chase Manhattan Bank in Brooklyn, New York in 1972. The bank was held up by this gay man named Sonny (Al Pacino) and his dim-witted crime partner Sal (John Cazale) in order to get money to pay for Sonny's partner sex change operation. The manager and tellers agree to cooperate with Sonny, but things go south when Sonny realizes there is not anything to steal because the money has been packed up for the day. When Sonny gets in contact with Police Captain Moretti (Charles Durning), he gets nervous when he realizes the entire bank is surrounded by cops. Now he must negotiate a way to get what he wants without compromising the safety of everyone in the bank.Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors of all-time. He commits to every single role of his, even if the movie stinks. Obviously, this is not a stinker but it is impressive to see Pacino so committed to this role. I loved his performances in the two Godfather movies and Serpico. So it comes to no surprise I am impressed with this performance. This time around he brings an edge of comedy to his performance and it works spectacularly. The scene where he is being live broadcasted and he skips around in happiness telling people he's a star, that was a wonderful but funny scene. John Cazale does a fine job as Sal. I felt Sal's character goes hand-in-hand with John's character in The Godfather, but regardless it was still a fine performance. Charles Durning plays it tough as the NYPD captain as he should because it easily fits his persona. Finally, Chris Sarandon as Sonny's lover Leon does a fine job in his small role-a role that got him nominated for an Oscar.I thought it was interesting about the political angle given to this movie. Gay marriage would not be a major political issues until many years after the release of this film, but it was interesting to see the viewpoint of the movie given how gay marriage was frowned upon during this era. The movie played the sympathy cards for Sonny and Leon and it gave a motivation for Sonny's actions. The movie does not revile Sonny, but instead it makes him a deeply-flawed character.Overall, Dog Day Afternoon is a excellent movie. It has committed performances by everyone, especially by Pacino. Sadly, Pacino still did not receive an Oscar up to this point despite being nominated for every movie he was in until 1975 including this one. Sidney Lumet continues to bring his style into all of his films. I love Lumet because like auteurs like Scorsese and Allen, many of his films are about New York. Each individual brings something to their films about the great city of New York and they make these films even more interesting to watch. I like the way Lumet turned the film from just an ordinary crime film to a film that is intelligent, creative, and still fun to watch. This is another impressive film on the resume for Sidney Lumet and Al Pacino.My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Even 50 Years Later, this Classic Amazes","How often do we assume we know where a story is heading, and how rarely does that story deliver legitimate shock and awe? Dog Day Afternoon is a movie that left me shaking my head in disbelief so many times I lost count.Directed in a matter-of-fact documentary style because the story needs no artificial dramatization, the movie never fails to remain transfixing. No soundtrack or score plays aside from the opening credits. Natural sound is all we hear. Save for a few Pacino scenes, every performance is subdued. The raw sequence of events provides all the necessary juice. The feat becomes more remarkable if you pull back and thoroughly examine the movie's construction and achievements. It's like being enthralled by a Wikipedia article.That's certainly not to suggest Dog Day Afternoon is devoid of feeling. The characters all present as real people with real and really human reactions. Pacino (Sonny) takes us on a journey as his character attempts to control the situation that quickly derails when the robbery attempt hits its first bump. He had zero contingencies built into his plan that was woefully underprepared. This plan needed to be 30 pages long, but Sonny only wrote two.Despite the unrelenting stress and dripping sweat, he remains cordial to the hostages and the police. He seems like a decent guy, likeable, even. But he lives with a darkness likely stemming from Vietnam-related trauma. Unsurprisingly, the robbery was not the first of Sonny's anti-social behavior.In addition to Pacino's work, one of the film's greatest strengths is its representation of a media circus, rapidly shifting and divided public views, and a thirst for fame. I don't know of a more prescient depiction of 2024 from nearly 50 years prior. The only thing missing is the smartphones.There are certain movies people will say movie fans need to watch before they die. Some of those have deteriorated with age. Some have been surpassed by more recent imitators. And some transcend time and remain essential. Consider Dog Day Afternoon a movie that belongs in the latter group.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Prerapare To Be Wowed,"Dog Day Afternoon is one of 70's best movie. Legendary Actor Al Pacino Plays the tough role of Sonny, One of the most weird yet interesting Characters of all time.

Sidney Lumet is at his best in this movie. He directed the movie beautifully. The cast was also perfect for their roles. Whether it was Charles Durning as Moretti or Carol Kane as Jenny. As for the Performance Al Pacino never let's his viewers down when he is given a proper role. Al Pacino Played his Role Perfectly, and So did John Cazale. I cannot imagine anyone except for AL AND JOHN As Sonny and Sal. It's a must see for those who know the real value of a masterpiece, and this one won't let you down",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Barking dogs seldom bite,"When you love somebody, you do everything you can to make them happy; you may end relationships with others who feel strongly about or go to the extreme of robbing a bank, just to see them smile. It is unfortunate that sometimes, these things that we assume might make a loved one happy are not really what they are looking for. Sonny clearly thought that Leon would see his efforts and perhaps take their relationship to another level. Poor Sonny-his master plan ends up in a series of tragic mistakes. The producers did a great job with the over view of New York in the beginning which orients the viewer with the Brooklyn community as it was in 1972.We also see a dog eating out of garbage bags during what seems to be an afternoon. The dog represents what Sonny's life has now come to. Sonny is unemployed and resorts to bank robbery. The movie also has a lot of firsts; for example, Sonny is a first time robber at First Brooklyn Savings Bank. This movie was also one of the first to deal with trans-gender issues. Whereas I knew that issues involving trans-gender and homosexuality are controversial, I didn't know that these same problems existed even in the 70's. The 1970s was a time when women's rights were starting to be redefined and when they started to experience the kind of freedom they had never enjoyed before. This movie shows the freedoms through the use of female bank tellers. The women also take on their typical roles as care takers by trying to stick together and take care of each other. Likewise the men assume their typical roles as heads/ leaders. This is shown not only by through the bank manager and the office guard, but also through the phone call that was received by one of the bank tellers from her husband, wondering when she would be back home. There are several signs in the bank saying things like, ""All-purpose loans"" and ""Change your vacation dreams"". These signs symbolize the dreams that Sonny and Sal have for a better life. But the irony is that these dreams and hopes are being advertised in a neighborhood that is not at its best. The crowd is able to connect with Sonny because they all experience the same challenges in their lives. Even if Sonny is the one holding the gun right now, it could have been any of them in this situation. Sonny excites the crowd when he starts to yell, ""Attica! Attica! "" Attica was a prison in New York where a riot was staged by prisoners who were furious about the poor conditions under which they were living. During this riot the police retaliated with extreme violence. Sonny therefore refers to Attica to draw the crowd to his side. Like many films in the 1970s, Dog Day Afternoon depicts the challenges that ordinary citizens had with those in authority. The journalists covering the story of the bank robbery seem to avoid the real issues of the problems people in Brooklyn are facing and the truth is often ""sugar coated"" for the public. This is seen when Sonny is being interviewed on television and when he starts to challenge the reporter, he is cut from the show. The crowd outside is also seen to mimic the officers as if to show that they are mere puppets to the authorities. There is good use of special camera effects when Sonny shoots the back window of the bank- the cameras shift from one scene to another, showing the ongoing chaos and panic and creating a mood filled with tension and suspense, which makes the event seem more vivid, especially for those that actually know what happened on that fateful day.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Al Pacino at his Best,"Watching this film, i finally understood why Al Pacino has earned a spot in the pantheon of great actors.He inhabits his role so deeply that the movie making spell is never broken. You always believe and you feel sorry for him too. Its in moments like this when films or literature hold you in a spell that you know something magical is at work. Pacino never slips out of his role and just keeps on giving with his acting. Surrounded by a good cast with actors like Charles Dunning this is a good movie, though it is more about his performance than an incredible plot.I would just add that for modern times it is a bit slow; if the movie came out today, they would have cut a half hour of footage. Then again, this movie wouldn't come out today. The other interesting thing about this movie is how it straddles the line between drama and comedy with all the nebbishy characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One Of Al Pacinos Best Movies,"Story: Based on a true story. Two men attempt to rob a bank that turns into a hostage situation.Review: Now in my opinion I think this movie started Al Pacino's career as a movie actor. What I love about this movie is how the film has a lot comedy in it and there's a great twist in the story. The acting is terrific. Pacino and Cazale have great chemistry working together. Also the film seems like it's making fun of how the media acts. The story is also very intense because you never know what's going to happen to the robbers or hostages. I think this is probably one of the best movies that was made in the 70's. Everything in this movie is perfect from the acting, story, and the dialogue between Pacino and the cops which is very good.

A masterclass bank heist movie.,"I watched this film as part of my weekly online film club. The movie is about 3 amateur bank robbers looking to rob a bank. The task should have been simple: Go in, take the money, and walk out. But everything that can go wrong does go wrong.It's amazing how well this movie holds up 50 years later and the subject matter is handled very sensitively considering the time period of the 70s. Al Pacino shows that he wasn't just a one hit wonder with the ""Godfather"" movies. It really shows the grittiness of what it was like being in New York in the 70s. This is one of Syndey Lumet's best films and one of the best of the 70s. It's a masterclass in character study and how to make a compelling film set in a single location.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The truly scary part of this movie?,"It really happened. It's been years since I've seen it, but I remember the incident -- and for a really weird reason. Because the guy Al Pacino plays spent most of that afternoon on the phone with one of the DJs at the radio station I listened to from middle school through after graduating from college and until I got married and moved out of state. I can't remember now whether that's in the film or not (it's literally been DECADES since I've seen it) -- but I was looking up Pacino in another context and this one came to mind. And it all came flooding back to me from half a century ago, with the bank robber on the phone with Scott Muni at the old WNEW-FM in NYC, and me at home up at the top end of Westchester County, listening to the conversation and suddenly realizing that it was NOT a put-on. That it was really happening and some guy in a bank holdup gone wrong was on the phone talking to a DJ on what was at the time my favorite station (and the DJ played what is now one of my favorite songs of all time -- the first time I ever heard it -- a year or so later). And I remember being both fascinated and completely creeped out by what, in retrospect, was a bizarre and yet banal conversation.And for the moron who thought the movie was ""boring"" and only gave it 1 star?

One of Pacino's Best and the Best Bank Heist Movie Ever.,"Some heist classics include Inside Man, Entrapment, and The Thomas Crown Affair. Dog Day Afternoon tops those.The Godfather showed the world how Al Pacino was. Serpico showed that he the man. The Godfather Part II showed the Pacino was the best. Although Pacino has never topped Serpico or the second Godfather movie, Dog Day Afternoon certainly comes close.Al Pacino plays Sonny and John Cazale play his buddy, Sal. They plan to rob a new bank in New York to pay for a sex-change operation for Sonny's lover. The robbery was supposed to have taken just ten minutes, but one thing leads to another and the heist becomes a media sensation. Sonny and Sal demand for them to be taken to Canada on a plane so nothing bad can happen to them.I would call Sonny Pacino's third best character after Frank Serpico and Michael Corleone. He is funny, bizarre, determined, likable, headstrong, all-around deep. As the day progresses and stress grows, the viewer will be found rooting for Sonny and Sal, hoping they make it to Canada safely. Powerful acting and lots of suspense lead the movie to it's nerve-racking ending.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Reinventing the Wheel,"Dog Day Afternoon may not have invented the wheel for the heist genre, but it certainly reinvents the wheel for what makes a compelling protagonist.Having watched Dog Day Afternoon for the first time in 2021, the characterization feels very modern. Too modern. Sonny is a character that defies genre and cinematic norms. Al Pacino's genius acting sends the character into the stratosphere in that regard. Not the bumbling fool, not the sympathetic case, not the hearthrob hero, he exists somewhere in between all three at once and outside of all three at the same time. You want him to succeed because he's relatable, and he's relatable because he's perfectly human.Furthermore, it's hard to consider this film anything other than a crime drama, but being a crime drama, Dog Day Afternoon hardly feels like a drama, and it hardly feels like it fits into the canonical crime drama umbrella. Mostly it feels so hard to categorize because Sidney Lumet does such a fantastic job genre bending this film into both a dark comedy and something of a slice of life. What we're left with is a film that truly pushes the boundaries of what was even enjoyable at the time into something that laid the groundwork for all modern crime drama.Films like The Godfather and The Sugarland Express maybe better and character study and sprawling drama respectively, but Dog Day Afternoon turns the character study on its head and condenses the sprawl into a single setting.

"Anti-climatic, aged, but well-crafted and inspired","""Dog Day Afternoon"" is the famous (purportedly true) story of a bank heist gone wrong. Because its reputation precedes it, it lacks in flashy shoot-outs, and its social commentary tirades are a bit outdated, the movie may not deliver to modern audiences with the same gravity as it did when it was released. The film is a showcase for one of Pacino's most controlled, nuanced performances and the story has some interesting things to say about loyalty within relationships and friendships. There is some amusing dialog with regards to Vietnam veterans, transgender and homosexual romance and even smoking (maybe a touchy subject at the time).The film feels longer than it is and seems to build toward a surprise twist that never appears, but it is solidly crafted throughout and the climax itself is much more intoxicating for the masterful build-up. The tasteful camera cinematography (a staple of pre-80s films!) and the absence of a musical score both work to accentuate the character portraits and claustrophobic nature of the situation.While maybe not one of the greatest movies of all time, it's certainly one of the notable ones of its decade, expertly crafted with some stand-out performances by Pacino and John Cazale. And while influencing a number of films since its release, ""Dog Day Afternoon"", also seems to have been the inspiration for the charming early '90s comedy, ""Airheads"", about a band of metalheads who get trapped while holding up an LA radio station.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I absolutely love the fact that the majority of this film takes place in the bank, it creates an amazing atmosphere.This film involves two of the best actors to ever live Al Pacino and John Cazale. Al Pacino is superb as Sonny. He plays the character so incredibly well, and it just solidifies my love for him as my favourite actor of all time. John Cazale is terrific as Sal. Despite him not having many lines, he still brings a lot to this film with his body language, facial expressions and his bits of dialogue with other characters. He was such an incredible actor and it's so sad that he died two years after this film came out, rest in peace. The fact that he talks about not smoking so he doesn't get lung cancer in this film is heartbreaking considering how he died from lung cancer.This film has fantastic performances, terrific tense moments and potent characters.

We've all had one of those days.,"'Dog Day Afternoon (1975)' is ahead of its time in multiple ways, not least of which being the honest and forward-thinking depiction of its openly gay protagonist and his transgender partner that somehow rivals what's seen on screen today. The internal struggle of our hero is portrayed very well, nuanced and subtle, as he tries to come to terms with his sexuality and lashes out in frustration, desperate to be heard as those he knows either ignore him or blame him for their own problems. The bank heist itself is rendered incredibly realistically, with the improvised fumbling of our robbers matching their lack of professionalism and adding to a tense air of unpredictability. Its quick escalation soon makes an uncomfortably tight situation downright claustrophobic. Each slow yet ever increasingly suspenseful moment adds to the last to create a bizarre stalemate that seems as though it could last for hours and yet will have one inevitable conclusion, a conclusion you don't want to happen because you've come to truly care for the perpetrators even if you know they're the ones in the wrong. Pacino gives perhaps his best performance to date and it is backed up by some phenomenally naturalistic direction, as well as brilliant supporting performances and a great (if heavily improvised upon) screenplay. It's all exciting, affecting and entertaining stuff, even at its slowest. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Simply Brilliant,"Great directing, exceptional acting, the right dose of humor and a great story make a winning combination. This is unlike a bank robbery you have ever seen and years before numerous directors made films about bank robberies. Pacino and John Cazale hit this film out of the park. Their stellar performances make this film iconic, I am not sure if any other actors could have had the same impact.Essentially we see a bank robbery that is badly planned turn into a media circus. After seeing the unstable and excited personalities of Pacino we understand why. For a film that escalates and a situation that increasingly grows out of control it flows perfectly. You are carefully taken through a chain of events. The humor is also brilliantly done and also flows effortlessly as to not take away the drama and intensity of the robbery. The unplanned robbery, virtually no money being robbed and the unlikely bonding with their captors endears the bank robbers to the audience. You want them to succeed and possibly root for their escape.Despite the circus and things going out of control it appears the duo will succeed as the film nears its end. The film also delivered some shocking moments. I had the same expression as Al Pacino's character at the end of the film. Al Pacino steals the show with his fits of rage, expressions and always being on the edge.This film is highly recommended, 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This Film Doesn't Mess Around,"Dog Day Afternoon has some of the best cinematic pacing I've ever seen. No frills, no dancin' around, it just kicks off with a bang and let's you follow the events as they unfold with the characters. This plus a lack of a musical score help create a superbly real feature film.
Al Pacino's finest performance I've ever seen him in and he's wonderfully complimented by the talents of the late great John Cazale. All of the supporting actors did a remarkable job as well under the brilliant directing of Sidney Lumet.
This film grips you from the beginning and doesn't let go.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wyoming is still not a country....,"Great film! Pacino is superb! I loved the crazy, intense arguing between Pacino and Durning! It felt so real, even adlibbed! The feel of the movie is incredibly real too - sweat robbers and hostages, dirty door window of the bank, almost everyone looking worn out and exhausted. I love when filmmakers realize that makeup and hair aren't perfect in real life! This film also touches on social issues, like gay marriage, sex change operations, working man poverty, etc. Pretty progressive! I'd definitely watch this again! "" ATTICA! ATTICA! ATTICA!""p.s. - love that 3 ""Godfather"" actors are in this!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I've got one thing to say about this film...,"Stunning. Al Pacino is totally awesome as Sonny, it's not quite a one-man-show, but he certainly takes center stage. ""Stage"" being the perfect word - we get a real stage-play feel created mainly by the strong acting and virtually singular location.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a great movie!,"What a great movie! Visiting it again after a near forty-year gap, I'm astounded how well it stands up, in spite of it being so firmly rooted in the 1970s. It's definitely one of the top NYC pictures: the opening sequence captures the city in many moods and places before homing in on a Brooklyn bank, scene of a botched robbery by Sonny (Pacino) and Sal (Cazale). What follows is constantly engaging.One of the many fascinating things about DOG DAY AFTERNOON is the quality of the acting, both on an individual and collective level. Pacino is extraordinary as Sonny. Gentle and angry, crazy and lucid, a volatile pack of explosives threatening to detonate at any moment. But he is given rock-solid support from Cazale, Durning (amazing), James Broderick, Chris Sarandon, and the entire ensemble of bank hostages led by terrific Penelope Allen. The only cast member who doesn't score a bullseye is Judith Malina as Pacino's mother: there's something not quite right about her big scene, though I can't put my finger on what. It needed Lee Grant, or Estelle Parsons. But it's a tiny cavil. A work of art doesn't need to be perfect to be great. The two rarely go together, in my experience.The camera work ranges effortlessly over documentary-style helicopter shots over the city to classic claustrophobic close-ups in the bank. The editing by Dede Allen is breathtakingly good - it's completely absurd that she did not win the year's Oscar for her work here. The whole is masterminded brilliantly by Sidney Lumet, at the top of his game.A classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pacino's best performance.,"And that is saying a lot.This is one of those films you find on TV and maybe decide to watch a small bit of it. Ten minutes later, your hooked and it's done before you know it. The slow build and the realistic changes in circumstances keep anyone into it.Al gave his all here and definitely left it all on the celluloid. If not for Jack's ""Coukoo""s Nest"" performance that year, Al would have gotten the Oscar. He owned the film and you wanted the camera to stay with him.Chris Sarandon, in his debut, also got (and earned) a nom. I wondered why Durning, Cazale, and the blonde bank teller (with the obvious Irish accent) didn't.Durning's role was a bit of a stereotype, but he kept it in check. He's one of the most under-appreciated actors around. And despite filming in cold whether, you DID feel like it was oppressively hot.The script deserved the Oscar. So did everything else.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Dog Day AfternoonThe reason dogs aren't allowed into banks is that they chew on the exploding dye packs.Thankfully, the canine reference in the title of this crime-thriller is seasonal.During the dog days of summer 1972, first-time felon Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) and his equally inexperienced partner Sal Naturale (John Cazale) hold up a Brooklyn bank.But the easy in–and-out gets complicated right off the bat as their third gunman bails, the depository's coffers are depleted, and an impromptu fire alerts authorities.Now, the hapless hostage-takers must negotiate with Sergeant Moretti (Charles Durning) in order to get the funding for Sal's girlfriend's transgender surgery.A tense, but tongue-in-cheek, hostage situation movie inspired by actual events, this unusually timely caper redefined the dog-eared genre through its use of plausible characters motived by plausible, yet peculiar, means.Incidentally, the old acting adage about working with kids and dogs is the opposite for terrorists.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Every Dog Has It's Day,"The true story of a truly botched bank robbery. From there, a New York-style spectacle, complete with media and armed police on every corner comes to pass as the hostage situation worsens. Powerfully, it is filmed and edited using diegetic sound, which creates the illusion of documentary footage. This technique is powerful and makes Dog Day Afternoon the genius film that it is. Beyond its subject matter, the film at its heart is about attaining power through the notion of celebrity. Sonny, throughout the hostage enjoys the roaring crowds and unexpected sway over the hostage negotiator. He begins to get high on the new power that he has attained. ATTICA!!! ATTICA!!! This is a classic in every aspect.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Will be remembered forever for Al Pacino's performances.,"The film is the best example of how an amateur will deal with a situation. The character is shown excessively kind by heart. This is a film where you will see a different side. The film opens with a bank robbery and revolves around the struggles of a common man to steal money from the bank. The main problem which stopped sonny from achieving what he wanted was his kind heartedness. The film is a delight to watch. You would not want to miss it.PROS: Al Pacino has dominated in every scene. His acting in this film was the best I had seen. The story was based on a true incident so I would say that it was properly handled. You will watch it till the end whatever might be the case because Al Pacino will not let you leave even for a minute.CONS: The story seemed to be kind of dragging in the middle. It looked as if things were inserted forcefully. But considering that it was made on true incident, I don't think that there can be any better representation than this.MESSAGE: ""Plan everything.""VERDICT: ""A must watch.""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A true bank robbery...,"""Dog Day Afternoon"" is a crime movie which is based on a true event and this event was a bank robbery. In this movie we have a man who wants to rob a bank because he wants to help his lover to do an operation. But this turns into a hostage situation and a fight with media and the people.I liked this movie very much because is is based on a true incident and it was a robbery really different than the others that I have seen before that. I also liked this movie because of the interpretations of Al Pacino who played as Sonny and John Cazale who played as Sal. In addition to this I want to mention that also the direction of this movie which was made by Sidney Lumet was very well organized and this was obvious in the whole duration of the movie. This robbery is very different from all the other robberies that I have seen because we watch the robbers being in the same mental situation with the hostages and they create a bound between them.Finally I want to say that ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is a great movie that everybody should watch because it shows us and gives us many issues to think of. Also I believe that after watching this movie you will discuss about it and maybe reconsider some of your opinions about certain subjects that come out from this.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Masterpiece of acting,"Dog Day Afternoon is Al Pacino's best work, portraying the hapless bank robber who seems to fumble everything in contrast to his slick mate Sal. The film portrays the bank robbery as a testament to Murphy's Law, as everything that could go wrong eventually does - and the incompetent robbers barely know how to react. The feeling of the film is very grounded, as if the audience is really witnessing ordinary people suddenly caught up in a crime turned into a media frenzy, and this gives the characters plenty of familiarity. This close feeling turns what is usually a dramatic story into a very personal one.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Work Of Quality That Refuses To Age,"Based on a true story, filmed majorly in a single location & riding on the strength of its two sensational performances, Dog Day Afternoon is a firmly crafted, expertly narrated, briskly paced & accurately portrayed cinema that is much more than a robbery gone wrong story for it also tries to capture various issues prevalent in 1970s America with its anti- establishment tone.Set in Brooklyn during the early 70s, Dog Day Afternoon tells the story of a first-time crook who along with his friend decides to rob a bank but their plan goes awry from the very start when they arrive at the bank after the daily cash pickup. However, with the arrival of police, the whole scenario inadvertently turns into a hostage situation which soon escalates into an intense media circus.Fabulously directed by Sidney Lumet, this crime drama is one of the finest works of his filmmaking career & presents him at the very top of his game. The film doesn't waste much time in setting up its premise, introduces tension with fine elegance which is then steadily elevated as the story progresses to finally subside after a nail-biting finale that's far more suspenseful than most thrillers out there.Further intensifying its plot is its claustrophobic atmosphere made possible by its secluded location & tight editing. And last but not the least is the outstanding work by both Al Pacino & John Cazale. Although Pacino expresses his character's dilemma amazingly well, Cazale steals the show with a performance that's as unforgettable as it is heartbreaking. And both of them are nicely supported by the rest of the cast.On an overall scale, whether it's the direction, writing, acting, camera-work, editing or even its set pieces, Dog Day Afternoon is a work of quality in every one of these aspects and is also amongst the best works in the careers of Sidney Lumet, Al Pacino & John Cazale. Belonging to the very decade that gave us some of the greatest American films of all time, Dog Day Afternoon comes thoroughly recommended for it is a classic that simply refuses to age.",,Anonymous,Biography
convincingly realistic,"This is not your typical 'entertaining' movie. It is slow paced, depressing at times, it has not much action and is situated at only one setting... but I loved it! It has a very realistic feel to it. The directing, the good acting of the whole cast, intelligent writing, the lack of dominating music and the sober camerawork make it believable and very realistic (shouldn't that be the main focus of a film based on a true story?). You really believe it happened this way and you get absorbed in the story from beginning till end. And especially Al Pacino is very convincing as the desperate bank-robber, who tries to save the situation in which he is landed.This movie is about real persons who get stranded in an 'unreal' situation. I wish I could see more movies like these instead of all those fast-cut, superficial ones from Hollywood they're showing us nowadays in the theater.",,Anonymous,Biography
Pacino and the1970's setting stand out in this movie classic,"I was delighted to get Dog Day Afternoon as a Christmas gift. I still watch DVDs and thank goodness for them. Other than TCM, there is only a slim chance of viewing this movie on television.
Finally getting to see the movie and its star Al Pacino was a bigger treat than I expected. Watching this robbery/hostage drama made me feel like I was right there minute by minute as the story unfolded. Sidney Lumet, a director of so many great movies set in New York, knew the territory.
The movie is set in 1970s Brooklyn and it captures the squalor and the mood of one New York neighbourhood. At the time, New York was dealing with crime, bankruptcy, racial strife and the loss of faith in government. Pacino, playing Sonny, is an unemployed Italian-American in a failing marriage. Part of the story is an alliance he builds with neighbours who cheer for him as he is surrounded by police, FBI, and media reporters.
John Cazale plays his buddy Sal and Charles Durning is the seasoned police chief caught in a highly charged standoff between the police and the supportive crowd who cheer on the hostage takers. The full cast is great.
Glad I finally saw this movie, which I can now add to the many other great movies I've seen from the 1970's. Highly recommend.",,Anonymous,Biography
gay butch cassidy with cops,A lot of humor in this film as well as being a great dramatic film. One scene I thought was funny was when Pacino asked John Casale what country he would like to go to and he chooses Wyoming.What I also found humorous was the byplay with both his gay lover as well as his conversation with his wife.,,Anonymous,Biography
Amateur Dogs,"A startlingly young Al Pacino stars in this true-life story of a bank robbery gone wrong. The most famous recent film about a botched bank robbery was of course 'Reservoir Dogs', but the two movie could hardly be more different (except for the use of the word 'dog' in their titles!) - Quentin Tarantino's movie was stylised, ultra-violent, and told of gangsters, whereas this movie is realist in tone and features very little shooting, while Pacino's character is essentially just a mixed-up kid. He gives a fine performance, and director Sidney Lumet shows a sure touch in handling the tragi-comic unfolding of events; the longer the movie lasts, the more involving it becomes. If anything, the film better resembles Scorcese's under-appreciated gem, 'The King of Comedy', another story about the pursuit of dreams both modest and absurd. It's among the best things that Lumet and Pacino have done in their long careers, and a welcome reminder that the greater slickness one expects in a modern blockbuster does not necessarily make a better film.",,Anonymous,Biography
Circus Comedy of Erros and Perversions,"I doubt this has too much in common with some real life event, usually when they say that it's ""loosley"" based it means some aspect of the story was important to the golden calf worshiper androgyne god-people who make these pictures possible. In this case it's the trans-former androgynes aspect which is mentioned on the top level info page here, but only very obtusely in the movie itself. A cult is out there and it's very visible and image based which is based off of this divine balance insanity. Defaming religion, a specific religion, is a major motive, likely the most important one. But that's film and its owners, all movingbeast images really.Now it is funny how circus like this movie is, and it really should be called a farcical comedy, the perverts involved which definitely include the ""stars"" of transformerwood, notwithstanding. And even the supporting players in this film are obvious, how anyone thinks these are the gender they mask themselves as is just sad and so indicative of the state of the world. Objective reality be danged, our word is reality, as we say IS. The tellers are the most obvious, that side of it usually is but the other side is the hardest to see, making them most dangerous. Collapse, decay and decadence seem to be unnoticed, until it smacks in the face or the belly is deprived of its delights.Pacino(and ther rest of the imagecult) is one of these transformers and its mission is always to defame a particular religion. It's all over the script and all over PUZOsteinbergs sick books and the sick movies based off of them. Projection is a huge marker of a certain tribe, a version of the scape goat ritual in older days. You're seeing the real mafia there but under others names, it's all a stage for misdirection and control. I shouldn't have to mention the ""neo""-french, bottom dwellers in charge for hundreds of years so Lumet is just another one. I realize there are tons of zombies here and even more cadres, it's pretty obvious in the stacked nature of the blurbs on offer. This film is largely forgotten for a reason, it's just farcical comedy of errors and perversions lifted up on the backs of cattle grazing below in the mud. It's more of a strictly cult of the androgyne people film, unnoticed termites. The contrast to this queiter version would be Rocky Horror, a weirdocult opus as well.",,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty good hostage movie,"Al Pacino and Charles Durning are the highlights of Dog Day Afternoon, a thriller concerning a pair of none-too-bright bank robbers and the hostage situation they find themselves thrown into.  John Cazale is also effective as dim but dangerous Sal, a guy who doesn't know that Wyoming is just a state, but seems capable of murdering his hostages with no trace of emotion. When he says he's prepared to send out bodies, I had a feeling he meant it. Some of the shouting-match negotiations between Sonny (Pacino) and Detective Moretti (Durning) are really funny.  While I thought it was pretty solid, I don't rate it as an all-time classic like others seem to.  With the exception of the last 12 minutes, there was a lack of intensity that I felt was needed for this type of movie.  Pacino seemed almost TOO gentlemanly toward his hostages, and it costs the atmosphere.",,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty intriguing and amazing performances,"This is my 3rd Sidney Lumet film, and once again it is an intriguing and entertaining bank-heist film with some great writing and performances.Al Pacino is magnificent in the title role, but he ain't the only one. Chris Sarandon and John Cazale are also really impressive. Lumet is both a story-teller and an actor's director, as has been proved with performances from Fonda (12 Angry Men), Dunaway, Finch, and Holden (Network). He really knows how to make the most of a character and the actor. I give Dog Day Afternoon an 8.5, and while very, very good, 12 Angry Men and Network are still higher.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Uptight, frantic, furious and compassionate",Its very frantic ... then it becomes more up close and personal... Interesting to see how the Oscar winning screenwriter has orchestrated this into a drama for the movies. You'll see Sonny conquer his INTERNAL conflicts when he asks MOUTH to write for him.Be amazed at how the FBI people managed to cajole the two men... and how wickedly the other fbi guy (after Morreti) hints Sonny at how they're gonna handle Sal.... and it does happen in the end.Nice to see some arcs with the hostages.Tense and furious and compassionate.GRADE A-,,Anonymous,Biography
DDA and Media Lit Skills,"The bank is where Sonny can get the money for Leon, where all his problems can be solved in just 10 minutes but instead turns into his long 12 hour demise. Sonny just wants to make his lover and family happy so he does stuff he wouldn't normally do. When Sheldon takes over for Moretti, it signals a change in the game for Sonny and that he will probably not make it out alive. When Sonny starts to yell ""Attica"" to the crowd he gets them on his side and makes him a hero for standing up to the police. What does Attica mean though? We gather that is where many people got shot by police outside of a bank robbery/hostage situation, but we don't know Sonny's connection to it. This tale of a quick robbery gone wrong is very good. You think that the robbery won't take very long but then there's a compilation to it and then everything goes south for the robbers. This is an element that is common in many police type movies and how Sal reacts to being trapped in a corner is good. He makes his stand like all other bad guys but in the end he loses. (Evaluation) There are many different groups in the film. The hostages are interesting because most of them are women and then there are two older men. Mulvaney and the security guard are also a group because they have medical conditions and are let go by Sonny, but Mulvaney chooses to stay. The duo of Sal and Sonny and then Moretti and Sheldon is another group. Sonny doesn't want to kill anyone while he is robbing the bank, but when it is revealed he is a Vietnam War vet, it throws you off guard. It is then revealed that he has a family but also a male lover so you don't know what to think. He does not seem like a violent man but when pushed to the brink he will do whatever it takes to make his family happy. All hostage situations end up with violence, therefore Dog Day Afternoon was going to end with violence. While gay rights have been taken to a whole new level in today's society, you don't think of gays being open in the 1970's. The fact that Sal goes from a normal husband in a straight couple with a family to having a gay lover and the robbing a bank to help him get his sex change operation, many different fronts are presented. Sonny is a family man, first and foremost, and he will do whatever to help them. Even when it involves possibly going back to jail or dying, he is willing to put it all on the line for Leon, even though he is married with kids.",,Anonymous,Biography

A city that never sleeps. A city where two desperate men decided to launch an assault on heaven, and for two hours, you can hear their cry. Sonny and Sal have long been acquainted with the pantheon of violent and desperate men. They have come to know it's marble steps, and have seen for themselves the caution that creeps freely about the gallery of rogues. But Sonny and Sal are heroes. Stoic and true. They are operatic. Sonny builds warfare out of romance, and Sal constructs a rune out of gasps; those frail, sickly drops of doubt and mistaken destiny. It's easy for me to find poetry in this film, and honesty in all of its characters. Its easy because I know what it feels like to be desperate. To make a stand.. for what? You never really know, but you completely understand, it is justifiable, it holds up in a court of the Gods. And on one hot day in New York City, a robbery that should have taken ten minutes raged on all through the night, into you neighborhoods and local television news channels, you might have even stopped by to take a look for yourself.

A meditative take on a famous novel.,"This is a classic of 70s cinema. Dog Day Afternoon, directed by the late great Sidney Lumet features a fine turn by the then fresh Al Pacino who plays a callow youth robbing a bank. The pacing is fantastic, there are many political underlying themes(the lower class's revolt, transgenderism) and it came out at a time when there was much disconcert on the streets of America. It is truly a great film and its reputation has only increased with time. Watch this one. 8/10 (Watch it for Lumet's crisp direction and Pacino's acting). Solaris (1971): Stanislaw Lem's Solaris is a highly regarded book and Andrei Tarkovsky's film adaption is pretty much spot on, though Tarkovsky being an auteur brings his own touch to the proceedings. The story is about a cosmonaut who is sent to a space station revolving around a mysterious planet in the future. The cinematography and production design are haunting- the spaceship is so different than what we usually see in Hollywood. The acting is restraint and works here. Some people have said there is a sense of pretentiousness and rightfully so as some scenes go on way too long. But hey, this is Tarkovsky we speak of. This is one of the finest hard science fiction films and you should see it at any cost.",,Anonymous,Biography
masterpiece,"it is not easy to define Dog Day Afternoon. it is bitter and strange and not comfortable and unique. it is one of films who propose not a story but questions. and who remains long time in memory scene by scene. because it defines the life in a brutal, too honest and cruel manner the life. film of John Cazale, it propose a special Al Pacino. for the manner to explore the nuances of his role. for the science to use the detail as mark of emotions. for the force of words. for the art to impose an attitude as axis of atmosphere. a masterpiece, the film becomes definition of a state of conscience more actual today. because our society has a better manner to suffocate the small existences. a precious film for its artistic value. a masterpiece important for the status of manifesto. and one of films who, at each meeting is deeply another.",,Anonymous,Biography

Groundbreaking,"I recently saw this movie, and I'm suprised it came out in 1975.  Pacino is absolutely fantastic in this role, I would rate it a close second to his performance in the first Godfather.  Chris Sarandon is also great in his very risque role.",,Anonymous,Biography
sad,"This movie ain't easy on the heart.  Very sad.  Very tragic.  But, the opening montage is classic and inspiring. Unfortunately, I think the film is a little too long.

Chiseling and Involving,"Not much is explained about the bank robbery in Dog Day Afternoon at the picture's start. All the information we're given are the thieve's names and the dialogue exchanges they release to their captives. What's interesting is how connected we feel to the characters being held captive in the bank, the police trying to extinguish the situation, and the publicity outside. It's like we're one of the townspeople watching in the background or one of the tellers in the bank. We're put directly in the middle of the catastrophe and learn Sonny's motivations at the same time as the characters themselves them. Uniquely, we almost believe we are apart of this grand heist. We feel Sonny's humanity, despite the situation at hand.Dog Day Afternoon tells us what we're about to see is an accurate depiction of these events that took place in New York City before the action of the movie begins. Once that idea was placed in my head, the more I felt like I was watching an event, not a movie. Director Sidney Lumet blurs the lines of cinema and journalistic news reporting. The film doesn't play as one or the other, instead it's a more involving experience. The screenplay brilliantly recounts the events and shapes together a suffocating and chiseling incident. Dog Day Afternoon accounts the amateur plans and actions of the characters realistically. It's a special film that taps on different parts of our mind and interest.Al Pacino is the movie. He's in nearly every scene and commands the screen with his flawed, compassionate, warped character. Pacino attacks the character from the right approach. Sonny thinks he has everything under control, but he doesn't know or think he looks ridiculous or inexperienced. As the movie grows, the more we learn of Sonny and we see Pacino's portrayal growing and growing. The film finally arrives Sonny's character climax in a lengthy scene where Sonny speaks on the telephone. In that scene, Pacino reaches new levels of intensity that he only scraped the surface of in the Godfather trilogy.The film contains little musical score, which works to its advantage. A musical score exists to aid the actors in expressing what the characters are feeling. In Dog Day Afternoon, we're watching a ""common man"" robbing a bank, it's a representation of a real-life event. Thanks to the cutting directing, involved writing, and absorbing acting, there's no need to force the audiences hand to understand the story. The film even boldly tackles issues of homosexuality with poise. Holding your attention, Dog Day Afternoon recounts the event probably better than it was played out in real-life.Rating: 9/10Grade: A",,Anonymous,Biography
Al Pacino's Materpiece,"I was amazed the way Al Pacino carried the character till the end. Remember this movie was a 1975 production. That means its about 36 years old and it still matches to the modern movies in this genre... I was taken aback by the awesome acting of Al Pacino, that too in his very early stages of his career. The storyline is very simple, about a robbery at a bank. But the screenplay got to be appreciated, with the way it keeps the audience nailed to the seat . AP portraits the innocent , young man, who is confused at times about his doings .. But wants to run the show till he gets what he wants ... Good sensible Direction ... Highly recommend this movie for all viewers ... Especially, those who don't know about Al Pacino's legacy ..",,Anonymous,Biography
Timely Classic,"Like many of the films of the seventies, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" was made as a reflection on society.  The idea of the media over blowing an event and making a star out of losers is nothing new in the nineties.  What is unique is that this is the first movie of its kind. However, in less capable hands it could have been a disaster but we have a brilliant director in Sidney Lumet and an exceptional cast.It's hard to believe that Sonny is being played by the same man who played Michael Corleone in ""Godfather II"" around the same time.  Al Pacino gives an amazing performance that makes him both a hero and a loser.  He is holding these people hostage but makes sure they get food and even Aspirin.  It is also one of the first leading homosexual characters in a feature film but is not portrayed through stereotypical mannerisms. John Cazale is great as the dopey partner whose primary interest is making sure the television reports don't say that's he's gay. It is truly a shame that this talent had to die so young. Chris Sarandon makes the most of his part as Sonny's gay lover but one wonders how he and Sonny could have gotten along. In the end, though, it is the subject manner that leads to the success of this film.  The media is the main character in the film.  It manipulated all of the others and made the entire situation larger than life.",,Anonymous,Biography
**** out of 5,"If the idea of an entire two hour movie being solely based on a single bank robbery sound boring than I would have agreed with you. But Dog Day Afternoon is extremely intriguing, why you may ask. Well the simple fact of it is that this film is more than just two hours of footage from inside a bank. First we have the media. We see how the bloodthirsty media will do anything to get their story and will feed the public as much information as they can get their dirty hands on no matter how relevant it is to the situation. We also see that the media seem more content on making heroes out of these criminals than covering the actual story, you think it's unbelievable just look at Charles Manson, this is justified in the film just by hearing the crowds reaction every time one of the robbers steps outside. Then we deal with family, love, identity and homosexuality, that sure is a lot for a bank robbing flick isn't it? To actually enjoy this film you have to dig a littler deeper, scratch a little harder and listen a little clearer to pick up on what is really going on, if not you will probably be experiencing the most boring two hours of your life. Al Pacino is fabulous, as always, as Sonny, the man who is robbing a bank so that he can pay for his lovers sex change operation. But he sees himself struggling not only to find his way out of the mess he is in but to find himself as a man and try to justify his actions. Pacino gets so deep into his character that the suspense created by the film has a very natural feel to it, not to mention that this was also based on a true story and it is very hard to make an audience believe that this has actually happened but Pacino does it beautifully. In the end we see that life is only as hard as you make it, as complex as you make it and as complicated as you make it, to use others as an outlet for you frustration will only dig yourself a deeper grave than you have already made for yourself. I highly recommend this film if not for the message beneath the surface than just for the overall impact the film has.",,Anonymous,Biography
Fine Thriller,"Dog Day Afternoon is edge-of-your-seat thriller that's based off a true story, when two former Vietnam War Veterans decide to rob a bank in broad daylight, the robbery should of only lasted ten minutes, but eight hours later it was the hottest thing on TV. Al Pacino again gives us a fantastic performance as a character whose mixed emotions leads him to the worst of actions. 120 minutes flies by whereas they're in the bank for 95% of the movie. It's a very suspenseful thriller, with intriguing characters topped off with some very memorable scenes. As this actually happened in the stages of reality, you appreciate the movie even more as it accurately displays the events the occurred on that Sunday afternoon. Dog Day Afternoon is a must-see for all Pacino fans as he delivers a fantastic performance.",,Anonymous,Biography
