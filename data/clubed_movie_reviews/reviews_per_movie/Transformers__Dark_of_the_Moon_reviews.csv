Good considering what it is,"I have to say I enjoyed watching Transformers 3. If you take it for what it is, a Michael Bay movie with awesome, epic visuals, an over-the- top weak plot, not very deep characters, and classic 'Bay' humor, then it's great. Not as good as the first, but easily better than the 2nd one.First off, the visual effects are amazing. One of the best, if not the best, that I've seen, both in details on the transformers, in action/fighting sequences, and in more general landscape shots - the views of Chicago when it was being attacked by decepticons were great. I watched it in 3D in the theater, and it was arguably the best 3D effects I've seen, and best use of 3D cameras, and that is including Avatar which i also saw in 3D. This is what Michael Bay is really good at, and this movie shows he is arguably the expert in visual effects and composition.visual effects and presentation - 10/10The plot isn't great. When it starts out, it seems like it might develop nicely into a moderately complex story rooted in some historical events that happened very differently than how we thought (kind of like the hoover dam part in the first transformers), but in the end not much is made of that and the plot is relatively direct and over-the-top. However, it does have a few good moments that offer a bit more complexity or emotion, and anyways I didn't watch the movie hoping for a subtle, complex, and nuanced plot.Plot - 6/10The characters and acting aren't Oscar-worthy either, to say the least. Rosie Huntington-Whitely is not a great actress, in fact she isn't really an actress, and it shows, but, to be honest, I have seen worse performances. Shia Labeouf is decent in his role as usual. and again there are some new characters, including some for Michael Bay- esque comic relief (which in my opinion is actually funnier than much of the humor in revenge of the fallen, which felt a little too forced to me).Characters/acting - 6/10Fun - 8/10If you're expecting a layered, nuanced movie with deep characterization and a complex and well-written plot, well, then, don't watch this. If, though, you want a fun blockbuster with truly amazing visual effects, a decent (but forgettable) storyline and characterization, and an easy to follow dynamic, well you'll probably like Transformers 3.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Stunning Effects But the movie lacks Heart and Soul,"It's 'Bayhem' time again - and this time around demolition king Michael Bay presents his trademark 'Six-C's' in glorious 3D! In case you don't know, the six 'Cs' are: chases, clashes, crashes, combustions, carnage and cleavage. Spread over a bottom-numbing two-and-a-half hours, ""Transformers: Dark Of The Moon"" can also induce mental and metal fatigue, especially with the clanging robots smashing one another - and the whole exercise making little sense.Technologically, however, ""Dark Of The Moon"" is Bay's best work so far - and action fans looking to be awed by scenes of massive mayhem and destruction in 3D should be satisfied. Story-wise, this one is better than ""Revenge Of The Fallen"", but not as fun and emotionally-connecting as the first.The film opens with a flashback to the Sixties Apollo landing mission where history is rewritten (by Ehren Kruger) to incorporate the cover-up of an alien spaceship crashing on the moon. That spaceship, of course, is one of the remains of the epic battles between the Autobots and the Decepticons, and its 'discovery' sparks off another war that threatens to destroy planet Earth. Or at least the face of Chicago as we know it.On the human level, we find that Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has traded in his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) for a newer model (a Victoria Secret one, to be exact) in the shape of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly). Sam is being offered a job by Bruce Brazos (John Malkovich) but we soon learn that Carly's boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) may be up to no good. Then, when the conflict between the Autobots and Decepticons hots up, Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) of the elite Government squad NEST are summarily called into action.We get lulled into believing that there may somehow be an intelligent plot coming from the conspiracy of the NASA lunar-landing cover-up which also involves the Russian space program and Chernobyl. These turn out to be just an exercise in 'historical name-dropping' to spur our interest before we get to the demolition derby created by the Transformers. Indeed, some of the robots seem to emote better that the live cast. Cybertron leader Sentinel Prime, for example, is even designed to look like Leonard Nimoy (who provides its voice), complete with stuff that looks like beard. Again, the problems of the previous installments recur - like the confusion between the good and bad robots in the clashes.Unlike the first two movies, there are no more gags about the shock of humans interacting with the mechanical 'bots. Bay, however, insists on some comic sequences and he has hired Ken Jeong to do his in-your-face shtick as Jerry Wang. John Turturro reprises his role as former FBI agent Simmons but this time around, Turturro finds it fit to clown around with his role. The most striking inclusion to the cast is Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam's love interest. However, with limited acting talent, she provides only eye-candy and beside her, Megan Fox would look like an Oscar-caliber actress.Like the first ""Transformers"", this one is also a live-action cartoon on a grand scale. Scenes of Chicago buildings being toppled and destroyed can be as spectacular and brain-numbing as those of September 11; and the wing-suit flying sequences are breath-taking. Indeed, these are what most of Michael Bay's fans pay for and they will not be disappointed. The only problem for me is that Bay prolongs and repeats the robotic clash sequences to the point of being self-indulgent. Technically brilliant and visually arresting, ""Dark Of The Moon"" lacks heart and soul. (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A bit of an improvement over ROTF, but not nearly as good as the first","In order to coincide with a fourth Transformers coming out in the next few months, I'll be reviewing this third entry of the successful film series. I liked the first Transformers despite it's cheesy dialog in some parts and while there were some awkward moments and very bad dialog, I still liked Revenge of the Fallen. Then, when I saw the whole thing in theaters back at 2011, I thought, this wasn't so bad after all. It later turned out to be a good ride, but while I do think it's a bit of an improvement over the previous film, it's nowhere near as good as the first.First, there are some good things that saved the film for me. The music score from Steve Jablonsky has improved and has an epic tone to it. The story is a lot more decent than the previous film with a much better second and third halves; the action sequences are solid especially the collapsing building scene which took my very breath away. The scenery is great and the special effects are as top-notch as ever. The acting is good, too. While John Turturo, Franches McDormand, and John Malkovich aren't given much to do, they did fine with the material. Patrick Dempsey did OK as the villain, but he's a bit underwhelming. Rosie Hunter Whiteley is a bit bland, but not exactly terrible as the new girlfriend for Sam Witwicky. While Shia LeBeouf isn't as charismatic as he was in the first film, he does have the same charm he brought to the film series so far. The Autobots and Decepticons are great to see again and the voice actors are solid especially Leonard Nimoy as Sentinal Prime, who is a very good villain for the movie much Megatron.Then, there are the bad things that I would point out. First, the script. While the second and third halves are a lot better, the first half is pretty boring. It seems to be lacking in it's action and it wasn't exciting. Second, the ending is way too similar to the first Transformers (what? with the auto-bots and decepticons fight against each other while bringing destruction to the city and such?) The pacing is also very sluggish it would almost put you to sleep. Third and mostly the final problem is the dialog. There are some humorous bits that might get the audience a chuckle, but there are other parts that are just so inane it would give you a headache.Overall, Transformers: DOTM isn't nearly as good as the first, but despite the flaws that I just stated, I think this is a great sequel in an overall solid franchise. I may not be a fan of Michael Bay and such, but while I do not like the Bad Boys films, Pearl Harbor, and others, I think that this and the other films are a lot better and it deserves a recommendation to those who haven't seen it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mix feelings,"Well I knew I would have to review this movie sooner or later being this was the only film I saw in theaters in 2011 which I wish now I saw more but it is what it is.I love Transformers and as you know from my reviews of Transformers Movies, Video Games and TV Shows I am a huge fan of the Transformers however I know not all Transformers can be perfect and this movie prove to be that.Transformers: Dark Of The Moon prove what happens when you're not paying attention to anything. Everything about this film just feels disappointing.The Autobots: Optimus Prime (Voiced by Peter Cullen), Sentinel Prime (Voiced by Leonard Nimoy), Ironhide (Jess Harnell), Ratchet (Voiced by Robert Foxworth), Sideswipe (Voiced by James Remar), Mirage ""Dino"" (Franceso Quinn),Bumblebee, Wheeljack ""Que"" (Voiced by George Coe), Wheelie (Voiced by Tom Kenny) Brains (Voiced by Reno Wilson) The Wreckers Roadbuster (Voiced by Ron Bottitta) and Leadfoot (Voiced by John Dimaggio)The Decepticons: Megatron (Voiced by Hugo Weaving), Starscream (Voiced by Charlie Adler), Soundwave,Barricade, Shockwave (Voiced by Frank Welker), Laserbeak (Voiced by Keith Szarabajka) and Greg Berg voices Igor.The voice talent and their performances are what I like best about this movie and it was awesome to have Mr.Nimoy return to Transformers because anything he touches turns to gold. As I set in the theater listening to his voice work I can't help but think of Galvatron the role he first performance in Transformers. It's good to have Peter Cullen and Frank Welker in the film together since they are part of the Transformers for so long and you can't have one without the other.The plot of the movie was good enough as it did have a tense story line Action scenes in the film are the rewarding part as you are given tense and extreme battles. The music is also very well done Also the Special effects are just awesome that is enough to make you go wowThe disappointment I have with this film is that the comedy was really Bad comedy they try to push the comedy and I swear it just so bad that I wanted to cry. The human characters the new ones are pretty much awful and just really insulted my intelligence it just made you wish they added more transformers instead of more stupid human characters who are not even worth the screen timeThis in my opinion is the weakest of the films yes I know ""Revenge Of The Fallen"" got a bad rap but this one deserves it more because it is like a wreck on a wreck while it does have some things to make it watchable.What I like the best of the film is The voice performances of the cast, the music and the action scenes that are just what you hope for in Transformers. What I hated the most is the human cast who are just pretty much the worse punch line in the history of punch linesBut the plot, the action scenes and the voice performances are the redeeming features of this movieI give Transformers: Dark Of The Moon an 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The Witwicky Trilogy goes out with an indulgent, flawed BANG","After their disastrous second outing, few people had faith in the third part, but Dark of the Moon rights a lot of the narrative faults and feels like the sequel the first film deserved.A despondent Sam finds himself out of the limelight as the Decepticon threat appears to have lessened, Mikaela and Bumblebee have left him and he struggles to find a job and direction in life. But when Optimus Prime learns that humanity had found a vital Autobot ship crashed on the Moon, he rescues Sentinel Prime from the wreck, just when the Decepticons return with a plan to restore their homeworld of Cybertron.Watching Dark of the Moon feels like an endurance test by the time it finishes, this is due to a ridiculously drawn out battle set in Chicago for the climax. While it makes up for Revenge of the Fallen's terribly underwhelming finale, it does become a blur of insignificance after a while because there's simply too much happening! But if there is one thing done right this time is a correct use of characters. A lot of the ludicrous padding and fluff from RotF is completely missing; our human characters are involved but not excessively (ie. Sam's parents hardly feature at all!) and let's say this film provides us with humans who aren't noble and just. There's a lot more of the Transformers too (you would hope so) and it feels like they have a lot more respect shown to them now. Decepticons genuinely appear threatening and the Autobots are shown to have personalities again, continuing from the first film's groundwork (a scene with a silent, brooding Optimus-in-truck-mode is a favourite). The action is off the rails too. More in keeping with the original film we see them transform during battles.There are some deeply unsettling scenes too. The setup involves assassinations against humans who knew about the mission to the Moon, executed by Decepticon Laserbeak (great to see him too), one where he infiltrates a family's house by pretending to be a friendly Autobot playing with their daughter. Woah, woah! RotF was too cheesy, but this is really dark all of a sudden!As a fan of the Transformer characters, this film sees a lot of deaths. Some are most unforgivable. We haven't seen this many prominent robot deaths since the slaughter that was the 1986 Transformers: The Movie! The only other gripe I mostly have about this film asides deaths and a bloated finale is Carly, Sam's new love interest (the forgettable Rosie-Huntington Whitely) who is given things to do thanks to the plot, but is far less notable than Fox's Mikaela (I cannot believe I just wrote that) but I do believe the film would be stronger without a love interest. But it is Michael Bay, we need a girl for those slow-mo shots.It is a vast, vast improvement and a faithful sequel to the 2007 film. It is too long, and it does make some unforgivable decisions regarding Transformer characters, so it feels less perfect in those regards. It is still a fun film though.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Clever script blended with spectacular special effects...,"I was highly disappointed with Revenge of The Fallen and I thought the script for Dark Of The Moon would be similar to the other films of the franchise. But surprisingly, it was fresh. Ehren Kruger cleverly used the Apollo 11 event to create a Decepticon world invasion storyline with few interesting twists...Although I was amazed with the explosive action and brilliant special effects used in the film, the film itself lacks a lot of things...It started very well with the whole history of THE ARK and it crashed throughout the second half of the film. The humour was still silly like Revenge Of The Fallen. For example, Ken Jeong was appalling and Sam's parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) tried to be funny and humorous but failed. Replacing Megan Fox with Rosie Huntington Whiteley wasn't much of a big difference. However, she was certainly better than Fox. There was pointless scenes around the last half of the film that made it a really long, boring film. Also, Michael Bay tried hard making the slow motion action scenes very 3D and realistic which was a bit irritating and ruins the film. The main antagonists haven't performed well enough to create an epic ending to the franchise In another point of view, however, this film was fairly enjoyable and the script was written very well. The soundtrack used was fresh and bends well with the film. There was some scenes that just blew me away and the CGI special effects definitely deserves an Oscar nomination. Shia Labeouf, John Turturro, John Malkovich and Alan Tudyk was enjoyable to watch.Overall, Michael Bay definitely improved this film compared to Revenge Of The Fallen by creating really amazing CGI effects and a really interesting script, but it wasn't enough to deliver a spectacular ending to the franchise...",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Some Things Never Change,"I'm going to commit what to many will seem like film geek treason, I will now connect Michael Bay and Terrence Malick into one theory of filmmaking.Yep, deal with it.Malick and Bay share one important thing and that is a completely unabashed tunnelvision for the type of film they want, damn the naysayers, critics and crowds. They both make movies mainly for themselves and in truth, there is nothing wrong with that. As an audience member you need to know going in exactly what you are going to get. It is the only way to really enjoy anything that falls from the cameras of these two (and some other notables). With that said, let's dive headlong into the metallic masterpiece of summertime popcorn, Transformers!Transformers: Dark of the Moon continues the story of Sam Witwicky and his Autobot friends. While Sam struggles to gain a purpose in life outside of Decepticon attacks, the Autobots are off helping the government on secret missions. Then everything is torn apart by the discovery of the original Autobot escape ship, known as The Ark, and the captain of that ship, Sentinel Prime. He alone holds the key to technology that could either help reshape the Transformers home world or completely destroy ours. The Decepticons, completely aware of this discovery, make an immediate power play and the war is back, bigger than ever.Kids buying the Transformer toys today only want one thing, huge robots in spectacular 3D slow motion destroying each other and every building in sight. From this narrow viewpoint, Bay delivers in bulk. The highway fight sequence brought back memories of other high-speed terror scenes like in Matrix Reloaded and The Island (maybe a little too reminiscent of that last one according to some eagle eyed movie nerds). Since Bay actually filmed these scenes in the latest and greatest 3D technology, it was admittedly pretty amazing to watch. In other scenes, some of the CGI was so intensely crisp that it actually started popping too far from the live footage, making it stand out, which ruins a little of the illusion.So the special effects is where it was at. Big robots, big explosions, big buildings falling down. Those were the high points.The low points were pretty much everything else.Standing in the center of all the toys-on-roids insanity is Shia LaBeouf, who in my opinion is a really good actor banking inside really bad movies. I can't fault him for taking parts in some of the biggest franchises in movie history (Transformers and Indiana Jones) because the exposure and paycheck are nearly impossible to pass up, but in terms of showing his skills as an actor, those hefty titles have done him nothing but a painful disservice. He made his big splash on the scene in the Disney TV show Even Stevens and then on the big screen in the Rear Window update, Disturbia. Many people also don't remember one of my personal favorite performances in the Project Greenlight-sponsored film, The Battle of Shaker Heights. Shia has the chops, but gets surrounded by weak emotional performances, both from CGI and real people. In this outing, Megan Fox's eye candy character was replaced by Victoria Secret's model (and current Jason Statham girlfriend), Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Whiteley was an improvement in sense of acting ability, but the part was written levels below what Fox was given. The original love interest had layers, depth and some edge, while Whiteley was given virtually no background, no emotional outlet and nothing to do but stand there and be hot. Sure, the 12-year old in the audience doesn't want or need more, but to them I say, ""Go grab a Victoria Secret's catalog from your parent's bathroom and stay out of my movie.""Beyond the magical pair of leads, Bay brings back the regular tough guys, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson, to keep on keeping on. They both do fine jobs and don't try to make this more than it is. Coming in for the first time in the franchise is Frances McDormand, an Academy Award winner to class up the joint. While she was amusing and brought a little more skill to the screen, her part was borderline over-the-top, even in a movie with three story tall robots, because she had to balance out John Tuturro who drifts somewhere off to Hunter S. Thompson land. As if they weren't enough, Bay decides to bring in an unusual amount of big name cameos, including John Malkovich (who does a decent job in his few scenes) and Ken Jeong (who seems to be acting in a completely different movie, possibly thinks he's filming Hangover 3). I saved the best for last though, my personal favorite and the only person I was actually thrilled to see appear on screen, Alan Tudyk (who plays Tuturo's assistant/bodyguard). Tudyk is a cult TV and film legend to his legions of fans spanning from the days of Firefly, Dollhouse and other projects not created by Joss Wheedon. Tudyk was the one person I actually cheered form when he magically appeared on screen.I could go into a section now where I talk about the story, the plot lines, the connective tissue of the writing, but in reality, Bay didn't really care and neither do the younger members of the crowd, so let's just skip it.The End of the Page recommendation: Transformers: Dark of the Moon starts slow, goes out with a bang and delivers surface entertainment for the middle school crowd.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I don't get why people hate this movie!,"After the box office success and almost critically panned Transformers film that was REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, that was released in 2009, Paramount Pictures announced that they would be releasing future films in the Transformers saga.The third film was titled DARK OF THE MOON and the film was released in the summer movie season of 2011. The film was the last film to have Shia LaBeouf in the film as Sam Witwicky and the end of the original trilogy of films.The film is set three years after the events of the 2009 film, with the Autobots, during the collaboration with the NEST (Networked Elements: Supporters and Transformers) military force, discovering a hidden alien technology in possession of humans, which had been found by Apollo 11 on the years earlier. However, the Decepticons unveil a plan use the technology to enslave humanity in order to restore Cybertron, the home planet of the Transformers.The story was a really good story and it took inspiration from a novel called Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday, written by Alan Dean Foster. The novel was a prequel to the 2007 film, TRANSFORMERS. Due to the critically panned REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, the Twins were cut out of ""Dark of the Moon"".The acting is just amazing, but can get dreadful. Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky one last time and he does a great job. Megan Fox was originally signed on to play Mikaela Banes in the third film, and Patrick Dempsey's character Dylan Gould was to be the employer of Fox's character, but she was fired, instead Victoria Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley plays Carly Spencer and she does a great job.She is not as good as Fox but considering the shoes that she had to fill, she could have been a hell of a lot worse. Josh Duhamel, Kevin Dunn, Julie White and the rest of the cast are great in their performances, especially Tyrese Gibson, who was also in another 2011 film, Fast Five, which I previously reviewed.The CGI is amazing and the action is so fantastic in this film and the best part is at the end of the film, and it was so long but I enjoyed it and the film is 154 minute long feature film.The music by Steve Jablonsky is fantastic and much more cool and amazing was Linkin Park's song at the end of this movie.Overall, TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON is not the best Transformers film, but it could have been worse.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing visual spectacle but tedious and full of clichés,"This film is certainly an outstanding visual spectacle that boasts some of the most impressive, fluid and stunning cgi sequences I've ever seen. The photography is fantastic and the 3d technology is used effectively to create stunning, visually amazing scenes. However, that is the only aspect of the film that I believe deserves merit at all.Despite the continuous action, destruction and battles, I found this film to be extremely boring, and the final battle, which claimed the last hour of the film was far too long and drawn out and it greatly prevented me from appreciating the visual spectacle that is the final battle as it's so long it becomes tedious and I couldn't wait for it to end.The extensive use of cgi action scenes was what ruined the film for me, and although I never fully agree with the typical view that modern films have too much cgi and effects and not enough good story, this film certainly presented a convincing case that the above statement is true. As there is so much shooting, exploding and fighting in this film there is relatively little time for dialogue, which was largely, poorly written, and full of clichés.Finally, I didn't rate the casting of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley or her performance. She has clearly been chosen for the role for her good looks and her great sex appeal although I think she shines brighter as an underwear model than blockbuster film actress. Also, It seems unbelievable to me that Shia LaBeouf's character, although not a bad looking guy, has been in relationships with 2 characters played by women who have both topped the annual FHM 100 sexiest women in the world poll. Rosie has clearly been cast to attract more male viewers, bring sex appeal that the film didn't really need and throughout struck me as being far out of Shia's league.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Back to something resembling form.,"The Transformers series recovers slightly after an horrendous second instalment with a decent final act, providing of course that it is the final act.The story (yep, unlike No.2 this one has a story) is that the autobots sent a ship out into the galaxy nearing the end of the Cybertronian War which crash landed on the Earth's moon. The Yanks found out about this, which is why they were so eager to land there in the late sixties, their real mission being to investigate this alien vessel. Turns out have the dormant former autobot leader Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy, the voice of Galvatron in the original animated film) on board, and he has a cargo that could hand the Decepticons final victory in the Cybertronian war and grant them dominion throughout the universe.So the stakes are huge, so is the budget. So are the nods to older characters. Uber badass Shockwave finally makes an appearance, the autobots treating him with suitable fear and trembling. The rebel autobot Wreckers make an appearance, though as particularly vulgar characters. The autobots have the odds stacked against them, beaten and exiled, and yet triumph in the end after much sacrifice.I won't say too much about the plot. Though there aren't many surprises, you're better off seeing them in the film than reading them in this review.THis is easily the best characterisation of Optimus Prime, and also Megatron in the film series. Sentinel is an excellent addition, and I must admit to chuckling at the various Spock references throughout the film.So with the human actors. LeBeouf, who I quite liked in the first and found tolerable in the second, is here just annoying. We swap the brunette Barbie Doll Megan Fox, for an actual Barbie Doll in Rosie Huntington Whitely. Though to compensate not being able to see Megan draped over a motor bike in short shorts, we are shown a close up from behind of Rosie walking up a flight of stairs in her underwear. As a matter of fact, that is her introductory scene which tells you all you need to know about her character. Frances McDormand and John Malkovich are both welcome additions and their characters both appear to have walked in off the same film John Turtorro's had in the first movie. Patrick Dempsey is perfect in his role as an oily business man conductor of mass enmity.Spike's parents were so funny in the first film, and so vulgar in the second, hear they have improved to being merely banal.Some of the set pieces are astonishing, the highlight being some humans trapped in a sky scraper leaning on another sky scraper, trying desperately to make their way across the fallen building into the still intact one as Shockwave tears the building apart, but the whole battle sequence in Chicago is breathtaking. The ending is suitably dramatic and feels final.What can I say? Loved the transformer characterisations in this one. Had a couple of decent human characters added and actually had a story, even if it was pretty thin. Better than the second, not as good as the first. Loved it!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Quite A Spectacle,"Well, lets get a quick look at the film. Explosions, CGI, 3D and after these comes everything else. These three things are the main reason why one should watch Transformers: Dark of the Moon. We all know who Mr. Bay is and what his movies are famous for: explosions, explosions, explosions and destruction, destruction, destruction. Plot has never been his strongest feature, but hey, and i am being totally honest here, it works well enough, at least for me. All i wanted to see was a typical Michael Bay movie, something like Armageddon or the first Transformers, and what i got was a pleasant surprise.So, before watching the movie its probably not a sin to say that we were certain of one thing: it couldn't have been worse than Revenge of the Fallen, which, lets be honest, was pretty atrocious. This time we've got plot linked to Moon and Apollo 11, which was clever and worked well for the movie, decepticons taking over the world and turning Chicago into something we're used to see in The Terminator movies and autobots with their human allies resisting them. Oh, and what we don't have is Megan Fox. Thank God for that. The new female lead, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has one task: be pretty and well its safe to say that she succeeds at it, no one expects her to deliver an award-winning performance, but she did really good (it's her first film by the way) and she fits in the movie and with Sam very well.Anyway, the film is much bigger and more serious than the previous ones. This time we've got emotion and character, which maybe has something to do with, again having Steve Jablonsky and Linkin Park for soundtrack. Iridescent which is played at some points creates an excellent aura. All this decepticon destruction and ""drawing the bigger picture"" motive provides us with more seriousness and depth.So all in all, Transformers: Dark of the Moon was an awesome watch. It could be for anyone, if only one goes to watch it for the right reasons (needlessly to say explosions, CGI and 3D). We've got fast pace, a lot of visuals, romance, a lot of mayhem and well, a moral (presented heavily with clichés but, hey, no harm). All of which are vital components for a solid summer blockbuster and a clear head to define Transformers as something more than meets the eye. Just sit back and expect a fun and adventurous ride and you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

In this movie Megan Fox is no longer to be seen but we are gifted with a beautiful Rosie Huntington-Whiteley playing along side Shia LaBeouf. This movie added some serious effects to it with the robots. just like the first two it combines an action/love/comedy attribute. The action scenes in this movie are without a doubt awesome. The effects they used are amazing and to sort of let you catch up with whats happening they use slow motion to let you see things that are going on.

"OK I admit, it's the best of the bunch, so far.","It's sort of funny. Unlike most others, I don't mind big and overblown Michael Bay's movies at all. However his Transformers movies always have been ones that I could never really enjoy watching, while they are the biggest and most overblown Michael Bay movies out there.Reason as to why I liked this movie far better than the previous two Transformers movies is because this time around I could actually understand what was going on, on screen and with its story. Not that it's well written or a terribly clever story but I at least could understand all that was going on. I don't even remember all that much about the first two Transformers movies, because they seemed terribly random with its story and got told very messily.But really, this is not the only thing that this movies does better than any of its predecessors. Also for the first time ever I truly got a sense of it that the Autobots and Decepticons were at a full scale war with each other. And what a war it was! Visually and with its special effects, this movie is truly a great and spectacular one! The battles have never looked bigger or better and overall they also have a more type of special-effects vibe to it this time.So both the Autobots and Decepticons work out better in the story, this time around but so do all of its human characters. Thing that really annoyed me about the first two movies was how it seemed to focus way too much on the human characters, while they didn't even seemed to fit into its story all that well. In this movie it all works out way better. The human plot lines are just as 'good' and 'interesting' as that of the Transformers and all of the story lines besides feel more connected to each other and less random. It definitely makes the movie more enjoyable to watch and it makes you forget that it's almost 3 hours long as well.Of course there is still plenty to complain about. The action and interaction between the humans and Transformers still feels a bit awkward at times really and so does its comedy. It's shocking how lame and totally out of place its humor is at times. Another thing that started to annoy me after a while were its slow-motion moments. Really, what was up with that? Sometimes they would go on for ever and ever, without a real good reason for it and it became laughable, instead of awesome, like it was supposed to be. Also it was weird that you kept hearing all of the Transformers voices crisp and clear, no matter how much noise there was. Things like this bugged me, as did its simplistic story of course.And does the presence of Frances McDormand or John Malkovich add a lot to the movie? Not really but they got obviously put in to give the movie a more serious status, as if this time things would be different and more focused on its story and acting, while this of course really wasn't the case at all.But still, do all of these things really matter for a movie of this sort? This is simple entertainment and at entertaining this movie does not fail. Say what you will about Michael Bay but he is a guy that can make a $200,000,000 movie, of which you can see every cent back on the screen. The action is simply amazing and absolutely spectacular at times. They came up with some good set pieces, which also gives the movie a true sense of war and intensity. Really, this movie is already worth seeing for its action and special effects alone.Simply enjoy it for what it is; a big dumb, overblown, action movie, that simply entertains and brings plenty of visually great excitement to the screen to enjoy.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Product Placements and Ducklips,"OK, let's be fair to this movie. The special effects were great -- assuming you can suspend your belief in physics long enough to enjoy them. The rest of this movie was awful.The product placements for Lenovo, Cisco, Waste Management and Chevy Impala were overwhelming. There was a product placed in almost every scene, and the sheer SIZE of the logo overshadowed most scenes. It was brutal, even for Michael Bay.And the leading woman (I refuse to look her name up for this review) - the giant implants she had in her lips gave her that permanent ""duck- lip"" look. Gross.It's sad to see so much of Hollywood's money go to tripe like this. There must be better things to fund.2/10, and all of the ""2"" is special effects.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great end to the Transformers trilogy!!!,"Despite the negative reviews by critics, this film is packed with classic Michael Bay and Transformers action. From start to finish a great movie, it has great chemistry between the characters and the robots, with an awesome storyline that really makes you think. There are several minor blips and mistakes I noticed, but they do not take away from movie at all. I would say it is slightly better than the first film and a lot better than the second one. Like Michael Bay said the film could go bigger than the second so bringing it back into a small arena was an added bonus. the 3D was also a nice addition to the movie added to the immersing experience. Nonetheless I am a fan of the trilogy and plan on seeing it again. I recommend anyone who is a fan of explosions, non stop action, and comedy to see this film, maybe even twice!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Witwicky The Movie!,"Witwicky The Movie! Once again, Transformers is not focused to the Transformers but focused to a human being named Sam Witwicky. This is why I never liked Michael Bay's Transformers. This is why I already predicted ""Revenge of the Fallen"" will fail two years ago because the movie is not interested with Optimus. How can this series be called Transformers if it doesn't have enough Transformers? The Autobots only appear when there are Decepticons attacking and the preachy scenes about them. If there's no action, there's the life of Witwicky. His life is never interesting but the film just wants us to show how important it is. How about less Witwicky and more Optimus? Would it make the film better? I guess so.Transformers movies never gets a good story. But we still watch these movies for the Autobots and the explosion and the loud noises. Fact: The scenes of the Autobots only exist in the action scenes and the important scenes about them. The rest is all Witwicky and his chick and his uninteresting & unimportant life. There are new Transformers in this film but we never get to know them because it doesn't only have new Transformers, it also have excessive cameos. These celebrity cameos has more screen time than the robot newbies.The special effects were the only merits of this trilogy. All the transforming, all the robots, all the explosions, all the stuff jumping off the screen. Another Fact: The 3D is ""DARKER of the Moon"". We sure love the action and the explosion but the climax is focused to Sam Witwicky's survival again, and the soldiers and Witwicky again and his new girlfriend and Witwicky then Patrick Dempsey(not spoilers dude) and Witwicky. It's all Witwicky! Yeah, there's Optimus and Bumblebee but mostly focused to Witwicky and the humans.Saddest thing is, the scenes of Bumblebee were also moderated. He is the only Autobot in the series we know the most and loved but here he is now like Optimus and the rest of the Transformers. Why can't they just call these films ""Sam and the Transformers"" or ""World Invasion: Chicago and Egypt and LA and other places where the Transformies went""? Sounds more credible than ""Transformers"". I'm not really trolling Shia LaBeouf but him as Witwicky is like playing the same roles all over again. I bet he love Michael Bay for giving him these hot chicks. Rosie Huntington-Whitely was only cast for her sexy body and giving Sam a backup. She doesn't improve Megan Fox's Mikaela Beans.Transformers is supposed to be about the Transformers. But it has more humans, and Witwicky, and Cameos and Witwicky. I think Michael Bay is getting lazy. He's not taking this movie so seriously and the movie ends too quickly and he throws a lot of humanity and celebrity cameos in his excessive runtime. By the way this movie is called ""Transformers"" not ""Human Celebrities"". Well, Bay made a grave mistake.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Still Entertaining, But This Time Lacking In Punch","I have to give director Michael Bay a great deal of credit in this Transformers series. He manages to make three movies that are basically all just carbon copies of each other and make them all at the very least entertaining. That is no small feat. Thus, although the luster of the franchise begins to wear off (especially towards the film's conclusion) in this installment, ""Dark of the Moon"" still is an entertaining romp that won't leave you bored.For a basic plot summary, ""Dark of the Moon"" formulates the notion that the Apollo 11 moon landing was merely a ""smokescreen"" for the retrieval of alien (i.e. Transformer) technology. Many years later, this technology predictably falls into the wrong hands and leaves the fate of the world to Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his military buddies (Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, & John Turturro).The positives of this movie are the usual: the special effects are a spectacle to behold, the action/adventure is pulse-pounding, and it is just a visual treat to watch. More importantly, though, is that the franchise still goes as LaBeouf goes. Though his exuberance for the Sam Witwicky role seems to have diminished just a bit (and perhaps that can be attributed to the character's aging as well), but his scenes are still the best of the experience.Sadly, this movie also has a few notable ""misses"" that render it only slightly above average. First of is the utter exclusion of Megan Fox's character. I realize that Fox had a falling-out with Bay and wanted nothing to do with this movie, but the fact remains is that her stand-in (supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) has nowhere near that great romantic chemistry with LaBeouf. Rose is just as ""bombshell"" as Fox, but acting-wise it isn't even close.Also, in this third go-'round, the general plot begins to get the slightest bit old. It is never boring, per se, but it doesn't have that ""edge"" like the first two did when the characters were still fresh.Overall, ""Dark of the Moon"" is a decent effort that doesn't end up boring in any way. The exclusion (and no explanation) of Fox is the biggest missing piece here, but other than that it is pretty much ""same old story"" (with just slightly less enthusiasm all around).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More of the same from Micheal Bay,"The Transformers franchise has got to be one of the most infuriating in all of Hollywood. On the one hand, you have some of the most exciting and innovative action set pieces, not to mention some seriously impressive CGI which really sells the idea of robots disguised as various transport vehicles. On the other hand, you have some of the most excruciating dialogue this side of Twilight, corny humour which would make your dad cringe, and a guarantee of a bum numbing running time of at least 2 and a half hours.And so it makes sense that Transformers: Dark Of The Moon follows the exact same template as the previous 2 movies. The action is fun, the CGI is the best it has ever been and the script is completely nonsensical. The story, for what it is, revolves around the 1969 moon landing. In Bay's universe, Neil Armstrong and Co. landed on the moon, but rather than being a simple exploration mission, they were actually researching a possible alien sighting. This of course turns out to be an old Transformer – one which the Decepticons (the bad guys) have been searching for and it's up to the Autobots (the good guys) to stop them. That's about it really, but Micheal Bay manages to pad out the story with a wholly unnecessary subplot involving Sam Witwicky and his low self esteem. It's as exciting as it sounds and only serves to distract from the admittedly impressive action.This is the main problem with this, and the other Transformer movies; it's just too long. There are a number of misguided attempts at humour and Sam's love interest has all the charisma of a cardboard box. And yet, by the time the epic 45 minute finale kicks in, you will forget about all the wasted time and revel in the destruction that he so masterfully weaves as the Decepticons launch a full on invasion of Chicago. It's easily the best extended sequence of the entire franchise and would have benefited even more if we didn't have to wade trough so much unnecessary exposition.A disappointing entry, in that Micheal Bay doesn't appear to have learnt from his previous mistakes. The good news is, he has also not lost his flair for explosive action and, in these moments, Transformers: Dark Of The Moon is every bit as entertaining as its prequels.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why do people hate this movie?!,"First of all, I'm 34 years old and as a kid I was a huge Transformers TV show fan. Back in 2007 when they said there will be a transformers film I was kind of excited, I loved the idea. When I went to see the movies I was very very very disappointed. The robots look nothing like the cartoon, the story was different, Megatron's voice was different, Shia LaBeouf was awful - It was a bad movie.OK, sometimes things can get better, I went to see the second one. By all means those were 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. Transformers 2 was a total disaster. No plot whatsoever, Megan Fox's body was being thrown on us for the film to succeed, about a million goofs and mistakes regarding ""the big war in Egypt"" - (Believe me, I know, I'm an Egyptian).I thought of giving Mr.Bay a last chance. I went to the movie with very low expectations and then....WOW. By far the best movie of the trilogy. It had a nice story, some twists, AMAZING CGI - no more shaky cameras, you can now witness every fight in clear detail. The music was fantastic (although ripped off, a little mix between The Dark Knight and Inception). Shia LaBeouf surprisingly was actually good. The movie is a summer blockbuster, it's a two and a half hour thrilling action ride with a lot of scenes that will make you drop your jaw and bite your fingernails. Why do critics hate it? Have no Idea. Please people don't talk about plot holes and wrong scientific facts, this is a movie about talking robots that have feelings, so I think we're already past the scientific and logical point! I gave this an 8 because I had to drop 2 points for the movie's biggest fault - Miss ""lips"" Rosie - She can't act, I didn't give a damn about her and to be honest, she is NOT hot. Megan was totally HOT.Don't wait to rent the DVD. You will not waste your money, if you like action, thrilling scenes, have an ear to music and most of all - like the Transformers, go see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A solid entry that, much like its female star, is nice to lack at but lacks real substance. Skip the first hour and its incredible.","After the critical back-lashing Revenge of the Fallen, Michael bay stated that the third and possibly final Transformers would take away everything that failed in the last movie and give the audience what it wanted. But has he learned his lessons? Yes and no. Gone are the racially insensitive robots, the incredibly messy and clumsy plotting and much of the dizzying, incomprehensible camera-work. What remains is the poor geeky humour and questionable performances from the leads. Shia Labeouf was very enjoyable in the first movie but here has gone into overdrive, and his character Sam Witwicky has become much less relatable and interesting. His home life in particular (of which the first half of the movie focuses) is getting irritating. His girlfriend problems and embarrassing parents boring and we really couldn't care that much about how he feels unappreciated for saving the world twice. Then there's Megan Fox's replacement: Rosie Huntington-Whitely. She can't act. At all. It wasn't expected that the former model would be that great but she really is poor.The first hour of the film is much like Rosie. Nice to look at (especially in 3D) but lacking any substance at all. We are left with Ken Jeong doing his Hangover thing in a 12A film, and not being funny, just very annoying. And John Malkovich doing his thing but really just embarrassing himself. There are reams of exposition, while the plot is better than the last two films it is still handed out poorly. Bay won't let the action tell the story, it has to be action, break, story, break, action. The rest of the first hour is just CGI and Shia going mental while Rosie watches blankly.But all of a sudden the supporting comic actors are dropped and Michael Bay does what he does best: Explosions and fighting. An impressive freeway chase leading into a fight a plot twist (yes a plot twist in a Transformers movie) and a death of a significant character. The whole film gets better from here. The plotting gets tighter, John Tuturro and Frances McDormand are given more screen-time (there were so many Coen favourites in this movie I was expecting John Goodman to be voicing an Autobot) and the action is dished out in spades. Whe the decepticons invade Chicago all hell breaks loose. And we are given fights, battles, explosions and collapsing buildings galore. Robots kick, punch and rip each other apart. And this is where the third dimension comes into play. This is definitely the best 3D experience since Avatar. Watch in awe as Optimus Prime tears chunks of metal out of other giant robots and chucks them at the screen while in the depths of the background, aerial battles ensue. It is breathtaking and a triumph for 3D, proving that it can be done properly and amaze the viewer.If you went an hour late to the movie, and make sure it's a 3D screening, this would be a 5 star experience of pure entertainment. But as it stands it's still a solid closer for the trilogy, an improvement on Revenge of the fallen but not as good as the first.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good demonstration on how to destroy a movie.,"What an Awful display of commercialized cinema, playing to the tunes of all the wrong stereotypes. A horrible waste of time, effort and money, specially since a lot of effort must have gone into the graphics only to produce this distasteful parody of sorts. This is what you get when you make a movie without passion or substance. Anyway, I intended to ask this question since the first part. What is the point of having a chick running around in these types of movies? Really, is it necessary to have some chick in skimpy clothes romancing around with metal crashing on metal in the background ? Unless off-course you wanted to woo schoolgirls in to watch the movie. My serious advise is, if you have to finish with watching the 3rd installment, rent it.

"It's Michael Bay: Explosions, CGI, sexy women, comic relief, explosions sunlight, romantic faith, explosions, CGI, explosions, CGI...","Michael Bay's TRANSFORMERS franchise has become an enormous commercial success, and although the second installment received terrible reviews, it ain't gonna avoid people from rushing to see the third one. Now, it looks and feels exactly the other two films, in reality very little is changed upon so what we're given is a semi-mixed version of the first two, and that's sadly not a good thing. TRANSFORMERS 3 involves some spectacular CGI effects, and the more time director Bay shares with the robots not involved, the better the film is, which is kind of surprising given his experience. Megan Fox has been replaced by a high-heeled beauty which gives the teenage boys an alternate run for their money, and Shia LeBeouf in the leading part does a moderately good job, and as for the rest of the cast, it's not very much to say except that John Malkovich is funny in his scenes. The plot is as always very confusing and badly told, and the climax is long and noisy, which one can say is positive, though again - I felt tired at the end, being the film is very loud and way too long (a huge Michael Bay issue).

I personally think this is the worst of the three,"I liked the first Transformers, and while it did have its problems the second was better than I expected. I came into the cinema not expecting much, but I left feeling very underwhelmed. Other than the amazing effects, authentic sound, quite excellent action and above average cinematography and editing, this Transformers entry was a waste of time in my opinion.In my opinion Transformers:Dark of the Moon is the dullest and worst of the three. The first half is poorly paced and dull to the point of boredom, and while the second half fares much better due to the action it came too late and wasn't enough to stop the film from becoming a messy bore overall. The dialogue is stupid and formulaic, the film is much too long and the story is choppy and confused complete with a messy ending.Michael Bay's direction is another low point, it is murky and unfocused throughout, while the characters are either underused(the robots) or annoying(John Tuturro's character). The acting is not great at all, the voice work is decent, however John Malkovich is wasted, Shia LaBoeuf's easy going charm doesn't disguise the fact his performance is uncharismatic and dull, Patrick Dempsey(performance and character) is useless, John Tuturro tries hard but ends up over-compensating and the less said about the lovely but bland replacement for Megan Fox Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, the better.All in all, a mess and the worst of the three. 3.5/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Expecting a total failure, but then...","First of all, I'm not a big fan of Transformers.

But I have to say with all honesty the third on was pretty cool. The effects were great (as always) the last hour is just ONE BIG WAR (I don't count that as a spoiler since i wont tell you who's winning, but take a guess ;) ) the camera shots were pretty good and actually for me thats all that counts for a good transformers movie.Of course the story is stupid and the characters are completely forgettable, but come on who walks into transformers expecting a high class script? I went to the movie to see explosions, cool fights between robots and maybe a nice (pretty hot) new Megan Fox, and thats exactly what I got.So for all those who can ignore a story full of plot holes and forgettable characters (eventhough I like ShiaLaBeouf) and just want to see some nice heavy action robot fights you sure won't be disappointed",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Eyegasmic ! But an Intellectual BORE !,You go in this movie with fingers crossed tightly on both hands and wish only that Mr. Bay does not screw this up.

While the second half is a testosterone overdose pumping on adrenalin .

Why so much hate? this is really good!,"This is really good movie and yes it does have its flaws, but what movie does not? These films are more focused on CGI and action. The plot is smart and is not to hard to follow. I think all of the people are likable in this film. Even though i do miss Megan Fox. As the new actress who plays Carly adds nothing to the film, but like in most action movie, you need a bit of eye candy and a female lead. The action is amazing in my eyes. And the script is not as bad as people make out. But i think it suits the film. People slate this film for all reasons. But is a classic in its own ways. It is just a good fun film.

The Dark Side of the Moon,"Optimus Prime: You may lose faith in us, but never in yourselves.First off, I must say that this movie was not as good or better than the first (4.5/5) was far superior to the notoriously bad sequel (and Worst Picture winner) known to many as ""Revenge of the Fallen"", or ""TF2"" (2/5).Now, lets decrypt this film so that we may know the good and the bad;BAD The script by Ehren Kruger was poor. The dialogue and cheesy and unnecessary one-liners (Optimus while flying: I'M COMING TO SAVE YOU! from 1000 meters away) are abundant here, but this is a ""Transformers"" film, but it still seemed to have slight resemblances to RotF, which it was said it would try to stay away from. Its not bad, but it sort of degrades the quality a tad bit, preventing it from being on-par with the first. Rosie Huntington-Whitley's acting in the film was poor as well, but that was expected, especially since she was probably just picked straight out of a Victoria's Secret magazine, especially since she models for them and was chosen just to look pretty and just have a big sign on her forehead saying, ""HEY GUYS, I'M REPLACING MEGAN FOX!"". She was the only really ""bad"" actor I witnessed throughout the film. Comment if you wish to try to educate me about everything else (I do agree that Wheelie and his buddy, while helpful in the movie, are still obnoxious, but less obnoxious than the dreaded Twins).GOOD Well, the humor of the first is back (no fart/ball/weed/kid jokes, mainly the type of humor from the first), and it was actually enjoyable instead of stupid like the second (and Sam's parents are slightly restrained also, participating only in the first half). The score is excellent, reminding me a little of the ""Inception"" score a bit, and Michael Bay did an awesome job directing the action sequences (my favorite part was when the paratroopers jumped out of the planes and flew through the city to find Decepticons to fight), but not very well with the plot scenes (although it was slightly more coherent than TF2).Also, the last hour of the movie, which starts with the climax of the brutal destruction of Chicago and DC (Megatron destroys the Lincoln Memorial and sits upon his throne, which I found somewhat ironic), and ends when the long battle is over, especially in 3D, makes up for the gaping flaws.FINAL VERDICT Compared the the first, its only average, but compared to the second, its like the first. It was a bit cliché at the beginning and the end, but the last hour makes up for some of it. I would give it a 3/5 (a B-), but I'll amp it up to a 3.5 just because it met my expectations.It was some good fun, and the 3D is quite good.

I thought that plot wise, the second movie is better but the visual effects on this one took the cake.

"Not as good as 1 part, but better but the 2nd","There has been a lot of discussions about this movie so I will try to keep it short.I will first describe what I didn't like in the movie, and then move on to the good parts and things I liked.First of all - lovely Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. She is gorgeous, but she can't play. At least she didn't in this movie. I bet she tried, but what we have is just horrible, and there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Shia Lebeouf's to the point I couldn't actually believe that Witwicky digs her character. It really bothered me throughout the movie. I mean, we have Turturro who overdoes his part but for one I'm fond of him, and two - he does that deliberately and winks to the audience while doing it. I understand that, it's just an action-figure movie. Yet what Rosie delivers is dramatic, and would be in anything more than, let's say, a Brazilian TV soap opera.Sigh. Alright, let's move forward. I'll just point out that the story, while making more sense than in the previous part, is still rather so - so. While everything is fine with the dark side of the moon and the general core of the plot, there are little inconsequences and simply daft scenario cuts that make it, at times, just disturbing to watch (whole issue of government handling the situation, Malkovic and Jeong characters). Not to mention we are lead by the hand throughout whole movie so while there are some major twists - you just can't be surprised when they finally happen.So what's good? As always - humor and visuals. I mean the battle at second part of the movie is truly epic. The mega-mecha-worm cutting through buildings, the air scenes with skydivers, dang, those are some really creative effects that were never tried before in any other action movie, and they are top quality too.So why rate it so high? 7/10.C'mon, it's a movie about giant robots!

Totally heartbroken as my other friends enjoyed the movie in 3d. well let first give you the overall negative & positive comments of the movie in my opinion.Negative pointsWhere is Megan fox ? if I would have Michael bay, would have done anything to get her back in this third installment & made her role much better that European chick.Was there a need of the Chinese guy in the movie director bay, I don't think so ! Megatron & Starscream were total waist in the movie, their role is not at not convincing as in previous installments.Ratchet share the screen presence for not more than a minute in the entire movie.The movie would have been better without Epps in my opinion. Bay just got him the movie to show the link between previous installments . Movie looses grip in the last 40 minutes due to excess of action & as their weren't much use of dialogues in the end.What's the need of that European chick running around in the battle ? I could see the glimpse of war of the worlds & other alien invasion movies in this film.I personally hate that scene so much the fight between Sam & Starscream, it does'nt make any sense & very unbelievable.Positive pointsThe movie begins breathless, Autobots ark crashing on the moon & Apollo 11 sent to moon to investigate. Brilliant move Bay.Good thing that Bay rid of Rc twins, which was pleasure to my eyes & ears .Some new robots in Autobots, Que , Dino & Rackers. I became an instant fan of Dino, when he first transformers in the Middle East illegal nuclear site & his words. Way to go bay.Bumble bee is been upgraded with its design & now he can even shoot without getting transformed. Way to go bay.Optimus Prime as usual brilliant in the movie & carries the movie on his shoulders specially after getting betrayed by Sentinel Prime. He is being upgraded to with fly tech.The introduction of new Decepticon Shockwavewooooooo my new fav in Decepticons & makes me his fan with its first arrival.Laserbeak & Soundwave looks good on screen too.Sentinel Primes looks perfect as a villain against Optimus prime & much more powerful too & has been given the perfect voice to his role.Shia has improved with his acting skills in this movie, & proves that transformers is no where without him.Agent Simmons at its best again in this movie, brings smile on my face with his introduction in this movie.Mearing role is perfect for this movie, looks more powerful way strict. She share an important screen presence in the movie.The movie has got some of the best action sequences in the entire transformers series, my personal favourite, the highway battle my gosh what a chase I literally felt that I am actually inside the movie. 3 Decepticons chasing Sentinel & bumblebee, sideswipe & Dino in action. Ultimate action chase. Dino steals the show in this particular part. The best part of this chase is the background score, special thanks to my fav music composer Steve. The music touches my soul deeply every time I hear it & it suits the chase perfectly. I actually watch this particular everyday. The best action sequence in the entire transformers seriers. Masterpiece bay.Ironhide the tuff autobots does it again in the Mexican stand off & so does the sideswipe.Linkin park does it again giving another theme song for this movie, way soulful.Steve as usual give the best background score once again.This movie in my opinion could have been much better if bay & Ehren would have work more harder on the script cause I totally believe this movie could have been the best in the entire series but as usual its been ruined in many ways. If this movie would have been directed by Spielberg it could have been much better. If your planning to make a 4th one then bay please please take all your time work on the script & make a good transformers. No doubt about the effects in the movie but still you got to work on the script & screenplay. But still the movie is highly enjoyable in many ways & I loved it. As a huge transformers fan I rate it as 9 on the scale of 10 specially that highway chase which was breathless.The movie has got the best trailer ever i have ever seen. I am definitely going to buy the 3d bluray.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Watch it for the Robots,"The human characters in the movie are pretty boring especially in the first quarter of the movie. The new actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley fails to add much substance, her lips a ridiculously huge and she fails to hold more than one expression. In fact, she should really ask for a refund on her botched Botox job.But who cares, we are there to watch the robots and we do get loads of action. Optimus gets extended screen time to kick some major ass and the whole apocalyptic war theme goes well with the action sequences.Do not over analyze the plot and just sit enjoy the experience. Definitely worth a watch!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"There will be days when we lose faith, days when our allies turn against us. But the day will never come, that we forsake this planet and its people.","So the final film in the Michael Bay Transformers trilogy now is up for review. In my opinion the first film set some solid ground work for what Michael Bay wanted to do. Sadly in the second movie it all fell apart. Some like to blame the writers strike that was going on during that time, I think that is a cop out, and a bad one at that. Thankfully Dark of the Moon brings the franchise back to the roots of the original film. Light humor, average acting, but fantastic action scenes. This is my review of Transformers: Dark of the Moon.This is the third Transformers film directed by Michael Bay, and while I did trash his effort in part two of this series, I must admit they really rebounded amazingly. He took the heavy criticisms of the second film, mainly being that the humor was over the top and the film was light on action, and made this film better because of those criticisms. The action is heavy in this film, even more so than the first film. Sure there are slow spots here and there while they build up the story, but overall this is a nicely paced film. I love a great final battle scene, and while the summer blockbusters have been mainly stale in that area, Dark of the Moon fully delivers in that aspect as the final battle ranges from a good thirty to forty minutes I would say. That is very impressive.Ehren Kruger returns from the ashes of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, and is in fact the only writer who returned from that awful film. Also, Kruger is the only writer on this film. Much like the first film in the franchise, if you are expecting an Oscar winning script, you simply will not find it here. Kruger's script holds up nicely, and he really redeems himself after the mess of the prior film. The over the top humor is replaced with much more timely humor that works very well for the most part. The pacing of the action scenes are far better as well. With only a few slow downs in the story, Kruger is really able to hold our attention very nicely over the course of this two and a half hour film. While it is hard to say if this film was overall better written than the first film in this series, Kruger's effort is still top notch for this amazing summer blockbuster.Overall this film was a fantastic way to end the first trilogy for the Transformers series. Personally I must say this film is slightly above the first film, but even still, it is just barely. So fans of these Transformers live action films, this franchise as a whole is pretty good for what it has set out to be. Sure there are some like even myself who would want a Cybertron War movie, but in due time I suppose.7.4/10While this is the end of the Sam Witwicky story, the Transformers will return in Transformers: Age of Extinction.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Please avoid folks if you are above 12,"There are basically 2 problems with this movie -1. It lacks a soul. 2. It doesn't know where to stop and goes on and on till you simply wanna remove your 3D goggles and run for your dear life.This is what happens when you spend absurd amount of money on special effects, stunts...but forget what actually makes a movie special - a gripping story-line with actors that can actually carry it through. In the end it feels like a cartoon movie without the essence of a Tom-n-Jerry sense of humor.

"Good effects, but unnecessary long movie","The movie tries to keep up with the sequence of Transformers' movies of the last years, though is the lower of the three in quality.It begins with what it seems a good base story, but quickly leaves this aside, and moves into the action scenes we'll watched hundreds of times.The movie is about 80% scenes of action and most of them are unnecessary long sequences, that will lead to another long action scene, over and over.Most performances are poor and the movie has a lot of fails. It lacks of a convincing argument, and it ends up being just another almost-boring Sci-Fi movie.I've got the feeling that they could keep making these movies for ever.Recommended if you (like me) are wanting to watch some good visual effects. Awful if you want to watch an average movie.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Popcorn Action,"This is the best of the transformers films in my opinion. The special effects held up well after ten years. The directing and some dialogue could be better, but there are great scenes that have beautiful visuals. Rosie Huntington Whitley is stunning, the cars are beautiful and there are scenes with elegant visuals. Some of the jokes will probably be dated in the near future and theres alot of product placement. It can be somewhat exploitive of Rosie Huntington Whitley as she is essentially eye candy and a damsel in distress, but she does SOME stuff. The cast is preety A list however for a threequel. Shia Labeuf plays Sam as quirky as ever in this one but hes trying to prove himself more as a hero. John Malkovitch, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Patrick Dempsey, Frances Mcdormand, and Alan Tudyk all have great character performances. Hugo weaving and Leonord Nimoy do a fantastoc job as well. Sentinel Prime is a well rounded character. Much of the action is mechanical and explosive but theres alot of sci fi action as well such as dogfighting spaceships, carchaces, gunfights with lasers, and disaester scenes. It doesnt have a good ending either and kind of cuts off at the end, but; everyones arcs are preety fullfilled. It also has one of the best alien invasion scenes, I feel. The Autobot designs are preety cool though a bit stereotypical when it comes to race, theres an italian, and two celtic sounding robots which really doesnt make sense if they are aliens from another planet. Rhe Decepticons have cool designs as well. Theres also a few plot holes but nothing that interferes with the story. Its mainly a movie you watch for entertainment and action, theres a few emotional moments like the begining scenes and a few with Sam but the human side of the story isnt as fun to watch. I do like how the antagonists are dark shadows to the protagonists. Its also probably the most rewatchable, american, giant-robot film besides maybe the Iron Giant. Id say if you have time to kill and want a movie to watch on maybe a work night or a lazy day I would recomend this.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A little better than 2009's sequel,"So many changes, so little progress. As the conclusion to the Transformers trilogy, this second sequel was better than Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, but not everything was tweaked as tight as it should have been. There were changes and there weren't. As stated before in my last two reviews of this franchise, there are three components that have stayed the same for these three films. These three components are the music, action and special effects.The music, still composed by Steve Jablonsky; good work. The action; still big, loud and bold. The special effects; still cool to watch robots transform and fight. Not much to be said because that kind of stuff has been standardized now. The autobots and decepticons are still voiced by their respective voice-actors. One decepticon I found really cool was Shockwave. A real robot I don't think anyone would want to mess with. Here are the changes and for the most part they are positive things.First, Megan Fox has been replaced with Victoria's Secret model, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who plays Sam Witwicky's new main squeeze, Carly. It's not that I find her bad at acting but she doesn't cut out being a tomboy like character as Megan Fox made out in the first two. Plus, Carly's clothing ceases to get dirty throughout the whole running time of the film. Oh and let's not forget that she runs around in high-heels.The next piece to change was the tone of this sequel. For once, the film crew heard what fans and audiences wanted and they followed up on it. Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) actually has less of a comedic feel. People will actually be killed on screen. It won't be blood and guts but the audience will actually see them die. Also the two loud- mouthed autobots were removed from the story as well. Thank you for listening Ehren Kruger.However, I am still frustrated over the fact that Kruger did give Simmons (John Turturro) a larger than needed role and still gave Shia LaBeouf's role the lines, ""You scream here, here, here and..."". I'm done with the runaround. I don't know how others who tolerate it can sit through it and say that's good acting. It's noise. The explosions are more fun to listen to than that.The second transformers sequel has some improvements over its previous follow up but it still lacks the greatness of the first.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Major Improvement Over FALLEN,"REVENGE OF THE FALLEN was an abomination. Seriously, it was crap. I was a fan of the first TRANFORMERS movie, but the second was almost enough for me to write off the series completely. Now, I understood that there was a lot of behind-the-scenes trouble during the second movie's development/production, so when the time came that the third movie, DARK OF THE MOON, was to be released I could barely muster any interest. I almost passed on it, but I enjoyed the first movie enough and the reviews coming out claiming that the third film was actually decent blockbuster fodder convinced me to give it a shot. I did, and I'm happy to say that it was a lot better than I expected. Not good enough to rank as one of the best movies of 2011, but fun enough that I haven't totally given up hope on the franchise (because let's be honest, this series isn't done yetnot while it keeps making bank at the box office). In this movie, it's explained that America's sudden eagerness to reach the moon during the 60's space race was the result of a mysterious craft's crash landing. The first men to walk on the moon discovered a Cybertronian secret that would remain buried for decades. In present day, Optimus Prime and the Autobots are angered to discover that the humans have been keeping this secret from them and demand access to the craft and it's contents. We discover that the craft is the Ark, a ship sent from Cybertron during the war containing a secret to ensure the continuing survival of the Cybertronian race.For starters, I should mention that the story in this movie is actually coherent. It's amazing how much better things turn out when your writers aren't on strike. The plot is pretty slim (though I love the premise: integrating man's first landing on the moon with the Transformers canon), but that's to be expected in a movie where the big interest is the visuals. If there's one thing that can be counted on in a Transformers movie, it's that the CG will be spectacular. They've had three movies to perfect these effects, so yeah, they're pretty awesome. Quick complaint about the CG: the computer-generated JFK. It sucked and stuck out horribly. The Transformers themselves look great and the action is seamless and intense. The battles in this movie are done a lot better than in the previous movie because you can actually see what is going on. With that said, I've got to saythe fights in this movie are pretty brutal. I was surprised. I mean, the whole series is based on a collection of children's toys and a cartoon. When the Transformers fight in this movie, robots are being dismembered. ""Blood"" is spurting. Death gurgles. Heads ripped off and even a ""spine"" being ripped out. Seriously, you replace the robots with humans in this movie and you've got a hard-R rated action film. I'm not complaining, I'm justwow. A bit out of place but pretty cool nonetheless.There's a lot of action in this movie. The last 45 minutes in the movie is a non-stop action sequence as Sam and the Autobots infiltrate a Decepticon-devastated Chicago. But, unlike the overlong action ending in REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, this one entertains. The majority of the regular cast returns here: Shia LeBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, etc. Even Sam's parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) get some screen time, though mercifully less than in the second movie. The only one missing is Megan Fox. Oh well. Her character was nothing more than eye candy in both of the first movies so, plot-wise, she won't be missed. Nope, director Michael Bay merely replaced her with a different piece of eye candy, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. A Victoria's Secret model, Rosie's acting history is limited. But that's OK, because the only thing this character needs to do in Michael Bay's Transformer movies is look good in slow motion and show off the goods when necessary. And that's all she does. Mission accomplished? Speaking of Michael Bay, I guess he's had a good run with the Transformers series but, in my opinion, it's time for him to let go. Let another director have a chance to bring these larger-than-life robots to the big screen. He's done well (ok, except for FALLEN) but his shtick is getting stale. His obsession with the military is becoming overbearing in these movies. I get it, he likes the armed forces and has some friends inside that let him use the cool stuff. But I didn't come to this movie to see Bay's military toys, I came to watch giant robots kick each other's butts. Enough, man. I also think the character of Sam Witwicky has run his course. Let him remain as a supporting character in future films, but pass the torch to a new leading man. New director, new characters, more robots. Time for an overhaul. Well, time will tell where this series will go in the future (and there's already a release date scheduled for a fourth film). On the bright side, DARK OF THE MOON was fun enough that I'm willing to see another in theaters. If you were a fan of the first movie, then DARK OF THE MOON probably won't disappoint you.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Outstanding,"Transformers 3 is a breathtaking, intellectually stimulating piece of cinema.The script was incredibly well-written with Optimus Prime sporting unforgettable lines such as ""YOU DIE NOW"" and ""KILL EVERYONE"".Shia LaBeouf showcases his excellent acting skills; you feel he truly engages with his character by screaming for 155 minutes. Indeed, Rosie Huntington Whiteley's acting debut was particularly interesting; never have I seen an actress perform so breasts.The action scenes were a treat to behold - each explosion looked radically different from the last and really provided the film with an emotional edge. You really start to sympathise with all those poor buildings being shattered to pieces.All in all, one of the best films I've seen in years. A true landmark in cinematic history.

"Yes, it's that great!","I never thought I would find this one beautiful. I've never been a fan of the first and second one, but I like them nonetheless. When I found out my Mom was going to make me watch this, I had low expectations.But after I watched the film, I realized I was wrong. The movie pulls it off. I never thought I would like this one but ended up LOVING it. This is a simple tale of freedom and the will to claim it against all odds. The acting was top-notch, and I have to give Rosie Huntington-Whiteley due credit for making a great performance which is not bad for a first-timer. Shia was as usual excellent and so were the other actors. Their performances complement the simplistic storyline to give it a kick it deserves.And finally, there are the Autobots and Decepticons. They have been the CGI masterpieces that they are ever since the first one, and now it seems they've just secured their spot as the most charming CG robots on Earth and Cybertron. (Yes, I found even Megatron quite great.) In Dark of the Moon, they are not just rendered robots but somehow, the makers were able to breathe personality and even more life into all of them. Kudos to Michael Bay for directing this great third act to the Transformers franchise. I just wish there is no more 4th film as it might ruin the greatness in the series.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"You tried Mr Bay, and you failed.","I am, without question, a huge transformers fan since childhood. The home i share with my wife is filled with original die-cast metal transformers toys made in the 80's which i display proudly in my home. I have spent large sums of money to get the items i want and countless hours learning about each transformers character and history.In short, i am a transformers purist. This means i want any movie that depicts my childhood heroes to be true to their original characters and soul. This is a bias i must point out so that you the reader understand where i come from in writing this.Michael Bay has come under sharp criticism for how he directed the first two films. It was widely accepted before the third was released, that the original was far superior than the second. Now it is time to explore what Michael Bay did well and not so well in the third.WHAT IT DOES WELL. The films action sequences are superb. One of these scenes in particular is worth the price of admission alone where a number of autobots seek to protect another while driving at high speed on a freeway. More specifically, it is bumblebee's attempt to do battle with passengers on board that is an absolutely magnificent sequence that gave me similar thrills to those i experienced when i saw the car chase sequence in the second Matrix film. To give you an idea, I consider that scene in the Matrix to be one of the best car chase action sequences ever. If you enjoy action films then this movie is a must.Michael Bay does his best to bring some maturity to the plot .There are twists that genuinely add to the drama and draw real surprise and anger (towards the characters) from the viewer - these moments alone allow the film to stand head and shoulders above the second transformers film. The brutality of battle is not censored and the very real sight of human casualties is a welcome realism that was missing in the last two films.The film definitely has its comedic moments. John Malkovich has a welcome and underused role and the banter between Bumblebee and Witwicky is not heard often enough. There was a clear decision to give a less prominent role to Sam Witwicky's parents and i actually believe this was a mistake. Going against the grain i actually found his mother's role and edgy insanity to be funny in the first two films. Regardless, the film managed to have the audience laughing at times more so than the last 2 films.WHERE IT FALLS DOWN The acting is cringeworthy. As i exited the theatre i overheard one woman say to her friend ""would you like some cheese with that?"" and her cynical question nailed it on the head. The film utilises a cliché'd romance between its main star and his sweetheart to motivate many of his actions and it does not work. Their scripted lines are stale and lack any type of edge. More importantly, the Transformers themselves always had enough on their own to sustain a plot. These are machines with souls and the original characters had failings just like humans - these imperfections made them interesting. We do not see it in these Transformers films and the insertion of a romance plus its lack of credible dialogue means we miss out on a big part of the folklore that makes this franchise great.The film does not make a genuine effort to be true to the original transformers. To name but a few let me provide examples:Megatron as a vehicle. To any transformers fan, this is almost unthinkable. Even more maddening is that his being a vehicle is not important to the films plot.Perhaps the most iconic Transformers voice (after Optimus Prime) of Soundwave is not only unlike the original voice, it does not stand out from the other Decepticon voices.This is a criticism of all the films, but do we really believe an advanced Robot race would come to planet earth and have accents as well as metallic beards as they get older?The killing off, so quickly, of some of the very original and most important Transformer characters. We saw it in the first film with Jazz and we see it again in this film.OVERALL Transformers 3 is an action extravaganza worth seeing for the wonderful sequence of battles and use of CGI. The acting, as with the first two is average-to-poor but this film is a genuine improvement on the second and is on-par with the first. For those with little concern for the Transformers history and mythology this is likely to satisfy but one thing is for sure, Michael Bay has failed to satisfy the hardcore fans in his attempt to bring the Transformers to modern day cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Megan Fox Dodged a Bullet!,"Unfortunately, I didn't: I sat through the whole film. Excruciating. You'll need plenty of aspirin to get through the first half of this stinker. If you u-n-w-i-s-e-l-y choose to see it through to the end, bring arsenic.Here's what I liked about the film: I am a fan of Transformers, so I had to see it.Here's what I disliked about the film: the acting was mediocre, at best, as the film was poisoned by the failure to convey the slightest amount of chemistry between Shia LaBeouf and Rosie Alice Huntington-Whiteley. Pathetic. The story--if there is a story--was incoherent. If you feel the need to visit the restroom you won't miss a thing, unless you want to reminisce the musical score from Inception or the many ripped-off lines from Star Trek.

Transformers : Dark side of the Moon,"So who is with me and giving up on listing to some of these so called critics who bash our comic book movies? I say if you're a fan of the transformers show or any other comic book film franchise stand up for it and let your voice be heard. This sci –fi adventure transformers : dark side of the moon stars Shia Labeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Rosie Huntington –Whiteley, and PatrickDempsey.It's directed by Michael Bay and runs 157 minutes.Going into this film i was hoping it would better then revenge of the fallen and it went way beyond that this film was a home run. The Transformers : Dark side of the Moon centers around the autobots learning about a cybertronian spaceship that crashed landed on the moon during the war on cybetron between the Autobots and Decepticons, this space ship holds a secret that could have help the Autobots defeat the decepticons.The secret is held inside an accent autobot leader Sentinel prime who crashed on the moon and prompted the space race of 1969 between the USA and Russia.Sam's life picks up after transformers 2 living in Washington DC trying to find a job after graduating from college living with his new girlfriend Carly(Rosie Huntington –whitely).Megan fox and victories' secrets model Sam is one luck guy.This secret brings SAM (ladies man 261) witwicky back into the fold of the war among the auto bots and decepticons. While working at new job he meets a co worker jerry Wang (ken jeong) who has inside info to the spaceship that crashed on the moon and knew Sam had connections to the auto bots. He gives this information to Sam in an awkward but funny bathroom scene wrestling around in a bathroom stall. When on the way to give this info the CIA, which is headed up by Charlotte mearing (Frances Mcdormand) Sam is attacked by the decepticons at every turn.Sam realizes after some digging what the plan actually is and all hell breaks loose. It's all starts with his girlfriend Carly being kidnapped by her slimy boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) who happens to be an allies of the decepticons and helping them get the secret from the crashed spaceship on the moon.You know regardless of what people think of all the special effects being used nowadays this is one film where it is necessary to explaining the story and bring the characters to life. Michael bay did an outstanding job of bringing this final chapter to life from the battles between the auto bots vs.decepticons to the attack on the CIA facility, and the attack on Chicago and everything in between.If you're expecting any Oscar worthy performances here you went to the film and wasted your money. This is a typical sci- fi action adventure lot of explosions gun fire, buildings collapsing, and aliens. He did a good job adding some new faces to the franchise; it didn't interfere with telling the story at all. Ken Jeong (the hangover) John Malkovich (red) added just the right amount of humor as Sam's co worker, and lunatic boss.Frances Mcdormand felt like she was there all along from the beginning and what can you say about Rosie Huntington –whiteley she made me forget about Megan what's here name.If this indeed is the final chapter in this wildly successful franchise you can say it really went out with bang. It didn't disappoint one bit from beginning to end. I give Transformers: Dark side of the Moon 7out of 10 stars for putting a great product on the big screen.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Argurably better than the first one, and just about anything is better than the second","Well after the last transformers movie (revenge of the fallen) a lot of people lost hope in the transformers series. Actually some people lost hope after the first movie, but I personally liked it.Dark of the moon takes place some time after Revenge of the Fallen, and thank goodness Sam has a new girlfriend. Honestly Megan Fox wasn't really attractive in the last movies and just kind of looked like a... ummm... not going to say slut... but you get the drift. Either way this new girl who is played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who honestly know how to act for not being in any movies before this. I found this surprising that she actually did have some acting talent, and seemed like a better match for Sam's character than Megan... but honestly who really cares about the female role. I WATCH TRANSFORMERS FOR VIOLENCE! Shockingly Dark of the Moon has a plot of sorts (I know this may sound like a stretch for Michael Bay) but it does. The plot isn't real deep or extremely engaging, but it still has one that deals with conspiracies and it actually makes sense. The visuals are over the top in this movie, and honestly the visuals are so good you don't really question if this is real life or not (scary, I know). This movie is much darker compared to the others and there are much less juvenile jokes. That was the biggest problem with the last two movies is that the autobots would do something juvenile like fart, pee on someone, or talk trash. There is a little bit of that in this movie, but much less compared to the others. The most annoying characters from the last movie are gone. Sentinel Prime is voice by Leonard Nimoy which I discovered when watching the movie and I literally turned to the guy next to me ""THAT'S LEONARD NIMOY!"".This movie is really good at being what it is: A very violent robot action movie, with human characters that are there for plot reasons. The human scenes are sometimes funny (a particular bathroom scene) but sometimes they are unrealistic. Like where someone gets shoved out of a window, only to fall to their death. Everyone in the building practically laughs at the guys death, and take pictures. One guy says ""Look there is a dead guy out there, he is literally everywhere, so go clean him up."" at this scene bothered me because it is trying to be funny, but it is so dark that it doesn't make sense.I'm slowly getting to this, but the action in this movie is top notch, along with the 3-D. If you are going to see this movie, see it in 3-D. The action is very detailed, has graphic robot violence, and is very epic. All of the battles are very cool and fun to watch. Seeing humans work together to take down a giant robot is also cool, though sometimes it seems like the humans weapons are overpowered. Like when the humans are using machine guns, you will see chunks of robot fall off. Another impressive battle was a road action sequence which you could compare to the road action sequence in the first movie. The only difference is that this one is bigger, and a lot cooler. The decepticons are in large numbers in this movie, but they seem to be a bit weaker, and Optimus Prime now has a crazy amount of weapons and seems like a total bad-a** when he is mowing down tons of decepticons.The movie has some slight pacing issues, like the ending seems a bit too abrupt, especially if this truly is the last movie then I think there should've been a deeper ending. There are a couple moments in the movie where a whole bunch happens in about 30-seconds. Like the entire decepticon attack was viewed in a montage... slightly disappointing we didn't get to see the whole attack instead of only a couple seconds of it.If you want to see a great action movie, with a fairly good plot then Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the movie for you. If you didn't like the first movie than you might not like this one... you notice I didn't even mention the second movie there? Either way see this movie in 3D and you will definitely enjoy it. Did I mention the ending action sequence is over an hour long?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I was insulted by the first two films...,"Transformers was a horrible script with bad direction and annoyingly terrible performances. Transformers 2 only made things worse. Jokes and humour only funny to children with language and sexual references aimed at a much older audience, it was a mess.Now you could say; 'Why then, if you hated the first two films, would you go to the theatre to see the third?' I have a six year old brother who is obsessed with Tranformers. He is going to see the movie either way. So I thought it best if he was going to a 3 hour long abortion by Micheal Bay in the theatre, I might as well be there to support him.It begins like just another sequel and goes on for about an hour with only a few hints of action yet both the presences and performances of Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Alan Tudyk and a much less goofy, John Turturro, take the film to a new respectable level. I know, I still can't believe it either.Somewhere within the 2nd hour, a complete shift happens. A series of plot twists with characters and Shia LaBeouf, who I have never been a fan of, for the first-time in the series, we actually relate with! The film then continues to surprise as it gets bigger and darker with excellent effects and stunts with human characters we care for. It's not shot over-the-top Micheal Bay style either, which is a surprise within the film itself. The film looses the over-use of shaky cams and lens flares, instead focuses in on what is going on, so we can get in on the action instead of getting frustrated trying to figure out what is going on.It's almost as if Micheal Bay studied Zack Snyder's direction of The Watchmen, stopped smoking crack and later, watching J.J. Abrams films, said, ""That's what I've been doing wrong!""",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't Bother,"Just as the title implies don't even bother with this film, the reason why its nothing we haven't seen before. Big robot fights in the desert and the city, annoying ethnic and racial insensitive robots, hot girls who can't act, bad jokes falling flat, and a plot that has more holes than swiss cheese. On top of that we have Shia Lebouf screaming every 5 minutes countless laws of physics and common sense being broken (and not in a god way) and is packed with characters that are unnecessarily over the top or just unneeded, like Ken Jeong and John Malcovich.Overall it is a very slight improvement over the second film but still falls far short of one's expectations.Overall will give this a 3 out of 10 for amazing special effects and relief that this will be Michael Bay's final defecation on the Transformers franchise.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Story? Let's blow something up!,"""Dark Of The Moon"" is the first Transformers movie that I actually liked a lot. The others are good fun and all, but they're never what ""they could have been"". And, to be honest, Michael Bay is a great visual director, but a TERRIBLE storyteller. It shows a lot in almost everything he touches (""Pearl Harbor"" being the best example of how the man, simply, can't tell a story).Having said that, I feel that Bay directed this movie with the single intent to show us one of the greatest fire-work movies of all time. Screw the story, the characters and the substance and let's simply blow something up. The ""final fight"" last for about an hour and I just didn't want it to end.Let's face it, nobody walks in a Transformers movie for the story, that's just stupid. If you want to see some of the greatest action scenes ever made, watch this film. If you're looking for a great story and a beautiful romance, go see Titanic or something else. This is a film for the eyes. And it delivers it in an amazing fashion.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Third time's a charm for Bay and the Bots!,"There is a simple rule to knowing if its worth going to see this film..If you enjoyed the first film regardless of what you thought of the dubious second movie, then get your damn tickets! If you hated both movies then stay the hell away because there will be nothing new for you this time around.Quite simply this is the most outstanding action flick you're likely to see this year let alone this summer and it's a successful return to what they managed to deliver with the first movie. Make no mistake about the toilet humour, sometimes screwball acting and silly jokes. That stuff is still very evident but unlike the second movie where it went spiralling out of control and dominated the picture, here it is kept firmly on a leach. In fact it is very much a film of two halves, the first half has an even mix of humour an action but it doesn't go too over the top to the point where we see robots doing embarrassing things like peeing or showing their balls etc, and there is a lot of human death unlike the other films. You see the innocent getting wiped out not just building collapsing and explosions. The second half is very much a tour de force of action scenes that are either nail biting or breath taking, not much letting up once it starts going and the finale is very satisfying! This is no movie with an agenda to deliver some life changing tale, it makes no attempt to equal the Bard with its narrative or plot. This is a movie based on popular toys for boys. Expect that much and you will be entertained because they actually set up this movie with a very clever conspiracy theory based on the NASA missions to the moon and weave that into the roots of the franchise. Shia Lebeouf is without his sidekick for the last two movies in Megan Fox but finds a more than worthy successor in supermodel Rosie Huntington Whiteley who plays a part that's very difficult to see Megan ever pulling off. Sure these girls are meant for mostly eye candy but where Megan's hot lipstick and deep pencilled eyebrowed, glam-pornstar look got more slutty with each picture, Rosie's supermodel grace and fine English accented charm brings more class than candy. Sorry Megan fans but no way would she pull of a semi-rich bitch who's been to finishing school and back! In fact her part is essential in the few well executed plot twists and deceptions this movie presents that were never as potent in its predecessors.All this builds up to last hour of back to back action sequences of spectacle, stealth, barbaric violence and utter heroics that will please the masses and outrage the critics who can never assess these kind of movie based on what they aim to be rather than what they don't! Transformers Dark of the Moon delivers a picture worthy of ending any action series, this is what makes buying a movie box set on home video worth parting with the cash even when one of the films is totally duff. Bay's even managed to show the industry how to use 3D with easily the best 3D presentation since Avatar. Whoever takes over this franchise has a mighty jump to make because Michael Bay has placed the bar pretty damn high!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Simply Awful,"In short, this movie is just another example of how the more a production spends on special effects, the more the movie sucks. The humans in this movie are more prefabricated than the robots. This movie would seem good for two kinds of people, 12 year old boys, and people who were lobotomized.This is just another example of how Hollywood is so out of touch with reality. This movie is just a corporate product that is simply designed to make money. There is no heart in this movie. It only demonstrates how a highly paid and competent team of professionals, from marketers to designers created a working product. I guess this is in line with the original concept of Transformers - a cartoon commercial created to sell toys.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
''A Must See Movie'',"'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is the best Film in Michael Bay's 'Transformers' trilogy. i saw this epic and i must say that ''Dark of the Moon"" is the greatest 3D movie ever made in the history of 3D movies,done better than ever, on par up there with Avatar by James Cameron. the expectation from this movie were so high and i must say you will not regret that!!the visual effects and the fight scenes were stunning and just to experience that on the big screen is very particular, featuring one of the most breathtaking scenery of giant robots fighting each other on 3-D. The Music/Score I MUST SAY will ''BLOW YOU AWAY'' the Best Soundtrack of the franchaise! the plot of the movie is better then revenge of the fallen and the ending was spectacular!(Prime is awesome)all of you, who were left unhappy, deaf and unsatisfied, you must forget it and see the third part! A great summer movie experience,you will enjoy it i promise you!sit back and relax just clear your head for 2 hours and half. enjoy and have fun :) my note 10/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This epic conclusion will make a Transformers fan out of everyone,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon is Michael Bay's finest achievement. It is not his best film (that honour will always reside with The Rock), but it is his most mature film to date. After disappointing everyone including himself with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Bay went back to the drawing board with the final film in his robotic orgy of mayhem and destruction, and rehauled just about everything. While the results are not perfect, it shows that he may not be quite the hack we always thought he was. And that he knows exactly how to end things with a bang.Picking up a few years after the travesty involving the Fallen, Dark of the Moon revolves around secret government coverups, the US/Russian space race of the 1960s, high-level assassinations, secret counter- terrorism ops involving the Autobots, and Sam Witwicky's (Shia LaBeouf) search to find his place in the world.It may sound just as busy as the previous two films, but Dark of the Moon manages to let the story flow organically through the first two acts. It feels significantly more grounded immediately after it starts, and all the threads manage to lead somewhere. And rather surprisingly, there are very little action scenes splitting up the story beats. It stalls in some places due to a serious lack of editing, but I am willing to give more than enough credit to Bay and writer Ehren Kruger for composing something that actually held my interest and did not lose me twenty minutes in. The government intrigue and the blending of the Apollo 11 mission and infamous space race into the story was so incredibly well done that you almost forget you are watching a film about robots that can turn into cars.But what is really impressive about the film is how grown up it feels. When I watched Transformers and Revenge of the Fallen, I knew I was watching slickly produced movies primarily sold to teenagers and young males. While watching Dark of the Moon, it felt like it was catering to a more adult audience. The dark nature of the film is simply astounding, and becomes downright brutal in some areas. I was really surprised by Bay's go-for-broke style, but it works for the tone the film strives for. There are more than a few shocking moments sprinkled throughout that really push the PG-13 rating of the film. I predict that some parents may take immediate issue with how violent the film becomes.While the dark nature of the film flows throughout its excessive running time, the story comes to a screeching halt when it hits the third act and the massive battle scene begins. You may have read that it lasts almost an hour, and it comes pretty close. It is an absolutely insane, balls-to-the-wall action piece that simply needs to be seen to be believed. The blend of special effects, practical effects and 3D effects is simply outstanding. The addition of the real 3D effects helps make the battle, and the robot antagonists, feel more real than ever. Bay has staged some awesome fights in the previous two films, but this ridiculous heart-stopping battle is simply incredible and outdoes every single one. It is worth the price of admission alone, Transformers fan or not.Of course, this is a Transformers film, so it is not without its fault. The 3D may be the best since Avatar, but it never really comes alive until the final act of the film. Leading up to that, it is just as underwhelming as every other 3D film you have seen recently. And as you likely have guessed, the film is far too long for its own good. Some scenes drag themselves out unnecessarily, and others are cut up way too quick.But what really drags it out is the obscene level of comedy taking place before the epic battle starts. I mentioned how adult the film is, but it still attempts to bring in the child audience with goofy jokes and ridiculously zany performances from John Malkovich, John Turturro, Alan Tudyk and especially Ken Jeong. The previous two films seemed like they had a few too many jokes, but here they just feel forced and overdone. It makes the film feel desperate in some scenes to evoke the dark tone it is aiming for, and in other scenes feels like a complete betrayal.Acting wise, there are not a lot of standouts. LaBeouf does his usual scared hero routine, and both Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson do their usual ass kicking routine. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is absolutely stunning eye-candy as Sam's new squeeze Carly, and she wisely does not even attempt to act. Frances McDormand does well in a thankless turn as a CIA honcho, but Patrick Dempsey is likely the only human character who gets to chew scenery and not overact while doing it. I have yet to be impressed with him as a film actor, but he gives a great performance here easily outshining everyone not playing a robot. Voicewise, Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving are excellent as always, as is the absolutely impeccable Leonard Nimoy playing Sentinel Prime.I wanted to love Transformers: Dark of the Moon for everything that is done right and all the mistakes it makes up for. But it still has its share of problems that seem to be characteristic of the franchise more than anything else. Yet, do not let these issues hold you back from experiencing the sheer absurdity of Bay's robot opera. It is a wild event, and one of the few true worthwhile blockbusters we have seen this summer. After being disappointed by the previous two films, I can say without fault that I was made a fan by this film. I just wish I did not have to wait for three movies to make it happen.7/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Dark of The Moon sustains with overlong explosion-laden redundancy, but not without some improvement over its predecessor","Behold the third entry of the Transformers saga. After the mediocre sequel that was 'Revenge of The Fallen' in 2009, Michael Bay has made his return to the director's wheel with a second sequel that manages to breath a just a little more life back in the franchise. It is loud and it is a very special effects heavy with lots of explosions, lots of destruction, lots of innuendo, and lots of screaming -- all of which is packed into a bloated 154-minute runtime. In addition, it slightly improves upon one major aspect that plagued the previous film, and that is boasting a more coherent plot with slightly more ambition. On the other hand, this does not eliminate the problems in Ehren Krueger's script which sporadically hinder the loud and overlong experience. Another change in this entry lies in the casting of Victoria Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who steps into the damsel-in- distress role, replacing Megan Fox was fired prior to production. This film tells the story of Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) who leads the Autobots in a race against the Decepticons lead by Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) to retrieve a mysterious Cybertronian artifact discovered by NASA back in the 1969 Apollo 11 mission. Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (played by Shia Labeouf) has graduated college and has just landed his first white-collar job to support him and his new girlfriend Carly (played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). When he and Carly are unexpectedly dragged into a heated war between autobots and the decepticons, they must enlist the help of the National Intelligence Agency, head by Mearing (played by Frances McDormand), to aid them in yet another battle on Earth.Michael Bay normally falls short of ambition when it comes to storytelling. The premise, which unlike the previous two installments, boast a surprising amount of substance dealing with the Space Race during the JFK administration. The story to is able competently connect landmark political history with the Transformers universe. But when it comes to sustaining the plot, that is where things falter. In return, he tries to make up for this an enormous slew of eye-dazzling action sequences complete with extravagant special effects and enough explosions to put dozens of firework shows at once to shame. Then it comes to the big question: are these massive special effects do enough to distract from the thinly developed plot? For a while, they do, especially for those with longer attention spans to parades of visual effects than the narrative. Bay indulges in his signature blow-em-up style with countless shots of the giant metal monsters punching, shooting, and slashing each other to pieces, a gimmick that gets taken to a bulky advantage in the final act during the climatic battle in downtown Chicago. The destruction of the skyscrapers is spectacular and fun to sit through, but goes on for so long to the point where it gets a little numbing. On the surface side, the performances are about as good as actors can get in the franchise. Shia Labeouf is fine in the role, and working along his side is Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, the model-turned-actress who turns into a rather one-note performance. Her role is rendered to feel identical to the fashion in which Megan Fox's character is written in the previous films, and that is serving as a sex symbol for teen boy, especially as she is introduced in the first ten minutes in a shot showing her lingerie- clad bottom. Arguably the most surprising new face in the cast is Frances McDormand who, like the actress she is, turns in a competent performance. Needless to say, it is nothing that shouts for wide recognition as is the rest of cast here including Ken Jeong who has a minor (and gravely obnoxious) role during the first half.Transformers: Dark of the Moon is an overlong, but somewhat competent special-effects action thrill ride that is likely to please those hungry for some explosive visual heft signature to Michael Bay's trademark directorial style, but disappoint those seeking for something more ambition. As far as many of Bay's films go, this one sustains a level of entertainment that is not too low, but too high either. Don't go in expecting something ambitious.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Thrilling Conclusion to the Trilogy,"""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is the third and final installment in the Transformers trilogy. Directed by Michael Bay, the movie stars Shia LaBeouf, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and Josh Duhamel. The story follows Sam Witwicky as he becomes embroiled in another battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons.The movie features some of the most spectacular action sequences ever seen on the big screen. The special effects are top-notch, and the CGI robots are incredibly detailed. The final battle scene is particularly impressive, with non-stop action and explosions.The performances of the actors are also noteworthy. Shia LaBeouf delivers a solid performance as Sam Witwicky, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a welcome addition to the cast. She brings a fresh energy to the franchise, and her chemistry with LaBeouf is palpable.The plot of the movie is more complex than the previous two films, and it manages to tie up all the loose ends. The storyline is well-constructed, and the pacing is just right. The humor is also present in the movie, and it provides some much-needed levity amidst all the destruction.Overall, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a thrilling conclusion to the trilogy. It is a fitting finale to a series that has captured the imaginations of audiences around the world.

awesome movie,"""Transformers: Dark Of The Moon"" is easily the best film in the series, and there's a solid hour-long action sequence in Chicago that uses everything Bay's ever done before, but all blended into one exhausting push to save one girl in the midst of a war involving two planets. It's the personal story on an apocalyptic scale that Bay loves to try to tell, and that other guys like Emmerich and Cameron and even Spielberg love to do. And this is the best version of it that Bay's made so far.Let's start with this: for the first time since ""Avatar,"" I am going to recommend that you find the biggest and best 3D theater you can find and buy yourself a ticket, because ""Transformers: Dark Of The Moon,"" especially seen in IMAX 3D, is an overwhelming sensory experience. The sound mix alone is more exciting than anything in the billion-dollar- bore of ""Pirates 4."" This is gigantic action we've never seen before, and Bay's reaction to shooting and cutting his film for 3D is to get better at what he does. It raised his game, and as a result, I feel like we just saw a dare thrown down by one of Hollywood's biggest action specialists: ""Top this.""",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One Of Stephen Spielberg's stupidest decisions.,I have read that it was Stephen Spielberg's decision to fire Megan Fox over her infantile comments. Replacing a well established character with a new character that seems to have no purpose but show how unqualified she is to be an actress was just a distraction that ruined the movie. Megan Fox is not the greatest actress in the world but she was good enough to have become comfortable and natural in her part.

A Great Summer Movie,"Here's my problem with the critic reviews, they expect too much. If you come to see the movie expecting to be completely moved by what you've seen, then you've got another thing coming. This is a great movie for what it is, a summer action thriller. The story was good not great, and obviously, the special effects were perfect. Compared to the second installment, this is a BIG improvement. The second was just trying to be too funny, and the action was great, but it was just chaotic. In Dark of the Moon, Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg tuned down the comedy level and they put in a better structure for the action sequences. Now, there were still a lot of great laughs, and the special effects were at best they've ever been, if not better. my only problems were that I believe that the characters could have been better developed, but enough was done to get by, and the way it was put together was just a tad bit messy, but nothing too noticeable. DO NOT listen to what a bunch of hot-shot movie critics have to say, you really should never listen to these guys. Overall, this was an awesome, fun summer blockbuster.

This is a worthwhile addition to the action genre that's a must see but you may only need to watch once,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched on Netflix. The storyline follows a hidden artifact on the dark side of the moon that the US government kept secret for decades but has been waiting to come to Earth. The artifact is awaken by the energy from the last Transformers film and another Prime emerges...a Prime with different motives than Optimus.This picture is directed by Michael Bay (Bad Boys I & II) and stars Shia LaBeouf (Fury), Frances McDormand (Fargo), Tyrese Gibson (Baby Boy), Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (Mad Max: Fury Road), John Turturro (The Big Lebowski), Patrick Dempsey (Can't Buy Me Love), Ken Jeong (The Hangover), John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich) and Josh Duhamel (Shotgun Wedding).Once again the opening narration, special effects, sound effects and Transformer character depictions are awesome. The soundtrack is also very good. The storyline was the worst of the first three pictures and I definitely missed Megan Fox. It was good they could bring back so many others from the original cast. The villain were just okay and I felt the long mechanical Dune style worms were a bit corny; however, the last 40 minutes of this movie is non-stop action and I found myself glued to the screen.Overall, this is a worthwhile addition to the action genre that's a must see but you may only need to watch once.

For anyone who is enthusiastic about graphics, this is a must see.At least, for the first 30 or 60 minutes. I did not see this movie expecting any depth in the story or brilliant acting - but Transformers 3 seems to be a compilation of every bad cliché to attempt getting the viewer to connect to the characters. The reason this fails, at least for me, is that you will see everything coming from miles away. The movie will not skip a chance to throw a US flag in your face.This movie will work fine for you if you're into hot chicks, hot cars, explosive action, American heroism and not very attentive of details. As soon as you start trying to ""read"" the scenery, the sequence of action and especially the plausibility of everything that happens, you will find that the suspension of disbelief is broken every two minutes.I'm rating it a 4 because although I thoroughly enjoyed the graphics, everything else in this movie made me want to get up and leave halfway. I sat through it to the end and realised: ""I would have enjoyed this much more if it didn't intend to be a story.""",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Improvement over Revenge of the Fallen,"Having not watched this film at the time of its release, and watching the fourth and fifth installment starring Mark Wahlberg before Dark of the Moon, one can see as to why the entire franchise has changed. Dark of the Moon is relatively decent with some entertainment and in comparison to the films with Wahlberg, this one is better. Shia LeBeouf portrays his character better in these films than what we have seen from Mark Wahlberg, as his character and the storylines seem to make more sense.As a film, this does start off decent but becomes tiresome at some points and drags on heavy as these films tend to do. The visuals are there but overall, the film film is still quite messy and the plot becomes distant to its special effects.Megan Fox's replacement Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is decent as her role doesn't require much but is quite odd how the film doesn't mention how her and Shia's character came about. Though, it is what is expected. Dark of the Moon even with its flaws is easily better than Revenge of the Fallen as that was far more messy, too much overload of action with a lesser plot.In this film it settles down somewhat as there is more drama, more heart and at least concise. Not the mention the finale of Dark of the Moon is quite entertaining and heartfelt, knowing it was the end of the main characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
tragic,I am a big fan of the old series...the movie starts nicely with the landing on the moon.after that we get a 15 min sitcom.and after those 20 minutes the movie ends. Followed by a 2 hours lasting explosion and special effects demo with an occasional cliché line and a waving American flag.no one who has worked on this movie gives a **** It is just a sci-fi channel flick with a huge special effects budgetIt really made me sad...where is someone like James Cameron when you need him.,1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"An ugly, miserable experience.","The third entry in the Transformers series is a cluttered, noisy, ugly mess that brings the series to its lowest point - a point thought impossible to achieve after the disaster that was its immediate predecessor. It proves to be an extremely miserable experience, being an hour too long with a plot too complicated for its own good and characters that, even for the type of movie it looks to be, are too thinly written.The movie sees the return of its main character, Sam Whitwicky, portrayed at his whiniest by Shia Lebeouf, as he once again aids the Autobots in some sort of war against the Decepticons. Honestly, that's the most I'm able to describe the plot because I had no clue what was exactly going on for the film's entirety. Every major detail is presented in such an incoherent manner, with characters rambling endlessly at a pace so rapid that my head was left spinning after just a half-hour into the film. It also didn't help that the film would periodically stop for inane subplots such as Sam's mother - for some reason - trying to promote a self-help book to him.That brings me to the film's next biggest problem. This is a two-and-a-half-hour-long film, but it really should have been anywhere between ninety to one-hundred minutes. For a simple summer blockbuster, everything should have been presented in much simpler terms and without unnecessary subplots. Why do we need to hear all this complicated backstory that's being thrown in our faces when all we really want to see is a simple story about two groups of robots in battle? If the simple route was taken, I could guarantee at least forty-five minutes or so would have been cut from the film. And for the better, I might add. I mean, how long could one possibly drag out the notion of a bunch of robots fighting each other?Speaking of the fight scenes, the film even fails to make these appealing, and it's the action that's supposed to be the center-point of the film. Each action scene is presented as loud as it could possibly be, with non-stop explosions and screaming being the driving forces behind these sequences. The editing causes these scenes to jump all over the place, so there is never even really a clear focus as to where all the loud noises and screaming are distinctly coming from. This proves to be especially mind-numbing in the last act of the film, which is essentially all the previous action sequences in the film presented non-stop for forty-five minutes to an even greater degree. About five minutes into this point of the film, you're already begging for it to end.The film also includes a huge supporting cast of actors who are clearly all too talented to be wasting their time with this sort of nonsense. However, I guess with the way the economy is going at this point, desperate times call for desperate measures, I suppose. The cast includes supporting roles or cameos from the likes of John Turturro, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Ken Jeong, Alan Tudyk, and Patrick Dempsey. The majority of these roles are meant as comic relief, although they all fail miserably at providing one single laugh. Instead, they all play obnoxious versions of characters they have previously played, all desperately shouting out one ""comical"" line after another. For example, take John Malkovich's Osbourne Cox character from Burn After Reading. Now, take out all the profanity, make him shout even louder than he already did, and then just make sure every single word he says is not funny. And that's essentially the character Malkovich portrays in this disaster-piece. It shames me to see such talented actors go to waste, but like I said, there are just times when some people need a paycheck, I suppose.Watching Transformers: Dark of the Moon proves to be one of the most miserable experiences I have ever had watching a movie. It does everything it could possibly do wrong to the greatest degree it could possibly do it. There was not one single bright spot I could think of as I look back on the film. And by that, I mean, there actually were about three or four moments where I remember briefly smiling, but there were so many explosions, screaming, and obnoxious performances that immediately followed that it caused me to forget what I was smiling about. It actually was so obnoxious that just thinking about it now gives me a headache, so I'm going to stop before I do any serious damage to my brain.0.5/5",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's been declining in terms of story for both Cybertronian races,"A Cybertronian spacecraft hid on the moon that triggered a space race by the United States and the Soviet Union. The Autobots and Decepticons race against each other to learn the secret.Why does Shia LaBeouf have to scream throughout this movie? Can't he play calmly and look wise for a moment? Sam Witwicky's character development here is actually declining. It looks dumber than the previous two movies. It doesn't show the maturity side of the storyline and the timing that comes from the Transformers film franchise. Carly's character?? Replacing Mikaela's role is actually no significant change. It's even less important to give a large portion of the film. Why does Michael Bay always feature female characters with sexy looks? Can't Bay give the players a better realistic? Running through explosions and falls didn't make the actress look dirty. It still looks charming. Something strange.Transformers: Dark of the Moon has suffered such a bad decline. The plot of the whole movie is too ordinary. The constructed conflict looks out of thin air. A weightless conflict. More striving for big, mesmerizing action is peppered with increasingly behancing explosions. The conflict between the Autobots and Decepticons that just became bored. It doesn't show a good story for the two of them. Quite the best fighting action of any Transformers franchise. The darkness of the moon looks unattractive and focuses more on Sam Witwicky choosing to save his girlfriend. There are also not too many battles between robots, in fact, it seems ordinary.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Transformers: Dark of the Moon""","I have to say that I actually really enjoyed 2011's ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" much like I did its predecessors ""Transformers"" (2007) and ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" (2009). Now I know I'll probably just catch hell for making that statement. But I don't care, it's my thoughts and that's all that matters to me.Like most 20-somethings today, I grew up watching the original ""Transformers"" cartoons throughout my youth growing up in the early '90s. Those were really good times. I even collected a few of the Hasbro toys (which inspired the cartoon and big-budget live-action movies), but my admiration for ""Transformers"" never really peaked because the channel that I used to watch the original series on removed the show from its early-morning line-up during the mid-90s and it didn't return to TV until just recently - like within the last four years when the first live-action movie was released.History lesson over...Like its two predecessors, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is loud, obnoxious, high destructive good fun. The first film is obviously the best by any standard, I'm partial to liking the second film only slightly more than that one, and this third entry probably has the most ridiculously over-the-top city-wide siege battle I've ever seen. (The film's last 40 minutes are basically one long action sequence; 20 years ago something of this magnitude would have been impossible because of the sheer scale of everything but because of CGI and bigger budgets, lengthy action sequences of this type are now commonplace in the movies today.)As you will recall (or in case you've been living under a rock and have no idea what a ""Transformer"" is), the whole ""Transformers"" mythology involves a centuries-old war between the heroic Autobots and the malevolent Decepticons, massive shape-changing robots of extraterrestrial origin who mistakenly bring their conflict from their home planet Cybertron to Earth where humans are soon brought into the fold along with them.""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" begins in 1961, when an Autobot spaceship carrying a secret from Transformer home planet Cybertron crash-lands on the moon. A little bit of revisionist history thus takes place in which it is revealed that the whole Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union at that time was instigated to see who could reach the lunar crash site first and learn its secrets. (This is all set up in some pretty quick-step tempo that includes archival footage of President Richard Nixon and the 1969 moon landing integrated with scenes newly shot by over-indulgent, over-director Michael Bay.)We learn that this secret could also save mankind, or wipe us out.The Decepticons are back once again, led by their fearsome leader Megatron (voice of Hugo Weaving), and they once again resume their war with the heroic Autobots who are led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen, the only voice actor from the original ""Transformers"" TV series). Caught in the middle of it, are determined human players Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf, still continuing his likable Everyman thing), his new love interest Carly Spencer (newcomer and model Rosie Huntington-Whitely, now having thoroughly replaced Megan Fox), soldiers Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Epps (Tyrese Gibson), Agent Simmons (John Turturro) and his assistant Dutch (Alan Tudyk), and newcomers federal bureaucrat Agent Mearish (Frances McDormand) and Carly Spencer's hunky boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey).Everything culminates in an epic, highly destructive Earth-bound siege in Chicago between the Autobots and their human allies, and the evil Decepticons.I think Bay out-did himself on this picture with seeing how many things he can blow up and how many bullets can be fired. It's all utterly ridiculous, but the entire time I was more in awe of the amazing technical feats of it all. From the beginning of the ""Transformers"" series of films, I've always been impressed by the level of attention paid to the littlest details of every scene.Every time a Transformer transforms, I've always been amazed by the sights and sounds of metal parts clanking, whirring, and reconfiguring into some robotic alien mass or robot disguised as heavy-duty machinery. I'm also awed by the amazing details of every explosion, every slain robot that gets torn apart limb from limb in battle, and just the overall attention to detail. It's a pure visual spectacle where you're just in awe of everything that's going on. If you hate Michael Bay, at least like his special effects.Whatever your feelings regarding Bay are, don't miss out on this one; you'll only regret seeing one of the most finely detailed action epics of the year.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Using the GDP of a small country they made.. THIS?!?!?!,"Transformers 3: Dark Side of the Moon is a movie that I wish I could forget.

Also what almost made me gouge my eyes out were the incredibly ridiculous, horrible and disjointed battle scenes. I literally thought of walking out of the theater.Length was also a big issue.

A New Cinematic Low,"There's a scene in Michael Bay's Transformers: Dark of the Moon that is one of the most visually provocative sequences ever put to screen. In it, Megatron marches to the Lincoln Memorial and blasts Abe to pieces. He sits on his new throne while two smaller robots gnaw away at Lincoln's severed head. This image serves as a haunting symbol of the fact that the entire human race will soon be enslaved, their freedom and dignity taken away from them. God, this movie sucked.I could stand Megan Fox, John Turturro in a thong, and the takeover of the Smithsonian Air Museum with a couple of tasers. As bad as ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is, I can stand it. Even enjoy it. It's a decent popcorn flick. That being said, I found it easier to eat popcorn during Precious than this cinematic train wreck.The third installment in Paramount's billion-dollar franchise finds Sam Witwicky in search of a job. He's saved the world twice, been given a medal by the president, graduated from an Ivy League school, and dated really hot girls. Regardless, he still can't get a job outside of the mail room. In the midst of this, he discovers that the malevolent Decepticons are out to take over the world again. The logistics and intricate details of their plan aren't important. Just know that the plan involves an exhaustive barrage of slow motion, explosions, running, and screaming.Michael Bay's never really been known for his storytelling, but he can make movies flow at an even enough pace. This movie jumps around faster than a bunny rabbit on crack, explains nothing at all and assumes we care about characters who are about as interesting as bird droppings on a telephone pole. Appearances by the likes of Ken Jeong, Stephen Merchant, John Malkovich and Frances McDormand aren't as much welcomed as they are unnecessary. The humor present in previous installments, which at times was cringe-inducing, has all been vanished, replaced instead by an extremely morbid, depressing tone. It's not even exciting.To be fair, the movie is a technological wonderland. The CGI is effectively placed in the film, the sound design is excellent, and the 3D is actually worth the price. Shia LaBeouf is always fun to watch, and I was actually able to stand new girlfriend Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley.Despite its achievements on the technological front, the movie is still a mess. The final, incredibly long battle to save the human race will leave you more exhausted than exhilarated. Oh, and the movie's about 157 minutes too long.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I am now dumber for seeing this movie :(,"I felt the first transformers movie was excellent. It was new, original, and simple in what it tried to accomplish. The same can not be said for Dark of the Moon. What made this movie terrible was Bay's attempt to appeal to a mass audience. He tried to make an action, horror, comedy, romance movie and unfortunately the end product was extremely cheesy. Also, the movie had poor physics. How many times can a human being jump through panes of glass and not receive any cuts? I freely admit that I half expected this to be a bad movie and what I was looking forward to was the 3D animation. However, even that lacked originality to it as it was simply debris flying everywhere as the 3D showcase. The one saving grace of this movie was LaBeouf's performance, who carried this movie on his back by creating a believable world of metal robots and bad actors and actresses.

Last good Transformers film,"Michael Bay recovered after the train-wreck of Revenge of the Fallen. The last hour of this film is insane.

Excellent,"Since Transformers: Age of Extinction is coming out in two weeks, I decided to re-watch all of the old Transformers movies. After watching the first movie and reviewing it, I decided to review all of the movies. I really liked this movie, which was surprising because I didn't remember liking it this much. I really enjoyed the 2 1/2 hour movie. It was very long, but I still enjoyed it. Just like the second movie, I felt like some of the scenes were dragged out way too much, which is why I gave it a 7 instead of an 8 or a 9. Just like the second movie, I was happy with the absence of a shaky camera. It made the battles much more enjoyable, and made the movie way better. Even though I gave this movie the same rating as Revenge of the Fallen, I think Revenge of the Fallen was a tiny bit better. It was more pleasant. This movie was so dark that I had a hard time believing that it was a Transformers movie. Don't get me wrong, it was still really good, but it was also very dark. The acting in this movie was once again outstanding, and Shia Labeouf did a great job adapting to his new character. He was still Sam, but his attitude completely changed, and he did a wonderful job. Rosie Huntington-Whitely did a good job filling in for Megan Fox. I thought the movie would've been a little better if Fox was still Sam's girlfriend. Whitely still did a wonderful job, though. Every single person did another wonderful job in this movie with acting. The Transformers really is a good series for acting. The series is also amazing for special effects. Everything looks so great that the battles and the robots and everything else that isn't real looks real. Transformers 1,2,3 and probably 4 are one of the best displays of visual effects I have ever seen. I like how there is always so much detail in all of the Autobots and Decepticons. Their emotions are so easily displayed that you are sympathetic for them when one of them dies (the Autobots, mainly), which really makes them more human, and all of their moving parts go together without a problem, and their transformations are once again awesome. That is another thing I like about this movie. They aren't just regular, stereotypical robots. They are original, and are very realistic. As with the second movie, the setting changed. Well, the final battle of the first film was in New York, and the final battle in Dark of the Moon was in Chicago, which are different cities, but still cities. But the scale of the battle increased at least 20 times. Maybe even more. This made the battles more grandiose, and way more fun to watch. Also, the story thankfully changed again. The introduction of so many new Decepticons was awesome. I was looking for a lot of new Transformers. Ehren Kruger and Michael Bay did such a good job creating some new Transformers that it was almost as if this was a different series. The dialogue was another great thing in this movie. The actors said their lines perfectly, and displayed their emotions perfectly once again. Steve Jablonsky (composer) did a great job once more with this installment of the series, and used Arrival to Earth again as a main theme, which is good. That's all I have to say about Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Thanks for reading. See ya.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"terrible, waste of time and money","OMG, this was one of the worst movies I've seen in years. I loved the 1st movie and like the 2nd one, this one was a huge disappointment.

It created good depth and was always present but not in a bothersome way.2) some good special effects - the snakey bot was cool, and the long fight at the end was good, but ....by then I was so bored by the bad dialog and plot that I didn't care.

Do electric sheep dream of Michael Bay?,"Watching a Michael Bay movie is like sleeping with a prostitute. There's that rush of adrenaline, the heart beats become faster, the pulse quickens and all your thoughts converge into making the most out of what lies in front of you, be it a naked body or bare knuckle metal. And while the act in itself, however long it may last, may very well be an apotheosis of pleasure, it will definitely be one of those acts which, once it's over, you'd desperately want to sweep under the rug or stash it away in a closet hoping that its skeletons don't tumble out years later the way Bill Clinton's did. And soon after finishing the act, you realize that you have a wife, seven months pregnant with your 2nd child, and a 5-year old kid to whom you are the Batman, Superman, Ironman and all other imaginary super heroes out there rolled into one. The screws of guilt start turning and tightening, leaving you conscience – stricken about the dastardly act that you just committed. That is exactly how you feel when the closing credits starting rolling after completion of a Michael Bay movie. All the excitement, the adrenaline, the eagerness that was there before the movie started snowballs into one gigantic sphere of guilt as the end nears, leaving you flummoxed as to why you went to see the movie in the first place.It has been four years now that Michael Bay has been running a prostitution racket in all its metal glory. We know that racket as Transformers. And just like failure to contain one's carnal desires has led to flourishing of prostitution, Bay's metallic monstrosities, bereft of any emotion or storyline, have drawn audiences from all over the world if only to find out whether a robot's testicles are square or round. Almost every Bay movie has raked in substantial amount of moolah at the Box Office, resulting in rapid proliferation his racket and fueling his desire to find innovative ways to assault people's senses with every imaginable metal monstrosity. As if it wasn't enough, this time he has gone a step further and added an extra dimension thus launching the attack from all the three dimensions leaving us feel like a mosquito that has been squashed over and over again with a sledge hammer. Bay's movies are destined for two things 1) being lambasted by critics 2) striking gold at box office. Dark of the Moon will be no different.I don't know for sure whether androids dream of electric sheep or not.

Panopticon Defects,"Sometimes you simply get proved wrong. I was wrong and I admit it.When I saw the first Transformers movie, I thought I was seeing something that advanced the cinematic vocabulary. The movie was still otherwise worthless, and the advance was in the service of crass goals. But an effective evolution in how we see things is a big deal. What I saw was expert editing that in the action scenes gave us just a bit less information than we needed to understand what was going on. These edits had compositional energy so that in general we got caught in the swirl of the battle, experiencing the fog of war.This, I thought was a big deal, because there is only so much you can do visually. You are delivering an entire world and interacting within that world at the same time. It should be impossible. I qualified my comment at the time by remarking that this also saves money; since you never have time to fully comprehend a special effect, they can be designed or rendered with less fidelity.The second film continued the tradition, with less freshness. This one abandons it altogether and presents itself no differently than your average Marvel bravado. It has a different editor, so that makes sense. But for the first time, the franchise has decided to enter the premium ticket market with three D and IMAX. Ticketbuyers who pay the extra moola want clear confirmation that the extra detail is worth it. So the whole enterprise has had its one redeeming value ripped out.

The absence of Megan Fox doesn't help either. The only thing that pulled the film along was the action, of course. It was unreal, though. I'd say a lot more explosions compared to the previous installments. In short, the film doesn't let you breathe from a certain point on and when you want it to, it's over. I mean, compared to the previous films, which concluded the plot nicely, the ending here didn't seem to me to be very good, I would even say a little bit cut off, as if there was still something missing. What to add. An action movie with a capital A without a deeper plot. If you're looking for explosions at every corner, you probably won't go wrong.

Transformers: Dark of the moon,"I have to give director Michael Bay a great deal of credit in this Transformers series. He manages to make three movies that are basically all just carbon copies of each other and make them all at the very least entertaining. That is no small feat. Thus, although the luster of the franchise begins to wear off (especially towards the film's conclusion) in this installment, ""Dark of the Moon"" still is an entertaining romp that won't leave you bored.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not As Egregiously Awful As #2, Merely Bad","Transformers [3]: Dark of the Moon (2:34, PG-13, 3-D) — SF, biggie, sequelI have the same attitude toward Autobots vs. Decepticons that I do toward vampires vs. werewolves, rats vs. cockroaches, and Baathists vs. Al-Qaeda, namely I hope you all die! Kill each other off, but please do it quickly, quietly, and far far away from here. Unfortunately, in Transformers 3 they take forever (over 2.5 hours), it's noisy, it's in a theater near you, and there are still some left standing when it's all over.The original Transformers wasn't all bad; I gave it a 5 (average). The sequel was aggressively, unrelentingly obnoxious and loud loud loud loud; it got a 2 (awful). This one edges up a notch to 3 (bad). Why is that? Because the 1st 9 minutes recreated the greatest moment in human history, when we took only a decade from decision to footfall on a trip to the Moon. There's original footage from the 1960s plus a modern-day cameo appearance by Buzz Aldrin.But why did we go to the Moon? The movie starts off with an intriguing premise: that we were aware that an alien spacecraft had crashed in the Sea of Tranquility, and we wanted to go up and get a good look at it. Aldrin and Neil Armstrong (who were never on the far side of the Moon, regardless of the title or what screenwriter Ehren Krueger has his characters claim) supposedly discovered a huge alien robot there. This turns out to be Sentinel Prime, master strategist of the Autobots, voiced by Leonard Nimoy. Severely damaged, he had fled the Transformer homeworld of Cybertron after his last-ditch effort to win the final robot war ended in defeat. But he's inert in 1969, and it isn't until the present day that the Earthly Autobots head back to reactivate him, bringing along their own version of the Energizer Bunny.That's the high point of the movie. After that, it's all downhill, as director Michael Bay and the various special-effects teams take over. As before, there's lots of whirling hardware, dust, spurting oil, blazing guns, and explosions. Once again it's impossible to keep track of who's who, even if you had a clue in the 1st place, which the movie never bothers to provide. Dweebish protagonist Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) tries to pretend that human beings in general and he in particular have a role to play in the intra-robot conflict, but it's abundantly clear that they're mainly cannon fodder. He's accompanied thru much of the carnage by eye- candy girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), whose job is to dress in saran wrap and adopt whatever emotional attitude the screenplay requires at any given moment.The tone of the human interactions is saucy and insincere, played broadly and cartoonishly. Oddly, the actual cartoon characters, the robots, are the ones with the serious dialog and motivations. This is at least consistent with the movie's general attitude that they're the only ones worth caring about.Other actors who collected a paycheck for walking thru this junkyard-in-progress include Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey, Alan Tudyk, and John Malkovich. Their talents range from decent to excellent, but in all cases are superfluous here.The Decepticons convincingly devastate an odd version of Chicago that includes the Milwaukee Art Museum. The survival of our heroes against all odds is not even remotely plausible.I saw the flick in a packed 1st showing, and I was the only one who laffed out loud when Nimoy's character said ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."" This tells me that (a) nobody else in the theater was over 35 and (b) efforts to insert even a little bit of ingenuity into the plot were wasted. OTOH, one of the comic-relief minibots elicited a hearty chuckle with the clipped-off expression ""clusterf"", which tells us once again how effectively the MPAA is protecting the tender sensibilities of the too-young-for-R kiddies.There's no doubt that this movie will find its audience. I am not among them. I'd advise you not to be, either.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hate to see Meagan gone,"Michael Bay's Transformers: Dark of the Moon, the third installment in the blockbuster franchise, is an undeniable feast for the eyes and ears. With its mind-blowing visual effects, explosive action sequences, and larger-than-life set pieces, the movie is the epitome of summer popcorn entertainment. However, beyond its dazzling exterior, it struggles to fully deliver a balanced or memorable experience.The plot starts with an intriguing premise, tying the Autobots' history to the Apollo 11 moon landing and weaving real-world events into the Transformers lore. This creative approach gives the film a sense of scale and stakes, making it feel more significant than a typical alien invasion story. Optimus Prime and the Autobots return with their usual heroism, facing off against the Decepticons in their latest plan to resurrect Cybertron at Earth's expense.Shia LaBeouf reprises his role as Sam Witwicky, bringing a mix of wit and frustration as he grapples with post-college life and feeling irrelevant in a world where giant robots are saving the day. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley takes over the role of Sam's love interest, Carly Spencer. While her character is charming and visually prominent, her performance feels underwritten, leaving little room for meaningful depth.The action is where Dark of the Moon truly excels. The climactic Battle of Chicago is a masterclass in CGI and Bay's signature destruction-heavy filmmaking. Skyscrapers crumble, robots clash in spectacular fashion, and the stakes feel immense. The sequences involving Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) add an emotional layer to the conflict, as his betrayal injects tension and moral ambiguity into the narrative.Despite these strengths, the film suffers from significant pacing issues. At nearly two and a half hours long, the story drags in its middle section, with extended comedic scenes and subplots that feel more like filler than substance. The humor, often involving supporting characters, is hit-or-miss-some moments land well, but others feel cringeworthy or out of place.Another notable flaw is the imbalance between human and Transformer storylines. While the robots are the main draw, the focus frequently shifts to the humans, diluting the emotional impact of the Autobots' struggles. This problem has plagued the series from the beginning, and it remains evident here.Ultimately, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a visual spectacle that entertains but fails to reach the heights of its potential. It's an improvement over the second film (Revenge of the Fallen), but it lacks the fresh charm and tighter storytelling of the original. For diehard fans, it's a must-see, but for casual viewers, it might feel like an overly long fireworks show with little substance to hold onto.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
most awaited movie,"It is also the best job the series has done so far of turning the robots themselves into lead characters, something the first two films avoided for the most part. In the first film, Optimus Prime and Bumblebee had their moments, but they were still secondary to the human characters in every way, and the second film didn't really give anyone, human or animated, anything to play. This time out, I actually felt like the robots made a strong impression, and if there are more of these films after Bay leaves the series, then he's laid out a pretty strong template here for others to imitate moving forward. Finally, it feels like the war makes sense, and the stakes make sense, and it all matters. Sentinel Prime is a great addition to the series, and Nimoy plays him perfectly. It's a real performance, and as a result, it makes the rest of the Transformers feel more real. Cullen is very good in this one, and the rest of the robot cast manages to impress as well. Even the weird little robots, and there are two of them living with Sam (Shia LaBeouf) grew on me over the course of the film, especially when you see where they wind up. The Decepticons are way nastier in this one, and so when Optimus Prime and the Autobots unleash hell... AND THEY DO... it is so deserved and so worthy of one cheer after another that it almost becomes audience participation.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Much Brighter than its title implies....,"In Transformers III, the battle of humans and Autobots vs the Decepticons moves into a new level; To begin with, visual effects are not just state of the art.They are innovative because they are really superbly designed and directed. There are hardly any faults and they look like real.Director Michael Bay helps us enter into the agony of the battlefield with his camera angles and movement. The film's atmosphere is now more dramatic. Many humorous elements of the 2 prequels are not anymore present. The dialogues are mostly desperate while the action is like a hurricane with a progressing climax that keeps the audience's interest and expectations on a constant knife edge. The battles can be described as epic. A minus (according to my opinion)is that the character of Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) is no longer in the script. Overall, a state of the art action film that will keep you in the seat from the first till the last minute.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Movie,"I was able to view the movie this evening. Excellent action, excellent special effects. Same Transformers acting, and story. However, 3D was great. Lots of in your face 3D action. If you have plans on seeing this film I highly recommend going to the theater and seeing it in 3D. Watching in the theater 3D IMAX made it worth the long sit. Watching it on regular DVD, or Blue Ray will make it lose some of its attraction. The story is a typical Transformers story. The acting is watchable. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley did her job. Not having Megan Fox didn't make a bit of difference. Whiteley is a Looker!!! The comic relief helped the story and acting.

All Style No Substance,"I was already tired of Shia LeBeouf's antics after part two, and he only went more overboard in ""Dark of the Moon."" He hammed it up big time with his screaming, spazzing, and terrible witticisms. So why watch part three you ask? I couldn't tell you. Some pathetic hope that things would be better. They weren't.Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) traded in his old girlfriend for a new one, but it doesn't make much of a difference. His new GF, Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), is nothing more than eye candy with perfect make-up in every situation much like Megan Fox was, except this one has a British accent. The introduction of a new flame was awkward. For two movies we saw Sam doting over Megan Fox, then all of a sudden (in viewer time), he's just shy of wedding bells with a new girl.Thrusting a new paramour into the mix was just the beginning of all the things wrong with this waste material. It was way too long, it took itself too seriously, and there was far too much screaming.At two-and-a-half hours ""Dark of the Moon"" was trying to bill itself as ""Lord of the Rings,"" especially when you factor in all of the portentous moments director Michael Bay had us sit through. With the rousing speeches, the slo-mo, and the emotionality I thought Bay was really trying to go for Best Picture. Too bad it was all so hollow. There was no need to be that grand.

The characters are all morons,"If I had wanted to watch a humans vs aliens/robots insert generic bad guy here then I would have watched one of those movies. No I payed to watch Transformers instead I got about 30 minutes in total scenes of Transformers & two hours plus of Michael Bay making American soldiers look cool and badass.Transformers have been fighting a war for centuries, they are supposed to be hardened veterans instead they are used for comic relief & to make humans look cool with the ways they can kill some huge massively armoured and armed robots.The characters are all morons and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is the most annoying talentless person I have ever had to look at, just seeing her face on the screen in 3D no less made me angry and cringe at the same time. Also they shouldn't have called it Transformers it should have been called Optimus Prime because he's pretty much all you are going to see, the other Transformers are just thrown in as faceless, voiceless filler characters. The 3D is also terrible and pointless I have seen several movies in 3D recently and it was totally under used and wasn't even consistent not being used throughout the movie and the movie was about an hour to long, I prefer long movies but this one actually dragged along not going anywhere.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bay tried to deliver on his promise of a more developed story but failed miserably...but at least he gave us a good action movie,"Transformers 1 still remains the best of the lot in terms of story and the joy of watching the robots transform. By the third part it becomes quite ordinary and mundane.The positives: The action sequences are done quite well. With the way technology is advancing it's quite amazing at how quickly sequences can become bigger, better and longer. If the humans portion was cut out of the movie entirely it would be an even better movie to watch.It is a million times better than the abominable ROTF.John Malkovich in his short role is quite funny, as is John Turturro, even if he is still OTT in his diminished and toned down role.The transformers, both good and bad, are quite excellent. Sad to say but they're better actors than the humans.The slightly sub par: The new girl: I have to admit that she wasn't as bad as I thought she would be acting wise but she was still nothing special. In fact her role was completely pointless and there was a point where she's interacting with the transformers as she's been in the previous 2 movies and took herself way too seriously at times. Even a muppet on a stick could have done the same job, for less money, and with the same result. But she is still a lot better than Megan Fox...The negatives: The lack of consistent humour, which was quite funny and welcome in the first movie. Instead there are some sexual gags and jokes which are quite lame.The slow motion of the new girl's body: I like it when a camera focuses on a hot girl but the way Bay did it made me feel sleazy and cheap. It was there in the first movie but done quickly and more tastefully. Here, it's so blatant that it's annoying, as if it had to be part of the script or else the movie would fail.The plot: there is none, or more to the sense there is nothing original to the plot of the movie. It follows the basic principle of just about every trilogy ender: have a giant war/battle that lasts more than an hour. It seems that the plot was written after the action scenes were mapped out because it's a jumbled mess with a lot of stop and go.The cheesy ending: a typical Michael Bay ender. NO spoilers required. Who said this guy could direct movies? Too many human actors: just about everyone from the first two movies are in it and there are new people added. There's no time to draw out anyone's back story and you just don't care for Sam and the rest of the humans this time round.Not enough time spent on the robots: This movie, as well as the others, starts of as Transformers, not Humans. There are new transformers but they are either not identified or done too quickly for us to register before the start of a action sequence so it becomes confusing whether they are autobots or decepticons.All in all, it's a teenager's action movie wetdream and they'll love it. But for the cynical it's a wasted effort on ending the transformers saga on a high note in terms of a good story. If there is another movie in the works I really hope that Michael Bay is not there to ruin it. George Lucas destroyed the first three Star Wars movies with his ""vision."" Let's hope that Michael Bay is not round to repeat the same mistake...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Solid action but can do without the weak romance and comedy,"So this latest installment has turned the transformers franchise into a trilogy. The 1st one is still the best for one single reason - pure action. This one, much like the second, has become watered down by Michael Bay as he attempts to reach a wider audience while hardcore transformer fans (like myself) now have to suffer! The two annoying mini-autobots from the 2nd part make a return appearance and are still very annoying. Also the romance dialogue between Sam and his gf is quite weak and actually takes away rather than adds to the movie. I hope in the 4th installment that Bay sticks to pure action (a la Terminator 2) and stop trying to appease different demographics!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"I thought, Michael Bay apologized for part 2...","I don't always review films, but when I do, it's either because the movie is great, or it really sucks! Which one do you think it is?I thought Michael Bay apologized for the second movie, but still he didn't seem to have learned anything. The annoying parents were still there (although I have to give him credit for keeping their screen-time to a minimum) And although he put some well-achieved actors in this movie (John Voigt saved Transformers 1, in my opinion), both John Malcovich and Frances McDormand are both redundant for the plot (if there was anything like a plot) and also had pretty ridiculous roles.And yeah, you have to give the movie some credit for the special effects, but now really think about it!...Were there any amazing scenes apart from those in the trailer? I don't think so. Optimus slashing some Decepticons, Building falling down with protagonists in it, City of Chicago under a large-scale attack of spaceships... all in the trailer...And now some more points that make the movie the terrible piece of cinematic pulp it is:-product placement (yeah, all computers are lenovo, I get it)-soundtrack (some nice pieces from the first one but anything new? anyway,what has become of linkin park?)-non-existing jokes (at some points you feel you were supposed to laugh, but couldn't really find anything funny... just weird)-what the fudge did the Chinese guy from hangover do there?",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Transformers: Dark side of human intellect,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon does put me in some dilemma. To call it a movie would be gross injustice, for it is anything but, it is a sad, raucous, empty 150 minute flick that tricks you into yawning insufferably. To call it a bad movie would be no less an injustice, as it would give the bad movies a bad name. So if we agree to call it Thing, I should say that it is one terrible Thing.It is easily the worst Thing of the decade, and keeping in mind that this very decade has seen movies like its prequel, Pirates of the Caribbean IV, Twilight saga, this is saying something. There is no story, none at all. It is a pathetic excuse for a movie. The last hour is peppered with loud cacophonous dumb action, where, for all it matters, every robot is hitting every robot, and it becomes tiresome to figure which ones are the good ones, and frankly speaking, you would hardly care. The acting is pedestrian, a fine actor like John Malkovich is reduced to an absolute mockery, Shia LaBeouf, who was moderately tolerable in the first two installments, spends the first half screaming like hell, and the second half deciding whether to scream or not, and his parents, as usual, are poor comical add-ons and make you cringe. Every alternate minute, people turn up sporting a national top-secret, making you wonder since when has the US Govt started dishing out state secrets to common people. John Turturro appears out of nowhere, and bosses his way in and out of CIA, NASA, whenever he pleases, wherever he wishes, and he seems to have an awful number of people at his command, even though he is supposed to sit home sipping lemonade, as he was stripped of his power in part II.Surprises abound, still. As if the entire US army has gone to Tahiti for snorkeling, only a dozen of people are left in Chicago to defend the city, as the future of the world lies in balance. Thousands and thousands of spaceships materialize from thin air, and instead of attacking the rest of the world, which would have been much easier, given they don't have Autobots to protect them, attack poor old Chicago, and keeps on attacking it only. Actors find time to exchange romantic truisms in the midst of the war, even when a missile is cruising towards them. A clichéd word of wisdom is enough to turn one Decepticon against another, that too when the latter is about to kill an Autobot.The dialogs are so inane and trite, that one might strongly suspect whether there was any script at all. The action is stale and raucous, an unending pain-in-the-ass litany of gunshots and missile blasts, a motley influence of too many Fast and the Furious movies, and it's time that directors understand that having the latest CGI graphics and special effects at their disposal and cramming them in any possible combination does NOT a good action film make. Perhaps they will never understand. Perhaps that is why the Spielbergs and Camerons will always belong to an elusive class.And of course a review of the Thing would be incomplete without a mention of its lead ""actress"" Rosie Huntington Whiteley. Yes, you heard it right, she does make Megan Fox's acting look like Ingrid Bergman's! She happens to be the latest addition to a slew of models who have made a foray into acting, trying to parlay their success as a model into celluloid. She looks reasonably tolerable when she keeps mum, and indeed looks hot in progressively lesser and lesser amount of attire, but the moment she opens her mouth the entire effect is ruined, and an already poor scene is made even worse. Not only does she sound dumb, her trying to buy off the audience with daredevil clothes, as if her 'hotness' can buy her a purchase on acting skills, cannot but appear condescending, and after some time, quite tiring. It's high time that directors (and most importantly the models themselves) understand that acting and modelling are mutually exclusive sets, and excelling in the former doesn't necessarily make her good (or even tolerable) in the latter, so that we, the audience, are spared some horribly wooden acting. Amen.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It has flaws, but I still really liked it","I don't know why the world seems to hate me. Before I saw this movie, I saw tons of reviews saying that this film was a fun, action packed movie, with great visuals, and a plot that actually wasn't that bad. I see the movie, actually really like it, then when I get home, I get on my computer, and all I can find are reviewers bashing the film. I mean seriously, spill.com gave this a low rental, two some ol' bulls**t, and a f**k you. Richard roper recently said it was the worst movie he had seen all year, despite the fact that he had given the film a D and given at least two other movies a D- and at least one film and F.I won't say the film is perfect, even though I couldn't find any, I'm sure there were at least a few plot holes. Some of the humor didn't work, and it is at least 30 minutes too long.I basically went into this movie expecting great action and effects, and I got that, but there actually were other things I liked in this movie. For example I did laugh quite a bit, some of the humor actually did work for me. And yes, I actually liked the characters. I can't say I really loved any of them, most of them are just forgettable, but Sam Witwicky I did find to be enjoyable. It's weird, I should hate him, but Shia LaBeaof takes a character I should hate and makes him likable, where were you on that one Jeremy Renner.And the plot actually isn't that bad, the last half of the movie is pretty much not stop action. And like I said, I didn't see any plot holes.There are some people who absolutely hate this movie, and to me, they either focus on one negative aspect and exploit it, like Richard Roeper. Or they can't stop living in the 80s, like Spill.com or Brad Jones. I don't really care what Spoony says because I was never really a fan of his. If you do have a strong hatred for this movie, please explain why, what makes this really worse than Season of the Witch, or Battle: LA? Overall, it is a very stupid movie, but it's a fun, very stupid movie.Whether you like them or not, I guess there are two things you can't deny about the the live action Transformers movies, one, they have incredible special effects, and two, they are very stupid.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mind numbing!!!!,"Transformers 2 was unbearably horrible, it was almost sure that part 3 would have to be better, as being worse would be nearly impossible. Unfortunately, Michael Bay has made a film about on par with his last trainwreck Transformers movie, and this, like this last movie is a thoroughly dumb and unenjoyable sensory overload full of poorly thought out plot points, dumb dialogue in this sort of surreal fantasy world where everyone is as goofy as can be.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is living in a nice apartment with his new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), and needs some action in his life. He gets a new job, and is almost killed, and meanwhile Optimus Prime makes a trip to the moon to gain pillars and to bring back his old friend Sentinel Prime. Meanwhile again, Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) is Carly's boss, and Sam is jealous. And then Megatron and the Decepticons take over Chicago. And then there's action. And then it ends (thank God).Transformers 2 must have been too serious for people, because Michael Bay just had the actors go all out slapstick performances. It was like an unfunny reproduction of the Three Stooges or something. Comedic scenes are comedic only because of these cartoon like performances where everyone is a comedian, and nobody seems to care about impending danger, but instead just want to lighten the mood with their nightclub routines. The first hour of the movie is so silly and lightweight, it literally serves no purpose whatsoever.No scenes had any effect on the next scenes. Shia Labeouf is almost killed, and this scene is followed by a 5 minute speech about love with his parents. Chicago is destroyed by Decepticons, and immediately following we see people casually walking through destroyed Chicago like they're going for a stroll before work or something. An entire sub-plot about Sam getting a job is completely dropped, and serves no point in the movie except to introduce these bizarrely eccentric characters and give the audience some very dumb yuk- yuks. A bizarre scene has Russians pulling guns on Sam and John Turturro, and it literally is just there for laughs. It's so over the top, and cloying for cheap laughs, it's almost pathetic, and again, has no impact on anything. In fact, this entire movie could have been scrapped, and the big battle at the end could have basically been the film, because really that's all that mattered in the ""plot"".Character motivations are way off too. Patrick Dempsey wants the Decepticons to win, because he was promised he will be saved, and not killed by them. He knows that their plot is to enslave humans, and he also admits a dislike for Megatron. When the Autobots come, Dempsey goes and tattles to the Decepticons. So...does he want to be a slave? Not tattling would have had no repercussion on him, and actually could cause him not to be a slave. Also making no sense is Patrick Dempsey's henchmen and workers who stay loyal to him in the face of total annihilation. As the robots destroy Chicago and kill people, they stay guarding Carly like this job is of some importance. Humans are being enslaved and they are taking some meaningless job when they should be running for their dear life. Again, it's like no characters think through anything that happens.The Transformers are hard to watch. They walk around with English, New York, Italian and other accents and why? Are they from these places or just made to be exactly like Earth people? Megatron's henchmen robots are like Igor from Frankenstein, and one of them even has this giant rag on their head to make them seem like a lowly servant, but why? Why would a robot wear this? Did they see people doing this in clichéd sci fi movies? And to top that off, the robots know all the cool Earth slang and speak in it, and the little robots seem to have high libidos. The only purpose for them being so anthropomorphic is to get the audience to laugh at their lame one-liners, and they come off as horrible clichés.This is a movie that is pandering to it's audience through bottom of the barrel dumb comedy, big loud action scenes and a nonexistent plot. But it's terribleness goes beyond that. It's a movie where even the most idiotic of individuals in the audience has more brains in their head than any of the characters, and nobody thinks through any situation, and no decisions make any sort of logical sense. It's a series of unnecessary events that leads to an overlong finale that is more headache inducing than fun. This might be a tiny bit better than Transformers 2, but the two movies are close to being on par. If you just think about any aspect of the film, you will realize nothing makes any sense. This was just awful!My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 153 mins. PG-13 for violence and language.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Waste of time.......,"i checked IMDb today after i came home from the cinema, and saw that the movie has almost 7 points... i just had to register to write this review.It was absolutely terrible. In advance, i'd like to apologize for using the world ""ridiculous"" too many times, but that's the best one to describe this masterpiece. of course one would expect that a story about 30 m high robots is a little bit ridiculous, but it was really over the top. After things started going, there wasn't a single minute in the film where something utterly ridiculous did not happen. So many examples... I'll list some of them and some of my problemsthe chick checks the 2 evil robots with the spyglass, sees that they have an argument. later on, she decides to turn megatron against the bearded guy (the super villain high tech robot megatron), and she persuades him. yeah, that's right. that's some neat intrigue you might expect from hose luis Fernando from a Brazilian soap opera, you get it here with a super robot in a 100 million dollar budget film with Steven Spielberg's name.they don't stop telling each other secrets of the government. no question, no reason, it's needed because the story can't progress, so why not tell something that's been a state secret for 30 years, or even yell it in front of 30 people. every time this happens, you just ask loudly in your chair: WHY THE HELL DID HE TELL THAT? but there's never an answerno one thinks forward in the movie, not even the decepticons. the bug just came off the main guy's wrist after the decepticons thought the auto bots left.why the hell did it come off and just left the guy that has been a major pain in the ass for the decepticons in the past decade? why didn't it stay on him or kill him? humans don't kill each other, even if it would be in their best interest. no, they let the hostage live and tell secrets so he can escape and ruin their plans. the robots somehow avoid killing humans until the last part of the moviethe movie has some weird comical parts, some of them childish, and they don't kill any humans in the first half of the movie. but then there is a gay joke and at the end the human killing strangely begins, decepticons shoot people to ash and their skull rolls on the ground after they evaporated. so please mr bay, decide if you want a movie for the audience of spy kids,and don't show sexual/violent stuff, or make a scifi for adults, and don't make it retarded.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Dark the Moon, the mediocre one","The Transformers series started out quite strong but I knew as I watched that film that any attempt to make a 'bigger' film would end up with a clunky mess. Thus we had 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' which was a terrible in parts, overly complicated and had a dull climax. For these reasons I had pretty neutral expectations going into this film where I expected action by the bucket load but more hoped to gain enjoyment from it this time. The film starts out with our human protagonist Sam played once again by Shia LaBeouf with shoehorned girlfriend Carly played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. The reason why I say shoehorned is because there is no introduction, they are just a couple. Of course I realise the absence of Megan Fox but after all Mikaela went through with Sam you'd think something pretty big would end that relationship. Anyway we've got two and a half hours to fill, Sam has to find a job and the Autobots must face off against the Decepticons again. The first act of this film very much feels like filler until the action comes rather than set up and that is where we get most of the 'humour' which falls flat around 60% of the time. I'm not going to get too wound up as if the film got treated completely seriously this time round it would make for a cringe inducing experience. By now though it was more of a slight distraction. Performances wise LaBeouf does a fairly good job with what he's given. Quite a good actor in all honesty and wasn't nearly as annoying as he has the potential to be. Carly, our new female lead is not very good and doesn't provide an improvement on Megan Fox. Maybe its the fault of the script but she was just uninteresting and obviously only really served as eye candy.Other characters like Simmons returned to inject little to no decent comic relief. Gladly John Turturro is a good enough actor to be in the role and not be bogged down by what he's in. Special effects wise it is mostly more of the same, the action set pieces are better set up and are superior to second film. In truth at times it was spectacular to see especially towards the end before becoming very familiar the more it progressed. This had more to do with the film's run time which again well over two hours, you do have to brace yourself for it as certainly I felt it towards the end of the film. The Transformers looked as good as they ever did and if it is one thing the film gets right is that they did look very real. The Decepticons seemed to have more of a presence this time round as there appeared to more effort put into them as antagonists. They were satisfactory but never came across as particularly menacing as they wouldn't the third film in. The film more works out as a middle ground but could never capture why the first was the best. It is superior to Revenge of the Fallen but the final action climax did very much remind me of when I was bored in the cinema two years ago.Overall though this is the mediocre edition to the series, its enjoyable on its own merits but not on a general film level. If you want to see this and enjoyed the series so far you'll probably enjoy this one. It is just simply a half decent Transformers film and an average action film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What's all the fuss about?,"You know what? I get this film. I get what Michael Bay aims for these films. He doesn't make emotional or deep movies. He makes action-packed blockbusters. This is what, I think, people have forgotten about the director. This film, unfortunately, doesn't try anything fresh for the franchise - it is still the same ""end of the world"" plot with a couple of plot twists here and there. The characters don't really develop at all - Sam is still looking for something he hasn't figured out yet (in this case, a job); Megan Fox, now out of the picture, has been replaced by Rosie Huntington-Whitely, who is still there to stare at when the plot gets dull, although does well in her first big film; Sam's mother and father are irritating as ever; Optimus is dramatic and always arrives at exactly the right moment. This doesn't make Dark of the Moon a bad film, it just doesn't take the franchise in any great leap whatsoever. It provides a fairly fast paced, action packed movie with awesome special effects and incredible set pieces - probably better to wait until it drops in price and pick it up then.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Only 3 stars?

I especially loved the battle at the end.

In what sort of extra terrestrial universe is this a good film???,"Let me get something straight, I like movies which contain a good storyline, unpredictable plot twists, memorable dialogues and well executed direction and acting. And to be frank this movie had none of those. It was just a showcase of high- tech, expensive but pointlessly executed special effects filled with extremely boring clichés, petty thrills and cheap attempts to draw big crowds. Movies like this might be considered by some people as 'entertaining' but where is the class in it?The acting is just awful, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was used as an eye candy but nothing else. Shia Lebeouf did what he did in the first two movies , bored us to death. His character is flat as usual and the acting was disappointing to say the least.Now, coming to the context of the plot , there are no twists, no adrenaline-rushing action scenes, no depth in the storyline. The only thing that might be considered even remotely close to ""good"" in this huge mess is the work done by the special effects team. They managed to make some of the scenes pretty believable and realistic. And finally, how on earth did the writers manage to create plot holes in this rather simple plot? I mean how can machines survive for years in a metal corrosive surface like that of the moon? There were also other plot holes which I spotted but I'd have to spoil the story to point them out. Anyway, with due respect to Michael Bay and all who were involved in the making of this film, I'd like to request them to change their extremely commercial approach to filmmaking and create movies by thinking out of the box like Quentin Tarantino and especially Christopher Nolan.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing film,"I'm a really big fan of transformers . The movie had the best action scenes of the Transformers. There are some fabulous action sequences and epic battles that take your breath away. It's technically sublime, but if does go on a bit. After two and a half hours I did feel as If I was suffering from metal fatigue. Incredible visual effects !!! Outstanding. I waited for a long time to see it and after seeing the movie I could only say 2 words ""WOW and AWESOME!!!"" and I saw this 3 times but still interesting. This film tells the story of the future of a thousand years. There all awesome all though the end I think should have been a three way battle instead of Optimus killing them both in 3 seconds but still really good movie Megatron looked awesome. The should make a fourth one with Megatron coming back as Galvatron and Unicron should be in it. Morover,the special effects is where it was at. Big robots, big explosions, big buildings falling down. Those were the highest points.The story of TF4 is similar to the 1st cartoon movie. Megatron is revived by Unicron and becomes Galvatron. Optimus is replaced by Rodomus Prime in the cartoon movie. I like that Transformers 3 is effective and very clear like in a reality life. Not Boring...I wanna to watch it every time.... I hope continue with next episode more adventures, also more tragic.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Sorry, it sucks.","Have the producers of this franchise forgotten that the original fans of the Transformers have grown up now? Apparently so. With a little work on the script and animation, it would have had much broader appeal, but the result is a movie aimed only at teen-aged boys, which is actually offensive to other demographics. The jokes were stupid and crass, and the themes too childish for someone of LeBeouf's age and maturity. Presumably the inclusion of good-quality actors was to make it seem they would present good characters, but I suspect that after they saw the script, it was only good pay that kept them at work on the production. Sorry, this is the last of the franchise I'll be going to see.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Pretty long, the action was good but felt was made just like that ..","Wow great graphics, love the action but pretty bore movie and too long. Showing the cars running again n again nothing new same old fights with just a new agenda but stretching it too much was stupidity. A lot of talks happening in the movie made me and a lot around me sleepy and they like talking about the film that what really is happening or where is it going i mean it was heavily loosing its interest as people today needs to see a movie that keeps them a lot interested and like what's gonna happen next?! That boosts a lot of + points in the movie's ratings i bet! But nothing was seen like that in this. Due to the other characters playing a bogus role and because of wasting time it was like there was no use of making this one and like the movie is just made for the heck of it. I give it a 6/10 because of the cars, good action, good acting by the main stars of the movie and really because of Shockwave (Character) which was awesome, would have been better if they would have shown him from a much further distance angle on camera to see it all clearly for long doing all the thrashing stuff but none the less was good as much of it was shown.

"Transformers 3, much less than meets the eye...","I'm not a fan of the Transformers but I did enjoy the first two films and I don't ask for much when it comes to movies about giant robots fighting each other. Transformers 3 however failed to even live up to my low expectations and in my opinion it is easily the worst film of the series.In the first two films director Michael Bay was at least aware that a movie based on large robot toys should be fun. This movie tries to get clever by infusing robot lore into actual historical events such as the moon landing in '69 and the Chernobyl meltdown of '86 which had great potential if only they'd bothered to think it all the way through. Stagnating in pits of exposition with plot holes large enough to ram Optimus Prime through sideways, we get bogged down in lengthy scenes where everyone tries to act more crazy and over the top than everyone else, presumably to hide the fact that nothing much else is happening and it's all very boring. To compensate for the absurd over acting displayed by most of the cast Bay throws in a new leading lady who barely acts at all but in her defense she does do a decent job in the role she was really hired for and that is to fill the 'sexy eye candy' void left by the controversial departure of Megan Fox, who should be glad she was left out of this debacle.The first half of the film is filled with little more than scenes of Shia complaining about everything, so much so that I almost switched off around the 30 minute mark but thankfully the second half of the film ramps up a little and we get to have a bit of fun as the story starts to unfold with some twists (albeit mostly lame or obvious ones) and an injection of much needed WOW moments of visual delight. At last we get some of Bay doing what Bay does best - total mayhem, but regrettably by the time the film really kicks into gear I was way past caring or investing into the movie on any level.Watching Transformers 3 I couldn't help but feel Bay was growing bored with fighting robots and the complete lack of extras on the Blu-ray could be a telling sign that I might be right. It was like he was on auto pilot, there was a definite lack of typical overly stylistic signature Bay moments and I wondered if he actually bothered to turn up on set most days. In fact he has become so disinterested that he's now reusing songs from the soundtracks of his previous movies (Aerosmith's Sweet Emotion also featured in Armageddon). It's way past time for Bay to move on, especially if there is to be a fourth film because this franchise is in desperate need of fresh ideas and some enthusiasm.Despite being a pretty terrible film Transformers 3 grossed a truckload of money and there are rumors that parts 4 and 5 will be filmed back to back. The bad news is that Bay is meant to be directing. The good news is that LaBeouf may be replaced by Jason Statham so hopefully there'll be less moaning and groaning from the leading man which might, if nothing else, free up some time for Bay to blow more stuff up earlier in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
long movie,the transformers series is going a little too far now. this film like all the transformers films are is long. there are some bits that aren't necessarily needed. don't get me wrong it's a great movie it's just that it's on for hours. the films ending seemed to me like it was a bit of a rush to get finished but i still like it.the story line to this movie in the franchise is the best for me. out of all the transformers movies this one has to be my favourite just because of the amazing special effects. i think that they should ma'be start coming to the end of this franchise now because every new plot has a complicating story line to it. if you watch the movie from start to finish you'll be able to get it but if you have a break you are bound to miss an important key to the story.watch it if you like apocalypse type of movies as the ending sort of seems like it's going to head that way plus watch it if you've watched the rest of the series as you won't be disappointed,8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bay redeems his imperfect franchise with strong visuals and a high-stakes story,"I called ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" a 2.5-hour exhibition of a hurricane in a hardware store. There should have been nothing exciting, therefore, about the prospect of a second 2.5-hour exhibition — this time of hunks of scrap metal perpetually raining over Chicago — filmed entirely in 3D. Yet with the added assurance of the 3-D fusion camera system and someone with as keen an eye for action as Michael Bay, there was something thrilling — at least in theory — about this installment.It also helped, for me, that Bay apologized. He was among many involved to admit the problematic nature and various shortcomings of ""Fallen"" and vowed a better experience this go-around in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" Redemption, it seems, would be a good way of categorizing ""Dark of the Moon."" It's hardly the disaster its predecessor was, but it's also hardly what most would classify as ""good."" Fortunately, it has plenty of (thoughtful) satisfying action with enough traction for us to actually give a damn about what happens on screen.In this third chapter, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) lives in D.C. with his new girlfriend, Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). She's a bit more charming, though equally positioned for the purposes of eye candy, than Megan Fox. Sam's trying to get a job, but finds that he only felt confident in himself or important when he was saving the world with the Autobots. When the U.S government makes a discovery proving that Transformers first made contact with our planet in 1963 when a ship crash-landed on the moon, a chain of events occurs and Sam finds himself with the chance to be a hero again. Basically, if the Decepticons were to get ahold of what's on the moon, destruction would befall Earth, unsurprisingly.For one, ""Dark of the Moon"" provides a worthwhile 3-D experience. Bay and 3D seem like a perfect marriage of auteur and medium. Only he and other style-first types could imagine an action sequence worthy of capturing in 3D without intentionally making stuff fly out toward the audience. Some of it's breathtaking, but most of it simply looks good. The ""Transformers"" series has only ever been as good as its paint job, and the look of ""Dark of the Moon"" is crisper and cleaner than ""Fallen.""Yet many of ""Fallen's"" problems transfer to this installment, in particular length, story and an overabundance of characters and robots. Other than a key plot twist halfway through, the story lacks any grounding. At this point as well, the focus shifts away from Sam and onto the Decepticons trying to take over the world. Writer Ehren Kruger takes so much time to set up the historical context of the dark side of the moon and Sam's feeling of insecurity, yet he throws all that setup out the window when the action finally takes off. By then, we're ready for Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots anyway, so who cares.An extended lineup of new mechanical friends probably made the folks at Hasbro happy, but there are too many Transformers to count in this film and so many lose the attention they deserve. Rather than focus on the effective ones like Soundwave and Laserbeak, Shockwave and Sentinel Prime, we get various bots shifting into the spotlight so that no one gets a distinct personality. Only those who've seen the prior films will feel moved by scenes involving Bumblebee, Optimus Prime and Ironhide, for example. The ceiling to care about these bots is high, but the sheer number keeps us from getting there.More problematic, however are the number of people actors. The human characters outside of Sam have always been obnoxious and inconsequential to the story, so to fill so many roles with A-listers such as John Malkovich, Frances McDormand and Patrick Dempsey feels more wasteful than not recycling a dead Transformer. Audiences are paying to see the robots fight in 3D, not the humans talk. Unless you're going to deliver a story where the humans matter, don't bog us down with them.Then there's the humor and political incorrectness that the ""Transformers"" movies can't seem to shake. Although nothing's as insulting as the racist twin motorcycle bots from ""Fallen"" that have been eliminated, the two ""mini transformers"" and some English race cars that McDormand calls assholes take their place. Some of the jokes are surprisingly spot-on, but it ends up excessive and uncalled for more often than not. Michael Bay also continues his lady- ogling with Rosie making her ""Transformers"" debut from the waste down.So maybe Michael Bay is just a stubborn old filmmaker who knows what he likes, but one gets the sense with ""Dark of the Moon"" that he sharpened up a bit to make sure this film didn't outrage the fan base. Some filmmakers whose movies make $900-some million take that as creative license to make edgier projects, but in Bay's case, he makes it more how he likes it: big, loud, slick and sexy. It's unlike most filmmakers to make their films more Hollywood- pleasing as they gain notoriety and respect, but Bay's turned it into an art form. In the case of ""Dark of the Moon,"" he's upped the emotional and visual stakes to create an engaging feat of blockbuster. Although some of his contemporaries would have us believe that explosions and fighting should come with a side of philosophical sermon, Bay reminds us that there's value in wowing an audience and that doing so requires talent, even if that talent normally rates behind great storytelling.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
not what its cracked up to be,"yes the explosions are. but thats all that makes the movie... the plot is very dull and there is not much that makes it good than the epic giant robot battles throughout. the problem though, is the movies clichés and predictability. an example: dull point in the movie, theater is dead quiet... i turn to my friend and say ""boom"" whats next? BOOM! overall it was a good action film, but looking at the movie as a whole, it doesn't matter. the plot was there but didn't seem to fit well throughout. overall though, i've seen better, and i've seen worse... but still. everyone said it would be the best movie of the summer, i disagree. besides, there is a song that says ""cool guys don't look at explosions"" well, if you don't look at explosions, you get grade A crap. thats all the non action was... plain and simple.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mixed review,"I would rate this move a 7. There are tons of action, the special effects are great, the action sequences long and numerous. There is so much going on, it is hard to follow at times.

Rosie Huntington is incredible eye candy and does a decent job. But Megan Fox and her relationship with Sam was more memorable and interesting.

Unbearable,"I swear that I tried to see ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"". Michael Bay's film probably is so noisy to avoid that the viewer sleeps. It may help, since wakes up the viewer when the noise increases too much, but it is not enough. I have seen this film with two other people and we three have taken naps along the never-ending story of 154 minutes running time.The awful story is ridiculous and the characters are imbecile and inconsistent. The hero Shia LaBeouf has the face of an idiot, is a simple filing clerk in an office and out of the blue, he is the savior of mankind in a total absurd. His girlfriend with Botox in the lips is a decorative character and may be a great model, but her acting is limited to make faces and mouths and nothing else.The excessive use of stereotypes and exacerbated patriotism is also irritating. A film can not be limited to special effects only; otherwise it is unbearable to be watched.

There was actually a little bit off a story in there somewhere.,"This ""Transformers"" movie feels as though it's slightly better than its predecessors purely because I've gradually found the series chaos easier too follow each time. But it fails in many off the same ways as the others did as well as in some brand spanking new ways!First off,I'm probably one off the only ones in the world that thought number 2 off this franchise was an improvement on number 1 (These blockbusters being referred too as number 1 and number 2 seems justified too most who saw them i'd imagine) Ye it was over the top, but so was the original. I remember that the first film tried way too hard too be funny, while ""revenge of the fallen"" had me laughing. So succeeded more in entertaining me in my book. I also had trouble following who was who amongst the robots in the first flick, while the second had some off the characters I remember from my childhood featured, making it an over the top mess I could at least grasp a little better.This ones attempt at humour is pretty poor, but restrains itself more too the first half off the film, leaving the second part as nothing but action. The special effects are as good as always, even if the ""3D"" proves as disappointing as always. Off course its all relying on its visuals this, but at least there is a story off sorts, and some more characters that I remember from the cartoons and toys I had as a kid. So I really can't complain about not getting what I was at least expecting from the movie.What I will say against it though is that it really has a whole bunch off other priority's wrong! It brings back unimportant human characters from the first two (except for Megan Fox, who is replaced here by some annoying English model) while getting rid off the robot characters we're finally getting round too seeing way too early. All in all the whole franchise seems intent on barely featuring Megatron. The Main bad guy as far as I know. Demoted too a mere side character in this series. Oh, and the raciest robots from the second film have gone, but there is a stereotypical Irish and Scottish robot on board. I'm Scottish and can't really say I was offended, but I'm just saying because no one else will pull Michael Bay up for that one.Its nice that Bay got John Malcovich, Frances McDormand and Leonard Nimoy too be in the movie but so what? He should be concentrating more on cutting out cliché slow motion and dumb comedy sidekicks from his movies. I wasn't expecting the film too be a masterpiece based on what came before it. But I was expecting too at least see the return off some cool robot characters, and in that respect the film just teases!This feels like an abrupt end off a trilogy too. One that's finished before a proper story has even begun. I hate Hollywoods recent fascination with re-booting everything, but the ""Transformers"" really do feel like they're in need off one. A Transformer getting re-booted sounds just about right too me. Make it happen!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
In the world of transformer all we ask is that we get a story that makes enough sense to get giant robots to fight each other and to that demand the movie fits the bill.,"The Transformers films have had a long problematic journey ever since the decent and promising original came out in 2007. The original may not have been the greatest or most intelligent movie, but it was fun to watch and looked like a hopeful start to a new series of films. In 2009 Revenge of the Fallen was released to the world and has since become the definition of dumb bad movie as it was filled with mindless action all tied loosely together by an extremely weak plot. As much promise as it held it was not able to deliver what audiences were craving. For many film goers it seems that Dark of the Moon has the huge task of not only being entertaining but also redeeming the terrible second movie. Michael Bay himself apologized for the failures of the Revenge of the Fallen and promised a better third movie. With Dark of the Moon it seems that Bay is aiming for a darker film that will finally wrap up the transformers trilogy which does give audiences hope for an emotionally satisfying ending. So the big question on everyone's mind is can Michael Bay and screenwriter Ehren Kruger pull off a dark, entertaining, and emotionally satisfying end to this usually dumb but still fun film trilogy?Check out the rest: http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is Oscar Worthy!!!!,"(end sarcasm)Michael Bay mounts another overblown monstrosity. The cash machine needs to be continuously replenished.

She makes me pine for Megan Fox. Shame on her. Megan is a master craftsman compare to this. Josh Duhamel also returns. In the end, the story is meaningless. The acting is almost as meaningless. The action is the key. All that matters is the action. And there is nothing new anymore from this franchise. The super slo-mo is more a hindrance.

There are like one or two very tiny plot holes but who cares, it did not really effect the story.Three: The action was the best i've ever seen in my life.

"21st Century, All-American Godzilla Movie","When I was a kid, I used to watch Godzilla movies on TV every Saturday. I loved watching the rubber monsters duke it out. As an adult, I still do, scarily enough.What we have with Transformers 3 is a Godzilla movie. Only this is not some low-budget affair with men in rubber suits. This is an over-budgeted, over-produced, CGI monstrosity! In 3-D!!! Michael Bay, one of my least-favorite directors working in A-list Hollywood these days, has made his masterpiece. This is the biggest, fastest, loudest and perhaps MEANEST 150 minutes (yes, this mofo is 2 1/2 hours long!) I've spent in a movie theater in a long while.The first 20 minutes of Transformers 3, which tie the ensuing storyline to the first moon landing, are a tour de force of contemporary, big-budget Hollywood filmmaking: dynamic, gripping, utterly stupid, completely absorbing. Bay's best work! (Faint praise, I will admit.)I hated the first Transformers movie. Hated, hated, HATED it. I never even saw the second one. But this one, number 3, was *exactly* what I wanted.

"Crap piled on crap, piled on crap, piled on crap","Somebody please institutionalize Michael Bay. The first Transformers was a weak action film with some redeeming qualities. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was a ridiculous and over the top mess and now we've arrived at Transformers: Dark of the Moon which at this point is just sad. This is a pathetic excuse for an action blockbuster that makes a mockery of everything action films stand for. In the latest bulbous growth to the series follows the Autobots when they find a Cybertronian spacecraft on the moon. The Autobots must save the world again as they keep the Decepticons from utilizing the spacecraft for a worldwide takeover.There isn't really much more to say about the plot because it might as well be nonexistent. In its place we find the most convoluted action scenes full of a painful and redundant amount of explosions and robots throwing crap at each other. There is a scene here and there that I might be able to stomach calling a little cool or kinda neat, but this film mainly succeeds in convincing me that giant fighting robots can actually be really boring. I never thought I could muster up so much hate for so much action. But there is a certain point when all cinematic skill and finesse goes out the window and it is nothing more than an attempt to see how many explosions can be allowed in one two and a half hour film. There is no aesthetic quality to the action. It is as far from stylish or sophisticated as it can possibly be and is nothing more than an idiotic mess. I don't remember the last time I wanted a film to end as badly as I did during the last 45 minutes of endless stupidity that was the final battle of Transformers: Dark of the Moon.This film basically breaks down as follows. 60 percent action. 30 percent stupid jokes that do so incredibly little for the plot and aren't all that funny. 5 percent childish romance between the two obnoxious leads. And finally, 5 percent story. After Michael Bay snorts twelve lines of coke and crams his idiotic mess of a film full of as many explosions possible he says to himself, ""Oh right! I have to put a story in here somewhere! Well I can't have it take up too much time so I'll have to just have the characters explain things as blatantly and flatly as possible so that I have more time to thrown in explosions and stupid jokes that don't really belong here, but who cares! I'm Michael Bay I can do whatever the hell I want! And that includes making my movie two and a half hours long!"" And what a painful two and a half hours it was. If only Bay's heart had stopped after that whole spiel and I would be in a better place right now.This film reminds me why the art of filmmaking is so under-appreciated. It is because some ""filmmakers"" manage to produce steaming piles of crap like this movie. Every moment of this film is a mess. I chuckled maybe once and never did I feel I was witnessing something intense, awesome, or even fun. I wanted this movie to end and when the credits finally began to role a huge wave of relief came over me. This film is exactly how not to make a film. It is boring, stupid, paced horribly, and just put together so horribly and so crudely. In all its glamour and grandiose special effects you would think the film would be more polished than this turd is, but it is just such a piece of garbage that feels like it was thrown together by someone who has never made a film in their life. It is dreadful on a whole new level. However, there is one thing going for this film. I'm going to go see a lot more films this year as we're only half way through. A lot of them will surely be crap but now, when I see a bad film I can at least find some optimism by telling myself, ""At least it wasn't as bad as Transformers: Dark of the Moon.""",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Michael Bay - The Accidental Auteurist,"Michael Bay is certainly nothing short of an accidental auteurist! With his latest offering he takes the ockham's razor to the summer blockbuster, carving out the superfluous- story,characterization, et al, while distilling the necessary and tweaking his distinct Bay-ian aesthetic to a maximum to produce the purest testimony of an evident cinematic apocalypse.Also worthy of interest is Bay's provocative depiction of the British bimb0. Her reduction to an object of the gaze is evident throughout the film. In one glorious shot where she scuttles to the telescope to view the enemy forces Bay cuts from this collagen prone bombshell(sic!) to a fancy golden maned bitch seated on a similar chair passively viewing the ensuing mayhem!Talk about free association! Such honesty and fearless purity of vision effectively transcends the entire camp of critical left field detractors!As a final note : I'm sure future post modernists shall hail this film as the newest reincarnation of B-movie conventions . the 'b' now read as Blockbuster.

The most recent edition was as bad as the rest.I won't try to describe this ""plot"", it's just not worth it. Shea Labouf is terrible, and Rosie-Huntington Whiley makes Megan Fox look like Meryl Streep. Greats like John Malkovich and Frances McDormand show up, and for what? They are great actors in a terrible movie.As usual, big, incomprehensible robots duke it out in the middle of a city, and destroy everything they touch. No surprises there.

Amazing,"This movie will be the best movie of the summer and most likely the best 3rd movie in a trilogy. It was perfect. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the movie, excited, shocked, amazed, I even had a few tears in my eyes! Transformers 3 has everything a good movie should have. Action, comedy, a few little heart felt moments... Well Maybe just for me but it was perfect. 10 out of 10!! Go see this movie. I'm going to see it again tomorrow, that's how good it was. I just wish it would never end. I need more Transformers.On the other side of thing though, I don't think this counts as a spoiler or anything but a few autobots weren't even in this movie, maybe they were killed between movies, I don't know. Mudflap and Skids were the comical ones and now R.C had to fill that roll. And Jolt is missing, the character that put the wings and guns on Optimus in Revenge of the Fallen. How could he not be in it? But new characters make up for it all.

Scores for action and special effects alone,"Live-action Transformers movies make great business sense not just at the box office but also for Hasbro's merchandise. With the action getting bigger in every version, 'Dark of the Moon' aka Transformers-3 is a typical Micheal Bay movie, which promises loads of action which, as usual is scantily clad with a semblance of a story.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), the central character in the first two films has now finished schooling and looking for a job. He has also moved cities and also to a new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington- Whitley). Sam and the Autobots dive into the thick of the plot when the truth behind moon explorations is apparently revealed as an investigation into a crashed Cybertronian spacecraft on the dark side of the moon.Sentinel Prime is a key character inclusion as Optimus' mentor and Cybertronian genius who his keen on using advanced technology to revive his planet and also brings a twist in the story. The one-eyed serpentine cannon bot Shockwave is TF3's most formidable antagonist. Old enemy Megatron has lost his edge but not his ambitions and moves around as a rusty old truck with a cowl covering the injury inflicted by Optimus in TF2.The film's selling point is its special effects, largely shot in stereoscopic 3D which deserves unreserved applause for the resultant spectacle. Intricate action sequences are slowed down for detail and camera angles are simply great. The freeway chase that features in most of Bay's movies is seen again though. With more bots and the threat of imminent global danger make the climax worthwhile.Nevertheless, there is a lot missing with the script and acting. The flow is also affected by poor transitions between action and storytelling. Sudden cuts in some action sequences and the lucky bunny romance scene that suddenly pops up from nowhere are just a few examples. Also, some of its humor is downright silly.Sam's character that was central to the story in the earlier movies as he held maps or clues that either group was chasing. Here, the battle has nothing to do with him and all that LaBeouf has to do is to play his usual scared hero. Megan Fox's replacement, Rosie brings in her charm, but none too comparable to Fox. Both something in common though; they're both equally awful at acting.And, nearly everyone else is just a caricature. Be it those reprising their roles such as Josh Duhamel as the army commander or John Torturro as the former Agent turned author who aren't critical to the story or new new faces such as the largely wasted John Malkovich or a nervous Ken Jeong of Hangover fame. A significant exception is, Patrick Dempsey as Carly's moneyed boss with a deeper secret to his role.Clearly, it's a case of special effects donning the role of a back-seat driver. But, full marks for special effects, the lone pillar on which the Transormers edifice stands.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very crowded but not very satisfying,"Like too many movies recently, this rides the unnecessary 3D bandwagon for no reason. It adds nothing but increased ticket cost and eyestrain. No question, the effects are great (and would have been equally so in 2D), but the plot is very disjointed, with many odd segments that really make no sense, even when well done. The best performances were John Malkovitch and the barely credited Alan Tudyk. They were just great to watch, but so far off the main plot line, I was just not sure why they were there. I did love hearing Leonard Nimoy's voice as an autobot, but again, it was just too much in an already over-stuffed film.Let's face it, an overly long feature movie based on kids' mechanical toys is certain to have its detractors, but it does have a lot of rapid fire eye candy, and is a great summer movie. I did enjoy it, but I can't help but wish it had skipped the 3D, and invested that money in better editing, writing and some attention to continuity. It's always depressing to see a major production that really fails to be great, despite huge effort and expenditure, because it simply forgets the key rule of movie making.

"Better than the second movie, but still poor illiterate Bay...","This movie was better than the second sequel. Still, the director of this movie is very poor.

I mean doesn't this by itself tell you a kind of movie you can expect from him? Hard core Transformer fans will like it more than the 2nd disaster. However, I am missing Megan Fox, in this type of movie a hot chick is a necessity. Rosie is miles away and definitely not even comparable to Megan in a ""beauty"" department. All that this movie possesses are visual effects and better action in comparison to the 2nd movie. Even the sequel name is lame ""Dark of the moon"" trying to imitate the sequel ""Dark Knight"".

Awesome in every sense of the word,"This movie... was awesome. i mean AWESOME!Sure there's some dodgy stuff about it (Rosie Huntington Whitely's performance for one) but then what the heck did you expect from a movie that's essentially about gigantic fighting robots?i know that's not an ""excuse"" sure... why should we lower our expectations when it comes to big summer blockbusters? why should we expect no real story or strong non-stereotypical characters? i'll tell you why... it's because it's a big flipping action movie that's essentially about gigantic fighting robots.the whole premise of transformers (remember, based on toys) is ridiculous. It's preposterous. but it IS AWESOME. so, in fact, no, i don't want to be wasting my brain too much getting really 'in' to how deep and thoughtful the movie is. yawn-o-rama.Having said that, a story is present here, and it works perfectly well for the source material. It tells of a device that has the power to re-shape the universe.re-shape what i hear you cry? the universe? YES! THE UNIVERSE! that's epic man i don't care what you say. it plays out mostly like an epic fantasy, with it's own mythology and world relatable history. and man, what more do you want?Michael Bay is the king of blowing stuff up. He's the man here who dreamt ""what would it be like it bunches of massive metallic transforming alien robots started having a war on our planet, smashing each other and everything around them to smithereens"" And I'm so glad he did dream that dream. because this movie perfectly portrays exactly what i'd imagine would happen if this was in fact the case.We need this guy. Nobody creates this kind of spectacle like he does. it's so impressive. I can't even imagine beginning to conceive some of the sequences he pulls off in this movie. and he does it with such ease. It's so easy to hate michael bay, sure it is. he makes big dumb action movies, but we know this, and i really really enjoy a big dumb action movie once in a while. it's so much fun.michael bay is the man. yes, THE MAN. he is your man for pure explosive spectacle. No one else would have done a better job of this movie. I genuinely believe that.Beautifully mixing perfectly realised CG effects with epic locations. The camera always at some kind of ridiculous angle that makes everything look GINORMOUS. Huge towering sky scrapers, and vast landscapes setting the backdrop for the showdown.It's a movie that knows exactly what it is, and who it's aimed at (that's right, horny teenage boys) and because of that, this movie DELIVERS. I'm now in my twenties, but when I was a young teenager, all i wanted to see was some awesome action, some crazy effects and some hot women. boom boom boom. this movie nails it.Given most of the reviews from critics and again here on IMDb, people seem to have forgotten what fun it is to go and watch a real event movie.

Great Movie!,"I have always been a fan of the Transformers, the first film was amazing but The Revenge of the Fallen was a big disappointment so I was a little hesitant on watching Transformers: Dark of the Moon. I am so glad that I took the time to watch it since it was full of continuous action and destruction.The theme of this movie is about good vs. evil, and how good will always prevail at the end. The film revolves around the Decepticons trying to take over planet earth, and part of that plan means getting rid of all of the Autobots. It starts out with videos of the sixties Apollo landing mission and later the viewers learn that it was all a big cover up of an alien spaceship crash on the moon. The Decepticons are able to get started on their plan when they trick Optimus Prime to go to the moon and bring the missing puzzle pieces they needed back to earth.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is of course the main character and his new girl friend Carly Spencer (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is his side kick. I think the only down fall in the whole movie is Rosie and her character. She is clearly not meant to be an actress and I think that this film lacks a great female actress to match all the amazing male roles. I really don't see why a movie with such brilliant special effects would need ""eye candy"". The other male roles were played by Josh Duhamel as Lennox, John Turturro as Simmons, Tyrese Gibson as Epps, and Patrick Dempsey as Dylan just to name a few.The Transformers in this movie are really amazing, their movement is so real and the angles they are shot from are visually spectacular. They did a great job shooting them from when they are cars to when they turn in to the transformers, and the angles make all the difference with such stunning sequences and the viewers are able to picture how huge these transformers are really meant to be. Bumblebee is my favorite transformer and he had a huge part in the first movie but I felt like he was missing a bit from this movie and it was disappointing not to see him as much.When this movie first hit theaters in June of 2011 it did come in 3D. I was not able to watch it in 3D and I'm usually not a big fan of them either because films seem so dark once you put the glasses on. However, I felt this movie was very bright in lighting and because of that fact I think it would look great in 3D and hopefully I will have the chance to check it out sometime.At the end all of the Autobots and humans have to work together to save the planet. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) puts a group together including Tyrese Gibson (Epps) to go to downtown Chicago and stop the Decepticons from succeeding. The final battle is a little drawn out and long but there isn't a dull moment in it, there are building falling over, glass shattering, explosions and all kinds of fun fire. Of course the Autobots win and Optimus finally kills Megatron.In my opinion it is highly doubtful that this movie will be the last of Transformers and as long as they are able to put this much action into a movie they will continue to gain more new fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Barf bag compulsory,"Someone made a mess of the plot . With a wafer thin storyline and the action blinded by stupidity for eg. in one scene 'humans' creep along the street undetected under the 'watchful' eyes (come one - how can aliens be this stupid ?) this is way up there with disappointing sequels.

Worst ever movie i have seen in recent times . Not to be rude or offensive but in close up shots,Rosie Huntington-Whiteley appears to be less feminine and looks like a bloke with thick lips (??). of course she can't deliver her lines - she is not an actor.

The Thrill-Ride of Summer 2011,"*A review of the IMAX 3D version Say what you will about the ""soulless"" brand of movie mayhem served up by the likes of Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer and Roland Emmerich; roll your eyes at the crassness of it all; but have no doubt: audiences love this stuff. They're not being hoodwinked or manipulated into seeing anything they don't want to see. They, we, I know exactly what I'm paying my tenner for.On the way out of a screening of Emmerich's 2012, someone described the experience as ""like an apocalyptic roller-coaster."" And that's a pretty fair summary, if you ask me. These are sensorial thrill-rides, state-of-the-art theme park attractions as much as they are movies. Audiences want to be blown out of their seats by the audiovisual experience. As long as the plot is coherent, the characters are likable enough for us to care whether they survive or not, there's an occasional laugh throw in to preserve that roller-coaster giddiness, well, there's your formula for this sort of thing. I can imagine select 3D scenes from this third Transformers film playing to sell-out crowds in any Universal Studios or techno theme park.Dark of the Moon has stupendous scenes of destruction, perhaps even surpassing the aforementioned 2012. Director Bay's robot battles are epic. The hour-long showdown in a battered Chicago is worth the admission price alone. Vehicular carnage, military firepower, transformer face-offs galore--this sequence has it all, including skyscrapers being crushed and toppled by giant robot snakes. The 3D, too, is stunning, with a daredevil freefall by Josh Duhamel and his special ops rangers into a maelstrom of robo-carnage being the standout. It's eye-popping stuff, and just when you think Bay has peaked, he ups the ante tenfold until your brain can barely process what he and his filmmaking wizards have wrought with their limitless FX budget.The series' throwaway humour is as hit-and-miss as ever, with John Turturro's oddball Agent Simmons and his even weirder German sidekick (Alan Tudyk) generating the most laughs. Ken Jeong is atrocious in his brief (but not brief enough) role as a paranoid office worker--probably the most grating comedy performance since Chris Tucker's screechy turn in The Fifth Element. Other series newcomers include John Malkovich and Frances McDormand; the former is given nothing to do, while the latter is good fun in her role as the brassy National Security Chief.Duhamel and Tyrese are solid as ever in their stock gung-ho roles. Shia Laboeuf goes hysterical once too often but at least his character, Sam Witwicky, wants to join the action this time around. Brit model Rosie Huntington-Whitely is sweet as his new girlfriend, Carly, and makes a decent replacement for the Fox (whom I did miss, I have to say). In the transformers' cast, Leonard Nimoy makes a great voice contribution as the powerful and crucial Sentinel Prime.I'm going to recommend Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3D to anyone who enjoyed the first movie, those who love action on a grand scale, or anyone who wants to see the potential of 3D technology. The SF prologue, including a nice alternate history reveal during the Apollo 11 EVA, showcases some breathtaking 3D framing and depth design. And the extended finale in Chicago is the must-see action event of the summer.It's pretty much indefensible as anything but a thrill-ride, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one, as did the (astonishingly multi-cultural) audience at my IMAX 3D screening. It runs a bit long at two and a half hours, but once the Chicago sequence starts, you'll be gripped to the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Better, but not stunning (no spoilers)","Just come out of a showing, and in summary, yes, it's a definite improvement, but is still not a fantastic movie.The 3D was actually very good. There were some scenes where I was really impressed with the depth, and it added to the 'experience' without a doubt.In addition to the excellent 3D, the FX artists have used far less motion blur, and the action and fights are much clearer for it.I also felt the story was more cohesive than both 1 and 2 - and I was pleased to see we didn't have a repeat of ""you need to get item X to position Y"" and then rather then dropping Sam off at position Y, they leave him a mile away so he has to run through a war-zone just for the spectacle of it.Make no mistake, there's still running, and it's still there to segue between massive set pieces, but at least there was a semblance of logic as to why the characters needed to be there.It wasn't amazing, but it was enjoyable, and from a story perspective (as I'm not going to go so far as to call it a plot) it did seem to have the best pacing of the trilogy.So in summary, if you enjoyed TF1, I'd say it was equally enjoyable if not slightly more so - as long as you don't expect anything more than a popcorn movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mixed Feelings,"I have been a major Transformer's Fan for quite some time now. After watching Transformer's in 2007, I fell in love with the stunning new rendition of the well known franchise. When Transformers Revenge of the Fallen came out I was also very happy with it overall, although their were some aspect's I wasn't entirely happy with, I overall did really like it.When I went into the Cinema for Transformers Dark of the Moon, I think however that I was expecting to much because in my opinion it didn't live up to what I imagined it would.Firstly I will say this. This movie is a great Movie in some aspects. The Special Effect's are simply jaw-dropping, with crisp, immaculate detail that look's like the Transformers are visually there on the set. The Action also is insane, and at certain part's of the film left my saying ''Wow, that was awesome''. So there is no doubt in my mind that the Action and Special Effect's side of the Film is incredible and top notch as usual.... However, the Storyline and some other aspect's of the Movie though were very disappointing and quite confusing. Without sounding too harsh, unfortunately for me this is the worst story line in the entire Transformers Movie. After thinking about it non -stop all night and all morning, even i found it difficult to recall what was happening. After discussing it with some of my fellow friend's, they also found it very confusing. I felt the story - line was rushed, or wasn't consistent, and it felt like they were going for that objective ... but then they were going for that objective. So for me, this is the worst story -line in my opinion.One of the other thing's I did not like was some of the Acting skill's. The acting was at time's fairly good, however at other time's it was week and degrading. The new girl who is playing a different role, is not the best actor either I'm afraid. At first I admired her sweet tone and fairly well presented acting skills, however - and excuse me for sounding a bit prejudice - I found her English accent quite frustrating at times when she was suppose to be conveying a sense of sadness or fear. Unfortunately the acting skill's for me were average, Megan Fox in my opinion did better in the acting field.Another thing that was very frustrating is they did not show us or give us enough information or detail on new Transformers. There is a lot of new Transformer's that we don't know there name, didn't see them Transform and didn't see their vehicle form or hear them speak. I saw one Transformer only in it's vehicle form, I never saw it Transform. And their was countless other Transformer's that I wanted to see more. Also a large minority of character's were killed and in a way I felt like they were only shown for a couple of minutes and then they were dead or gone just like that.Overall, I wouldn't say it is the best Transformers. It is still worthy of seeing. I would rate it 10/10 if it were just for the Special Effect's and Action, however the confusing and jumbled story - line, lack of knowledge on a range of character's and the poor acting skills from some of the actor's leave me to give it a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Make it stop, please.","Picking up where the previous one left of this one starts with several transformers living on earth, more or less at peace with human civilisation. This all changes when an old government secret is uncovered. From there on things start to get nasty and the world once again needs to be saved by the Megatron and his metallic friends.After seeing the second one I wasn't expecting too much of this one. Where the first one had a story and a decent amount of CGI the second one had no story and nothing but CGI. For some reason I was thinking this one couldn't be worse than that second one. But alas, it is.On the one side it offers what is to be expected - explosions and fire, and lots and lots of action sequences. On the other side it offers the return of some of the older characters - and a shipload of new ones. Now that wouldn't be too bad - if only they would fit in the story and would do what they were supposed to do. What I found more than mildly irritating for instance was the fact that the Sam Witwicky character had to start all over when it comes to trust from the government agencies.Add to that that at least one character was hopelessly miscast - Patrick Dempsey does not belong in this film, at least not in the role he plays, it doesn't suit him at all and it shows in the way it comes to the screen.Then it seems they tried to save the film by applying the old trick of opening a can of known actors/actresses in the hopes they can turn lead into gold. The trick never worked and it doesn't work in this one. What's Frances McDormand doing in this film? She can do a lot better. The same for John Malkovich. John Turturro is about the only big name that I can like in this film - but that's because he has a long history of odd little roles and the one he has in this film suits.Last but surely not least, the 3D. This can be described by asking one question: What 3D?

Before I review all aspects of the film, I'll talk about the story.The story is being reviewed as convoluted, choppy and all over the place. And I can admit it can seem so for some audiences, but I think the film is directed for a target audience. I'd say Star Trek Trekkers! If you're a hard core Trekker, than this might be the best film ever created. It sounds bold, but I seriously feel that this is the case. I might sound corny for saying so, but I acknowledge that. And this is why I believe it is one of the most important films of all time.In Transformers, and Transformers 2, we saw some simple good vs. evil battles, great action, and funny scenes. In Transformers 3 Dark of The Moon, we get a whole lot more. More in plot, and a much more subliminal tale that blends fiction with historical account. If you believe in The Secret Space Program, E.T. controlled governments, and UFO's, or plain and simple; aliens amongst us, than this film is the nutshell. I believe that Transformers 3 and it's plot is basically centered around conspiracy theories that have been running since the 50's. This is E.T. disclosure in fiction form, You will see simulated stock footage of John F. Kennedy discussing UFO's. Only to see real stock footage right after wards. You will see astronaut Neil Armstrong in a cameo appearance, only to see a scene of him taking an oath not to discuss his knowledge of aliens on the moon and on Earth. Why would Neil Armstrong agree to the role if he didn't agree with all of this?! It's absolutely perplexing to me.The movie was darker than the previous 2. Less comedy, but thought Shia Lebouf was the best in this 3rd installment. He was very good, and as funny as ever. But yes, the movie lacks emotion as most critics say, but It doesn't matter, it's a plot driven film, not a character film. The CGI is the best I've ever seen, simple as that. It surpasses Avatar's CGI by far, I was absolutely mesmerized by the CGI in this film, and the previous 2 Transformers films do not compare to this one. Even the fight scenes were well choreographed, where as in the past 2 films, they seemed blurry and rushed.This is Micheal Bay's best film. It's his masterpiece, without any doubt! I just wish the film was rated R, like I said in my review in the other Transformers film that you can find on here. I think a more serious tone would have made this less campy and just better.In the end, there is an all to powerful message. All the evil in this world is due to a spiritually evil Extraterrestrial intelligence that intervened with our technological progression. And there is also a good kind of E.T.'s keeping us safe. Whether through their messengers, or not.Star Trek fans, be advised, there are many homages here to Spock in this film, some of his most famous lines are used, and after all, he is voicing Sentinel Prime, so why not! 9/10 I'd give it a round 10 if it wasn't for the lack of emotion, and lack of care for the characters. But like I said, it's the plot that is good, not so much a character driven film.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Definitely Landed on the Dark Side,"Transformers Dark of the Moon, a promising title followed with equally promising buzz over the last several months that swelled with intense anticipation. I can't review this movie from a die hard fan p.o.v. because in all honesty, though I loved the original animated series and the classic movie, my history is a bit rusty and my ass would be blended into a tasty boba treat for some spectacle wearing fan boy with a hard on for Optimus Prime. So, in all fairness I will simply review this as someone who loved the previous movies. And yes, I even loved Revenge of the Fallen If you've stopped reading at this point because of lack of credibility I understand, if not then let me continue. There were several things I appreciated about the movie, the first being the visual effects as always were impeccable. The orgy worthy robot on robot fighting was amazing and exciting. Honestly, I almost wish Bay would do a prequel following along the lines of the fall of Cybertron.You know, just ignore the human aspect of it all together since we have a habit of being awfully messy with emotions and intentions gone awry(cough cough every suit wearing pencil pushing government agent Bay puts into his films cough cough). The stunts were nothing to sneeze about either. Something about soldiers leaping out of burning planes with wing suits under wave after wave of assault by the pursuing Decepticons just makes you tingle inside. Or that might be this morning's coffee? Either way, there are moments of jaw dropping stunts mixed with visual effects that make you sit on the edge of your seat. I was also impressed with the plot that starts to take shape early on in the movie but sadly it drifts off lazily in the background halfway through like my Grandpa during our family gatherings for Christmas. It also gets a little far fetched at one significant point where even I, someone with little knowledge on physics and global dynamics, had to shake my head and ask out loud ""What?! We're just gonna pretend that that wouldn't have any repercussions?!"" I can't divulge too much because then I would be spoiling the surprise but once you see it, you will know exactly what I'm talking about. What makes me especially upset about this is that (and yes, here comes my redemption for the earlier comment)with Revenge of the Fallen the plot was filled with so many holes it looked like the Swiss cheese I put on my breakfast bagels. However, at least in the second one they made an attempt to fill in as many of those craters as they could with one of (or both at times) Megan Fox's ass cheeks in daisy dukes or the never tiring air acrobatics of Shia Lebeouf. Yes, throw your Bumble bee collector cups from Burger King at me and boo at the statement I am about to make: I felt the second one at least delivered more closely to the first both in satisfaction and entertainment than Dark of the Moon. I liked it better, so there. I feel this movie could have been great had Michael Bay simply followed the story line and tried to keep his Bayisms at a minimum. Much like the random moments of humping dogs and pants less people in the second there are times during the third that seem rather arbitrary and eye rolling-ly awful. Not to mention even though Fox has a backlash against her that would make Vanilla Ice blush, her character, Mikeala, seemed to fit the mold of female lead better than Rosie Huntington-I don't care I lost interest in the remainder of her last name. Fox's interaction with Shia also felt more realistic; yes, maybe it was because they were actually getting it on behind the scenes but that's not the point, point is both his character, Sam and the new girl, Carly, have a forced physical attraction that doesn't seem as convincing. The same go for other character interactions that don't seem as genuine as they did in previous movies which unfortunately becomes a little emotionally detaching from the story. All in all, if you are still awake, I would say the movie is worth checking out but I don't feel it lived up to the hype or delivered as well as the others.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
less than a movie expected,they sell the same movie for the third time no big deal.. does not full fill my expectations people screaming and running places.. nothing wise an ordinary action movie for dummies I do not recommend this movie don't waste your money unless you are hardcore transformers fan in the trailer they show the moon .. conspiracy and lots of promising stuff but in the movie i couldn't see anything related to the trailer im tired of blowing cars and nerd robots speaking philosophy i repeat i do not recommend this movie the blond megan replacement has also no place in this movie she does not fit the characterdisappointing movie my rating is 3,3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great, stop hating","most people on here never had transformer toys as a kid, therefore they cannot understand how great it is to watch a cartoon come to life. 1. People need to stop hating on Michael Bay, what he doing is working , look at the ticket sales. 2. If after the first movie you still looking for character development, go else where. Go watch HP or LOTR, like they really had it anyway. 3. Transformers falls in a genre that is not for everyone, it is action, scifi and mecha, plus it was a CARTOON Finally, go watch it in IMAX 3D , the whole movie is 3D. If there was one problem i did not get enough of the transformers, which is what the movie is about, even though it had lots . next time do like 1hr 45 mins to include the TRANSFORMERS, and the remaining 45mins of humans All in all great movie",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
How can this movie score 6.4,"Perhaps, if this movie had cost less than $195 million dollars say a mere $100 million and had some other atributes, plot characterisation or a point to its existence I might have scored it higher but this is just another example of Hollywood and in particular Michael Bays view that if you have a project and if you throw vast sums of cash at it, an overblown cgi budget and pounding score, you get an instant mega bucks hit. These kind of movies are killing the movie business, I am certain that there must be a hundred lower budget projects that never get green lighted, because such lumbering primitive monstrosities like the Transformers movies get made. I have no problem with high budget movies per se, Avatar, Pirates of the Caribbean ,Marvel,Star Trek, Batman franchises all cost lots of money, and make lots of money, but they have at their core, intelligence vision and integrity and are far more entertaining than most of Mr. Beys work. Give Mitchael Bey $50million and he might just manage a 10 minute short. In short Transformers DSM while occasionally spectacular lacks pretty much anything else that would make me want to watch it ever again.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than Revenge of the Fallen,"A significant improvement over its predecessor; characters, storyline, visual effects, score-almost everything had improved dramatically. The decision to include Sentinel Prime in this equation was actually a good one, primarily because it raised the stakes and gave the Autobots an incentive to fight and protect.Optimus Prime, as usual, was the pivotal figure in delivering iconic scenes (the climax fight being one of his finest so far in this series). Bumblebee, too, had his moments to shine, which warmed my heart.For the human counterparts, LaBeouf was as effective as he had been since the first day, but I had serious concerns about Rosie Huntington being replaced by Megan Fox; I don't think that was a wise decision on their part. Another minor complaint would be Megatron's brief appearance on the screen; he was kind of pushed aside since he had too little to do, which seemed amiss.Having said that, it's a solid entertainer. The visuals are gorgeous and massive in scale (Shockwave design was phenomenal), the action is full of energy and enthusiasm, and most important of all, the score sounded incredible here, exacerbating the intensity whenever and wherever it could. What a wonderful work by the composer (Steve Jablonsky).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The silver medal of the trilogy,"First off, I LOVED the first movie, it was fun and fun to look at. Then the second movie came and I HATED it. It took everything great about the first one and flipped it on its shiny metal ass. I gotta say that this movie is marginally better than 2, but still nowhere near 1.You don't need to know the plot here because it barely exists anyway.There are a lot of annoying characters, both human and robot, that deliver bad performances and really bad jokes. In fact the first hour is full of these bad jokes. The first action scene is really boring and forgettable. How could they screw up Optimus fighting a giant driller worm? The first hour is boring and almost a completely different movie with hardly any robots or action. Instead, we get Shia LaBeouf trying to find a job and please his new impossibly hot girlfriend in a painfully long and unnecessary sequence. You can almost skip that entire part.Thankfully, the move gets much better in the second half, where a HUGE battle takes place in Chicago. The effects and the set pieces look amazing here. This is where you gotta give credit to Michael Bay. The robot fights are also filmed better here than in the other two movies. Two scenes get special mention: the highway chase involving Decepticons and the skyscraper. Those scenes are really intense and fun to watch. Like I said the entire second half is pretty much one big prolonged battle scene. It has some great moments, but some are filmed poorly or just plain long. Also the movie ends very abruptly, with about 30 seconds of aftermath.Put simply, the movie is pretty bad overall. Most characters are annoying, the writing is bad and the jokes are horrible. The robots and other CGI look great, but they cannot cover up the flaws. Only the second half is worth watching.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Enjoyable,This movie is not a great but this movie is so entertaining that I am willing to forgive the plot. This movie has some very well done action scenes which you should expect from Michael Bay at this point. Me personally I recommend it for when you have friends over so you can have it on in the background.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Had it's moments, but overall disappointing","What to say about it, exactly? I love the first two films, and I was pretty excited to see this. I was already annoyed/bummed that they had replaced Megan Fox, but I was hoping it wouldn't be too big of a deal. Because I had fairly high expectations, I ended up being disappointed by the entire first half of the movie. It had a very strange, unpleasant feeling to it. The humor was very forced and didn't fit well with the wittiness from the other movies. There were several new side characters, few of whom were at all funny. John Malkovich's part was unnecessary, Frances McDormand fell flat. Ken Jeong was a nightmare who brought The Hangover to Transformers. Alan Tudyk at least provided some good laughs, but his character was also an unnecessary addition to a bloated cast. Even the established characters didn't have that old spark. Sam was reduced to ranting and whining by turn, without the right kind of sarcasm. His parents became caricatures dressed in matching green track suits, who irritated rather than endeared. Even some of the new Autobots were ridiculous, especially in appearance. Only Optimus and Bumblebee felt true to character.And then, of course, there's the new girl. Carly, a.k.a. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. With regard to any actual acting, she did alright. Nothing impressive or all that expressive, actually, but she was okay. The thing that I'm most bothered about is the blatant and over-the-top over-sexing of her character. You can so obviously see why Megan Fox declined to return to the role under what I'm sure is the absolutely objectifying and misogynistic direction of Michael Bay. Of course he had to resort to casting a lingerie model! And his unprofessional-ism showed itself in the dialog as well, dismissing the character of Mikaela as 'selfish' and praising the new Carly as someone who 'loves Sam for who he is.' It read way too much like Bay getting a final few jabs in at Megan Fox through the script of his new film.But there were some redeeming factors that deserve to be mentioned. First of all, the 3D in this movie was admittedly spectacular. Normally I hate 3D with a passion because the darkness added by the glasses and the inevitable headache that ensues, but I had no such problems in this film. And the action scenes were as fantastic as ever, perhaps even better than in the previous films. I must admit that the second half pulled me in and had me on the edge of my seat. There was a wonderfully epic feel to the entire Chicago storyline, which almost made up for the rest of the movie's shortcomings.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Honestly not as Bad as People Make it Out to be,"***ONE VERY MINOR SPOILER THAT DOESN'T GIVE AWAY ANY PLOT POINTS***After seeing this when I was 11 or 12, I, as pretty much anyone of that age would be, was mesmerised by this film. Of course, that was simply because such a film is like a staple diet for kids that age. If that makes any sense at all.Anyway, 4 years later, and I'm still loving this film. And it's not because it's feeding my inner 12-year-old (well, not completely)— it's because I genuinely think that this is a good film.I understand where the hate is coming from: enraged viewers still haven't gotten over the somewhat shabby Revenge of the Fallen, and are continuing their hate over this sequel, too. People complain that it's too long, bloated, the acting is bad and the comedy is ridiculous. These complaints are what's ridiculous. Transformers: Dark of the Moon is exciting, the CGI is incredible, the acting isn't too bad, and the comedy is toned down, but very much needed. Let's elaborate...The CGI. Pretty much the only aspect of this film (or, indeed, the entire franchise) that is not hated upon. It is simply incredible- you don't stop and think- ""was that real?"", or squint to see if there's some sort of not-so-real detail— pretty much nothing is flawed about it, except of course, the infamous scene where Sam is carrying an invisible robot in a brief shot.The acting— not bad at all, I don't understand why people hate on it so much. People seem to hate Rosie Huntington-Whitely's acting, but it is not bad at all. Fair enough, it's not Anthony Hopkins, but at least it's not Alan Bagh (Birdemic). None of the other actors are bad at their job either: each one gives a very realistic performance. Yes, Shia screams a lot, but wouldn't you if you were flying through the air over a truck that just fell over while there are robots shooting at each other?Now, the comedy, which made Revenge of the Fallen one of the most hated films ever. In DOTM, the comedy is toned down to Wheelie and his companion (who's name fails me at the moment). Their comic relief is much needed, as Dark of the Moon is as the title suggests- dark. There is a lot of killing, and some of it is graphic, but brief. The climactic threat is quite intense, and in the midst of it, these two provide a little relief. I will admit that there is a lot more humour in the first 3rd of the film, with the humans, but it does tone down once the action picks up.And that's another thing that people are complaining about. ""Too much"" human involvement. Can I get one thing straight? Each of the Transformers movies are set on EARTH. Earth. That's where HUMANS live. How can you have a credible storyline if robots are fighting each other and there's no human involvement? And if there are humans, you have to develop them and make them interesting. The only reason why Carly (Huntington-Whitely)'s character was underdeveloped was because she was replacing Megan Fox who was abruptly fired. And she doesn't even need a back story- all we need to know is that she and Sam are together, and she's simply replaced Fox's Mikela (spelling?). And then you get all these other complainers saying there's too much action. Goodness me, it's a freakin' film about robots. No one complained about Pacific Rim.Now, the storyline. There's only one major plot hole, which no one is going to care about unless they're a troll. Each of the scenes match up, there's no major clashes in the story, and it's actually pretty good. I'm sure there's some things people will nitpick at (yes, I have seen CinemaSins), but nothing too major.I could go on and on, but I'll sum it up here. All in all, this is a great film, despite the unnecessary hatred for it. The CGI is incredible, the storyline is pretty much solid, the acting is believable, and there isn't the ridiculous comedy that was found in ROTF. A much darker, thrilling film that's based on a toy lineup. Doesn't require intricate thought, but is still very good, nonetheless.On a final note, may I remind everyone that this film is intended for guys. GUYS. What does a guy film need? Explosions, action and hot female leads. This film has all that. This is a fun, dark action film that is definitely geared towards the male audience. Suck it up, quit hating and enjoy this epic masterpiece. Plus, it's doesn't feel 'cheap' like some action films (I'm looking at you, Die Hard 5...). It feels... Epic. Literally.One final, final note to wrap this up— the score for this film is absolutely incredible. Very well done and really epic. Major, major props to Steve Jablonsky. He really captured the scale of this movie. (Yeah, scale. Giant robots, epic score— large runtime. It's about the scale).That's about it. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Transformers: Dark Of The Moon Is A Big Improvement From The Previous Movie, Still Flawed But Pretty Good Overall And I Still Like It","7.5/10
Transformers: Dark Of The Moon takes more than a step to finally able to become again another watchable Blockbuster extravaganza after the utterly boring and horrible Revenge Of The Fallen, the movie opens with these amazing real 1969 moon landing sequence with the twist of the Cybertronian has a classified part in the mission, that i think despite the fiction part Michael Bay should do a movie about it because he executed very well, and after that we're back on the track with Sam Witwicky played again betterly by Shia LaBeouf and his new chick which i think not only she is pretty and hot, she can also act better than Megan Fox, and this whole new story up from the beginning until before the last 15 minutes build up for the last battle was better than the first Transformers and i really enjoyed it and i really really like it, after that it dragged down a bit until the long final battle sequence which i still think a bit too long but the most important thing is it's not bad or super boring like the previous one, it has it's exciting and impressive moments in it and i still enjoyed it for the most part, the special and visual effects are incredible, Transformers: Dark Of The Moon has an enjoyable good story for the most part, a better performance, but a bit too long last final battle, and story dragged a bit near the end but overall it's still pretty good and i still like it, oh, and there is so much less cheesy moments in this one too which is good.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The curse of the number three movies continues... Terrible,"Most of their demographic seemed to like the first one. Then they ""kinda tolerated"" the second one. Logic dictates that the third one ""sucks"". Logic is right.The curse of the number three movies continues. This movie is indeed worse than its predecessors and with Transformers, that's really saying something. While that may spell big box office, it doesn't spell long-term staying power and of the three films in the Transformers trilogy, the final installment may well go down as the biggest disappointment of them all. It's wild but it's as bad as most feared. The CGI action is indeed over-the-top and may induce some popcorn merit but there simply is not enough of the things that matter. All that video game action starts becoming dull without a film or characters we care about to hold it together. It's easy to see where they went wrong but the formula led to two big paydays, why would they change it now?",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visually impressive...,"I grew up with the 80's cartoon and love it, but the movie adaptations just never really cut it for me. It just didn't have that same appeal and just never felt like it was properly being ""Transformers"".And I guess that having Shia LaBeuof in the lead was the deal breaker for me. That actor just doesn't bring anything good with him and he is annoying in his acting, just to be blunt. So he wasn't helping sell the movie adaptations to me. However, the amazing voice cast for the Autobots and Decepticons, now that was impressive. And especially since many voices from the 1980's series are back, that was just downright awesome.As with all Michael Bay movies, this was a continuous explosion. If you enjoy lots of action and explosions, then you will be more than happy with this 2011 movie.Story-wise, well, the movie was good enough for what it was, and it was entertaining enough for what it was. Just don't expect a Shakespearian experience.This is solely a special effects movie.

"No more than meets the eye, but it's alright this time.","The critics seem to be bashing the hell out of this movie, maybe it's because the second installment was just uber terrible. But this time around it wasn't that bad in my opinion. Now I can see why professional reviewer or critics gave this movie a negative review, I guess they just had to. The story is just so cliché and predictable and there is almost no character development in this. Saying this movie is better than the second installment isn't saying much, since that one was pretty much garbage besides the special effects and action. But this time there is much better set pieces and it has the most action from the three movies in this franchise and the action sequences are more well done and more fun to watch. However the constant explosions gets a bit tiresome after a while, explosions and a lot of actions is what this film is known for with robots beating the crap out of each other. But after a while with things constantly blowing up and stuff flying around everywhere for a long period of time it gets tiresome. But didn't get super irritating because of it and was worth sitting through those sequences. The build up is however crappy and so is the climax, there is one twist I didn't see coming but overall everything was so damn cliché and predictable. With the humans on the brink of destruction there was no tension and there was no parts that was actually gripping. You will not care who dies or lives when it comes to the humans or which robots get destroyed for the most part. Also Shia again taking on the main role as sam again got irritating after a while cause all he does most of the way through in the story is constantly whine about his life and how he can't get a job. One of my co-worker was like this and it was a real pain to work with him and didn't want to see the same crap on the big screen, ironically he is a big fan of this franchise and Linkin Park. Unlike the 2nd installment however things stayed consistent for the most part and didn't go all over the place in negative manner, which is a plus. I didn't really like the new girl taking the place of Megan Fox, not that I was a big fan of Megan Fox but she was better than the girl that took her role in this. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is shot in a very sexual way but didn't leave a impact or made the movie better, the audience for the most part didn't seem to care how her assets were expose a bunch of time on screen. Except the annoying 14 yr old kid that was sitting on the next seat in theater that seemed to go bonkers over it and constantly made stupid remarks or talked on his phone. Micheal Bay must have a big grudge against Megan Fox cause here character gets insulted multiple times in this movie. Anyways overall this was a good summer flick that has some entertaining action sequences, the war between the Autobots and Decepticons at the end was satisfying and felt it was worth the price of admission this time around. Oh and Optimus Prime is a badass robot in this as well.7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
meh,"This film dragged. The story was weak so I was just waiting for the final showdown between the Autobots and Decepticons. I was hoping for something different from the first film but it seemed all the same. I guess you can only do so much with a bunch of machines pounding on each other. This film, like the second one, was a rehash of the first with similar stories and battle scenes. What's new in this film was the lack of chemistry between the lead actors.Michael Bay simply got lucky with the first Transformers. I didn't like any of his previous work until that one.

A Hollywood joke !,"So i read an article a couple of months ago about how Micheal Bay and Spielberg worked on improving this new movie over the atrocious film that was Revenge of the fallen. And while i have noticed some improvements over the sequel, this one still fell short from becoming a good movie in my eyes.So many wrong things about this movie that i don't know where to start, probably, the most thing that annoyed me, was the silly and lame humor. very silly and unrealistic characters that don't seem to take the events surrounding them seriously, especially Turturro's and Malkovic's characters, such jokes !! i don't get why someone like Malkovic agrees to do a character like that ?! And what about the embarrassing Ken Jeong ?! involved in a disaster scene that was meant to be funny !!!Then comes the typical cliché characters in the American military, all pumped up and Rambo like macho men with big huge guns and gear running around and kicking A** !! lame !!the Robots themselves are ridiculous with their multi English accents, some speak American accents while other speak Irish and British ! what is up with that ?So here, Sam has left his old connections with the Autobots and is starting a new life looking for a job, yet he still has two robot pets, that i have no idea why they are there with him ? and as expected they are clumsy and always goofing around him for no clear reason ?!No more Megan Fox, but now she is replaced with another hot model like actress, who's character is still annoying, was just casted here to be constantly saved by our hero. there was supposed to be a passionate drama like relationship between her and Sam, which was totally unrealistic and lacked in depth. She was hot undeniably, but why ? do we have to ingrain this hot image in our growing generations ? that this is what every guy should have and that this is what every girl should look like ?!?! another cheap Hollywood image that i wished they would have avoided in this film. sad !!Too long, too much unnecessary scenes that could have been easily cut out, the whole Sam struggling with his family issues have been done before and grown old.the Visuals and sound effects, however, were stunning, i really can't deny that, and i only saw this in 2D, people seem to like the 3D and highly praise it. definitely, very enjoyable visuals, and some of the action scenes were very brilliantly executed, but even the action lacked in certain areas and did seem unrealistic.Spoiler >> so when Sam is hanging by one arm to one of the Decepticans, there was so much big and violent movements and he was dragged around like a feather, yet his arm did not get broken or his shoulder dislocated, seriously ?!So to summarize, this was another Hollywood joke, lots of emphasis on visuals, which were brilliant, but no depth and no heart to it. but I'm pretty sure, a lot of people will be taken by the visuals and will think that this was the best movie ever made, the younger audience "" including my 7 years old son who actually liked this "", and it will make big bucks, but with no heart.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

More of the same,"I watched the movie in 2D. It was decent. All the talk about how amazing the final hour was, it didn't live up to my expectations.

Things just happen in the nick of time, coincidences drive the plot, etc. But this time, there are a few twists to make it slightly more interesting.Comedy-wise, some parts were damn right funny as hell. The jokes that involve robots didn't work, but the wackiness of the new human characters adds to the funny bits. Alan Tudyk is easily the funniest of the bunch.The action bits featured in the trailer are actually most of the highlights of the action in the movie. Due to the use of 3D cameras in filming the movie, the fast cuts and camera shake that were prevalent in the first two movies are gone. The action is much more discernible.

Not even a movie.,"Absolutely abysmal. Made it 1h 30m through somehow. My head is spinning. It felt more like an anxiety attack than a movie. Sort of like ""The Other Guys"".

The action was pointless. The girl? Who cares. All I remember was something crashing on the moon and there being a government cover-up. Can't put into words how stupefied I was after viewing this crap. I watched the first Transformers and, I didn't have enough great things to say about it. It was amazing! The only vibe I got while watching Dark Of The Moon was that the directors must have been ingesting large amounts of amphetamine while directing this. I felt like it was one big RUSH to squeeze so much dialogue into 2h 20m of run-time. But for what!? 80% of the script was pointless! Maybe cut out all the completely useless scenes and you wouldn't have this horrendously distracting pacing issue. I spent so much time being dizzy and confused, I didn't really even get a chance to digest what was going on. I literally had to leave, and go to the bathroom and splash water on my face and calm down because the movie had overstimulated me to the point of having an anxiety attack..

The 6.4 rating is a bit harsh for something designed to be pure entertainment and, let's face it, the budget of ""only"" $195m grossed a return of £1.1bn by November 2011 so I think the ""ayes"" have it. Take any critically acclaimed film and see what the return ratio is and then think ""maybe these guys have got their criteria wrong"" because their industry is still called the ""entertainment industry"" and not the ""social commentary industry"" or the ""change the world industry"" (that's US politics) or even the ""I'm so far up my own backside that I think I can make a film about any old tripe and call it Art and people will buy it industry"". I like to be entertained and THIS film hit the nail on the head.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pleasantly surprised....not saying much...,"This is my review on the third installment to the Transformers series. Let me first say after i watched the second one I really was not going to waste my time with this one. Though it was in 3d so i decided to check it out.This movie is a lot like the second one. About an hour of story line(if you could call that a story) then about and hour and a half of explosions and CGI.Now if you watch movies and take them in at face value and all your looking for is explosions and CGI then by all means this may be your favorite film. As for any true film lovers like myself though if you enjoy story line, solid acting, good script and direction then this movie is probably not for you.This is dirceted by Michael bay which of course means he is going to pump exsplosions and CGI whenever he can. And hell why not he makes hundreds of millions off these movies.Overall though if you are looking for a good movie you can skip this one. If you are bored and like just watching explosions and and incredible CGI then go ahead. Better then the second one not as good as the first. 5/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You did the third one right.,"Having watched the Transformers cartoon as a kid, my expectations were tempered when Paramount Pictures announced that a live-action movie was forthcoming. Once the film came out though, I couldn't wait to see it. The cartoon I grew up watching, was now a real live action movie and there I sat in awe. I recall watching the first time Bumblebee transformed and getting chills at the sight and sound. Once Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was released, I was terribly disappointed. Instead of a worthy follow-up to an enjoyable first movie, what was delivered was an insulting piece of garbage, but that's a review for another day. It was inevitable that a 3rd movie was going to be produced, I was simply hopeful for major improvements being implemented to move the franchise forward. I'm happy to say that my hopes for the movie were far exceeded. The script far exceed that of the first two films; the action was again on a grand scale and the acting.well, it was OK. It's difficult for real-life actors and actresses not to be overshadowed by the sheer awesomeness of the Transformers. Michael Bay has made amends with me, whether he wanted to or not.Director Michael Bay has shown that he loves devastation, often times excessively; i.e. Bad Boys, The Rock, Pearl Harbor. The one thing about Bay's movies though, is that they never lack excitement and entertainment. Transformers: Dark of the Moon meets the required criteria, with non-stop action and massive destruction from start to finish. Shia LeBeouf's Sam Witwicky is once again thrust into the middle of the war between Autobots and Decepticons. I've enjoyed LeBeouf's portrayal of Sam throughout all three movies. In Transformers: Dark of the Moon, he plays the role with humor, such as his interactions with his parents and while interviewing for a much needed job; and he plays the role with a convincing intensity, which is necessary in action movie of this magnitude. Bay added big name talent to the roster this time around: John Malkovich, always a pleasure to watch, in a small but humorous role as Sam's boss; the talented Frances McDormand; Patrick Demsey; and the hilarious Ken Jeong, who continues a strong run of supporting roles. Reprising their roles for a third time are Josh Duhamel, Tyreese Gibson and the highly amusing John Turturro.Without a doubt, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a HUGE improvement over Revenge of the Fallen. There's a lot to love about the effects, and even the storyline.yes, it has a solid storyline, which revolves around the race to land on the moon in the 60s. I think it's a safe bet that the Transformers are here to stay and that more movies will be coming. Hopefully, should Bay decide against returning as rumored, that the studio replaces him with someone capable of continuing to move the series in the direction he just left it....pointed towards the stars and the planet Cybertron.Oscar worthiness: Special effects and Sound Summer movie Grade: B (my son, who is 7.5 gave it an A+) Age appropriate meter: 10+ (some excessive language, A LOT of violence, one sexual situation in the very beginning, some scenes may be deemed too scary for younger children)visit our site at www.twodudereview.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Haters gonna hate....hard.,"So. I consider myself a movie fan, I'm 30, I am not a fan of Transformers franchise, I didn't watch cartoons, read some comics as a kid, had one toy.Now. I saw it yesterday in IMAX, and wanted to sum up my experience in few bulletpoints considering how horrified I was with all the hate here. Not a fan of Bay too (I love The Rock though), but I like his films as I like to go to a theme park or a zoo - simple entartainment.1. 3d was excellent. It was used for pure fun and joy of the viewer and not just to throw axes and shoot bullets into your eyes. Also I liked the brightness, and as a side note my eyes hurt much less than say on Avatar, and movie is almost 160 mins long.2. F@ck the cardboard characters, I did not expect much and was there only for pure brainless kaboom action, which I got. The human baddie was weak though, and I still have no idea what Malkovich was doing there.3. The girl. I see many of you demand Hellen Miren or Meryl Streep acting qualities from a chick in a Bay movie. I expect MY girl to be smart, intelligent and pretty, but in Bay movie she can be brainless idiot and seriously I do not care - so why so much whining? Don't understand.4. The design. I see people bitch1n on the robots' design. What the f@ck where you expecting? Megatron transforming into giant gun? In my opinion, seeing how lazy production designers happen to be nowadays (see Skyline, or Green Lantern) the overall look of robots' devices, ships was t1ts.5. Unlikable main protagonist. Wait... what? He was a pure everyman - b1tchy, frustrated and tired of how the world is constructed, looking for a job being pressed by parents and having issues in his relationship with a girl. I do not see any difference between him and guy posting rant SaM WUZ soooo 1RRRR1TAT1ING ZOMG WHAT A F@G GOT.6. CGI. The composition was far superior to Avatar, I have not noticed any ""low-res"" textures that people complain about. I saw every dollar spent on this movie on the screen. Few scenes were done with so much taste that I was really proud of Bay (re: scene introducing Megatron, and dialog between Sentinel and Optimus about the latter being now the mentor since he's been on Earth long). The squirrel people jumping off the burning plane gave me goosebumps and that was what I expected from this ride (because I do not consider it a serious movie.)Now. Having addressed these few issues I would also like to add I really loved the one sweet moment - in the highway chase scene there was a significant zoom on the rear view mirror of the car with standard OBJECTS IN A REARVEIW MIRROR MAY APPEAR CLOSER THAN THEY ARE text being shown with blurred bots in the background. Well it was a song by Meat Loaf for which Bay made a cool video and I truly loved this little trivia.Closing my wall of text - and I know a lot shall not even bother to read it - I quietly ask you guys: do not overanalyze this. It's fun summer action flick, more of an experience than a film, a mixtape of cool action clishes for a tweleve year old in every one of us. Much better than the second one, and maybe even the first - but hey! stop analyzing! Cheer up and stop hating, life is better without hate isn't it?PS. Buzz Aldrin scene was so touching and directed with great taste. Brilliant.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Transformers never fails,"Transformers is by far a classic. Every little kid growing up wanted to own a car that could transform in to a robot/super awesome car. If you never grew up watching transformers, you should take a step back in time and relive your childhood. When they made a real movie I was more than excited, I wanted to go to the movie and watch them all day because my childhood heroes finally became realistic. The first 2 movies was definitely a bang and I anticipated this movie just as much and maybe even more than the others. Once it came out I went to the movie theater just like I did with the first 2 and once again Michael bay and Shia Lebouf never fails. The animation and graphics for this movie is just out of this world. All of his story lines was always on point and you just learn more and more every movie. Optimus prime will always be number 1 and he just takes over each movie. His supporting autobots get better and better each year. As they transform you get more and more details. I love this movie so much. If no one hasn't watched it, turn your TV on and proceed in searching for this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
don't bother,"Action scenes were not as good as the 2nd film. The parts where people spoke were just breaks between action scenes and didn't really add anything to the film!Rosie / carlys character was flat as a pancake. At least megan fox had screen presence and was likable (and hotter). To be fair to her though the writing was awful so not all her fault.Le beof what ever his name is was comical in the first 2 films and next to fox was just about worth watching but in this movie he was pointless, had very little dialogue and i found myself not caring what happened to him.Who ever wrote the screenplay for this was an idiot. whilst i know it was an action film i at least expect the story and characters to be focused on as an important part of the film but it was all about the action scenes which were a little confusing to watch at best.I gave this a 3 as some effort went into the action scenes even if they could have been better, When i left the cinema i initially thought of this movie as a 1 star!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Film of perfect action and dynamic feeling that made a revolution.,"I think Transformers film changed the entire film world, it was just like a revolution. All the robot effects and all those animated stylize movements perfectly made everyone in nova days to use it,to have it similar and have all those actions. Just like helicopters design in the film ""AVATAR"", everyone is using that helicopter concept these days,and I'm sure is going to be soon a cliché. I definitely think that this film has the most dynamic effect feeling, and watching these in 3d glasses would make to get deeply into this film and feel it so bad. It is hard to watch this film and not feeling powerful. It just gives me that emotion that in life you really can do anything if you want to.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It has its ups and downs,"To begin this is an extreme down-grade from the first two. I don't know about everyone else, but I LOVED the first two. Watching the third one once again I appreciate it MORE then I did the FIRST time I watched it. But, this is because I understand it a LITTLE bit more watching ti the second time.I find this third installment extremely hard to keep up with. I take my eyes of the screen for 1 minute and suddenly they (the main characters) are no longer where they were and are some how in danger or out of danger.This movie feels like they tried to jam a whole lot of information in one movie, they mention one idea, and that's it. They mention it ONCE, and so you are left behind thinking ""What, explain again?"". I still don't even know what the hell they were all fighting about. Something about something. It feels like it should have been TWO MOVIES, but then you think ""NOPE, I will not watch this thing stall out into bullshit"".There are however some EPIC scenes. These scenes just keep you glued to the screen, even though you have no idea what is going on, and you're still wondering why everyone is fighting for, these scenes MAKE the movie.Another great aspect are once again the creative and new designs of Aliens, weapons and gadgets. As one said in the film (no spoiler, just a quote) ""Why do all the Decepticons get all the good stuff?"" very true. It is extremely fun to see all these new unique Auto-bots, they are characters you just love.As a fan it is hard to get attached to this new girl... I can see they try to enforce their love (I'm not into Romances, but!) BUT they get it right. Although it would have been nice for a change of personality, maybe a girl with a different body type, something different. But, it worked. I did miss seeing Mikaela (Megan Fox) I just loved her in the last two.There isn't much comedy relief, and if there is you simply don't understand it as much because you really understand the plot. But it has its moments.I GAVE THIS FILM A SIX (perhaps 6 and a half if I could). The first two were worthy of a 7-8. But this one lacked almost everyone that was good about the first two. It JUST CONTINUED ON AND ON. You get to the point where you think ""Omg just finish already, get to the point"". It was a drag. BUT it DOES have its MOMENTS. In every 'Transformers' film Sam has a problem. Number 1 was getting a girlfriend. Number 2 was saying 'I love you' and number 3 is getting a job. At least they kept that idea going.Good film. Unfortunately the writers rushed it a bit.Also, how do they procreate? I understand they're Robots... but they could clarify how they get the solid mental to change into them. PERHAPS in the future they will make a WHOLE FILM about the Auto-bots and Decepticons. No humans, just these two rivals battling on unknown planets. That's always fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Dark Of The Moon won the box office but not the critics, I kinda see why.","I am a fan of the Transformers movies so when the third one was announced I was pretty excited for it and the trailer looked promising.....as the all do. The movie starts off rather interesting with Sam's new love interest, Carly(Rosie Huntington-Whitely) and I must say that she is a big improvement from Megan Fox, she brings sex appeal and class to her character which I love! Back to the movie... The plot revolves around an ark that crashed on the moon and Apollo 11 being used as a cover to investigate it however the deceptagons want to use it to bring Cybertron to earth and make it their home, and the auto bots must stop them. I will commend Spielberg and Bay on their great work on the effects and use of 3D, it was really a good action flick however, to me, that is all the movie ended up being. For 2 and a half hours I sat there knowing what would come next and instead of feeling sympathy for some characters I found myself waiting for this movie to be over. The script was OK, I think it could have used some more dialogue and the fades annoyed me. Good acting, good plot, great effects but not enough depth to hold you into wanting to see how it ends but rather dragging it out and having certain parts predictable.

A Visual Treat!,"Director Michael Bay's 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is a Visual Treat of a Film. The Special Effects, The 3D Impact, The Direction, are awe-inspiring. However, as a film, though better than the 2nd part, This action-packed saga still falls short, in comparison to it's first masterstroke! However, the devotees of the franchise, won't be disappointed.'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is the same thing again. Human vs Machines, The Good versus The Bad. It's old wine, that comes intact with, as mentioned before, stunning Special Effects, good 3D & Effective Direction, working on it's advantage.Writer Ehren Kruger, should have worked on the film more. Though not at all boring, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is very long & slightly dragged. The climax, which runs for nearly 40-minutes, is visually captivating, but as a whole of a screenplay, is lazy and takes advantage of the top-notch technology it's blessed to have.Michael Bay Cinema is different. It's Escapist, Ambitious & Explosive. I have liked him as a storyteller, and even though the writing material isn't as sharp as expected, Bay still manages to do his job effectively. Cinematography is good. Editing is average. Art Design is nice.Performance-Wise: Shia LaBeouf continues to impress, in a role, that he plays for the third time. Rosie looks good and does fairly well. John Turturro & Frances McDormand are first-rate. Turturro, is sure bring the house down with his witty dialogue delivery, that is truly funny. Josh Duhamel is decent. Tyrese Gibson gets limited scope. Patrick Dempsey plays the bad guy ably. Kevin Dunn is sweet. John Malkovich is wasted.On the whole, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is meant for Transformers Fanatics, mainly.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Can we have a reboot now?,"Hurrah! 3 transformers movies, and that third one is quite better then the precedent ( and since it was rise of the fallen was one of the worst movie of 2009, its was not very difficult to top). But here we are, it was a fun brainless ride and I really like it, mister Bay finally was able to create actions sequences that wasn't just scraps metals shaking on the screen. By making the Autobots in brighter colours the fight scene now make sense and are quite enjoyable, two or three time i just had to turn toward my girlfriend and exclaim, ''whoa! I just understand what happened!'' But it leave me a bit bitter.It took me time to figure out what was so wrong with dark side of the moon (and the trilogy in general) and here goes, I wont rehash what have been said a thousand time about the bad script and mindless explosion, no, I will just say that Micheal Bay don't understand is source material but more importantly he got a lousy moral compass. We have a movie where heroes (yes, the heroes) MUTILATE, DISMEMBER, EXECUTE and are hellbent on GENOCIDE and the list goes on, the malaise begin when Optimus put a bullet in the head of a random Decepticon in the second movie like it was nothing.And that, beyond anything else show that Bay doesn't care, its okay for the heroic character to dismember opponent for fun, for Optimus to kill brutally is mentor and none of them seem to raise and eyebrow when their home(cybertron, who look like a huge, ugly, planetoid, hive) got seemingly destroyed, because they are NOT characters, they are NOT heroic sentient machine, they are special effect pure and simple. I wouldn't mind if the movie was called Marines VS Machines or something, but hey its the Transformers where talking about here.So it was okay,in a dumb and fun kind of way, buts its time to move on, lets someone with real audacity and imagination take a shot, awesome thing could be done with that property other then selling Bud light and GM truck.Oh and as far as pointless insertion of useless token babe goes, Megan Fox was better, at least she as some real acting skill.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Definite Improvement,"Having seen the last film, ""Revenge of the Fallen,"" I did not have high expectations for this movie. I also heard a lot of bad reviews of this film. But having seen it, I have to say the movie was actually pretty decent and I think it's a definite improvement from the last one. In fact it's probably the best of the three. That's not to say it doesn't have its problems, but I did actually find myself entertained by this film and I do appreciate that the filmmakers tried to make improvements based on everyone's complaints about the last film.IMPROVEMENTS - Annoying characters are mostly dialed back and removed, and stereotypes are dialed back. That's not to say there aren't stereotypes, but the stereotypes this time around didn't totally offend or annoy me to the point where I couldn't enjoy the film. Skids and Mudflap are gone with no explanation (they needed to be removed from existence), the parents aren't in it as much, and John Turturro is far less annoying. The story makes more sense (at least for a popcorn fun blockbuster) and I'm able to understand what's going on without getting totally annoyed. There are no robot balls, and there is no close-up of John Turturro in his underpants (there is a close-up of Ken Jeong in his underpants, but it's played up for a shock humor joke which actually made me laugh for the big payoff so I can't complain. Others might find it offensive, though). Oh, and there is far less dog and robot humping all around.OTHER POSITIVES - Obviously the action and special effects. Definite props to the animators, the cinematographers, the stunt coordinators, and the special effects guys because they did an amazing job. Again. Plus I'm actually able to tell which robots are fighting in this movie, which is good. The jokes are a bit funnier this time around (not all big laughs, and not all tasteful, but definitely more hits than the last movie). There is better (not great) but better character development and I didn't totally loathe anyone. The pacing, the editing, and the music were also all very good. The elements I enjoyed all contributed to the story and added to my enjoyment of the film. The villains are also much more threatening because they have a definite goal and you see more of the damage they can cause (although the foaming at the mouth was over the top).NEGATIVES - There are a lot of unnecessary cameos and characters in the film who pop in and leave. For example, I'm not sure why John Malkovich is in this because he doesn't really do anything. He just comes in, acts weird, and leaves. They introduce him like he's an important character and then he's dismissed about halfway through. Kim Jeong will be annoying and offensive to some people, but he didn't annoy me so I really only mention this for the benefit of others. Bill O'Reilly and Buzz Aldrin make unnecessary and distracting cameos. And I love Leonard Nimoy, I think he had a good voice role in this film, and I love Star Trek and Spock, but the Spock love was totally distracting. They mention Spock a lot, show a scene from ""Amok Time,"" make references to the Enterprise, and even have Leonard quote a famous ""Wrath of Khan"" line. It's really very distracting. There are a ton of distracting ad placements in the movie (which, you should really expect if you go to see any Michael Bay film because they pay for the effects). Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a very sexualized, very stereotypical, very useless damsel in distress who may be offensive to some people (as one of only 2 major female characters in the movie). There are also still very noticeable plot and logic errors, despite the improvements, and some scenes that don't quite fit right.But, in spite of my problems with it, it did entertain me and I did enjoy it. It's about on the same level as ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" or ""Twister"" and any problems I had are made up for by the improvements and positives.7/10 - Some problems, but overall enjoyable popcorn fun. Recommended for people who just want to watch a robots and stuff blowing up movie without worrying too much about plot or characters.3DI don't like 3D anyway, but I saw this with a friend in 3D, and I do have to admit that the 3D was better than the last film I saw in 3D (""Tron Legacy""). It's not totally dark, and it didn't make me sick looking at it. However, the graphics popping out are still distracting, and I can't focus on some of the animation detail due to the blurring effect of some of the 3D graphics. If you go to see this I recommend 2D just to get the full details of the animations.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointed,"I have to say I was very disappointed with this film. I think they need to make it more about the actual transformers and less about Sam and the cast. Yes the parts involving the robots were visually amazing but I wanted more, I left the cinema bored and unsatisfied. I felt the story line could have been improved and I have to say that I preferred the first two with Megan Fox, did they really have to add another girl purely for looks? I rated this movie 5 as I do love the Transformers films and the effects but I was hoping for something a little bit more I guess. I think if they do a fourth instalment they should restart with a whole new cast as taking out one of the main characters was strange to the dynamics of the film, however involving totally new people and focusing on the Transformers would definitely have improved this movie for me!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good summer fun.....,"Well here we go again. Another Transformers movie and another round of critics bashing it harder than a decepticon hitting an autobot picnic.First let me preface things by saying, when do all movies being made lately have to be compared to The Dark Knight or be reviewed as if its the next academy award winning film. Whatever happened to just simply going to the movies and enjoying yourself.Transformers Dark of the Moon fits nicely into the ""go and enjoy yourself"" variety. ** Potential Spoilers ** I really enjoyed this installment of the Transformers franchise. The special effects are as always excellent. As opposed to Revenge of the Fallen there's actually a story to this movie. It appears that the space-race was inspired by a crashed Autobot shuttle that was fleeing Cybertron during the war. The US got to it first and learned what they could from it and salvaging some items that become integral to the story later on. Sam this time around is out of college and out of work. There's some mildly amusing and awkward interview moments (we've all been there) and he finally lands a job in a mail-room. This is when the story kicks in. It seems Megatron and the Decepticons have been working with humans behind the scenes for a while and now they are looking to terminate some of those relationships. Sam is confronted with the information about the crashed Autobot shuttle and NASA cover-up. And he goes to the dismissive head of national security. The Autobots hear of the news and hear to the moon to recover Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) and he tells why he was fleeing Cybetron. Then the action begins with some excellent chase scenes on the highway. Great battle sequences and an unexpected betrayal. Thus resulting in the invasion of the US and some mass destruction. Parents be warned the Decepticons actually vaporize innocent by-standers on screen and it may be a bit harsh for little ones. The new Autobots were enjoyable. Loved the Wreckers and they provided some great moments on screen. And the final fight between Megatron and Optimus was very satisfying. This was a great way to end the current story and leaves things open enough for future movies. It seems like most of the negative reviews have focused on the fact that A) They hate Michael Bay. B) Megan Fox isn't in it. and C) The story sucked. Well I for one thought the story was as good as the first movie. I like the action sequences Bay films and although I find Megan Fox pleasing to the eyes I really didn't miss her at all. I don't expect great acting from these types of movies. It's meant to be escapist fun. A chance to turn off the brain and be entertained for a few hours. This movie is pure fun and fit the bill nicely. Don't listen to the haters and bad reviews... Go see it.... and have fun",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
does anyone really believe a guy like...,"Sam Witwicky can keep getting supermodels as girlfriends. That was the most unbelievable part of the film. He's replaced Megan Fox with some Victoria Secret's model. And in this movie, he doesn't even have a job. That part right there just makes this whole movie seem so silly.In this movie, the decepticans have another scheme involving pillars stolen from a crashed ship on the moon. The film intertwines real people and happenings like Neil Armstrong and walking on the moon with the fictitious robot story. Optimus Prime goes to the moon and brings back an old alli, only he can revive. What he doesn't know is the alli has made a deal with the deceopticans as he is the only one whom can use the pillars and transport their planet to earth and take all of earth's resources.So Sam and his friends do a bunch of crazy action stunts to stop the decepticans. The last part of the movie is like one big action sequence that we've seen before.FINAL VERDICT: OK, for what is is meant to be which is a loud action flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing.,"It was awesome. The best movie of the summer. The acting was spot on. The robots were amazing. The music was top notch. Rosie was hot. g g g As a huge fan of the Transformers animated series, I was disappointed with first Transformers film. I didn't really like the look of the Autobots and thought it was a little annoying. When I saw Transformers 2, which is a HUGE mess of a film, I was really angry. I vowed never to see a Transformers film ever again. But when the trailer of Transformers 3 came out, I actually got a little interested. I mean the special effects were pretty much great as usual. But this time, it seemed they took off the annoying little robots and that annoying mother and replaced them with good old fashioned action.When I went to an advanced screening yesterday, I still came in with relatively low expectations. I have to say, that Transformers 3 is an overall improvement from its predecessor, Transformers 2. The film was pretty much at level with the first film, though. The action scenes were highly extravagant and at times, pretty epic. The movie had a lot less lame scenes, which is always a plus. The acting though, has not improved at all though. Megan Fox's replacement, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was not unbearable, but she's certainly not a good actress, but a mediocre one, at the same level with Megan Fox. Although Megan Fox is definitely hotter. As usual though, the story was unremarkable and extremely abysmal at times, but not as horrible as the first film though.Overall I rate Transformers 3, an 8/10. Don't go in expecting a Best Picture winner/nominee. With the right amount of expectations, you will probably be fulfilled. A definite improvement over Revenge of the Fallen, which doesn't say much. But at the end, the great special effects and extremely extravagant action scenes more than make up its flaws. A summer flick that rises above the usual, noisy summer blockbuster films. I definitely recommend this film if you overall liked the franchise.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Pretty good, but still the worst of the series.","Let me start with the good.The 3D was amazing. The action was intense. The special effects were jaw-dropping. The acting was good all around (with the exception of Rosie Huntington-Whitely) And the story was actually quite interesting.Now for the bad.Some extremely tedious moments. less actual ""fun"" (especially lacking in laughs) The crappy excuse for Mikaela not being there. Replacing Megan Fox with Rosie (she didn't do bad but she was utterly emotionless) And the killing of a few characters. (not to mention the brutality of some of it)Die hard fans like me will still enjoy it and buy it on DVD but it probably wont be so well excepted by others. there's also a lacking of likability, characters that i loved in the past two were less awesome.In closing it's a great action flick with non-stop mayhem (mostly in the second half), and if that's your cup of tea then you'll enjoy it, but it isn't a mind blowing classic or anything.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining than Revenge of The Fallen.,"Upon entering the theater, I was really hesitant on seeing this film; mainly due to the fact that Revenge of The Fallen received very negative reviews. However, and I'm really shocked to say this, I actually enjoyed Dark of The Moon. Sure it's no masterpiece by any means, but what do you expect from a director whose only talent is making things blow up minus character development, plot, and dialog.Dark Of the Moon really is the best film in the series, surpassing ROTF by many a long shot. It's story is better than the first two films, though that's not saying a lot when Bay for no apparent reason at all, inserts random shots of sexual innuendo that really serves no purpose at all in the film and scenes that are totally unnecessary; particularly the antique car and bathroom scene. But the battle scenes between the robots is really impressive and I'm shocked to admit that I was on the edge of my seat watching it all.But still, some characters are seriously overlooked; especially the villains Megatron, Starscream, and Shockwave. Sentinel Prime, really, was the only one who had the most development out of them all. As better than Revenge of the Fallen may be, Dark of the Moon still suffers from the same problems that 1 and 2 had: No fully fleshed out characters and plot. Dark of The Moon has a plot, but it's really skin deep as far as the twists and turns go and because of the fact alone, the emotional attachment is drained significantly.I will say that Dark of The Moon is better than Revenge of The Fallen, but it's not exactly the game changer of the whole Transformers mythos. And judging by the box-office business it's doing in theaters, it's safe to say that a 4 installment will inevitably be made. Hopefully by then it will have a better director and screenwriter along with better acting and plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun for Gen x Kids,"This was an all around light fun action film with many humorous scenes especially every scene with his parents.There is not any series in terms of blending Computer Generated Imagery, with film locations that has been done masterfully.These are fun films for Generation Xers if they had the ability to do this between 1985-1995 I can't imagine any kid between 9-16 not loving these movies. They'd really have hated the over priced easy to break Transformer toy-line.The story line was over the top. The evil corporation making deals with deceptions with everything the antagonists bring transformerdy, toasters , Televidions etc.Opening with the wise ass Transformer ""This is the one where Spock goes crazy and the Battle of Chicago was way to drawn out...and making it cheesier with lines like ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" really?Disney has that warning..but on an OLED quality 55-72' set the robot fight scenes can be overwhelming on the senses.The films may have been accepted or reviewed better had they been cut down to 130 minutes max plus credits..But if something can rake in over a billion on a 250 million budget before BLU-Ray and merchandising it will be made.Like anything else movies especially in this genre aren't made to win Oscars but to bring in big bucks.In terms of sequel overkill.... I find Starwars to be more embarrassing as mentioned. The prequels were a nightmare, and JJ plagiarized the first three...Ray is the Emperors Grandaughter...Luke is Vader's son. Mark Hamill was young and mopey now old and grouchy. A Death Star and Star base 1 at least they didn't make a second star base just Imperial Cruiser planet killers.

"Michael Bay has somehow done it-what an improvement, what a Sci-Fi.Genre-defining!","The Transformers series are a very strange and curious trilogy.The first was interesting, a little longer than the plot was capable of handling, but nonetheless enjoyable for what it is.Then, the second one came around with initial reviews claiming it was a loud-explosion mess of a movie.Yes, i left the theatre deaf as a post, but i still accepted it for what it was-a brainless, one-liner, visual effects driven non-plot having extravaganza, that can take your ears to the grave.Yes, it was a little sub par on plot and substance, but i enjoyed it for what it is-a summer Michael Bay movie.Now, with the third coming, i must say, that all of you, who were left unhappy, deaf and unsatisfied, you must forget it and see the third part as a reincarnation in a Sci-Fi classic, just like the likes of the nowadays Inception, or District 9 and so on, but with more effects, less inappropriate noise and featuring one of the most breathtaking scenery of giant robots fighting on 3-D.The technical part of the movie is done better than ever, on par up there with Avatar (yes, it's getting a cliché, but it's nevertheless true)and there is a believable plot, considering the flops they used to call stories in the first two movies (again, compared with this, of course).The acting isn't great, but it's an improvement, considering the movie's improvement in any other department as well.Even Rosie looks a little better than Megan Fox.Shia LaBeouf is the running man again, and with some additions such as Patrick Dempsey, John Malkovich and even the twist in Turturro's character, Transformers 3 looks fresher than ever.With good reviews coming from literary everywhere right now, i do hope people will believe, because this movie does not deserve to be in the box office shade of it's predecessors, because it is so much better.So, i'll leave you with this-go see it not because you still have faith in the franchise, but see it because as it looks to you, the movie is really different from the other two (which Bay also claimed to be ""dark""), and last but not least, see it for the mind-blowing SFX's, which have not been seen since December 2009...A great summer movie, a modern action, Sci-Fi movie, which will wind up in many movie collections over the years to come!Ny note:10/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as good as the first but better than the second,"The third film in the successful franchise based on an 80s toy product. This one sees the plot revolving around Earth's manned mission to the moon in the 60s (which incorporates some good use of archive footage). The real reason behind the mission is in fact a cover up for an ""incident"" which the world was in the dark over. An Autobot spaceship which crash landed on the surface on the moon, millions of years ago.With the intriguing premise, the film unfortunately starts to flag. As we head back to the drama's of Sam (Shia Labeouf) Witwicky life. Set a couple of years of the 2nd film. Sam is struggling to find a job whilst his Autobot companions are out on secret missions maintain peace and order with their human allies. It isn't too long before the Decepticons make an appearance and are back to their old tricks again.We learn that within the crashed spaceship (the Ark) contains special pillars that could help the Autobots once and for all to conquer the Decepticons and win the war....but in the wrong hands they could also lead to the destruction of the planet Earth.To summarise the plot in such way makes the film so interesting and exciting but it is far from it. The total lack of serious/normal characters in the film jars the brooding menace. Every supporting character is a bit weird (John Malkovich's- Bruce Bezo) or over hyperactive (Ken Jeong's-Jerry Wang). It sometimes feels like there are two films competing here. One a wacky and (un)funny comedy drama whilst the other, an explosive and eye popping special effects laden action film. I am at a loss as to why there was any need for such a need to try to use stock footage of real events for it to only throw us such infantile humour.After the absolute slating that the 2nd film received you would have thought that Bay would have learnt his lesson, but far from it. Racial stereotypes are still ever present and it seems like any ethnic minority is portray in very unpolitical correct way. A Scottish sounding Autobot is heard to say ""I'll bottle ya"" The humour is also not at all funny. If you do laugh, you'd be laughing at the absolute dire dialogue written for the film. I had high hopes for this film and my hopes soon turned to anger and dismay.The other problem with the film is the pacing of the whole thing. It takes an absolute age for anything exciting to happen. When you come to see a film like this you'd expect robots to be smashing other robots, buildings or any other inanimate object. What you get is a limp attempt at humour and character development.Enough about the negatives you say, what about the positives? Well the action scenes are extremely well handled. If you watch in 3D then your eyes will be in for a treat. Bays trademark of slo-mo is in full effect and there is so much happening at one time you could get lost in which Transformer is which. With the carnage and mayhem, you're going to be in safe hands with Bay. The 3D is also implement in such dazzling array and the action packed set pieces are done with aplomb.I just wish he would try to leave school boy humour and offence pokes at other races alone. Apart from that I just about found the film tolerable. A complete mess with a tone which shifts from one extreme to another and just doesn't sit well. I now know why Megan Fox jumped ship and left this awful mess of a film. A sad waste of money, time and effort. I want my money back.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Transformers 3 with the Extra ""D""!","To explain the plot of TF3 is like trying to explain rocket science to a child. You just can't. It has something to do with some Spock-voiced robot crash landing on the moon in the 60s and some teleportation pillars having to do with the end of the world or something, but I digress. It's already giving me a headache. TF3 can be basically seen as an apology from Michael Bay after making the hated TF2. He said it would be 100% better. He lied. Sure, TF3 has a hint of a story this time around, and the film tries really hard to show us this, but it fails miserably. At least TF2 didn't try to have a plot (which is probably due to the fact that the script wasn't even finished when they began shooting the film), and at least it was entertaining.Even removing the two annoying racist twin robots from TF2, TF3 is still worse. Why? Because it's a dull film. It turns out that watching the same thing thrice isn't as interesting as watching it the first two times. It tries to be different, but when you get down to it, it's more of the same, but with one huge difference: Bay decides to save all the action in the last 45 minutes of the film. And seeing how people watch these films for the action, we have to wait about 100 whole minutes to see it. Now this shouldn't be a problem had the film had an interesting story and characters to invest in. Well, it didn't. It's a LOOOONG 100 minutes of unfunny jokes and non-existent, incoherent storytelling. Seriously, Bay could have easily cut 30 minutes off the film, but you know how he is. His films just have to be over two hours, don't they?But anyway, once we finally get to see the action, it's actually quite impressive. With the addition of 3D, it's pretty damn amazing. And because of the Chicago sequence alone, TF3 isn't a total lost cause. We eventually do get what we came for. As for the 3D, I liked the use of it. It was shot in 3D instead of converted into 3D during postproduction, so you really get to see the depth and stuff popping out during the entire film, especially during the Chicago sequence where you see the depth of the city and people flying around (among many other things).The actors in here are efficient. It's not like they actually have to act. They just run and yell. Newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Megan Fox's replacement, is pretty decent too, although it's easy to imagine that Fox could have done the same. Veteran actors John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, and Leonard Nimoy give a response of pity rather than a warm welcome as we much prefer them not have their resumes tainted by this film. But anyway, they are in the film for good, and there's not much we can do about it. Ken Jeong is pretty annoying but (thankfully) does not appear in the film any more than 5 minutes. Alan Tudyk--why? Why are you in this? You're better than this!Anyway, I'll get off my soap box now. Of the 157 minutes(!!) TF3 has, about 45 minutes are actually fun to watch. The other minutes....aren't. I mean, it's a Transformers movie. It's the third one in the series. You know what to expect. By this time, you already know if this is for you or not. If it is, watch it in 3D. Or maybe don't, just so they don't make a fourth film. I'd imagine people will get tired of Transformers soon enough (like me) as the case of sequelitis becomes increasingly apparent.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Horrible just horrible.,This movie offers nothing at all from other Transformer movies which were also bad. The acting is no better. The main character Sam (Shia Laboof) acting consist of yelling names like bumblebee or something. Not to mention his new girlfriend who you don't really know because its just a replacement. The plot is just more robots shooting rockets and more Transformer cube robot crap threatening humans again. This movie still has that annoying orange color and fake tan look. The one thing Bay did do right was graphics but that doesn't make a movie. You know there going to make another one even though they always beat the main bad guy? I hope they stop because the plot lines hit an end at Transformers 2.,,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Better Than The Second Film, Not Quite The First Film","The first Transformers film was an event for me. As a fan of the cartoon, I was excited to see it brought to life on the big screen. And seeing it was quite an event. I got the chance to see an early screening of it at Anime Expo in 2007 with about 3000 excited geeks and nerds. So, you can imagine, it was a lot of fun. Sadly, the energy in this series is not the same. Gone is the excitement carried by the discovery of CGI- fueled Transformers. Gone is the thrill of seeing Optimus for the first time or hearing the line Autobots, Roll Out. Without that thrill, one thing becomes glaringly obvious: the series just isn't that exciting any more.Don't get me wrong, this is not necessarily a terrible film. Good, well, that's debatable. The action is still very well done and Michael Bay is still probably the best choice of a director to do a Transformers film. He makes the action look great, and it certainly is great here. But, one could argue that this is the same film as the first, and that was probably done on purpose. We're made aware of some dark secret, reintroduced to Sam Whitwicky in his current life, and then things go wrong. And yes, it all ends in a spectacular battle in which an entire city becomes the battleground.What is highly noticeable is how long the film is. It drags in the middle and by the end, you are starting to notice that the film is really long. And it is, at 2.5 hours. There is certainly some entertainment value to be had. The action is spectacular, to use that word twice. The CGI effects are phenomenal, as they have continued to be for the series and the Transformers are as enjoyable as ever. Sam and Bumblebee's relationship is specifically enjoyable, as it was in the first film. Despite what many will say, Bay does have a certain way of pulling out even the tiniest bit of emotion from his films, and he succeeds here on the smallest scale. Certainly it's not a film to will find a deep connection with, but there's one there.But, as I stated, this is essentially the first film, minus the excitement of discovering the Transformers for the first time. So, if you enjoy these films as a sort of reunion with old friends, then you will like this one. While the second film was certainly a disaster, this is much better, with a simpler plot, decipherable action, and even a decent story. I, however, was fairly bored. There's some sprinkling of humor and decent action, but again, the film dragged quite a bit. Maybe I was just a bit tired when I saw it, but one thing a Transformers film shouldn't be is boring, and sadly, this one was.What I say to you is see it if you want some decent summer action. But if the idea of another Transformers film already has you rolling your eyes and yawning, I say skip it. You probably won't change your mind.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" was the fastest two and a half hours I've ever experienced.","Let me start off by just saying that ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is much more better than its predecessor.I'm not what you'd exactly call a fan of the Michael Bay-directed Transformers film series. I didn't particularly like the first film with it's excess of cheese and CGI. I hated ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" which was even with it's action sequences less interesting than watching paint dry in a dark room. It was muddled, and after 30 minutes of watching the movie, I started to begin to have chronic headaches. Luckily though, Michael Bay has picked up the pieces, and directed the awesome ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon.""I'm not gonna bother writing a detailed plot description, since it doesn't really matter a lot, but the film is practically the following Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has to once again save the world from total destruction. He once again needs to help his Autobot friends. He once again has the hot girlfriend, this time a new one, Rosie Huntington- Whiteley, who's replaced Megan Fox. She is what Megan Fox was, hot and not getting too much dialog. She's effective at what she is supposed to do.Thankfully, there's less and more humorous humor here. Coen-favorites John Turturro and Frances McDormand star alongside John Malkovich to provide us with subtle humor. Turturro's character, the retired agent Seymour Simmons, who tried to laugh us in the previous films, actually succeeds here. From it's cast to the amazing special effects put to display here, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a carefully made action picture. It succeeds as one on every level.That said, there are still mistakes in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" The plot is too complicated for the adolescent 12-year-olds it's mainly made for, and it drags quite a lot in act two, but ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" was the fastest two and a half hours I've ever experienced. I mean that in the best possible way.There's a huge cast in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Frances McDormand, John Turturro, John Malkovich, Hugo Weaving, Kevin Dunn, Shia LaBeouf, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and even Patrick Dempsey as Whiteley's boss.Bay is known for directing bad movies with great action sequences. He doesn't create a good movie here, but he creates a movie that's action sequences are so good, that we don't really care about anything else. He's obviously done a lot of work here. Remember all you haters, Michael Bay doesn't write the dialogs of his movies. Ehren Kruger does that in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" and I give Bay extra credit of making the action so good that we forget about Kruger's horrible dialog writing.Apart from the action sequences, the 3D is amazing here. It's as good as I've seen in a long while. In fact, I believe that the only movies with good 3D I've ever seen are ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Tron: Legacy."" I didn't see ""Avatar"" in 3D. The second act dragged a bit, but the engrossing act one and the frantic act three with the epic destruction of Chicago in amazing 3D, more than make up for act two's mistakes.He said it himself, Michael Bay wants to ""entertain the summer audience"". He will with ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" which is the best film I've ever seen that he directed. This isn't a great movie, but it's wildly entertaining. It's got the explosions, it's got the frantic action, it's got the Victoria's Secret model, it's got robots beating the **** out of other robots, and it's got the amazing third act of total destruction. What more could you ask from a summer action flick?Rating: ★★★ (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You better not have hoped for much!,"First let me start by saying that I knew when I went to see Transformers 3, that i was going to be in for a big budget blockbuster, so I wasn't hoping for too much in the way of depth or volume or character development. But hell, a little wouldn't have been too much to ask. I know I know, it's Michael Bay at his ocular raping best, but something is missing here. Something big.I think Sucker Punch proved, you can't just through a tonne of money and special effects at a turd and hope it will polish itself. And this is no exception. Don't get me wrong, it's a major improvement on Revenge of the Fallen, but not quite up to the standard of the first. What has happened here (in MY opinion folks. Don't get upset. You're all entitled to one, and have one (opinions, not assholes)) is, we seem to have lost the need or want to tell a story.The special effects here have spared no expense. The 3D is OK only surpassed by Avatar or Jackass 3D (no, seriously, if you'd seen Jackass 3D, you would know what I'm talking about). I guess you have to tune right out and not try to think about the film so much to rate it 10 out of 10, but when I'm paying hard earned dollars to see something special, I expect something special. This is not special. To be honest, my favorite thing about the whole film was the Green Lantern 3D trailer at the beginning. I guess I had hyped this film up for myself too much and it failed to live up to my own expectations (also my friends who sat next to me complaining about the stupidity of the weak ass story). But I imagine I'm not alone. I think a lot of people have high expectations of big budget blockbusters and want to see something mind numbingly great. But this just didn't do it for me. Why? Because it was just plain stupid. The story had holes you could drive Optimus Prime through (at one point he does). And come on, since when do Robots have free-kin HAIR???? Robots with lips is one thing, but hair? I draw the line people.So see it (at your peril). But please don't expect to be blown away. Maybe expectations of an epileptic seizure (there is a lot going on at one time, flashing lights, explosions, space shuttle disasters and robots with hair) are more appropriate.I can only hope Green Lantern lives up to the trailers expectations.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Full of flaws, but still entertaining.","Expectations were still relatively high for this threequel, despite the disappointing Revenge of the Fallen, and director Michael Bay himself had guaranteed to deliver an instalment that lived up to the promise shown in the original Transformers only four years ago. He has partly succeeded. Dark of the Moon still features many of the flaws present in Fallen – lame jokes (especially from Sam's parents), preposterous plot holes, inaudible dialogue from the robots and woeful acting by the love interest, this time Victoria Secrets model Rosie Huntington-Whitely as Megan Fox's replacement – but it improves on one, arguably the most significant, element: the action. Where last time out you couldn't see what the hell was going on, this time around the robotic fighting (rendered in mind-bogglingly good CGI – the best of the franchise) is clear as day and possesses some tremendous slow-mo metallic clobbering. By no means a brilliant movie, even by 'dumb-action' standards, but leave your mind and maturity at the door and you'll be in for an entertaining two and a half hours.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Transformers 3...worse than I expected.,"When going into a film, it's only right that you go in knowing what the film wants to deliver. In the case of Transformers 3, the package has always been non-stop robo-action, and humoured digressions. That's what I kept telling myself going into this film: ""it's just a popcorn movie, so enjoy it for what it is."" Well, I went in, and for part of the movie I was kind of enjoying myself, but as soon as the final hour began, whatever enjoyment I felt disappeared and boredom set in.If you're familiar with the humour of the franchise then you're probably expecting more of the same, and that's what you get: more colourful comic relief, more banter between characters, more awkward moments for Sam Witwicky. Your enjoyment of this is likely dependent on how you enjoyed the previous instalments's humour: if you enjoyed it you'll like this, if you didn't then you probably won't. Personally, I thought this film was funnier than the others, but I still thought it was hit or miss.The actual plot itself has a lot going on, but it's largely there to connect the dots and present opportunities for large scale action. Even the moments of humour, which appear to at least attempt to advance the film's plot in some way, come across more as digressions from the plot as certain characters are given license to chew the scenery. But really, does anyone come to Transformers expecting to be engaged in the plot? Most people come to this movie to see robots fight each other, and that's just what they will get. And yet...I found myself wanting more.I thought I had gotten myself ready prior to my viewing, to enjoy the film as best as I could on its terms, and for a moment I believed I was heading in that direction, but I soon became bored in the final sequence & though I have a few reasons for feeling so, the one that sticks out in my head the most is the fact that not only was I not engaged, but I wasn't even feeling the slightest sense of drama.Out of all 3 Transformers films, Dark of the Moon easily has the most at stake, and there are moments of characters in distress, but it all comes across as superficial. Michael Bay fails to go deeper into the characters and throughout the climax I kept asking myself ""why should I care that 'this' is happening?"", and if I don't care about anything that's happening then why am I watching all these special effects other than to just, well, watch the nice looking effects? To a lot of people out there they are able to view only the eye candy and get enjoyment out of that, but to me, without any real feeling behind anything that's happening, the climax became meaningless.Dark of the Moon is indeed a popcorn film, and if you go in looking for a lot of action and humour then you may come out pleased, but for me the lack of any real drama hindered the conflict a great deal and left me feeling cold and bored.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A striking spectacle that requires no thinking for enjoyment,"I have been anticipating this goliath blockbuster since the day I saw the first trailer. My expectations were simple; lots of epic action, ground breaking visuals, and awesome sound effects. I received slightly more though. Dark of the Moon is a big step up in all aspects comparing to its predecessors. It delivered the most advanced live action visuals and 3d elements to ever be apart of a live action movie. Being the extremely critical person I am who usually enjoys films that deliver exceptional acting and well told storys, I ended up being obsessed with this movie, but for for all the right reasons. Epic action, hot women, and cool fx. If you're not into that then this movie wont be for you.P.S. I still am waiting to see this movie one more time before I can really give my true rating.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Do you like mindless action? Go see this ASAP.,"But for those of us who focus more on the story and characters then, you won't find too much of it here.The flaws from the God-awful transformers 2 has sort-of been fixed (probably because Bay didn't write any of the script this time). But the main issues are still very visible. One of the largest problems with this movie are the human characters, you can't relate to them and we don't really get to know them at all, as such we don't really care what happens to them, which makes a lot of the scenes where people get hurt or gets close to death rather bad.The awful and very miss-placed comedy is still here, while it is far from as present as it was in the second movie... It's still here. This is a really major issue since there isn't a consistent theme in the movie. For example, a lot of times when suspension is built up in the movie, it's destroyed by miss-placed toilethumour slapstick jokes which immediately breaks the tension. This was a MAJOR issue in the second one but thankfully it's not AS present in this one. Also, most of the human characters are in the movie only to serve as comedy-relief, which usually is fine but there are WAY too many comedy-relief characters in the movie which just gets annoying and breaks the tension.The story is also quite bad and there are a lot of plot holes in the movie, however what annoyed me the most were the same things as in the second movie.A, Unnecessary scenes) Again, there are so many scenes that contribute nothing to the story or the development of the characters, since I can't spoil anything I can't give any good examples of this, but again it's much less than the second movie (which is pretty much just a clusterf**k of unnecessary scenes) but is still very prominent.B, Historical things...) This is something that I personally dislike a lot, while a lot of people probably don't care at all. The movie both ""explains"" what ""really"" happened at two major of events, one of which was a huge disaster most people probably heard of, namely the Chernobly disaster. This almost felt insulting, not only do they want us to accept such a implausible explanation, they expect us not to react on it... I mean, people died in that disaster show some respect for Christ sake. It also references other disasters via imagery.C, The transformers)This is supposed to be a movie about the transformers, and I still don't understand why our main characters are humans and not autobots. The transformers themselves are never really presented in a good way which means you probably won't know who's who. The only characters I could notice were Optimus Prime and Bumble Bee, luckily the autobots are easier to differentiate from the decipticons this time around. As for the decipticons, I really did not have a clue as to who's who.D, The length) This movie is way... WAY too long. The ending part of the movie is almost 50 minutes long and it's just constant action which I found rather boring. I think if they cut around 35% of the movie I might consider giving it a 5.5-6 in score, but at this length it got to the point where I was looking at my watch every 5 minutes to see if it was about to end soon.Conclusion)If you want to see a solid action movie, then this will probably serve you rather well, however do not expect anything from the story and be prepared for poorly placed toilethumour jokes.If you're looking for a ""good"" movie, then you'll have better luck elsewhere, the movie fails to deliver at everything aside from the action.Final score, 3,5.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just SAD....,"This one is one of the highest grossing films of all time, they gave Michael Bay a ton of cash, then he spent it all on a CGI.

Another one?,"I would venture to say that we've entered the golden age of cinema sequels. Soon we'll have the misfortune of another Ghostrider film despite the fact that the first one stunk. Sequels can be the best thing to ever happen to a film (The Godfather II, Rocky II) or the worst (see any of the Land Before Time series after the first). So, needless to say I wasn't totally excited about the third Transformers film especially since the second film had left me disappointed.I'm happy to report that this third film was a dramatic improvement in several ways over the second. I still feel that the first film was the best, but this film was watchable and even enjoyable. This time the cast includes Shia LeBeouf, Josh Duhamel, and John Turturro. New to the series are John Malkovich, Patrick Dempsey, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.The story follows up on the previous films as the Autobots discover a Cybertronian spacecraft hidden on the Moon. Now they're in a race with the Decepticons to reach it and to learn its secrets. In the meantime Sam (LaBeouf) is struggling with being a normal guy after the role he played in saving the earth. Slowly he finds his way back into the mix with his old friends, human and Transformer, as the Decepticons begin their efforts to rule the world.The film is visually stunning through the action sequences. The CGI and special effects work well as they make each action scene amazing. If you're looking for anything realistic this won't be for you, the fights and destruction are over the top from minute one.The acting is exactly I expected, LaBeouf plays his frustrated Sam much the same way as he did in the previous two films. Gibson and Duhamel manage to shoot enough Decepticons to make their mark in the film. Sam's new flame Carly (Huntington-Whiteley) is weak in the film but I'm fairly sure that she wasn't hired for her acting. Newcomers John Malkovich and Patrick Dempsey are definitely the highlights of the film.If there is any criticism I would say that the effort to leave the door open for a sequel is obvious and may have weakened the ending. It's not a bad film, but like the second film it fails to match the quality of the first film in terms of story.I would recommend this film if you enjoyed the other two in the series. If the second film left you feeling bad this might redeem the franchise a bit. I would give the film a rating of 2.9 stars out of 5.Rating: PG-13 Running Time: 157 minutes",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A film only matched in it's epic failure by it's epic bad taste,"Once in a while,a film comes along that is something quite special. Setting the standard higher than any that has gone before.

It's not that Transformers 3:Dark of the Moon is just bad - that, this trilogy will be long remembered for. Instead, Micheal Bay has upped the ante once more and has created a ""film"" that not only succeeds in being vapid, obnoxious and offensive, but downright boring. The plot that exists is a hotch-potch of half-ideas, beginning in the 1960s with the suggestion that the American space programme and moon landings (via some shocking inter cutting of real footage) were an effort to reach a crashed Autobot vessel (they are the good robots - you can tell because they don't have evil red eyes). This ship carries 'pillars' which have the ability to open portals which allow teleportation. Cue the Decepticon's (red eyes) fiendish plan to bring their home planet of Cybertron to Earth, enslaving mankind in the process.TF3 is a game of two halves.For the first hour exactly nothing happens. Not only does nothing happen, but when it does happen, it is garbled and confusing, with big jumps in continuity and logic. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf - the human hero of the previous two outings) finds himself searching for work while also struggling to come to terms with the fact the Autobots no longer need him. Fortunately for Sam, he has a new girlfriend, possibly the least developed and most insincere relationship ever committed to celluloid, played by super-model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in inimitable Bay style, with minimal charisma and minimal clothing. In Bay's world men are either soldiers or gay, women are either supermodels or Mrs Trunchbull tyrants (with insinuations of lesbianism), and ethnicities serve only to be stereotyped (only black people say ""wak""). All familiar territory for the Transformers world, but Bay truly outdoes himself with some horrendously thoughtless references to 9/11 and Chernobyl. Classy.(NB. This is a 12A rating but due to sexual content, innuendo and swearing - not to mention the regular Hostel-style disembowelling of robots - it should be avoided for younger audiences. .) Played largely, and largely unsuccessfully, for goofy laughs, the first hour feels like a holding pen until the director can unleash his trademark Bayhem in the second half. Surely this will redeem the film, especially in the glory of 3D?! Well, no actually.Devoted to one long fight scene, this should be visceral, mind-blowing, red-hot action. Granted, the CG is effective, robots really do look like they are hitting each other, and a free fall set-piece is very well done. However, despite so much going on (explosions, mecha-crunching fist-fights, lots of running and shouting) there seems to be very little happening. Sure, there is lots of noise and stuff, but it's all so overblown that it's difficult to get a handle on anything, making what should be exciting, well, boring.It appears that Bay does not have an original idea in his head. Decepticon spaceships and technological hardware are a 'who's who' of other alien incarnations. Humans are dispensed of in War of the Worlds dust-clouds, the mother ships are Skyline carbon-copies, and the snake-like droids have been seen ad nauseum attacking The Matrix's Zion. (There is also a horrendous amount of copy-and-paste dialogue. Guess the films: ""I'll never let you go"", ""There can only be one"", ""With great power..."" yadda yadda yadda...). The random splicing of half-finished scenes, breathtakingly poor soundtrack choices, and rapid cuts is entirely disorientating, causing the viewer to slip into a kind of action-induced coma.Having spent so much on CG effects, Bay clearly had no money left for insignificant details like script, story or acting direction. Forget the Blockbuster cliché ""it's just a bit of fun"" - it isn't. It is boring and senseless, leaves a bitter after-taste, and gives the best reason yet to close down Hollywood forever.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

New girlfriend for Witwicky,"Megan Fox was fired after comparing Michael Bay's directing style to Hitler, a statement that evidently didn't sit well with the production team.

However, the film struggled to offer anything truly groundbreaking or new to the franchise. The action sequences were impressive as always, but the plot felt somewhat repetitive. Overall, while it entertained, it didn't quite elevate the series to new heights. Because of the action scenes and John Malkovich I gave 7 to this sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Better than Revenge of the Fallen, but that's not saying much.","The first Transformers can at least be called a decent action flick. It had nearly all the elements which Revenge of the Fallen would go on to run into the ground. Dark of the Moon somewhat rectifies this, but still leaves a rancid taste in your mouth. The humor is still obnoxious and overused, Megan Fox's replacement is only somewhat less annoying, and the Decepticons have only regained some menace, but still remain paper machete targets for the Autobots and military. The camera work makes battles extremely hard to watch, not that you're missing out given Decepticons are simply punching bags these days. This movie really can't decide if it wants to be a Saturday morning cartoon promoting Hasbro toys or a series of raunchy jokes followed by scenes of robot organs being ripped out. Still it has some perks. The CGI is better than ever and there were two fights I actually enjoyed. If you want to see giant robots battling it out, see it if you must, but you're better off watching the first film or Pacific Rim.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Thank goodness I only spent $2,Dark of the Moon definitely redeemed itself from part two but it still was somewhat of a disappointment. There was no need to cast the girl in this movie. She contributed absolutely nothing to this film and I thought it was a low blow to insult Megan Fox during the film. It was so obvious that there was no chemistry between Shia and Rosie and her acting was terrible. (not that Megan Fox's was any better). The only thing I enjoyed was Optimus Prime kicking major butt. The two little robots was pointless as well. Thankfully I purchased my tickets through Groupon for $2 because I would've been heated spending $10 on this.

"An entertainer, when you watch it just once.","One of the most awaited movies of this year, and its not a disappointment as its prequel. Still they haven't had much to tell us as a story though. But the way they did the screenplay is appreciable. The movie is a good entertainer and the music is something good, but it reminds me of inception's and requiem for a dream. The best thing abt this movie is the stunning visual effects. I really haven't enjoyed the visual effects of any other movies lately (after avatar and inception).The characters are just to support this machine movie.

Its Getting Old...,"Well the first film was a blast.

There are many scenes that are so predictable and Autobots are ALWAYS there in time. Apart from amazing visual effects and a higher epic Decepticon ambition to conquer the world as well as Sam's new love interest, the story is pretty much the same.

I think this might be my favorite,"Now again, it doesn't mean that it automatically fits into the bill as a good movie, but there were many things that they did differently in this one that I felt worked to an extent.While it wasn't executed perfectly, it felt like they kept the pacing a bit tighter and straightforward. That's exactly what you need in this movie. They kept the expository dialogue to a minimum, and they just went for it.I felt like they tried to give Shia more of an arc in this one which I appreciated, but as far as the rest of the human characters, they're pretty one dimensional. They've always have been in these movies. Thankfully I can say the action was big step up for me at least in this one.I felt like in this one the action was more defined. It wasn't as messy as the other two. And felt like this had some of the best action scenes in the franchise, with the Transformers, and the military warfare. I can still point out which scenes stood out to me.As always, I'm still impressed with the Character designs of the Transformers, as well as the sound design.

This gives a new definition to the word brainless,"I am a huge fan of Michael Bay movies and I must admit the first two Transformer movies were actually quite good and entertaining. The First Transformers was a action-packed, funny and good written movie. The Second installment was somewhat a put down, but nevertheless watchable.But what has happened to this third installment. The acting is horrifying, the writing is crap and the special effects may be the only good thing in this movie.Where the humor in the first two movies was well placed and actually a contribution to the movies, the humor in this part is just bad.As for the story, it must be said there is just no story. People keep complaining how Man of Steel is just a brainless action movie with no story, but it must be said, transformers dark of the moon has even less story in it.Like I said the only good thing in the movie may be the special effects and CGI, however watching this movie one gets the feeling that he is in a computer game and not even a good one. More than half of the movie is just pure computer added effects, making you wonder if Bay should even have taking the effort to film any actual scenes.If you are a fan of brainless action and just want to sit down in your seat after a hard day of work, watching the Apocalypse with some weird humor than you should really go and watch this movie. If you are not looking for this then I would suggest to just skip this movie and go watch another Michael Bay movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Out with the old (Fox), in with the new ...","You can enjoy the third Transformers movie quite a lot. Michael Bay did not have to listen to the criticism, but he did. You don't get a resolution on issues that concern the second Transformers movie, but the movie has reasonable gaps in its story. I'm assuming you have seen both prior installments, so I'm not considering talking about them spoilers.Megan Fox prominently has taken off. Reasons for that are not entirely clear, but I guess she wanted to move along. What's good is that it is resolved and mentioned in the movie. But is is really story you are looking for here? I can't speak for how much liberties Bay takes with the Transformers franchise. But I can say that he filmed this more coherent than the last one. The jokes are still there, but he toned a few things down (thankfully) and made the action scenes look better. Plus I could actually understand and see who was who in the shot.Not superior to the still best part in the series (the first one that is), but a return to action a la Bay, without much to think about. I still would have loved it, if they put a ""3"" after Transformers. It'd be a nice touch to the title, especially considering the 3-D that is used (which is used in a nice way too).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fun first half, bloated second","I realize that the ""Transformer"" movies are generally regarded as the non plus ultra of soulless commercial movie-making and that their popularity is supposed to presage the very demise of Cinema itself as an art form. But such an assessment fails to take into account the movies' sense of high-spirited fun, their playful wit and their over-the-top but sometimes amusing caricatures, human and otherwise (I can't speak for the universally reviled second installment, which I haven't seen).Part 3, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" starts with a clever premise: that the original lunar landing was really just an elaborate, for-public-consumption-only ruse to launch a covert operation to explore a spaceship - the one carrying the initial wave of autobots - that had recently crash landed on the surface of the moon. Now a new race of evil bots, known as Decepticons, are becoming activated, threatening to destroy the good bots and take over the earth for their own nefarious purposes.On the human side, young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) may have saved the world in the past, but he still can't find a job. But mere unemployment can't keep an honest-to-goodness, dyed-in-the-wool hero from saving humanity once again after the evil creatures pretty much raze Chicago in a literal scorched-earth policy of rampant death and destruction.The one saving grace of the ""Transformer"" movies - which would indeed otherwise be the epitome of soulless movie machines - has been their sense of humor, their refusal to take themselves too seriously (especially the first one). Unfortunately, the wit and fleet-footedness of the first half of ""Dark of the Moon"" dribbles away in a welter of overwrought CGI effects and self-congratulatory seriousness towards the end. And LaBeouf gets stuck playing romantic lead to any number of automatons: his metallic buddies and his flesh-and-blood girlfriend Carly Spencer - and he isn't too terribly convincing in either role. But as an action comedy superhero, the kid definitely brings the agility and skills necessary to get the job done. Which pretty much describes the film itself, come to think of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The ""D"" in the report card full of ""F""s","We are now up to the third installment of the action-packed franchise. Is this Transformers also stupid? Yes. Does it still have stupid characters doing idiotic things? Yes. Does it still have Optimus Prime disappearing throughout most the film and still not being quite as bad-arse as his cartoon 80s days? Yes. Is Michael Bay still dropping the ball as director? Yes. Does the franchise still not know how to have a decent ending? Yes. And finally, does it still have this overgrossing obsession about the military? Yes. Despite all this, we have clearly found our best entry in the trilogy, as Dark of the Moon mixes the humor and heart of the first, with the utter carnage of the second, while jacking up the ante in terms of conflict and suspense. That being said, it is freakin' frustrating to watch sometimes.With Dark of the Moon, we follow Sam with a new girlfriend but no job and a frustration of not advancing far in life despite saving the world.twice. In the meantime, the Autobots and the Decepticons race to discover the secrets of a spacecraft that had crashed on the moon many decades ago. This discovery will lead to the most haunting conflicts in the franchise as well as a multitude of surprises and twists and turns. Unlike the first two scripts, which didn't really pack anything juicy other than action scenes, Ehren Kruger's script actually does a great job fixing the Megan Fox dilemma while adding a dosage of much-needed heart with a much more likable cast of characters and less of the embarrassing stereotypes that we had to suffer through in Revenge of the Fallen. The stakes are much higher and the film never really drags along with unnecessary scenes. The final battle did take a while though.......The special effects have always propelled this franchise during the dullest of moments, and they shine once again with Dark of the Moon. If this doesn't get at least an Academy Award nomination, I will be extremely disappointing. Action junkies, you will definitely get your money's worth as a major city becomes a massive battlefield full of nasty destruction and pure mayhem everywhere. In the meantime the Transformer fights, while (once again) minimal, deliver in the visual department. That being said, it was odd to change the blood of the robots from a dark color in the second to a clear red. Not quite sure what they were trying to pull off there. That little note can be pushed aside as we see a gigantic building get torn in half literally and fall on top of another building.The cast in the third was the strongest, and it's mostly because of the small roles. While Shia LaBeouf actually disappointed a bit, the Megan Fox replacement (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) didn't do half-bad with the minimal material she was given. In the meantime, check out the talent in the small roles department: John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Ken Jeong, Leonard Nimoy, John Turturro, Patrick Dempsey (okay, so the last one might be pushing it, but he did well. Honest. Despite being a really...stupid character). Of course, the parents once again weren't in the movie enough (Kevin Dunn, Julie White) and pretty much disappear way before the climax.Here is where the ball is dropped: Transformers 3 is a pretty stupid movie. There is some heart, some soul maybe, but no smarts. Without spoiling too much, some of our characters (heroes and even villains) just make some dumbfounded moves and utterly questionable decisions that defy logic. And then, Michael Bay, once again, falters as a director. He does indeed have a knack for explosions and military-based scenes, but the robots fighting each other (yet again) are sometimes hard to distinguish. And then he does some very questionable things lake fading the screen to black far too many times (in one instance three times in a small scene that wasn't even necessary). I miss 90s Michael Bay, when he kept the action close and crisp, but never too close to a point of getting a headache. He got the carnage and destruction scenes right, but once the action picks up amongst those robots, it becomes a frustrating game of Where's Waldo.Bottom Line: Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the best of the three films, but that's still not saying too much as the direction is still shoddy, I still don't care about Shia LeBeouf's character, there is plenty of stupidity sprinkled throughout, and it still just doesn't have the quality factor of the better summer blockbusters we've seen over the decades. While the casting, writing, and special effects improved, we are still treated to strong potential not being met. The main villains (and coolest robots) are still idiotic and reduced to cameos, as Optimus Prime once again does his ""I am going to disappear for a while and then re-appear later to kick some arse"" routine. If you are a Transformer fan, you will probably appreciate this much more, as the transformers (while some reduced to cameos) visually look amazing, and the chaos they create is incredible on the big screen. But if you are looking for quality, you may want to peek elsewhere. For some mindless fun, look no further.And be happy that this is far better than Revenge of the Fallen.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Load, aim, shoot, crash, boom, explosion, repeat","Transformers: Dark of the Moon is loud, lucrative, cloying, and an ongoing headache of a film. Its structure consists of mindless action scenes with hundreds of explosions, stiff characters, and a neverending amount of screaming. It's easily one of the worst action films to come out of Hollywood in recent memory, and the worst Michael Bay film to come out in about a year.The story is convoluted and just a mess. In simple terms - the Autobots and the Decepticons are at war again, and for some reason, they decide to fight on Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive in Chicago.Shia LeBeouf is back playing Sam, who is still as idiotic and as loud as ever. Only this time, he has a new accomplice named Carly (Whiteley) who takes Megan Fox's place in the film. Together her and Sam face numerous explosions and somehow survive everyone of them. Because, you know, every girl sticks by some charming nerd who has a relationship with giant metal monstrosities. Not to mention remaining optimistic while they watch in awe as the robots turn Chicago into what appears to be the depths of hell.When people say they love the Transformers films I can't help but laugh, then correct them. They don't love the film. They love the explosions, the special effects, and the constant, mind-numbing action on screen. If these action sequences were cut up and put on the internet in little spurts and dubbed something totally different it would be the web series every twelve year old would be talking about. So, before you say you love Transformers: Dark of the Moon, stop and think - do you like the film or the special effects within the film? I bring this up because while Transformers: Dark of the Moon lacks a lot of hefty material that is required to make a good film, it completely shows the carelessness and idiocy of making a modern day action piece. Look at any good action film - Death Race 2000, Dirty Harry, Easy Rider, The Rookie, Speed, etc. What makes them all good besides their iconic leads? Character development, dialog, and worthy special effects that make up well crafted action scenes. Transformers, and I'm saying this to represent the entire franchise, lacks all but one of the categories.No matter how great the pyrotechnics, the explosions, or some of the scenes are, it gets incredibly aggravating to see pretty much the same thing for the course of two and a half hours. Not only is this just an incoherent mess, it's a mess that occupies so much more time than it needs to. It would be different if there was some narrative consistency rather than just explosion after explosion with a pounding, pretentious score playing at all times. If it followed a simple story, and worked from the ground up rather than settling for such a lazy style of film-making, the series might actually be more than just ""dumb fun."" One thing I could never wrap my brain around were the physics. I understand the whole genre is based off of someone's creative idea. In a cartoon, the idea of cars turning into a full-blown mechanical robot destroying everything in their paths is not only unique, but perfectly acceptable. For a cartoon of course. In a live action film, the idea is simply way too plausible to be accepted. The fun thing about cartoons is you know they could never happen. Having a live-action film made about the franchise, let alone three, just flat out ruins the point of Transformers overall - it could simply never happen.Certain scenes baffle me. For one - how can a robot jump, climb, wrestle, destroy, and blow up the same building and not having it collapse? How can another robot run on the side of a building without going straight through it or making it tilt? Also - how can Sam attach a grappling hook to a robot's eye while proceeding to be flung around like a piece of meat, crashing into concrete garages and buildings? With one hand only. Questions like these don't really get any other answer aside from ""just because."" Director Michael Bay has spent most of his directing years to making and producing horrible remarks and lackluster franchise re-imaginings. Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the poster child for why he shouldn't be in film, and why action films are quickly spiraling down to an all time low. The problem with Bay is he isn't creative or willing to pursue his own personal idea. The problem with this is the fact it suffers from no straight forward narrative, and relies on drawn out, cliché action scenes that, while well-crafted, go on for way too long of a time span.The final battle in Chicago, literally, is over an hour long. And it ends in the same cliché one would expect. If the battle was an hour long, and we were provided with a twist or something new I could see the reason for making it a certain length. But when you make us walk a long road to get somewhere and we get something we've seen before it just makes the whole trip useless and contrived.The moral of the story with Transformers: Dark of the Moon can be summed up, unlike the film itself, simply and effectively; quality over quantity.Starring: Shia LeBeouf, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Patrick Dempsey, and John Malkovich.

Personification of a Summer Popcorn Movie,"Not new news: Transformers DOTM is not the best movie ever, nor is it the best of the series, so far. The story is riddled with holes, the acting (from some people in particular) is passable, and it has more than its share of moments that make you think ""really?"".That said, this is a great summer action flick. Expect an entertaining, visually and audibly stimulating movie, and your expectations will be exceeded. For all its many, many faults, this Transformers movie is fun and thoroughly entertaining.It has some elements of the first two movies that contribute directly to the plot, but stands alone quite well. Not having seen the first two movies you would not be lost, although seeing the first two would give you a stronger appreciation for where the movie enters, character-wise. Transformers is long on action and short on making sense. Many times during the movie I caught myself wondering ""how did we get here?"". I believe this was the editing, which probably omitted many bridge elements of the story in favor of pacing and effect. Nonetheless, the actions sets are spectacular and, once again, found myself caught up in them cheering till the end.For 2 1/2 hours of escapism, entertainment, and eye candy (in all its forms) I rated it a 7.

Brilliant special effect - but what else?,"I was extremely disappointed with the latest Transformers movie. Granted, I didn't have much faith in it to begin with as the second one was also a major slope down from the first; however, I didn't think it would be this bad.OK, so the first thing I noticed was the mysterious disappearance of Megan Fox and the appearance of her replacement it seems Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, a British Victoria's Secret Model. Well, where did Megan Fox go?! The only explanation given is that she dumped Sam. There's no hint as to why, when, where etc. This really bothered me for some reason. I'm not a very big fan of Megan Fox but I felt that she played quite a large role in this franchise and I was disappointed that the producers messed with the flow of Transformers by replacing her. This was their first mistake.Secondly, if I'm perfectly honest I had no frickin' idea what the hay was going on for most of this movie. The first part was all about how sad Sam's life is and how he needs to get a grip, get a job and stop thinking about the decepticons. Whilst all the action is going on in this movie Sam and Carly's relationship unfolds and develops which is a bit distracting for the viewer as the story switches and merges plot lines. Sam is jealous of Carly's relationship with her new boss, a rich man (Patrick Dempsey), who buys her a car and then *shocker* her boss turns out to be in league with the Decepticons.There is a new bad guy: Sentinel Prime, who in my opinion just looks like a robotic ent. He was Optimus Primer's predecessor and was in charge of guarding the 'Pillars', but he secretly made a deal with Megatron and is now one of the bad guys. Using these Pillars the Decepticons want to set up a teleportation link bringing all the Decepticons to Earth, which has the resources they require. In my opinion this made the film look like a race between giant robots to find some sticks. Meanwhile, the Decepticons are murdering members of the US and Russian space missions to cover their traces, but of course, they're not very subtle about this. (Hint: man mysteriously flies out the window of a high storey building). The Decepticons threaten to wage war on Earth if the humans don't agree to exiling the Autobots, so of course, the humans pack off their only means of protection up in a space shuttle and shoot it into the sky. Then, after a bazillion fires, explosions, special effects, peace is restored - as expected.I don't know why but for some reason the only thing I could think of every time I saw Shia laBeouf was Even Stevens. I didn't feel this way during the other two movies so perhaps LaBeouf's acting had slipped back into old ways and he was reprising the role of Louis Stevens.What is quite cool is how they incorporate history into this movie by saying that the 'Space Race' of the Cold War between the USA and the USSR was caused because a Cybertronian spacecraft landed on the moon.Some people really liked this movie, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why. I guess the special effects are fantastic but it's effect is significantly lessened as there is no plot line to back it up. All in all I thought this movie was a bit of a mess. It lacked plot and detail that was needed and by the end of the movie I could see, hear and think was explosions, explosions, explosions. Thank god this is the last instalment so they can stop tarnishing the name Transformer oh wait that is what I would've said in 2011 but now we've got transformers age of extinction YAY!!!!

"Explosions, Explosions Everywhere","Perhaps it was JFK's grotesquely computer animated face, or the stupid trying-to-be-cool rip off title, or maybe it was the Buzz Aldrin and Bill O'Reilly cameos that did it for this reviewer. Whatever it was, the third installment of the Transformers series is obnoxious, bloated, and appallingly bad.Shia LaBeouf returns as the main character, this time shacking up with Rosie Huntington, who does nothing but stand in for Megan Fox. LaBeouf spends almost all of the first 30 minutes complaining about not being able to help save the world with the Autobots. Boo-hoo. Meanwhile, John Turturro plays Seymour Simmons, the other guy that was in the other two movies. Are we supposed to care about these people? In a film about giant robots? Regardless, director Michael Bay spends nearly an hour with the contrived plot and useless, unlikable characters. John Malcovich and Patrick Dempsey both have supporting roles in this film. Neither of them matter, yet Dempsey alone gets 10 minutes of screen time. The only logical explanation for this is that Michael Bay must have nothing but contempt for his audience.Rather than a movie, Transformers plays out like something used on Guantanamo Bay inmates when water-boarding doesn't work. The acting is bad, the story is incomprehensible, the robots are ugly, and the movie is 2 ½ hours long. Even the action scenes are impossible to figure out; Optimus Prime is literally left hanging for ten minutes, and the film cuts away when anything remotely important happens. Shia LaBeouf & co. are dangling from a falling building facing certain doom, when the film cuts to Optimus and Megatron fighting, but whenever someone looks like they might be the one who wins, the film cuts away—and with so many side plots, they don't return for what seems like ages. It's nearly impossible to tell the Autobots and Decepticons apart. They all have the same color schemes and cheesy one liners. ""Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican standoff here"". Give me a break.Michael Bay directs with the attention span of a hyperactive middle schooler. For the first hour the only thing he seems remotely interested in is Rosie Huntington's body; which is fine—for a while. And when the action finally starts, Bay can't make up his mind on where to be. Every cut seems like some main character is left facing impending doom. Not that Bay has made any effort for the audience to give a crap.The script lacks any forward thinking, trudging along at a gruelingly slow pace. Filled with stupid jokes, an insufferable romantic subplot, and jive talking robots, this screenplay is—dare I say it?—worse than the last one. The plot at points is ridiculously mundane. If this is a movie about giant alien robots, then why in God's name must there be a 5 minute montage of Shia Labeouf being interviewed for freaking jobs?!?The only saving grace of this abomination is Peter Cullen as the voice of Optimus Prime. He has a few good lines, but—just as in the other Transformers movies—he's not in it nearly enough. As a result, nothing works; the script doesn't work, the action doesn't work, Patrick Dempsey's pathetic attempts at acting assuredly don't work. Michael Bay throws every explosion he can at this movie, going so far as to completely destroy Chicago. His obnoxious direction consumes the movie, and the result is what happens when soulless Hollywood rears its ugly head.www.thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
this movie i mean.... it was OK,"i feel bad for giving this movie a 6, it deserves a 6.5 in my rating system. Its better told than the 2nd one, but aside from the effects and action sequences, well it sucks.I'm surprised that people like this better than transformers 2. my guess is that they hated the 2nd one so much that this could seem only better. Because this movie is not better than the second one, its just told in a better way (slightly).Im sorry if you re a united states citizen, but every movie that goes for the proud us flag waving in the back style of script fails, and fails in a big way. Bay movies are no masterpiece in my opinion, they are written for people who are very different than me and my kind of people.don't get me wrong i enjoyed the movie, but i knew what it was. The action scenes are awesome, like really awesome, specially the falling building scene and the final battle: the new bad guy fought off all the autobots like a MACHO, and he gets killed in the most pussy way. the dialog SUCKS, in the name of freedom we declare you the war?? damn that was bad. At least there is no mudflap and his brother who were awful in the second film.for me there were like 6 big plot holes and did i mention the dialog sucked? but the acting was not bad for me. another thing that bugged me, Malkovich, Mcdormand and Turturro are all major Coen brothers stars, are they friends with Bay or what?.i didn't hate the movie, the action was awesome and only that gave it the six points i gave it. i would like to give it more because i gave the previous movie a 7, but i will change the score of the previous film to 6 as well, because thats is the score the trilogy deserves.Bay should go on a mystical trip to other cultures and return to filmaking after at least 5 years, he should change his views because he is being toss aside of whats really cool nowadays",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A ""Marmite movie"", either you love it or hate it","The first Transformers movie was fun, silly but highly enjoyable. The second film was successful but critically panned as it turned the volume up to 11 and made no sense.Pre-release, director Michael Bay confirmed he had learned his lesson from episode 2. This third film was filmed from the ground up in 3D, we were told we would enjoy a decent story and a more mature structured film. All of the above, whilst retaining all the fun, explosions, soft and car porn a fourteen year old boy could want or at least wish to handle.Has he succeeded? The movie from a technical point of view is a tour de force. The 3D effects are fantastic, the set pieces colossal, see the previous 11 and raise you double. The CGI and animation on display is perhaps the finest and seamless we have ever seen at the cinema.How can it be then, that I would describe this as perhaps one of the worst films ever? The story begins with the Apollo moon landings, where it transpires the moonshot was about more than just going to the moon, the US needed to photograph and investigate a crashed Cybertronian ship. The remainder of the film revolves around huge fight scenes between the Decepticons (bad) and Autobots (good) led by Optimus Prime striving to prevent Cybertron being called to earth - very bad.This an interesting premise and the first twenty minutes hold together reasonably well following a lingering first shot which sets out the non-feminist agenda of the film. Sam (LeBeouf) is now with Carly (Victoria Secret underwear model - Huntington-Whiteley). Megan Fox leaving the series after she compared Michael Bay to Hitler, which will always dampen your career aspirations somewhat. Carly is gorgeous to look at and a large proportion of the film traces her sun kissed body and ogles her curves, at every and any opportunity.Can she act, no. However, for many this may be a moot point. LaBeouf also does nothing to dispel the illusion that he has yet to be involved in any movie where decent acting is actually required.The story then vaguely unfolds into, well it is difficult to tell, because from a thematic and structural point of view the film is a complete and utter mess. Each scene merely a very brief interlude or bridge to the next orgy of CGI created Robot on Robot fight scenes. Perhaps 80% of the films running time is used in this way, even reverting to a FPS (First Person Shooter) view at one point, confirming beyond all doubt, the continuing convergence between action movies and computer gaming.Interestingly the fighting is more brutal than ever, execution style sequences, ripping of robot body parts and spines, in slow motion with what appears to be blood on occasion. Quite why this would be the case is not explained.This is a short list of the talent on display, all of which without exception are wasted and on reflection may well be ashamed to have been part of the film. Stand up, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, John Turro, Patrick Dempsey and most sadly of all Buzz Aldrin, the only genuine character briefly on display.Ken Yeong of ""Hangover"" ""fame"" also appears in a bizarre sequence and yet again manages to confound as to why he is popular with audiences. The scene when ex-agent Simmons is reintroduced to the film appears to come from a different movie and jars to such an extreme, it is difficult to believe it was not intentional.Leonard Nimoy does a decent job of voicing the new character ""Sentinel"" but there really is no film of any substance to comment upon, just a string of CGI show reels, some appalling dialogue and misjudgements in taste. Quite how a shot reminiscent of the Challenger explosion was considered suitable is difficult to understand and a later tattered US flag waving moment, that even the staunchest of American redneck would blanch at.On this and recent evidence, Bay has to be one of the most technically savvy but shallow and incoherent directors working in modern cinema today. When compared with intelligent yet blockbusting cinema from Christopher Nolan, there is no comparison.SummaryTechnically and visually arresting but otherwise an appalling film, lacking any humanity, story or structure. A ""Marmite movie"", either you love it or hate it One star for the CGI and animation alone, one for the film.Not recommendedhttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3D Pre-Screening Review,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon was a really great film, and so far my favorite out of the three made so far. This is also the first film I watched in real D 3D and I was very impressed, there were some moments when the 3D became a headache because the scenes were so flashy and switched so fast my eyes/brain couldn't comprehend it, otherwise I believe the story line was outstanding, and they really do a good job of making the Transformers films seem like a true series line by mentioning events from the previous films. The humor was really great, I laughed a lot during this film, and I loved that I really felt in the action while watching this in 3D. This movie was like 3 hours but It is well worth watching. I would recommend this to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It might not be a work of art but it's fun and thats all that should expected in the first place.,"Transformers has never been a series about good story or good acting. It's about having too many explosions, stupid jokes, the hottest girls I've ever seen bending over the nicest cars I've ever seen, and robots killing each other.To think that it's anything other a fun movie is expecting too much and when the movie is 2 1/2 hours long you'll have a bad time if you're not going to overlook the fact that it's not the next Shawshank Redemption. Michael Bay is a director who people go to expecting explosions and action. In Transformers 3, you got it.However, the fact that it's a very long movie does give it some downsides. The real action doesn't start until the second half of the movie following a real exciting twist. One of my friends even started crying at it. The second half though is without a doubt one of the coolest movie scenes I've seen in a couple years. I went with my girlfriend and we were talking about it with her dad and we suggested going into it half way through the movie if he wouldn't have the patience for the slow beginning. I thought they were going to end the movie at the twist at first and make it the sequel as the second half would've been a great movie on it's own.Similarly the story is all over the place, I would suggest not paying too much attention to it as it wasn't very good, only complex and confusing. It's slow and mysterious at first and until the action picks up not a lot happens.Give the movie your attention long enough to get to the second half and you'll see some amazing robot fighting action that's way cooler than anything I could've done with those cool toys. It's fun, it's cool, it's stupid. Don't let the fact that it isn't a perfect movie ruin the action. I would suggest seeing it in theater; it's just a great time.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Could have been worse!,"After the box office success and almost critically panned Transformers film that was REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, that was released in 2009, Paramount Pictures announced that they would be releasing future films in the Transformers saga.The third film was titled DARK OF THE MOON and the film was released in the summer movie season of 2011. The film was the last film to have Shia LaBeouf in the film as Sam Witwicky and the end of the original trilogy of films.The film is set three years after the events of the 2009 film, with the Autobots, during the collaboration with the NEST (Networked Elements: Supporters and Transformers) military force, discovering a hidden alien technology in possession of humans, which had been found by Apollo 11 on the years earlier. However, the Decepticons unveil a plan use the technology to enslave humanity in order to restore Cybertron, the home planet of the Transformers.The story was a really good story and it took inspiration from a novel called Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday, written by Alan Dean Foster. The novel was a prequel to the 2007 film, TRANSFORMERS. Due to the critically panned REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, the Twins were cut out of ""Dark of the Moon"".The acting is just amazing, but can get dreadful. Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky one last time and he does a great job. Megan Fox was originally signed on to play Mikaela Banes in the third film, and Patrick Dempsey's character Dylan Gould was to be the employer of Fox's character, but she was fired, instead Victoria Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley plays Carly Spencer and she does a great job.She is not as good as Fox but considering the shoes that she had to fill, she could have been a hell of a lot worse. Josh Duhamel, Kevin Dunn, Julie White and the rest of the cast are great in their performances, especially Tyrese Gibson, who was also in another 2011 film, Fast Five, which I previously reviewed.The CGI is amazing and the action is so fantastic in this film and the best part is at the end of the film, and it was so long but I enjoyed it and the film is 154 minute long feature film.The music by Steve Jablonsky is fantastic and much more cool and amazing was Linkin Park's song at the end of this movie.Overall, TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON is not the best Transformers film, but it could have been worse.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Last but not the least,Third part in transformers trilogy what i have expected full of action and good camera work and heavy special effects once again Mr. Michael Bay proved it that he is the Master of Modern Epic Action Science Fiction Films.I am glad he used very heavy and high definition cameras. Transformers Trilogy is feast for my eyes and action pack trilogy very rare and unique script and direction and composer Steve jablonsky has done a great job.It shows that sometimes truth and humanity does not come easily we have to be active and full of action.I have seen all the films directed by Mr Michael Bay and he is my favorite director and it is the first film of Mr Micheal Bay to exceed 1 billion it is the most appreciated film according to fans all around the world.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
If You Like Chewing Bubblegum This Is For You,"Okay, right, the plot is confusing. Okay, right, the acting doesn't amount to more than some screaming and yelling and macho poses. Okay, the most absurd casting in the history of film was made by putting British supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in the role of the main lead and love interest. She slides down collapsing buildings, runs though explosions with shrapnel flying everywhere, crawls through burning pits of smoky ash, and doesn't so much as smudge her white sweater or show a single emotion besides sticking out her big pouty lips and speaking a few lines as if lobotomized. But besides all of this, Transformers 3 is pure bubblegum, two and a half hours of explosions and robot violence with at least an hour of Chicago getting attacked that rivals the destruction in any other movie. What do you expect from yet another sequel to a movie based on Hasbro toys? Clint Eastwood giving Meryl Streep a bouquet of fleshly picked flowers? If you want action and over the top special effects this movie is top notch, but if you expect anything else, why go see a movie called Transformers 3 in the first place?

Does Michael Bay really think he can beat Avatar with this?,"I watched this with my sister and as much as we love and connected with the 1st film, this one is just... BLANK. It was all CGI which we've already seen before. Story was a disappointment. Rosie should just stick to modeling with her injected lips. As expected she wasn't able to capture and leave a mark with the viewers like Megan Fox did with the first two films. It was a major mistake Michael Bay let Megan Fox go.As you guys may have noticed Megan Fox's name is continuously brought up when Transformers is being featured on shows like E. Usually you don't bring up an actress who has been FIRED already. Now, why is that? I guess they're hoping bringing up Megan Fox's name will help with the box office numbers.Also I've noticed that Bay often compare Transformers 3 with Avatar. PLEASE! Does Michael Bay really think he can beat Avatar with this? If you're a teenage boy with passion for robots and doesn't care about the story or soul of the movie, you MIGHT enjoy this. But if you're someone HOPING THIS WOULD BE A BETTER MOVIE THAN THE 2ND ONE, forget it. It's as bad as people have feared.I am impressed with how much advertising they've spent. I'm telling you Transformers 3 is ALL HYPE. Don't be swayed by the movie being featured daily on TV shows. It's all marketing. They make it seem like this one is going to be sooooo epic but it's not. Especially with the absence of Megan Fox. To think I'm even a girl! One of the reasons the 2nd movie is bearable is because of the presence of Megan Fox and now that she's gone, this 3rd installment is just UNBEARABLE replaced with a girl with injected lips.Transformers 3 DID NOT DELIVER.

This movie isn't called MEGAN FOX: Dark of the Moon...It's called TRANSFORMERS: Dark of the moon and it's absolutely amazing!!!,"Firstly i'd like to say, to all the people who're like ""Megan fox should be in it for it to be good""....NO!!! Megan fox was a delight to be in the movies, but these movies aren't just about 'Megan fox'. Yeah she's stunning' and she had a good connection to Sam in the films, but come on people, the Transformers movie's aren't romance types of films, they're summer blockbusters, action, drama, maybe a little bit of romance in there. But all together, when people go to see these movies, they don't just look for 'Megan fox'...they come to see these movies to be entertained. And secondly i'd read some reviews from people, and they're taking a dislike to the new girl Rosie-Huntington Whiteley. Tbh from a girl who's never had any acting experience in her life, she did a darn good job as Carly. Maybe she didn't connect with Sam as much as what Megan fox. But the connection between the two was still there. I think she played the part very well, there was a couple of flaws that i picked up on within her performance, but overall i thought she did pretty well.And now to talk about the film...I had concerns about this movie when Michael Bay first announced he was making the movie, because he didn't really deliver with the second film. But as the first plot lines came through over the web, i began to think ""maybe Michael could pull this off after all"" and then the teaser trailer came out and i thought ""hmmm...this could be a good summer movie"" and then when the theatrical trailer came out i was astonished and amazed and how well this movie looked. And so i went to see it at an advance screening in IMAX 3D at the odeon cinema in new york while i was out there. And after 2 and a half hours of sitting in the cinema watching this movie, i came out thinking ""WOW, Michael Bay deserves a round of applause, A REALLY BIG round of applause"" in fact i think this movie will be up there challenging for best action-invasion movie ever created! This movie was superb..i mean the action was top notch, went at a steady pace so everyone in the cinema could keep up. The drama in the film was intense and i think Michael Bay finished off the trilogy amazingly well. People who are fans of the movie's will really, really enjoy this movie. And for people who think this movie is garbage, then you must be very strict in what you want to see in a movie. 10/10 This summer isn't just about Harry Potter, Transformers dark of the moon will be up there with it.

... And Another Banger,"I like Dark of the Moon more than the original but less than Revenge of the Fallen. It's a shame that Megan Fox didn't appear, as I was not a fan of Carly (she slowly grew on me). Tyrese Gibson returned (with more screen time), giving me somebody to root for as I'm a fan of Fast & Furious.Dark of the Moon is a movie of betrayal as trust keeps getting misplaced. As expected, the graphics are second-to-none and the scale of the action scenes were somehow increased. The Transformers franchise continues to come up with new stuff to keep audiences engaged and managing to keep things fresh.It's a shame that this is Shia LaBeouf's last Transformers movie but a wise decision considering that audiences would be slightly turned off at how many times Sam Witwicky continues to perform. If you've seen the first two Transformers films, it's a given that you're going to like Dark of the Moon.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The AutoBots finally fall flat,"Hardly as entertaining as the first two films, nor as well written- Transformers Dark of the Moon starts a decline in quality for the Transformers franchise- relying more on big budgeted special effects than story. Believe it or not, I actually did enjoy the first two Transformers films. Yes they do have their problems, and 2 can even be a bit problematic, but they were both very entertaining films with awesome action scenes- and most importantly- a rather interesting story to tell. Transformers Dark of the Moon has the beginning of a good Transformers story but gets lost in its concept throughout and eventually just becomes a bit of a bore. It's attempts and themes of connecting to real life conspiracies feels all too forced and odd to be any fun, and its story feels bland and formulaic- typical and full of tropes that really brought the film down in levels of impact. There are a few good fight scenes towards the end, but the CGI isn't as amazing as some may claim. Yes at times it can look fantastic, and even has similar effects and plotlines the Avengers films seemed to have copied off of- but sometimes the physics of the characters on screen and how they move and walk about with no friction or fuss or shaking around them just really annoyed me here- and was never as distracting or blatant as it had been in the films before it. Not to mention, the really generic look of one of my favorite characters- Soundwave. The acting was also a bit over the top, and honestly I really missed Megan Fox in this one. When Tyreese is the best actor you have in a film, you know it's bound to have some problems, and new coming actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has almost no charisma on screen whatsoever and serves only as an obvious replacement of Fox's character. Even the music feels more drab here, and despite some cool moments and looks, the overall tone of the film falls from its darkness into just dull territory. In the end, Transformers Dark of the Moon was a major disappointment. It has its fun moments, but it's ultimately too shallow and too underdone to be anything but a lackluster sequel.My Rating: 4.2/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent action movie without a human touch,"I had a lot of expectations from DOTM right from the moment I saw the first trailer. The media hype about a dark story, technically pronounced action sequences, toned-down comedy and last but not the least '3D' were driving me crazy to go watch the movie. Well I did, and here are my opinions. The action sequences have defined DOTM to be the benchmark for all future action movies aiming to blast the audience in 3D format. Michael Bay has once again proved that there is no one to parallel him in orchestrating explosive shots deftly. The story elements embedded with amazing special effects work as constructive blocks in the able hands of Bay, building up to an explosive hour long climatic sequence that should end Bay's take on the saga. But...I feel that the story was a bit of a let down. The first movie was a fresh artistic piece that made me look up in awe. The second movie was just a mix of better action with not so good a story, yet a good take for an intermediate episode. But in both those movies, the human characters, especially Sam, were at least 70% instrumental in moving the story forward. Unfortunately in DOTM, I found Sam to be less integral while many characters who were important in the past two movies ended up playing near-insignificant roles except for some comic bits or command- center style dialog. If you think the robots filled the gap, well, I don't exactly think so as it is a simple autobot vs decepticon plot with more numbers on either side bombing each other, and hence more focus on action. So in all... 3D 'wow', story 'so-so', experience 'worth it'. If you want the action, go get it as you don't want to miss it on the big screen. Else if other elements are important to you as the action is, you might be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Will give you a headache,"I sometimes have the pleasure of babysitting my Grandkids, and my 4 year old grandson absolutely delights in throwing his toy cars and trucks off of the second floor landing and seeing them burst apart. He then collects and plays with the pieces, sometimes breaking them even more. This movie is like that. It's like the little boys who used to play with the transformer cars when they were little got older and now they're still playing with them through the manipulations of cameras and computers.This film does exhibit all of the usual modern computer generated effects. The locations are widely separated with nothing being too spectacular in that regard. The costuming is simple as are the props (except the computer stuff of course). The sets are, well, hard to judge because you can't really believe they're not primarily computer generated effects. I think the problem is they keep trying to do bigger and bigger special effects and at some point it almost gets boring from being so uniformly explosive and overwhelmingly unreal. I'll invent yet another new term here to cover it: ""Action Movie Desensitization"". One can't believe that these types of films are not solely aimed at the average 12 year old out of school for the summer. There's little else in the theaters.The film also requires an immense degree of the ability to suspend one's disbelief to begin to watch it. The plot is as thin and makes about as much logical sense as a 1930's comic book plot, but it's there if you want to try to follow it. If you saw any of the preceding ""Transformer""-type films you could likely write a better plot yourself; so just substitute your own plot in your head as the explosions unfold (NOTE to writers; a college graduate usually isn't a ""teenager"").That leaves the acting. The principle characters do yeoman service for their paychecks. Several previous denizens of Transformerville return to reprise their former roles with Shia La Beouf straining his best to out-panic and out-sweat his previous filmic efforts. He does so well, along with John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Patrick Dempsey and Alan Tudyk. The always watchable Frances McDormand comes on strong as a bad-womanesque government wienie. She was cool being bad. John Malkovich provided a great characterization as La Beouf's mildly-insane, oddball boss. He and McDormand are likely the best things in the film, BUT, there was a truly kinetic, unhinged, off-the wall performance by the increasingly popular Ken Jeong. Watch for him, he's a riot.The odd addition is ""the girl""- there's always a girl. In this case the very publicized Megan Fox from the former films was unceremoniously replaced for little understood insults to the hands that fed her. Such is life. But, Fox's bad luck provided all the excuse necessary to replace her with a younger model, literally. In this instance ""the girl"" is ""unconventionally beautiful"" 24 year-old British farm girl/model named Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Whitely's previous claim to fame, it seems, is the talent to look decent while walking around in public places in her underwear, which, of course, brought her to the attention of these film makers, so, at this point in her career I imagine her strategy has worked out rather well. She's not terrible in the film so at least she doesn't embarrass herself. However, skimpier costuming may have brought in a few dozen more teenage boys.I couldn't help but note that every time Whitely appeared on camera, or in some cases even close-by off-camera, the script became peppered with some rather obvious and sophomoric sexual innuendos and double-entendres accompanied by some rather epic leering. The most blatant one early on coming from someone commenting on the container La Beouf's medal came in. And, please, no one spoil it for me by claiming it was unintentional. I, at least, wanted to give the writer credit for getting away with some originality.Another thing one can't help but notice the height disparity between the two leads, La Beouf and Whitely. I checked and he lists his height in his bio as an entire quarter of an inch taller than her's states. There seems to be different people playing La Beouf as his height seems to change up and down by four inches or more throughout the film. Some of that can be explained by her footwear, but not all of it. One may wonder why I mention that? I mention it because I was so disinterested in the ""action"" on screen that I was looking for other things to find interest in on screen. Still, I have to give credit for any shorter guy willing to undertake scaling mount Whitely. It must have been very fun for him.In the long run, I would have much preferred it had they cast a ""real"" young actress in the role instead of a model. There are a number of good ones to choose from. For example, Blake Lively (barely shorter), pixieish Ellen Page, Hilary Duff (Oooo, she can even resemble a tough girl), Kay or DaniellePanabaker (or maybe both of them, they're small), Hayden Panettiere, Mia Wasikowska (shorter than whazziz name), Aly Michalka (barely shorter), Emma Roberts (who is charmingly shorter than that Witwicky guy), Amanda Michalka (also shorter) and, my personal favorite nominee, Emma Stone (also shorter). See how easy it is? In conclusion, I will posit that the theater was uncommonly packed, the most I'd ever seen on a weekday performance, and the audience uniformly seemed to like the film a lot. So, I guess that means that they will make a lot of money which, in turn, will likely generate yet another sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Sets the tone for 2010's blockbusters,"Michael Bay's Transformers films typically come under fire for being the absolute nadir of American film, the worst example of Hollywood's artless tendencies. It's all a bit exaggerated, since I see little reason for the critical acclaim piled onto later CGI-action blockbusters of the superhero variety. Bay sticks to his vision, his personality, all of which oozes out of every frame of this film for better or for worse, and with Dark of the Moon he basically synthesizes all the trends that would come to define Hollywood films throughout the decade.DOTM is a different type of film than the previous two Transformers films, which were very much products of the mid-2000s. Gone is the shaky-cam, War-on-Terror military aesthetic, replaced by a slick, detached-from-reality sci-fi tone. Gone are the messy Roland Emmerich-esque subplots, which have been cleaned up into a slightly more linear and focused format. The effects sequences are dialed up to 11, going to places the previous films probably couldn't reach due to budgetary reasons. The final battle is a massive boondoggle of Bayhem, so large scaled it overwhelms the film. The tawdry, 'edgy' humor has been dialed down. It attempts 'dark' themes while staying at an essentially juvenile level.If all this sounds familiar, it's because it all fits with the evolution of Hollywood films from the 2000s to the 2010s; Bay was way ahead of the times, or maybe he defined them. Even current Marvel films (along with old ones like the first Avengers) seem to owe something to DOTM since they all steal from its structure, its tone.That's part of why I'm more forgiving of this film, it certainly has the personal stamp of its creator and already has caught enough flack. Avengers films are TV productions of corporate blandness, yet they seem to get higher Rotten Tomatoes scores than most Oscar nominees. Why is this? They lack the kinetic force of Bay, while being equally brainless and simplistic. Both Bay's films and modern blockbusters indulge in bathetic, cringy 'comic relief'. (Bay's humor is overall worse, but at least he's not trying to 'cleverly' mock the conventions of his own sci-fi world). All of them are somehow able to ensnare some of the most talented actors Hollywood has to offer.Another thing: DOTM is actually better than its over-budgeted descendants in some ways. Steve Jablonsky's soundtrack is glorious, among the best of the decade. For all his faults Bay still sticks mainly to practical effects, so there's a realness to his action that Disney's films haven't really achieved. If you want to enjoy an overpriced, bloated, maximalist blockbuster to rest your brain, (we can't live off foreign films alone) this will probably leave you satisfied.To sum it all up, perhaps it's better to be an over-hated film than an over-praised one.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Same as the previous two,"I grew up on Transformers, and this movie was quite mediocre as the previous two. The action is great and well executed, but it's still lacking focus on the transformers - which are more interesting than the human story. The boy's story is boring and uninteresting, and the new girl is clearly here to shut up and look beautiful. I personally don't like Rosie, her face is filled with too much silicon.I'd still recommend watching it in the theaters - it's a fun action packed film. It's just too bad Michael Bay makes us watch boring and ridiculous stories about the humans. And no, I don't care about the chick in the film. This isn't James Bond, Michael.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So incredibly boring,"For so much going on, it has no heart, no interest, and no sense of urgency. It's the same material at this point and not even remotely trying to be interesting or engaging at this point.

That final battle was absolutely phenomenal!,"Similar to the first two live-action Transformers movies, I watched this movie in the theater and I really enjoyed it. Now as an adult, I still really enjoy this movie while also noticing a lot of problems.Positives for Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011):
I appreciate that this movie has the Decepticons launch a full-scale invasion on Earth as they try to resurrect Cybertron. Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro and Tyrese Gibson are pretty good as the returning human characters in this movie. I also liked the additions of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Patrick Dempsey in this movie. The Autobots and Decepticons are still very good in this movie. I really enjoyed Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime and he is a much better villain than The Fallen from the last movie. And finally, the final battle between the Autobots and Decepticons in Chicago is one of the most epic final battles in cinematic history.Negatives for Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011):
The first half of this movie is an absolute drag to get through as it features all of the traditional Michael Bay cliches. Thankfully, when Sentinel Prime turns heel, the movie becomes a lot better in the second half. And finally, I hate the fact that this wasn't the last live-action Transformers movie because this was the appropriate way to end the series, but Michael Bay and Paramount Pictures decide to make two more of these movies.Overall, Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) is another good Transformers movie after the disaster that was Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) and the series should've ended here, unfortunately that's not how things went down.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
this movie is something else,"Michael Bay has more holes in his movies then you can possible imagine, i like detail, thats the way i am i just like stuff that makes sense as it follows its story line. every Michael Bay movie has big holes and the holes just get bigger. enough of that this is a FUN movie, lots of action, some drama and laughs. that girl who replaced Megan Fox is nice but i would of kept fox or gotten someone who could act. Megan would of been so much better for this film. over all its a good movie it surprised me and i think i want to see it again really soon. its actually one of the better films i seen this year. watch it, enjoy it and have fun. i hope they make a lot more of these",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I wish I walked out sooner.,"I saw this movie last night & I came to one conclusion ... This movie sucked so bad they tried to save it by making it 3D! I was annoyed by the first 2 minutes of the movie & thought well hang on I'll give it the benefit of the doubt & give it more of a chance. 30 minutes in still disappointed. Then, less than half way through the movie I was wondering why I was still sitting in my seat. Being as I was with 2 other people I respected their wishes to stay & tried to get comfy enough to sleep off the rest of the film.You would think after the last 2 movies they would have a budget big enough to have a better story line & less Team America!To be honest I'd rather just forget I was ever there.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
great movie! great music! great effects! Mostly great Acting!,"I was never a huge transformers fan, but having just seen the first one and loving it and then watching the second and being utterly confused and unimpressed i was a bit skeptical about watching the last of the three. I went anyway and was utterly blown away. I have read some of the reviews on this website and find that this movie did not live up to the standard of those who are fans of the original transformer movies. I was never a huge fan so for me this movie was great. I would firstly like to point out the greatness of the soundtrack in this movie. Its mind blowing and makes the action and drama scenes much more intense. It fits in so perfectly as well. This is something that has not been touched upon by reviewers, and i personally think was missed by most people. ITS AMAZING. Secondly, visual effects, of course! thats an obvious one, but one that should be mentioned anyway for its greatness! Sure, we wont be talking about these visual effects in 20-30 years time, but right now, this is one of the best i have ever seen and i was truly amazed. Thirdly, Shia's acting, you may judge me on this, but i think it was his best from all three, and his comedy was spot on and hilarious! As for the whole story and plot, i think its based on opinion, i thoroughly enjoyed it and thought it was carried out very nicely. Not the strongest part of the film of course, but not low enough for me to score a 1/10, definitely now. The only thing i would downgrade this movie for is the poor acting of rosie (Carly) but for me Patrick Dempsey, Shia LaBoeuf and Josh Duhamel all receive a 10/10. Im not sure if this review makes any sense because this is just me rambling after seeing so many negative reviews! Don't hate me, but i LOVED this movie! i would pay to watch it again! Best out of the three for me!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Nutshell Review: Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"Some things never change in a Michael Bay film, and one enters his world knowing fully well what to expect, no matter what he's directing. Granted the army is back in full force once again, as are various quasi-government agencies, but toned down are the tremendous recruitment ra-ra moments that defined Revenge of the Fallen, although you can't help but to chuckle at how Bay is determined to show us the perfect US-led world with the Autobots now being at the beck and call of the American military to take out rogue nations and groups that pursue unsanctioned nuclear ambition. Well if you can't do it in real life, do it in film in time for a 4th of July salute, can't you?Then there's the token female characters, one babe in Rose Huntington-Whiteley's Brit bombshell Carly taking over the fired Megan Fox whose character in the previous two movies got written off through no less than two mentions that she had dumped Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky with many characters exalting Carly's ""great"" qualities, and the other the brainier Mearing of NSA played by Frances McDormand looking really frumpy. In Bay's universe, hot babes get to drive sleek sports cars and pout incessantly, and in what would be a laughable moment, have enough charms to casually chat with one of the main villains in the show reminding him that he should be vicious, when the villain should have just swatted her away like an insect.But there are some plus points to amuse a Transformers fan. For instance, the much loved Laserbeak gets featured here in its nasty glory, being one heck of a powerful opponent with espionage its main weapon in orchestrating much of the Decepticon web of deceit, though its combination with Soundwave was one scene too little. Then there's Shockwave looking too up to date save for his cyclops eye and owning a gigantic pet worm that you see in the trailer, and Optimus Prime finally having his trailer put to good use in more than one battle sequence. Yes, it is up to these little things that keeps things interesting for fans and the casual viewer, but that's about it, as the big bang finale treaded on familiar ground covered in recent science fiction films such as Battle: Los Angeles - this one becoming Battle: Chicago - and Skyline with its alien invasion theme with alien planes peppering the sky, and aliens flexing their superior firepower with reducing masses of humans into ash.Effort has been put into resisting the temptation to have too many robots show up on screen pulverizing each other in close combat, and having Bay's slow motion to show off some cool stunts involving humans and robots (Bumblebee seems to be the favourite to have to slow down), but for all the loud, mind numbing and eardrum busting action going all around during the action sequences, there's this distinct lack of villainy in the movie, with action sequences being overly long and losing their impact and focus.We get tons of faceless and nameless Decepticons yet again, with plenty of action in the huge finale focused on the humans and the soldiers/mercenaries, but little on the robots. I mean, if Optimus Prime can be temporarily forgotten since he's stuck in a bunch of wires dangling upside down from some broken building, something is wrong.There are also supporting characters galore, some returning from the previous film such as John Turturro's Simmons, now a multi-millionaire thanks to his best selling book, and the likes of military men Lennox (Josh Duhamel) now made Colonel, and Tyrese Gibson's Epps, and new ones with John Malkovich and Ken Jeong in minor roles, with Patrick Dempsey's Dylan being written in to be in stark contrast to Sam Witwicky as humans who share similar robot-related ancestry, but it doesn't matter since no acting chops are required to star in this film, only the willingness to spout incredibly bad lines, and look cool/nerdy. What Buzz Aldrin (the real Buzz Aldrin) is doing in this film, is something of a mystery in itself too, other than to lend some gravitas to the created back story on the space race.The IMAX 3D presentation wasn't all that impressive given the trumpeting of using technology that gave rise to Avatar, and felt for the most parts a 2D film instead, since most of the action sequences were converted to 3D in post. So you just might want to save money on this and go for a digital presentation which will suffice. Will this be the final Transformers film? I suppose the millions in revenue will make it hard for the studio to say no, but whether Bay will be back for another round, well it's anyone's guess. At least this installment was more entertaining than the previous one, but it still doesn't offer much and is at risk of running stale. There's only so much that the robots can do on Earth that we haven't already seen before in 3 movies.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Absolutely Amazing SF/High Def Adventure,"For those ""critics"" that can only see one star for this amazing film, I would suggest trying to let your imagination go free and try to realize that this is ""escapism""......don't over rationalize the physics or the reality.........The film is a marvel of Special Effects....To the casual film-goer, simply watch it to be amazed by the advances in effects. Yes the film has some rather stale acting, and some lame humor - but the story lends itself well to the trilogy.....It is a well-spent 2+ hours of high definition adventure....

"This Transformers has less jabs, more hooks and uppercuts","The third Transformers movie has some of the best action visuals ever filmed and were plenty exciting in 2D.During the ""Invasion of Chicago"", there are many CGI ships flying around downtown. The alien crafts resemble those in earlier movies this year like Skyline and Battle Los Angeles. There are spectacular aerial views of the combat and mayhem. The sweeping panoramic views of Lake Michigan and the Chicago Skyline with soldiers jumping out of helicopters and buildings set to a drum pounding score were comparable to some of the action scenes in the Dark Knight.The story begins with a new interpretation of the first man on the moon mission and makes an immediate impression. The scope of this film is immense as there is action on the moon, White House, Lincoln Memorial, Downtown Chicago and what appears to be a replica of Chernobyl.THE HUMANS (AMERICANS):Sam (Shia LaBeouf) wants to be taken seriously and succeeds by shouting in our ears most of the time. Maybe he was trying to be heard over the non-stop music and action. Col. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) shouts a lot as well. Sam's new love interest Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is there to be the damsel in distress. Although her accent is out of place, Director Michael Bay does a fine job showcasing her beauty utilizing a variety of wardrobes and backdrops. Tyrese Gibson is featured prominently in the action scenes along with Lester Speight (of Office Linebacker Terry Tate fame). The soldiers seemed to have a greater role in the outcome of this film rather than the previous two.There are frequent attempts at comic relief from both the robots and the humans, most of which are not funny but at least are entertaining. For the characters that we already know from the first two films, we get more of the same. Sam's parents are less obnoxious this time (Kevin Dunn, Julie White) as is Seymour Simmons (John Turturro). But many of the new characters (played by some veteran actors) were there to ham things up. I don't think any of these guys were necessarily bad, as they succeeded in keeping us occupied until the battles took place.THE ROBOTS:In one corner we have The Decepticons who are tough foes once again, this time their heavy hitter is a gigantic snake-like robot that rips through buildings and streets. ""Spock"" does the voice of the powerful turncoat robot Sentinel Prime whose arm is like a sword and the beat-up looking Megatron is back to manipulate and scheme.And for the reigning heavyweight champ Autobots, Optimus Prime reprises his role as the robot Rambo who comes in only for the final stages of the battles after his mates take their abuse.Overall, this one was a little more entertaining then Revenge of the Fallen.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Dark side of the moon,"I thought Transformers (2007) was fine for what it was and thought it was at least entertaining to watch. The first movie was better than Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) in how it was put together.Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) was a improvement since the second movie, but I still think it is bad. It has good scenes but it has issues.The acting from Shia LaBeouf has improved since the first and second movie, but he is given silly lines and a lot of yelling lines. I don't blame him for it though.The Transformers scenes are cool and over the top, but it takes a while just to get to a full on fight with them. The 3rd act is when it gets entertaining.The action scenes can at times look good but can also be hard to see. I didn't find most of the movie annoying, because they got rid of the problems of the last movie.The 1st act of the movie is slow and the 2nd act can drag a bit, but it becomes fun to watch in the 3rd act final battle. I think I could watch this more than the second movie.I hated Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009). I still think the first movie was better.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I found this film to be extremely boring,"Despite the continuous action, destruction and battles, I found this film to be extremely boring, and the final battle, which claimed the last hour of the film was far too long and drawn out and it greatly prevented me from appreciating the visual spectacle that is the final battle as it's so long it becomes tedious and I couldn't wait for it to end.The extensive use of cgi action scenes was what ruined the film for me, and although I never fully agree with the typical view that modern films have too much cgi and effects and not enough good story, this film certainly presented a convincing case that the above statement is true. As there is so much shooting, exploding and fighting in this film there is relatively little time for dialogue, which was largely, poorly written, and full of clichés.Finally, I didn't rate the casting of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley or her performance. She has clearly been chosen for the role for her good looks and her great sex appeal although I think she shines brighter as an underwear model than blockbuster film actress. Also, It seems unbelievable to me that Shia LaBeouf's character, although not a bad looking guy, has been in relationships with 2 characters played by women who have both topped the annual FHM 100 sexiest women in the world poll. Rosie has clearly been cast to attract more male viewers, bring sex appeal that the film didn't really need and throughout struck me as being far out of Shia's league.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Filled with clichés and dragging at times yet fun to watch,"I watched this movie in 3D, which I suggest to avoid and save the extra couple dollars. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty sweet, but it's such a long movie that after your eyes adjust to the 3D you kind of forget about it. There are few scenes worth watching in 3D anyway and most of the biggest explosions can hardly be seen in 3D.Now about the movie. It was freaking awesome! I've been reading some of the negative reviews and I just have to laugh at them. Those guys are so right about the movie yet they missed the point. One guy wrote a review and didn't even watch the whole thing! Oh well, all I have to say is that if it weren't for the Autobots I would have walked out as  well. Yet, I knew better. This movie was never meant to win any awards that has to do with screenplay, acting, or directing. I mean it was done in two years. Two years! That's not enough time to write something crafty without some concrete background like a book. I mean I'm sorry, but I don't think the cartoons count. Especially with the special effects and everything. Just not enough time at all.No, Michael Bay doesn't know structure in a movie. He doesn't even do transition within a scene very well either! Yet he knows one thing: how to make a movie exciting. And since this movie was done in only two years I give it a positive rating. Yeah I noticed all the clichés and the dragging storyline about the humans. Bay pays too little time on the Autobots and Decepticons at the beginning that I just felt like it was starting to become Witwicky's story, which is understandable, but something I didn't like all that much. Michael Bay seemed to misunderstand the type of story some fans wanted to see. Yet, despite all that I couldn't help but feel entertained at the end. That's because Michael Bay understands that the majority of fan goers aren't going to watch this movie expecting a grand Oscar worthy type movie. They are going to watch it to escape. To watch a little fantasy that is completely unrealistic but enjoyable. Remember what happened with Pirates 4? Yeah I felt like the story improved, somewhat, but the excitement and the overblown action was gone. That wasn't fun.Yes, this movie was filled with clichés. I rolled my eyes a couple of times, but I didn't care at the end. What is not cliché about this movie is the different take Michael Bay gives us this time. After the excitement, but at times lame writing, of the first movie and the awful, yet at times entertaining, second movie I was hoping for something like Dark of the Moon. I never felt, for one second, that Michael Bay should abandon his formula. It works and it's exciting. All I asked for was a bit more seriousness and no more goofy jokes that the second movie was filled with. At the beginning I felt excitement, followed by some anxiety as the movie seemed to drag for minutes at a time, kind of like driving a car through traffic (I know, cliché, but it's the best thing to describe it), then finishing with an awe of excitement that even topped the first movie. The movie takes itself more seriously, yet there are plenty of clever laughs throughout, and yes a few goofy ones along the way as well as some unintentional ones, but those parts don't negate the fact that when you double-cross Optimus you pay. I highly recommend watching the movie. I don't understand critics and the people who say ""it's a wonderful spectacle, but I'm giving it a few stars because ..."" of whatever reason. They don't understand that Bay has not failed. These movies are so extremely successful for one reason: it's exciting to watch the Autobots fight the Decepticons. What would make it more exciting would be getting rid of a human lead and just focus on the ""robots in disguise"" and to keep the seriousness and lighthearted humor. Until then enjoy this movie. ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a summer movie after all, whether just saying that is cliché or not. It's one spectacular movie to watch. My advice: go watch it and just have some fun, which you will.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Transformers Dark Of The Moon Is a Great Film,"First off i just wanna say that when this film came out. I saw it in theaters with my Dad and it was just awesome. It topped other movies like Harry Potter and also Iron Man off and was an awesome film about robots which i really enjoyed and i pretty much am now a Transformers fan.The thing that i liked in this film is that Micheal Bay did a good job directing the film. If it was not for him, None of the Transformers would have been awesome such as this. But as a director i give him praise and also respect for being such a good director. So i have to admit he was even a lot better and also he directed such a great film.The Decepticons want nothing more then the All-Spark cube for the destruction of our planet. Wanting nothing more then the cube itself. The Autobots join up to help the government with secret missions. But Sam Witwicky and his new girlfriend Carly Spencer are going nowhere when the Decepticons threaten to destroy the earth and with their new leader Sentinel Prime. It's up to Optimus Prime and his friends to save the world once again from a new threat if it's not stopped. Of course The Ark must be stopped because it's technology will destroy the world and ending all life on it if not stopped.The special effects in this film like Buildings collapsing and of course the Autobots fighting with the Decepticons is intense. Almost all the scenes had some perspective to them and a lot of those scenes were amazing. I enjoyed seeing them as they looked so real. And almost CGI like.Also Shia Lebouef is a great actor in this film. He expresses and acts so well that his performance is just unforgettable to watch. And his Talent amazing, He played recently as Mutt Williams in Indina Jones. And played as Sam Witwicky in Transformers. Though he does a good job playing in the Disney TV Show Even Stevens, And of course many more roles in the film Disturbia, And of course in The Battle of Shaker Heights. He was just excellent in this film all by himself.Also Megan Fox is replaced by Victoria Secret's model and Jason Statham's girlfriend Rosie Huntington-Whitely. Of course her role and her acting is awesome. But in some scenes she does not act normal like when she's only screaming. She looks great and she is an awesome actress. But Megan Fox was replaced as in the two other films were she was still with Sam but was eventually replaced which was nice too.Although this film definitely has some great fight scenes and the soundtrack that is composed very well i should say is the best. Of course it's not that bad and it sounds a lot better because the music makes it suspenseful and yet violent. But still the fight scenes are really violent no matter what you think. This makes the movie a lot better then it already is.Although the movie is a great film. I would have to say that this is an action packed film and it's a very good one. There are many great funny scenes in it like where Simmons knocks on the door and a Russian Doorman says that means goodbye. It surely makes me laugh every time i see it and the script is very well indeed told and read by the actors which is also nice. But the fact is that if you are a big Transformers fan then you have got to see this movie. It's all based on the toys and the TV Show and of course tops it off in my case. This is even better then Indiana Jones or Iron Man and also is something you have to see to believe. The story is incredible. The characters stay true and react perfectly in each situation. And the entire film and acting is something to be remembered. Everyone is going to love seeing this film like i did in the theater.So if you are wanting to see a superhero flick then look no furthur then to Transformers Dark Of The Moon. It surely is an awesome film and is a great film. It will make you laugh and the director behind it which is Micheal Bay is surely amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Rosie H-Whiteley,"I totally agree with Freddy Cox's comments dated June 28, 2011. The T:Dark of the Moon is great but Rosie Huntington-Whitely should have been cast as a Decepticon instead as Sam's new girl friend! Of course there would NOT have been any butt showing but she wouldn't had to try too hard to act since she is already too stiff. Or better yet, the CGI should have done all her moves. I am glad that Megan Fox's character was not killed of so she can return to (if any) Transformers movies.....so Megan please be careful with what you say and Michael Bay DON'T be too sensitive. The both of you GROW-UP!!!! As for Rosie, please DON'T quit your day job!!!!

Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"Our summer of sequels continues with the Transformers returning to the big screen with their third outing. After the rather disappointing Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen I have to say that my hopes were not particularly high for this one.Dark of the Moon is set several years after the second movie where Sam (Shia LaBeouf) is struggling to get a job and return his life to normal and yet this still hasn't stopped him from bagging the most attractive girl in the city- Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). At the same time, the Autobots discover that a Cybertronian spacecraft crash landed on the Moon during the 1960's and race against the Decepticons to reach it first and protect the secrets that it holds. The two story lines overlap and voilà the plot is born.As always the visuals impress and are the best in the franchise so far but I ended up asking myself how is this different from the previous two and it led me to this answer- there isn't that much of a difference at all. Bay has upped the ante somewhat in regards to the amount of CGI he has crammed into the movie so expect more fighting, more action and a whole lot more slowmo. While many will think great more action, I see it as part of the problem though. There is only so many times that I can be impressed with a vehicle transforming into something else, in slow motion, before it becomes repetitive and I felt like I reached my limit in this film.Aside from the first 10 minutes which dealt with the space race of the 1960's, it took a while for the film to get going. For the last hour or so though, I was enjoying what the film had to offer where it took on a Black Hawk Down kind of persona during battle scenes in the city.Several issues I had: at 157 minutes the film tended to drag in several places and led to a rather rushed final scene that should not have been; the comedy element was greatly reduced despite a cameo from Ken Jeong aka Mr Chow from The Hangover; the new love interest did not impress with her acting skills at all and was more than likely brought in merely as token eye candy for the viewers, which she did succeed in; and most importantly, the plot had more holes in it than a Swiss cheese being used as target practice on a shooting range. And that is an understatement. Also there has been zero continuity between the trilogy of films so far which does not go down well with me.I was more impressed than I thought I was going to be but as I said expectation had been lowered due to the extremely poor second film. I have to be careful here because I think the impressive graphics have partly blinded me to the rest of the cracks that appear in the film. All I can say is if you enjoyed the first movie or like good visuals then you will enjoy this one and if you didn't or want an involved and interesting plot that develops itself and the characters as the movie progresses then you won't get that here.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"So much better than the second one, maybe the best out of the trilogy!","I was expecting another terrible Transformers film due to the negative reviews and bad word of mouth however I was pleasantly surprised. The thing that made this film work was that it actually had a plot and the fighting had some reason, unlike the second one. I loved the whole involvement of the moon and space adventure. Some of the action sequences were immense, the stunts were amazing, out of this world. The action was really fun and kept you watching right till the end. Don't expect Oscar worthy acting or scriptwriting but since when does an action film have real substance in acting, not a bad thing but just fact. The new girl was OK, however by her character there were some moments where women were painted in a negative light. Also there were some glitches in the language which was not appropriate and also the couple of sexual references were inappropriate, not explicit but heavily implicated. This tainted the quality of the film and was unnecessary however the overall conclusion is that ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a great fun action adventure with killer moves and a decent plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Dark Of The Moon,"Dark of the Moon is the third film in the Transformers franchise. It involves a bit of human politics in the war between autobots and decepicons. That leads to news outlets saying everyone should pick a side. At the same time, the main character Sam decided to go back into the mainstream society after the events of the first two films. There's a lot of action just like the first two. If the first two films had too much action for you, likely this one would be too much as well. For me, I'm not the biggest Transformers fan after watching these first three films but I might watch the rest anyway because it might turn around after a movie or two.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pitiful excuse to show off an ugly blonde,"I knew Transformers 3 would be bad as no one had reviewed it in advance. That's always a bad sign. Also all the talk about Megan Fox not being in the movie and Shia shooting his mouth off also was tip off. This movie seems to be an excuse to show off an ugly blonde woman who seems not to know that there is any other color clothing but white and wears inappropriate attire to work. Every time I say Rosie Huntington- Whiteley on the screen all I could think of was Edna Mose and her summation of super models ""stupid little stick figures with poofy lips"". Not only is she ugly but she's the worst actress I have ever seen. She and Shia have absolutely no chemistry but Michael Bay must have been in love with her as he shot so many scenes of just her and her body that it started becoming ridiculous.Let me just say from a females perspective, Megan Fox might not have been great but her character was at least well written and we women appreciated the fact that she could get herself out of trouble without Sam. She didn't slow him down and she sure as hell would never have tried to stop him from saving his best and most trusted friend-Bumble Bee. Just for that he should have kicked Carly to the curb.As far as the plot, well we all know there wasn't one. Just one robot battle scene after another. As far as the humor and annoying characters were concerned, it wasn't as bad as Transformers 2. And these characters weren't half as annoying as the supermodel girlfriend. John Malkovich was wasted. Turturro was his usual. Tudyk and Jeong were funny. I really was disappointed that they used Leonard Nimoy the way they did. Some of the special effects were nice.The whole movie just makes you have to ask yourself what was Steven Spielberg thinking when he saw the finished product, hard to believe that he's sunk this far with his craft.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I got something during Transfromers,"i did not like any transformer movie, to begin with. what i came to realize during this one is how important credible characters are for any story. during th first 10 minutes of the movie (during the finght on the home-planet of the transformers), i really thought i would enjoy the movie, against my former expectations. but as soon as the characters appeared, everything went down, i have to say. both humans and transformers were depicted as kind of stupid, which is the totally wrong tone for a sci-fi movie, imo. nevertheless, gave it 2 stars, because of the cgi, although i had to leave 20 minutes earlier because i could not stnd this movie any more, and i was not interested in the ending at all!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Perfect Example for Modern Sci-Fi films,"Transformers was a great film,the most impressive part were the special and visual effects, the battle scenes were totally crazy and innovative, the score is beautiful and innovative from sci-fi films. I consider it a Sci-fi masterpiece on a technical level. Revenge of The Fallen wasn't as great as Traansformers but I still loved the film for the battle sequences and of course Megan Fox even though her performance wasn't that great. But Revenge of the Fallen was still a Technical and Box-Office. I only loved this film for the Battle sequences. Dark Of The Moon is the best film of the Trilogy, All of the elements that makes a good Sci-Fi movies you can find them on this movies, what a hell of a movie. Ranks amongst the best films of the year so far. The best thing of all is that The added the element of Drama Darkness, more drama and in a darker way, more serious this is what I mean, all the things that made up ROTF a fair film do not appear on this film, DOTM is the best of all because the elements that made good sci-fi film and is much better than any Transformers film or any film Michael Bay has done, this is the perfect example of a good and modern Sci-Fi Masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Is not a movie, I can say. Is a carnival, a celebration of stupidity and incoherence.","I enjoyed Transformers. In fact, I didn't even notice the movie was bad until later. I was so excited watching Optimus and Ironhide that I didn't mind when Prime said he found Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) through eBay. I forgot most of Revenge of the Fallen; barely remember a Decepticon climbing the great pyramid which was just awful. At least had Megan Fox.Transformers: Dark of the Moon is very different. Is not a movie, I can say. Is a carnival, a celebration of stupidity and incoherence. A blatant mockery on the moviegoers. Sincerely, the most exasperating 150 minutes, didn't make it to the last scenes. But I guess Buzz Aldrin did not know.Just like I didn't know either if there was an actual plot in the film. Apparently Michael Bay and Ehren Kruger had an idea involving Apollo 11, Chernobyl and the Trump International Hotel and Tower. They got $195 millions dollars and went through with it. I'm sure they didn't even ask an astrophysics before thinking of teleporting a planet into our exosphere. Absolute madness, some sort of vulgar comedy mixed up with a hottie (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), a lot of special effects and useless characters without persona, that is what this movie is made of.A little bit of light came from Bruce Brazos (John Malkovich), Sam's boss who was genuinely funny. Sad his appearance was kind of short. John Turturro was also entertaining during some point but took big part into the senseless madness as well.Definitely, we've seen the darker side of transformers, not the moon's. These people only cared about their $43,225,329 and this is the film they understood they had to make to achieve them. Congratulations!I know you may think I did not speak about the movie, but trust me is not necessary. If you want to go watch it, go. I did. I just don't think your reaction will be any different than mine if your passionate about movies.Always remember, you can actually loose your faith in Michael Bay.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This film transforms into a snooze fest.,"In 2007, Michael Bay hit one out of the ballpark with ""Transformers"". But 2 years later,he got a strikeout with the second film in the series, ""Revenge of the Fallen"". Now he's back on bat with the third film, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"". This time, He gets a another strikeout.This third film which looks like a 2 and a half hour toy commercial plug, deals with the battle for America between the Autobots and the Decepticons.Shia Labeouf is still good as before as Sam Witwicky. Taking over for Megan Fox is model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Whiteley may have half of Fox's looks but none of the charm. The rest of the supporting cast including Patrick Dempsey, John Turturro, Frances Mcdormand and John Malkovich are mostly underused. But the only shining supporting star is Ken Jeong {""The Hangover"" and TV's ""Community""}. Jeong is very funny as Sam's co-worker, but his role lasts a few minutes.Bay's direction is, as Roger Ebert would put it ""eye candy for the blind"". Ehren Kruger's script is too banal and drags the movie on too long. The visual effects are at times both impressive and corny. Armi Morki's cinematography make us feels like we are watching a music video.Transformers fans will be wowed by it. But for the rest of us, we see it as a endurance contest. Just in case non-fans, bring in pillows.FYI: The film is in both 2-D and 3-D versions. I saw it in 2-D. My advice: Skip both versions, go see Harry Potter instead.My Pick:Red Light{Skip It}",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Michael Bay Reaches for the Stars... Then Crashes Like a Rusty Satellite,"Michael Bay kicks off his intergalactic carnival with a clever reimagining of the 1960s. Apparently, between moon missions, NASA was busy covering up the crash of a giant alien scrapheap on the lunar surface. It's smart, it's slick, and for a moment, you think, ""Wait, did Bay actually try with the script this time?"" Sadly, this brilliant premise is quickly buried under an avalanche of explosions and dialogue that reads like a high school history essay written in a panic.Sam Witwicky returns, still the lovable goofball inexplicably tasked with saving the world again. Megan Fox has left the scene (probably off tuning cars somewhere), replaced by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who plays... a luxury coat hanger, it seems. Her lines are as shallow as a perfume ad, but let's be honest-she's here for set decoration, and Michael Bay doesn't care.Optimus Prime is back to kick some tailpipes, and Bumblebee keeps spinning nostalgic '80s tunes like a car-shaped DJ. But the Decepticons? They spend more time striking dramatic poses in the background than being actual threats. Megatron is practically begging for early retirement with how often he gets stomped.The second half of the film? A destruction fest that makes Independence Day look like a camping trip. Bay obliterates buildings, robots, bridges, and even your retinas. It's visually spectacular, but after a while, you just want to tell him, ""Hey, Michael, chill out-this is a movie, not a military recruitment ad!""Then there's the conspiracy: humans collaborating with Decepticons to take over Earth. It could have been incredible, but Bay channels all his energy into the action instead of the writing, and it unravels into chaos. Special mention goes to Patrick Dempsey's human villain, who's about as intimidating as a kitten on Xanax.With Dark of the Moon, Michael Bay shows he can dazzle you for 20 minutes before assaulting your senses with two hours of deafening noise. It's flashy, it's loud, but it's hollow at its core. In short, it's a textbook Michael Bay blockbuster: plenty to look at, but not much going on upstairs.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The best awesome action science fiction flick in the series!,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) was big improvement over Revenge of the Fallen and it is really better than the fourth one. I love this movie to death. It is my second best favorite Transformers movie in the series. I enjoy this movie so much and I just wasn't bored. I have enjoyed about anything that has to do with big robots and even bigger explosions! I know people will disagree with me and put my review down, but this movie was OK and it was far from disappointment! It was Miles better than Revenge of the Fallen and Age of Extinction those two movies were just awful horrible. This one was just big improvement over the second one and the next fourth one sequel. I could really got in the story. It was about Autobots who found Sentinel Prime Optimus the last predecessor and the leader of the Autobots, who later betrayed Optimus Prime and Autobots by making ages ago a deal with Megatron, he formed alliance with the Megatron and Decepticons who wanted to re build Cybertron with pillars that could open a bridge through space and time on our planet and enslave all humans on our world. Together with Megatron they would rule the planet and all Autobots would be exiled from the planet Earth. Sam and Autobots must fight once again. I love the music that they put it in this movie, action and I like the scene with Patrick Dempsey and Sam fighting each other, that was GREAT! Other than that though, as far as entertainment and emotion goes, this was a perfect movie. CGI of robots were good, they weren't bad. I know everything about this movie what is about. It is the last good Transformers movie and the last time we see the crew from the previous movies together. The action was really great, I love the action scenes, the explosions and the story, the plot about this movie isn't terrible or confusing at all, it is good.Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky did outstanding job as always it is the last time in the movie we see him. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly Spencer did a wonderful performance as Sam's new girlfriend. She wasn't annoying, or such a bimbo diva like stupid shallow Megan Fox, she was beautiful and her performance was outstanding. She wasn't hot, she was convincing actress and I didn't thought anything bad about her. Thank god for Michael Bay replacing Megan Fox with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, I am so glad Megan was gone. Rosie was miles way better than Megan Fox was. John Turturro as Seymour Simmons did a fantastic job portraying once again his character, he gave us an outstanding performance. Patrick Dempsey as Dylan Gould as the main antagonist did an outstanding acting performance as the second villain and Megatron's second in command henchman. This is the second time Patrick Dempsey reunite and work together with Ehren Kruger. He already worked with Ehren Kruger on the third slasher horror film Scream 3 (2000.Critics are way too hard on Michael Bay! He has said himself that he just wants to make crowd-pleasing movies, and ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" has done exactly that! This film has made 1.1 BILLION dollars at the box-office; and for a good reason. So what if it doesn't have Oscar-worthy performances, and had a few bad jokes here and there. I LOVE those two movies. And the fun part about the latest entry in the series is that I actually did find something deep with it. This film had several emotional moments, and I found myself welling up with tears. And the fantastic score by Steve Jablonsky fit in very well with it.The movie had a lot of mistakes and holes that I didn't understand. I thought the mythology of the Autobots was already explained in Transformers (2007). Megatron and Shockwave did not had enough screen time in here. The blond women Frances McDormand as Charlotte Mearing Director of NSA was annoying, she annoyed me too much. She blamed Optimus Prime for Sentinel Prime destroying NEST's base and making off with the five pillars. She had no respect to Autobots at all. They saved Earth twice and that was a big thank you for it. I did not like that. When the shuttle Xantium rocket was shot down and destroyed by Starscream, in which one of the booster rockets where the Autobots hidden? Because I only saw one rocket taking off in the air and not two. And in what Ocean the rocket fall? And how did the Autobots come back from water if they can't swim and than they mystery appeared in Chicago so soon, this confuses me so much.A mysterious event from Earth's past threatens to ignite a war so big that the TRANSFORMERS alone will not be able to save the planet. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and the AUTOBOTS must fight against the darkness to defend our world from the DECEPTICONS all-consuming evil in the smash hit from director Michael Bay and executive producer Steven Spielberg.

Did not reach its potential...,"""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie and the third movie of the ""Transformers"" franchise, in which we watch the evil Decepticons trying to get their revenge against Autobots after their defeat. They both want to reach the Moon in order to find a well-hidden Cybertronian spacecraft and learn its secrets.Since I had already watched the two previous ""Transformers"" movies I had high expectations from this movie. Unfortunately I was disappointed by the result because it was just another Sci-Fi movie without paying any attention to the plot and to the main characters of the movie. I am not saying that ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is a bad movie, I am just saying that it did not reach its true potential and that it could be a far better movie than this.

Phwooooar! Boom! Crunch! Phwooar!,"The summary I've written is actually paraphrased from Mark Kermode's film review which listened to the other week, and I must say I think it should also be the title of Michael Bay's autobiography whenever it gets written. I really think Michael Bay is good at one thing and all the elements of that one thing - spectacle; from special effects, to spectacular stunts, and set pieces that virtually melt your brain there is no doubting this word when watching the film. In that sense if you were able to combine his talents with another director who knows how to work with actors, and who knows something about plot and story then this person would be a true great. As it is we get one third, not even enough. The other vital two thirds which come together to form this Michael Bay experience are invented upon in a rush and as wildly like as a kid forced into doing his homework - for instance, present the issue of getting high quality acting into this film and the solution presented is John Malkovich. Anything more Michael? No, we just need an actor and Malkovich is that man in this movie - Malkovich will do the acting now lets get back to the explosions! As for the storyline - simply don't worry about it, because if you do you will end up bald from pulling your hair out. As a spectacle this film has something to offer - it is just a shame that scratching the surface only reveals more surface.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Everything is quite funny,"I don't mean action scenes. The movie's action scenes are quite attractive and dramatic. The director tried to show everything as best as possible. But maybe because the plot is not good, there are scenes where we feel everything is quite predictable or quite funny. Remember these are giant robots. They cannot have feelings of pity. Or at least the reason for this needs to be mentioned in more detail. Instead of focusing too much on action scenes without enough depth, the film no longer has story continuity or realism, which the previous two parts did better. The music still completes its mission. But even if Sam changes girlfriends, everything in this story needs to be accurate and realistic. Moon? An interesting topic. Unfortunately, other things on Earth aren't as exciting.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Depends on what you expect...,"What you think of this film will depend entirely on what you expect when you walk in. If you are expecting a detailed script, mesmerizing acting and deep/thoughtful story then you are going to leave a bit disappointed.Though if you walk in expecting amazing action sequences, massive explosions and brilliant visuals then you'll leave satisfied. Not saying that all the acting is bad, Shia LaBeouf plays Sam well again and also the comedic performance by Ken Jeong brings life to the film.Even though the film is 2 1/2 hours long, time goes by quickly. If you are looking for a great action packed film to see these holidays I recommend seeing 'Transformers'.Also if you're going to see one 3D film this is the one. I was lucky enough to see the film in IMAX which is definitely the best way to see it as the film really immerses the viewer and you can really feel it, as the cinema shakes for a large percentage of the film.

Good third movie for Transformers fans,"I was expecting a spectacle, and I got a spectacle and a half. Squared. Truly impressive movie. Bay has surpassed himself. We know what is expected from these films and it gets in large quantities. The explosions, action, tension, ... For me, by far the best 3D movie I've seen. A few times during the film's dream thought, that scene or how this is impressive or how did they record that scene. You can spit on the story, if you like, or acting, but the spectacle is nothing to do personally. Women are not even kept her as much as would be expected. Subtract that. Eyesore to me was John Malkovich, who had such a small and insignificant role in the film, I do not know what he needed, though he cast away the strongest of all these characters. Also this was my first 3D movie with new glasses that are excellent, light and nothing to obscure the image unlike those of past huge glasses. If you like robots, action, explosions, spectacle, you have two and a half hour of pure amusement. I love robots.

Best Movie of 2011!

Dark of The Moon was Not that bad of a movie it seemed pretty good. and it was listed at Number 2 of The Highest Crossing Movies of the year 2011. so anyways the Plot of the Movie starts off with In 1961, the Ark, a Cybertronian spacecraft carrying an invention capable of ending the war between the benevolent Autobots and the malevolent Decepticons, crash lands on the dark side of Earth's Moon. and you the Cast too doesn't Star Meghan Fox she was replaced by Rosie Huntington- Whiteley and also her boyfriend Sam Witwicky. so anyway the auto-bots of transformers are also in it like Bumblbee Optimus Prime and the rest of them. and the Sound Effects was pretty good and decent and the good fight scenes and even towards the End of the Movie was great too. This Movie deserves a good rating for a Transformers movie I Mean it didn't seem bad at all. but what Dark of the Moon could have improved was the casting or the minutes of how long the movie ran. that's all but still Dark of the Moon was not a bad movie and i Think it surpassed any 2011 movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
looking forward to DVD....,"I'm not sure what i think of this movie yet. i'll give it 7. i do know that the effects were overdone, but fun (a bit like spider-man 3)My reason for this review is to slam 3D. after ice age 3, this was my first movie to try 3d. I thought ""I'm the original transformers generation"" (30 something), lets get involved by trying transformers as my 3d debut movie. I have my question answered. I'm never trying 3d again.i'm looking forward to seeing this in regular 2d. Because I completely missed it in the cinema. I was far too busy trying to 'get through' the 3D. I saw T/f 1 and 2, and was entertained by them. I can't even comment on this movie so far, having sat through the entire 3d experience. The only thing going through my brain was ""this 3d stuff is rubbish"".the image i saw wasn't a film, it was like trying to piece together one of those red 3d view-master toy camera's. absolute mind-mess.absolute fail for the 3d. give me an image i can see.Some of the other points i can think of (possible spoilers ahead)Yes I'm not sure how megatron came back. I did think he was knocked off in either of the first two.Also, some new or change of characters needed. The FBI guy you love to hate, was (as far as I can remember) introduced by talking about his memoirs. Kind of had an ""oh you made it into the 3rd film too"" air about it.Also the main (cool scripted) army guy was 'also' in this one.

Possibly the worst film I have ever seen,"****May contain spoilers for this awful movie****Concise review: Rubbish, even worse than Avatar. Spend your money on something else.Extended review: Despite having heard nothing good about this film, I was quite excited about going to see it. Transformers was pretty good, Transformers 2 was pretty bad, but I hoped that Michael Bay would at least make something approaching an effort with the third instalment of this money-spinning franchise.Right...here goes...Plot: there actually is one, and if you pay attention during the first soul-destroying hour then you can try to follow it, although by the end of the film you will realise that such plot as there is completely fails to make any logical sense. In a nutshell, Sentinel Prime (an Autobot) was escaping from Cybertron with some new technology, but the Decepticons shot up his ship and he drifted through space until he crashed into the moon. Later it transpires that Sentinel had made a pact with Megatron to work together, so why then was his ship being attacked at all?? Some nonsense about the space programme is chucked in to confuse and add idiocy.Characters: Sam Witwitless returns as the slightly unconvincing wet who has amazingly attracted a model as his new ho. He continues to be annoying at every turn. His wench (I cannot even remember her name) is paper thin with no personality. The CGI characters are, as one would expect, almost completely lacking depth, aside from the fact that I went to see this film in 3d. Sam's parents return briefly for no obvious reason to reprise their roles and earn a few quid. There are some other characters but nobody who stands out in any way. Towards the end it is very difficult to distinguish between individual transformers as they start to all look the same.Acting: Shia Lebeef manages to struggle unconvincingly throughout the film, although excels himself when being ""terrified"". Rosie Huntingdon-Poshbird doesn't act at all, simply because she clearly cannot. The long, lingering shots of her bum and legs at the beginning of the film clearly indicate why she was chosen - in fairness, she is quite tasty for a skinny bird, although after the first 30 minutes of the film her permanent pouty-lipped look makes you want to put a paper bag over her face, or at least a photo of Megan Fox. Mr Spok (Leonard Nimoy) is an interesting choice for the voice of Sentinel Prime. Overall the standard of acting is somewhat low, as one would expect.Effects: There are lots of amazing CGI effects and stuff but personally I would have preferred 50% of the CGI budget to have been spent on the screenplay.Soundtrack: Lots of overly cheesy music utterly spoils what atmosphere was present. Way too loud, too.Length: At 2.5 hours long, this film is a killer. The first hour contained nothing of note and could have been put in the bin. At 90 minutes the film could have been slightly watchable.One last thing: I would really like my money back. This film is on a par with National Lampoon's Men In White.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Transformed excellence,"This movie series finally got really good in comparison to the first two.The opening was pretty cool because the Transformers' home planet Cybertron was shown. It really showed the origin of the conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons.Shortly after that, there was too much of the human element in the first quarter of the movie. It gets kind of annoying when the human characters are being developed instead of the Transformer characters developing.But despite the overwhelming time spent with the character development, it was made up for by the second half of the movie. It was almost non-stop action and fighting sequences. Megatron, once again, really did not have that much influence on the plot of the movie. It just does not make sense why he is not utilized much more than what he is in this movie and even the two previous ones.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The destructive spectacle is real and genuinely impressive, but terrible as a cinematic experience: too many characters, many subplots, comic reliefs that do not work","In 2009, with the success of the first film, Bay did what he does best: more destruction and more explosions.

For those who thought that the second film was just about shots, beating and bombing, you should not have watched ""The Hidden Side of the Moon"". The plot even anchors at an important moment in the history of mankind, making a fun relationship with historical facts - that the script seeks to tie with archival scenes and digital (unfinished) recreations of US presidents - between the fate of Cybertron, the planet ravaged by the civil war between Autobots and Decepticons, and the space race fought by the USA and the USSR in the 1950s and 60s. This historical stuff and glimpses of the robot planet give renewed interest to the series, even though they disappear there in the middle of the film, right after Buzz Aldrin - himself - shows up.In the plot, the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), participate in secret missions alongside the humans, where they try to exterminate the Decepticons existing on the planet. One day Optimus discovers that the humans hid something that happened to him on the far side of the moon. It is the fall of a spaceship from Cyberton, commanded by Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy), which triggered the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union in 60s. The Autobots decide to go to the Moon to rescue the old leader, in addition to the capsules that are still in place. At the same time, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) lives with his new girlfriend, Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), and is looking for a job. He feels diminished, having saved the planet twice and won a medal from President Barack Obama, but none of this seems to help him establish himself in the job market. To make matters worse, Carly earns well and is harassed by the boss, billionaire Dylan Gould (Patrick Dempsey). Shortly after finally getting a job, Sam receives a message from Jerry (Ken Jeong), who works in the same place. Jerry worked at NASA during the space race and is now blackmailed by the Decepticons, who kill him. The fact makes Sam look for the Autobots once again, but despite his past achievements he encounters resistance from the new commander, Marissa Faireborn (Frances McDormand).The prologue, which recreates the arrival of Apollo 11 on the Moon and the super-secret mission that is the real reason for its existence, is by far the best part of the script, for without something well structured and that really adds mystery to the narrative and robot mythology. However, the solidity shown in the initial 20 minutes completely collapses from there. We are re-introduced to Sam Witwicky (the embarrassed Shia LaBeouf being himself) who, despite having graduated from one of the best colleges in the United States, saved the world twice, winning a Barack Obama medal and winning one second jaw-dropping girlfriend, remains the same loser who gets nothing in life. It is inexplicable as is the rest of the plot.The relationship of the ""Witwicky core"" is horrible and, in no way remembers, the great interactions of the first film and even a little of the second. The impression is that Sam's parents, played by the excellent Kevin Dunn and Julie White are there out of obligation. It may seem an exaggeration to disregard the work of the actors, but the feature itself leads us to believe that their role is merely to take us from one action scene to another. Here we have big names, like Frances McDormand and John Malkovich, lending their talent to characters who add little to the plot individually, but who together with the supporting cast make the precarious script work.Since being announced as the hero's new girlfriend played by Shia LaBeouf, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has been one of the cast's most questionable additions. The first scene of the British serves to show its purpose in the film. The camera follows Rosie - who is wearing only a T-shirt and panties - in a sequence that reminds us of the lingerie commercial in which the director found the then model. Shortly after, the director follows his camera from head to toe while Patrick Dempsey's character describes a luxury car, making the analogy of the perfection of Whiteley's body with the characteristics of the car. In the few moments when he has to act, his performance is reasonable, although this was clearly not the director's concern. The gorgeous model replaces tall Megan Fox - after a string of disagreements with director Michael Bay and producer Steven Spielberg - not that it is too difficult.
New robots are also featured in the feature, both on the side of heroes (Autobots) and villains (Decepticons). The new Decepticons have greater relevance in the plot, especially the hateful Laserbeak. Shockwave, one of the best transformers presented so far, unfortunately has little screen time, but leaves its mark when it appears. Sentinel Prime, widely touted in the promotional pieces of the film, has a disappointing role throughout history - its only appeal is to be voiced by Leonard Nimoy (Lord Spock, from Star Trek). We see a new species of metallic sand worm (that of the Duna book series) controlled by Sockwave, one of the most interesting robot designs created by Bay's creative team.As in the previous film, the humor remains eschatological and bland. Until the story really starts to pass, almost an hour of projection passes, full of ""comical"" scenes without purpose and ridiculous subplots. Examples of this are the Autobots attacking nations in the Middle East, crude jokes, stupid quotes to ""Star Trek II - Khan's Wrath"" and Sam's mother making a joke about the boy's penis size amid an attack by Decepticons .Michael Bay also ignores something called ""rhythm"", keeping the feature at a perpetual climax, which ends up tiring viewers. Enduring the whole projection becomes a test of endurance, given Bay's inability to show a consistent narrative. The last hour is a gigantic action scene that just doesn't stop until the last thirty seconds of the film, when it just ends. The final battle has the feat of overcoming the battle of Egypt from the previous chapter of the saga. Chicago is devastated and thousands of people have turned to dust, so there should be at least some notion of shock, but such scenes just don't connect with the audience. The city does not survive the attack of 200 decepticons (including a monster robot, combat ships, four-eyed soldiers, General Shockwave and a disfigured Megatron) in the final sequence, which has 40 minutes of explosions, acts of bravery, phrases of impact and many slow cameras. The latter, a kind of technological halter that the filmmaker found to be able to shoot in 3D. Nothing more than the obligation, since the money invested and Bay's poor reputation can justify that. It is one of the best 3D productions so far. But that's it. The solution works very well: you can appreciate the formidable work of computer graphics from Industrial Light and Magic in detail and high definition, with the thousands of moving parts in each of the robots, interacting with the environment and with the humans around them.It is interesting to see the work of art direction and especially of photography when managing to portray a scenario of total destruction and even post-apocalyptic with shades of gray and specific lenses. Also noteworthy is another precise work by Steve Jablonski in yet another soundtrack that is consistent and that knew how to maintain tension and adrenaline throughout the film. ""Transformers: The Hidden Side of the Moon"" will easily make millions, which is perhaps why Bay still roams the hollywood sets. In the choreography of Bay's private war, real and three-dimensional explosions happen simultaneously, while armies collide in a space impossible to be discerned as real or imaginary, in what gives the impression of being the most expensive film ever made, so great its quality. The destructive spectacle is real and genuinely impressive, but terrible as a cinematic experience, the film has too many characters, many subplots, comic reliefs that do not work a script without emotional involvement. It's a great commercial for the effective uses of 3D, nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"An amazing, awesome blockbuster","This film is about the secrets hidden in a severely damaged spacecraft on the dark side of the moon, and the subsequent chaos when Decepticons and Autobots fight for the Earth.""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" may be 2.5 hours long, but certainly feels a lot shorter. There is so much material to cover, that the story starts already at the first minute, wasting no time beating about the bush. The first two ""Transformers"" had brainless plots, but this one has a great plot that engages and thrills throughout. Even though the ending is obligatorily predictable, I still find myself completely glued to the screen, waiting for events to unfold, and more importantly hoping things will turn out alright for the Earth. It's so engaging that I didn't even want to blink, for fear I might miss anything.The special effects are simply breathtaking and jaw dropping. The uninhibited rampage on the city is so awesome. And the 3D is very spectacular, it looks as if I was watching the events in the film live, as if I was there to experience it. Even a trail of dust look so 3D. A friend of mine once said ""Why watch a film in 3D when you can watch everything else in 3D. Well, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" shows that watching a 3D film offers more than what the eyes normally see in real life.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Epic,"If your seeking a film with an impeccable story, great plot and progressive character development..... this is definitely NOT that sort of film. Then again if you aren't aware of Micheal Bay's reputation of an all action and special effects based style of direction than you probably don't go to the movies a whole lot. That being said it is in my opinion that this film is nothing short of brilliant. Micheal Bays days of shooting car advertisements have really paid off in these three films and in particular this last installment of the trilogy (Transformers: Dark of the moon). The film lives up to everything I expected, the special effects are amazing, the action is fantastic the Computer Generated Imagery is perfect and to even add onto that the 3D experience is just incredible. I actually think I appreciated the film a lot more watching it in 3D. Like in particular the scenes where Shockwave's pet mechanical leech rips through the commercial buildings and the deployment of the airborne military troops in particular are quite astounding. Though as much as the action was fantastic and nail biting at times. The story is pretty simple and predictable as you would expect. I don't care though, I don't need story for a bunch of robots, just as long as their motives justify their means to blow $%*# up, I'll be happy to watch it to see what happens.So that being said do me a favor and grab an energy drink and head on down to your local cinema and buy a 3d ticket for transformers.Its one of the only 3D films out that will get you the experience you would be expecting and if your not to keen on an all action based film than its probably time to watch ""The Departed"" again",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Cheesy 3D action flick so bad it's funny,"I didn't actually see the other two Transformers, so that may have been a hindering factor. But when I saw this, it put me off the other two. I saw this in 2D about two weeks after it came out. I thought it was going to be awesome. I was wrong.The action sequences were loud and fun just like they should be, but the rest was actually so bad it was funny. Every line of the dialog was incredibly cheesy. Another hindering factor is it's length. Clocking in at just over two and a half hours, all the other crap can get you bored quickly. About two days before I saw Harry Potter, which is two hours ten but it felt a lot shorter. Transformers, however, actually felt like the two and a half hours it is. As most of the action didn't come in until about forty five minutes in I quickly got bored.So overall, this is probably the worst film I've seen this year. I give it 3 out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing and way too long,"Very disappointing after the first two. Transformers 1 was fun. Transformers 3 has great effects and some cute ideas, but it becomes hard to distinguish sides at some points and it soon degenerates to just plain mechanised violence.I often go to 3D movies on the basis that if the movie itself isn't that great at least I can enjoy the 3D effects. Once again, a disappointment. The 3D is ordinary. Not up to what we expect these days and certainly no ""Coraline""It's two hours too long and it's just not fun.Not what we expect from Mr Spielberg.

two thirds of this movie is an unforgivable waste and thats all there is to it.,"Im not one of those people who wants to hate this movie. I wanted this movie to be a fun action packed movie that played to Michael Bay's strengths (Lets face the facts , Michael Bay's main strength is that he's good at directing over the top action scenes) , to be fair the movie offers what I and the majority of the audience wanted ...in the last third of the movie.The first two thirds of this movie is like they didn't learn from the mistakes of the atrocious second movie 'revenge of the fallen' . The one saving grace is that racially insensitive robots allow it would have been great comic relief if the movie had them been crushed alive instead.The story is not my main quarrel with this movie. That been said its not a clever story. In all honesty it doesn't have to be though. Transformers movies have never been praised for innovative , new ideas like inception , or ideas that seem possible and encourage the mind to push the known boundaries of science and engineering (like star trek or space odyssey) . The transformers creators and audience know that the stories come second to the action in their movies. Thats fine in a movie like this. It doesn't have to be clever. It can be an entertaining thrill ride can knows what audience it wants to please.This movie though is a mess... Its not the story that I have a problem with.. Its the filler. The movie seems to be filled with an never ending stream of annoying characters. The least annoying character for me was the female lead (played by Rosie-huntington whitley) and the lead soldiers. There characters did not necessarily have a lot of dialogue . Believe it or not thats why I preferred them to the rest of the human characters. The first half of this movie plays like a horrible comedy that only gives you glimpses of the autobots and decepticons (which is honestly what everyone came to see....that and rosie huntington)...No one wanted to see lame jokes and characters belch out fast paced , incomprehensible dialogue. I find the dialogue annoying, very annoying , and thats my major quarrel with this movie. It spends around half the film with these annoying characters spewing words very quickly but rather unintelligibly .For example what was with the Asian who cornered sam in a bathroom... I could not understand a word of what he said...It was like he overdosed on speed (like a lot of these characters mind you).Everything in the third part was what I wanted from the movie , overpriced but great action scenes and I fairly badass fight for Chicago... that will never be enough however to make up for the first half or two thirds... You cant say this movie is good solely because of the end... Two-thirds of this movie felt like a wasted opportunity.I came into this movie saying what every person who liked the second movie said to me ''It's just a movie , Its supposed to be a stupid but fun action packed ride'' ... and now going to simply say to those people ... I wanted for the real action to come and it took ages , a movie can be dumb but It doesn't have to waste my time with pointless things that no one wants to see...So yeah if those people want to waste their own time with mind numbling stupid dialogue then step right in folks.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The 3rd one is better then the first 2,This a great movie I do not know why any one would not like. I it better then the first two Transformers movies and that is not easy to do. Transformers the last knight is better. 6.3 is a good ratting. But this is such a great film that 6.3 is underrating it. Most people are give it 7. So I do not why it got 6.3. This is such a great movie that 7 is underrating it. This is a 10. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. This is one of the best science fiction movie from 2011. This is a very fast past movie with a lot of action. See this movie. It is a great movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Enjoyable but a bit confusing,"We came out of the cinema feeling that we really enjoyed something. It was a long movie, but after spending a long time there the whole real climatic ending happened just too quick. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley should stick to modelling, it will help for her botox injections anyway, she was really flat and lifeless. I have seen a few reviews say that she brought a bit of English class, yes, like ""fish and chips"" brings English class. There were so many holes in the movie and I agree with many other reviews that it seemed like many many hours were filmed, but they did not necessarily pick the best two and a half hours for the finished version. Still the CGI was the best I have ever seen and we still enjoyed the movie and were happy to part with our hard earned money for a ticket, well it filled the afternoon.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Excellent, Mindless action movie","I saw this movie in 3D despite negative comments by critics. I watched it because I really like last two movies of the franchise. And let me tell you that I didn't made a mistake. It was the most incredible movie I have seen so far. Its a brilliant treat for the eyes to see the mind blowing special effects, 3D is the icing on the cake. But bear in mind just keep your logical, critic mind at home. The plot is really thin and acting is average but this is not a Citizen Kane. The action is like never seen before. Also I am a big fan of Megan Fox therefore I was disappointed because of her absence. Also Rosie's acting is really robotic. But she fulfills her purpose in the movie for providing the much required eye-candy. On the whole if you are really a fan of action and special effects I bet you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
why such a low rating?!!,"I feel this is the best transformers yet. seriously just watch and enjoy and stop bit*ing!!In all seriousness I loved the slow but yet medium fast pace that the film offered in comparison to the first two which where a bit too much really.This had more theory, and was a nicer pace.And oh, the beginning.. Whoa!

What a movie,"OK I wish someone would please after this is all over, please let some other director reboot this franchise. I mean Bay was just looking to make a buck with some explosions and humor. If you can get the right director who knows how to story tell, the transformers can be epic.I mean look at the disaster of the other 2. The focus was to much on well I am not sure but nothing of the decepticons or Autobots. What happen to the history between megatron and prime? How can some robots be frozen or killed so easily? Where is the bad vibe with megatron and starscream which was not done well? Why is it that the autobots have no clue what the decepticons are doing?

A fun summer blockbuster but could have been even better,"After watching Transformers 3 i came out really excited and wanting more.The movie is an absolute visual treat with great effects and set pieces. The sound and acting is also good.The movie continues the story from where transformers 2 left and fills some blanks along the way. A simple story which does drag a bit towards the middle, but the final half hour is a fun ride. There are a few twists and turns in the story, but very predictable ones. There is some amazing action towards the conclusion which leaves you wanting more.What i thought missing the most was Megan Fox. The new actress was just not a fitting replacement for her.I hope they bring her back for the next movie.Overall the movie will entertain you and certainly worth the admission price.

Then watch this film ASAP. The impact that Shakespeare, Aristotle, Socrates had on literature can never be matched by what Michael Bay have accomplished in Dark of the Moon.

Michael Bay has gone insane,"This movie is terrible in so many ways that it is impossible to articulate them all. Usually, with a bad movie, it is easy to say, ""It is bad because of this, this, and this,"" but with Framstorners: Bark at the Moon, the problem is that everything in it is terrible.The basic storyline is not too bad, and in the hands of another director, it could have been a decent 90 minute action sci-fi movie. Michael Bay makes it 60 minutes too long, and fills it with a bunch of Michael Bay rubbish that does not need to be there.Other reviewers have done an excellent job of pointing out the many different reasons why this movie is horrible. I think that Michael Bay has been injecting testosterone directly into his brain stem, and it has made him insane. How else could someone make a huge-budget movie and not care about plot, characters, dialog, physics, or having even a tiny shred of respect for his audience?And to top it off, why does everyone in the film have orange skin tones?

For such a big budget they could have hired some better writers,"Continuity errors between each of the three transformer films (and within this film), bad acting and a weak plot made this movie unbearable. Too late because now my money adds to the $190m this film has already made so the joke is on me.There is insufficient chemistry between Sam and the very attractive damsel in distress to warrant an entire theatre sitting through his attempts to get to her to save her. Watching them run to each other at the end made little sense since he was with her through the end of the movie ... not sure what was the need for a dramatic reunion. This coupled with the fact that through the film Sam had no real connection to any of the autobots (especially Bumblebee) to make you feel anything made the film hollow.The plot was particularly weak (or perhaps poorly executed) so by the time the twist in the plot came around, it made for awful cinema. The writers for this movie need to look for another profession.There were some unreal moments in the movie that should have been on the cutting floor of the editing, particularly when Carly stands up in the heat of an intense battle scene as she gets an idea, and somehow her hair blows in the wind as she pouts ... can't believe a director yelled ""And action!!!!!"" at the start of that action sequence!I am not sure how many times I counted Carley's shoes changing from heels to flat shoes .... and I'm not sure how she got jeans on when she was abducted in white pants .... She runs for hours and maintains the best hair ... realism and continuity wasn't too big on the agendaGreat CG of course so they should give the graphics team a big fat bonus ...

"The darkest, and most serious film of the first trilogy. Even the real Buzz Aldrin played in the film. By far the best film of all Transformers to date","Fantasy/action movie. The third and final film in the first Transformers trilogy. Although Bay's immature elements remain, the film as a whole gets serious, gets darker, and involves the Apollo missions to the moon, where the real Buzz Aldrin, one of the famous astronauts who went to the moon, meets Optimus Prime. Also documentary of Kennedy and also of the news of that time about the Apollo missions are shown in the movie. Things are much darker than the dark side of the moon, since the secret that exists there hides it very well on earth. People who have worked for the Decepticons for years in secret, assassinations of witnesses, Chernobyl and much more are connected to each other in the top film of all Transformers. The secrecy and the whole style reminded me a little of They Live (1988), where people worked for the aliens for years since they thought they would be the final winners. A much more serious invasion film, with the occupation of the city of Chicago and the attempt to enslave humanity. There is, however, the light element, as well as a great romance with a new protagonist, a model, while the other main protagonists, Sam, Agent Simmons, Lennox, Epps, etc., remain the same. The only negative part of the film is that the villain of the film is not very convincing, while Megatron comes in second role and weaker than in the other two films. On the plus side of the transformers, the terrifying and intelligent Shockwave with the huge robot drill and the scene in the skyscraper that is also the best of the film, and one of the top in the whole trilogy. In the rest, top directing, effects, action, emotion, and wonderful music once again from Linkin Park and Steve Jablonsky.

Too dull even for (the obviously targeted) teenagers,"I am a ""child of the 80s"" and grew up with Transformers, Ghostbusters, TMNT, ... so i am one part of the target audience. Nevertheless i couldn't get much joy out of this movie.On the good side i found that the ""robot action"" is roughly the same than in the previous two movies, so if that's your thing you can cat least enjoy these parts. It's also a plus that they dropped the shaky cam combat shots altogether and added some beautiful slow-mo photography.Unfortunately i couldn't find more positive aspects of this movie. The dialogue was mind-blowing stupid. The verbal fights between Witwicky and the ""intelligence boss lady"" Mearing, allegedly a veteran CIA operative, where so childish and doting that several people in the theater where moaning loudly. The plots of the villains (e.g. Dylan) where so one-dimensional and naive that they should be doubtful even for teenagers. No motives explained, no safeguarding, no leverage, ... nothing! Every comic book villain is more fleshed out.The relationship between Witwicky and Carly Spencer was equally immature and very superficial. Which probably was a good thing...Probably the worst part of the movie have been the constant comical relief attempts. Agent Simmons even more over the top and unbelievable than in the previous movies, the two small transformers as cliché sidekicks, the stupid ""espionage watch"" which constantly hinders Witwicky in actually doing some real espionage, the ridiculous behavior at the job interviews, ...To sum it all up, i can not recommend this movie to anybody past puberty, and even the more clever kids will probably find the plot laughable.3 stars for the expected ""giant robots fighting"", which was delivered.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Exceeded My Expectations,"To say my expectations going into Transformers: Dark of the Moon were low would be a tremendous understatement. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was so embarrassingly bad I could hardly fathom it; but I ended up going to the new movie against my better judgement, primarily because I wanted to see the trailer for Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol up on the big screen (which did not disappoint by the way, Brad Bird's live action debut looks amazing). To my surprise, though, Dark of the Moon was not terrible, and all things considered was actually pretty good.So when it comes to critiquing a Michael Bay film, you can't really treat it like anything else. There's a certain level of expectation that comes with one of his movies, and that involves a lot of explosions, and not a lot of plot. And when it comes to explosions, giant robots, and epic action sequences, this movie does not disappoint, however, for a Michael Bay film, Dark of the Moon is surprisingly talky and I'm still not sure whether or not that's a good thing. The first two acts of the film contain relatively few big action set pieces, and mostly attempts to set the stage for everything that happens in the film's final act. On one hand I appreciate that this film actually attempts to tell a story rather than Revenge of the Fallen's method of ""look, here's robots fighting in China for no reason! Ooh, and now they're fighting in Egypt for no reason!"" but on the other hand the film kind of drags at times in the first two acts because none of the characters are particularly compelling. Normally I would not criticize a film for spending more time on story and characters than on eye candy, and I do commend the filmmakers for telling a coherent story this time around, but they could have easily trimmed some time from the first two acts and focused more on the battle for Earth between the Autobots and Decepticons.When we finally do get to the good stuff in the final act, the action and the scale is certainly epic, but parts of it feel hollow. What we're seeing is cool, but none of it carries any weight; what should be a rousing finale to a series rings a bit flat because there was not a proper build up to it. Yes, this movie spent a long time setting up the finale, and they did it as well as they could, but for the kind of impact they were clearly going for the series needs to build up to it from the get go. This is my biggest problem with the film, it's not the shallow characters, the massive plot holes, or the annoying comic relief characters; those are all par for the course with a movie like this. My biggest complaint is that Transformers did not have the ambition or the foresight to build any sort of arc into the trilogy. Almost nothing from the first two films has any impact on the events of this film (the second film is particularly overlooked). This does not feel like Transformers 3, it feels like Transformers: Yeah, We Did Another One. When you make a trilogy like this, it's essential to have a narrative that ties them together. The reason Return of the King is so powerful as a conclusion because the rest of The Lord of the Rings builds up to it, the same goes for the Star Wars trilogy, even the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy creates an arc for its story and its characters so that the ending feels like the culmination of everything, not just another ending of another movie. In my opinion, that is the biggest area where Transformers: Dark of the Moon fails, that it does not build on any established narrative, but instead goes in an entirely new direction and therefore feels less satisfying than it could have. Again, though, this is Michael Bay's Transformers, so to expect that kind of foresight to go into it is a bit silly. So let's shift gears and focus on some things I did like.This movie, has far less embarrassingly juvenile humor than either of the previous films (THANK GOD!). Oh, there's still some in there, but we don't have anything as facepalm worthy as masturbation jokes, Bumblebee peeing on John Turturro, Mudflap and Skids, or ""I'm underneath the enemy's...scrotum."" Outside of the juvenile humor though, there are some things are actually legitimately funny John Malkovich has a fun, albeit brief, role in the film, and Shia LeBeouf has some great interaction with a character played by Patrick Dempsey. I was also impressed that there were one or two plot twists in this film that actually managed to surprise me. It was nothing super heady, but the script was at least intelligent enough to keep you on your toes, even if just a little bit. And of course the visual effects work by ILM was amazing, and is a shoe-in for the VFX Oscar this year.So all in all Transformers: Dark of the Moon was an enjoyable film. It vastly exceeded my expectations based on what we got with the last film, and while not as satisfying as it could have been still had plenty of cool action sequences and fun moments. If you liked the first Transformers at all I would recommend it, if not, than this isn't going to change your opinion on the series at all.B-",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It suddenly jumps from the main plot to Sam's life, and vice-versa, which gives you impression that your watching an action-movie with commercials on TV. No matter how hard you try to get yourself suck in it, BOREDOM still dominates. But 1 scene has actually impressed me.

I am also kind of hoping that has some coherence in the filmmaking industry, for that means I shall never have to endure another one of these overproduced, headache-inducing clumps of schlock again. Michael Bay has struck out three times now and I hope he stays on the bench.It's never been the premise of the ""Transformers"" trilogy, all directed by Michael Bay, that I've had trouble with. On the contrary, it was a setup that I really rooted for. It was the execution that I've always had problems with. The lumpy writing, the overblown running time, the unfunny (and mildly offensive) so-called humor, the action scenes so poorly directed that it was hard for me to even appreciate the skill and craftsmanship required to bring them to life.My criticisms of the first two movies return once again for the third (and hopefully final) installment, embarrassingly titled ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" As it turns out, when Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969, it was to exploit an alien spacecraft piloted by refugees from the robotic planet Cybertron. Flash-forward to present day and we have Sam Witwicky (still played by Shia LaBeouf) with a new girlfriend (Rosie Huntingly-Whitely) and a bigger egomania than ever. When Decepticons start popping up all over the world again, he comes to discover that they are planning to revive their fallen planet. From there, the plot continues to thicken, all the way up to a preposterously boring climax which stretches a seemingly endless forty-five-minute stretch and wrapping up with a cold, lifeless halt instead of a rousing conclusion.Like the two movies that came before it, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" has amazing visual effects. The transfiguring mechanical titans are blended seamlessly into the live-action backgrounds and with their flesh-and-blood costars. There is hardly a single weak special effects shot in the movie, and there are hundreds of them. And yet Michael Bay and screenwriter Ehren Kruger once again choose to toss their intrinsic awe and power out of the window in favor of overpopulated, bland stick-figure human characters. There are not only too many human characters in the movie, but they are all very badly-written and oftentimes poorly-acted. Even Mr. LaBeouf, who was charismatic in the first movie, is obnoxious here as all he has to do is act pompous and schizophrenic and shout all of his dialogue until his voice goes raw. Even great talents like Kevin Dunn, Josh Duhamel, Frances McDormand, even John Malkovich, are given excess screen time to do next to nothing. Gone is Megan Fox and that is a shame, for her replacement, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a complete bore. Not only is she resorted to just standing around and screaming while the camera lasciviously ogles at her lower extremities, but unlike Miss Fox, she does not have any real star quality. I did not think Megan Fox's performances in the first two movies were particularly good, but there was a budding talent, a promise that she would one day become a considerate actress.I never got that sensation once with Miss Huntington-Whiteley.There's not one character who is interesting enough to deserve so much attention, and yet Mr. Bay lingers upon them consistently, over and over again. And when the transformers are on-screen, they have nothing to do either. They don't do any more than what they did the first two times around, which is change forms, make sloppy cultural jokes, and mutter pseudo-intellectual mumbo jumbo. When they take each other on, director Bay shoots everything at such close angles and so fast that it was impossible for me to tell which robot was on which side, who was transformed and who was not, which robot was betraying his side and who was not, who had died and who had survived, and bottom line, I just did not care. And that cheap gimmick of an action scene first playing at regular speed, them all of a sudden slowing down, and returning to normal pace does not wow here. It didn't work before Mr. Bay used it and it certainly doesn't work now that he is using it.Now I will admit there were a couple of nifty moments that I did like. And guess what? They did revolve around the special effects. An out-of-the-blue battle on the highway scene, with Mr. LaBeouf being tossed out of his transformer-car and then caught again was quite thrilling, as were the scenes with a new robot equipped with giant worm-like tentacles. I wish he had been in more of the movie. But as a totality, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is just another clanging, obscenely overproduced mess from an aggressively misguided director. It clangs and clangs for a punishing 157 minutes, which seems like twice that long, and then cuts off without really ending. But that's fine with me, because I would rather not revisit this same scenario again.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
this movie stinks,"This movie is a real disappointment; it's just really bad. Great special effects. Bad screenplay, overacting, no chemistry (love interest), no character development, the works. There is absolutely no connection between audience and the characters. Bay and his team blew it big time. Big mistake dropping Megan Fox; they should have worked out their differences. One would think Spielberg would know better. Her character went through all this stuff with Wiwicky that would forge a lifetime relationship and it lasted a year, please. I bought the movie based on the first two; I'm going to give it away. The next Bay movie will be low on my list of things to watch.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Dark of the Moon"" is the Real ""Transformers"" Film!","The first ""Transformers"" was an enjoyable experience back in 2007. Even though it wasn't great, it was still a great experience watching the film. But the second one back in 2009 had a considerable drop in terms of quality from the first film. Even Michael Bay accepted the fact that ""Revenge of the Fallen"" was a sequel with a precipitous drop in terms of quality from the first film. Then ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" was announced with Bay promising that it would be a good film. And yet, it is. ""Dark of the Moon"" is a significant improvement from ""Revenge of the Fallen"" and is absolutely the best installment of the franchise.As its predecessors, ""Dark of the Moon"" has a mediocre plot. As mediocre it is, this is how it goes. Back when Apollo 11 landed, Neil Armstrong and crew were given a top secret mission to investigate a Cybertronian spacecraft that had crash landed on the Moon years ago. They discover several robots and kept the operation secret for a long time. Later, the Autobots and Decepticons learn of its existence and race to get it which can lead into two results; if the Autobots get it, the world is saved, if the Decepticons obtain it, humans will be enslaved and Earth will be used as the base to rebuilding Cybertron which would result in the destruction of most of Earth.""Dark of the Moon"" will take us deeper into the origins of Cybertron. This third installment will include much more robots, and most of them are much cooler than what's already in the previous two films. One takes the form of a Ferrari, one's some sort of professor, one's a gigantic snake-like form driller that's around ten times the size of Optimus Prime, one's super ancient, and there's much more. These robots take the action to new levels and will get our hearts racing so fast like never before.The acting, however was normal. Shia LaBeouf was great in portraying the role of Sam Witwicky. The others were also okay. But newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley seems to have a lack of experience in acting. But anyways, the result here is what you get for casting a new actress who's new to the world of acting, and for one who's new to acting, it's not that bad.The script was kind of awkward though. There were some scenes that were confusing and made me lose track of where the film is heading. Sometimes, these convoluted scenes force the characters to say strange things and I found it really annoying.""Dark of the Moon"" loses points in the shifting of scenes. Sometimes, they make the film look awkward and not really enjoyable as it could be. Here's an example (no spoilers): Optimus Prime talks about something very serious that relates to the fate of the whole world INTO Sam finding a job with humor. Definitely ironic.But besides all those, ""Dark of the Moon"" is definitely a fun ride to experience. The climax of the film takes up almost an hour and is definitely satisfying. The huge and dangerous robots compliment to the thrill levels of the fight scenes. The fight scenes are super awesome!The 3D in this film was acceptable, although it wasn't exceptional. Depth was sometimes conspicuous, though. But at other times, the robots and the explosions were out of the screen. But definitely, the scene which had the most amazing 3D effects were when the title showed up during the beginning of the film. That was amazing!The special effects in one word: amazing! There's no need to complain about that. The robots, the explosions, the fires, were simply amazing. But what was shocking, and funny, was how they used CGI to create the face of John F. Kennedy during one short scene. The face was clearly different from the others' faces. But good try though.Through halfway of the film, expect some reminders of disaster films such as ""2012"" as well as ""Terminator Salvation"". But what amuses me in these scenes are: where are all the people. I mean, it was only a few minutes after the destruction of the world began, and the terrified people only started running away. But then, minutes later, millions of people started to vanish and barely any person was there.But anyways, that doesn't matter. ""Dark of the Moon"" is satisfying.To wrap things up, ""Dark of the Moon"" is simply a great film and definitely worth watching. I know ""Revenge of the Fallen"" was a bummer but ""Dark of the Moon"" will replace that horror. 3D is not a bad choice to watch this film. I truly recommend watching this film. But remember, don't get the expectations too high. If you do so, you'll be really disappointed with this film.Michael Bay's promise is fulfilled. ""Dark of the Moon"" delivers. It is absolutely the real ""Transformers"" film we've been waiting since 2007.Prince AJB's Rating: 8/10 (Great)Thank you for reading my review on ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"".

I hate when movies frustrate me,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon was such a terrible movie! It had poor acting, casting, and sequences. Whaah! The movie involves, now unemployed, Sam as he uncovers a Decepticon plan that could end the world. He tries to confront the government along with the Autobots, but no one listens for some reason. Then things get out of control.Where to start? Casting! As stated by others, our hapless semi-hero, Sam is dating a collagen infused model who works for a billionaire who gives her a multi-hundred-thousand-dollar car?! The Decepticons somehow keep getting these ridiculously powerful additions, while the Autobots get weak comic relief. Shia is still Shia--who is annoying and frustrating. All of the old characters return and Bumblebee is still the fave--funny because he doesn't talk.The story could have been interesting, if they would have focused on it instead of slow motion explosions and long, boring scenes that include being slung through a building by a robotic snake for what seemed like an eternity. Worst of all was the repeated placement of Sam's parents throughout the movie. I mean, in the midst of the looming danger, Sam talks to his parents about relationship issues! I fast forwarded through it and lost nothing.Other dumb things: Sam does parkour through Chicago. The decisions of the US officials were idiotic and only served to drag out the film. I was dumb for watching it (even though it was free).This movie was trash and Michael Bay continues with his efforts of essentially making movies that have the feel of a 2-hour beer commercial.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The film is once again (like all of Bay's films) loud, obnoxious and relentlessly in your face.  It's also a lot of fun if you're into that sort of thing!","'TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON': Four Stars (Out of Five)The third chapter in director Michael Bay's immensely popular super robot franchise, based on the popular 80's cartoon show and Hasbro toy series. Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, Kevin Dunn, Julie White and most of the rest of the cast are back. With one obvious exception of course; Megan Fox. Due to conflict with the film's producers (Bay and Steven Spielberg) Fox was fired from the project. She's been replaced by popular Victoria's Secret's model Rosie Huntington Whiteley (who has worked with Bay before on a 2009 Victoria's Secret commercial). Also new to this film are John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey, Ken Jeong and others. Ehren Kruger (who co-wrote the last installment) returns as the sole scriptwriter this time around. The film is once again (like all of Bay's films) loud, obnoxious and relentlessly in your face. It's also a lot of fun if you're into that sort of thing.This adventure begins in 1961 while the Autobot's and Deceptions still wage war on their home planet of Cybertron. An aging Autobot known as Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy, who also voiced the character Galvatron in 'THE TRANSFORMERS: THE MOVIE' 1986 animated film) escapes the planet with special teleportation technology called Pillars that could end the war for good. He crash lands on the moon and has been wrecked there ever since. When Optimus Prime (once again voiced by the legendary voice actor Peter Cullen) learns that the U.S. government has known about Sentinel's whereabouts and the Pillars for some time he becomes extremely angry and makes it his mission to bring Sentinel home to Earth. The Decepticons meanwhile lay in wait, waiting for the appropriate time to strike and seize control of the Pillars. Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf reprising his most famous role) at the same time is struggling with unemployment (even though he helped save the world twice and earned a medal from President Obama) and feelings of inadequacy while trying to impress his new super hot girlfriend Carly (Huntington-Whiteley).The story is once again pretty simple but things still seem to get very convoluted and hard to follow (in classic Michael Bay fashion). The film always moves at breakneck speeds regardless of what's going on (whether it's a simple dialogue scene or an elaborate action spectacle). It jumps from slapstick comedy to emotional drama to explosive action, without a moment's pause, and back again (constantly). The whole thing becomes very exhausting (like all of Bay's films) and you really need some strong caffeine or some kind of drug (whatever LaBeouf is on) to keep up with it. This kind of material can definitely leave the viewer with a severe headache if they're not in the right mindset. With that said the movie is still a heck of a lot of fun and you get far more than your money's worth (there's so much going on). The scam is that it takes you three or four times of seeing the film just to process it all. The action scenes are breathtaking, the 3D visuals are arguably the best since 'AVATAR' and the comedy for the most part is very funny. The script is a complete mess but that's not really important with this type of film. LaBeouf's shtick is getting a little old but for me it still works. The guy has so much energy and is still hilarious in the right role (and Witwicky is the perfect showcase for LaBeouf's comedic and improvisational talents). Some people hate the parent characters but in my opinion Kevin Dunn and Julie White are always scene stealers in these films. Huntington-Whitely does a good job of looking extremely glamorous and beautiful (and that's all she really has to do) but I still prefer Megan Fox (or anyone more real). Bay's directing is once again Bay's directing; you either love it or hate it. I personally love it. Seeing one of his films is a very unique experience and it is almost like being on drugs in a way. It's mind-blowing! I love creative independent films made for next to nothing but I also love big visually exploitative films (made on budgets of 2 to 300 million dollars). I think there's room for both types of film-making in the marketplace and one style doesn't hurt the other. They can co-exist! If you enjoy these types of films you'll definitely enjoy this one too.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeZHJaLfc8",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just two words - very poor,"Where do we begin?Plot - infantile at best; Dialogue - banal (and couldn't understand Shia at all); Bad guys - predictable; Cameos - people turning up for no apparent reason. What was Frances McDormand thinking? John Turturro only there because he was in the other films. John Malkovich? No idea why actors who can act were in a film that didn't require them to do it. Oh, right. Turn up, breeze through it, bank a whole lot of money. Shame on you; Casting - was it names out of a hat?; Characteristion - Michael Bay not bothered about that; Diversity Policy - offensive racial stereotyping all the way.On the up side, the Transformers and the effects were brilliant. Pity they got such a small look in.Didn't even get to the end of it. Couldn't have cared less about 30 minutes from the end. I was hoping that the Decipticons would destroy the civilisation that had brought us this drivel. No such luck.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
awful,"I am puzzled as to how this movie can score a 6 out of 10 (at time of my writing). I mean this is proof that Bay has paid people to put up fake reviews for his movie, or maybe Bay himself is pressing the IMDb high ratings button HAHA hey you never know! Anyways, Bay, also known as Michael 'oh-look-at-meee' Bay - needs a lot of supervision when making movies. He can shoot a car chase and military paraphernalia, but other than that, nothing else. I was traumatised as a kid way back in 1986 when I watched Optimus and his old skool Autobot buddies get killed in The Movie; sadly to say I am once again traumatised watching this Bayhem of a Transformers franchise. I am slowly recovering knowing the Bayhem trilogy has ended. This Bayhem franchise reminds me of when Batman was with Clooney and Kilmer; so hopefully the next reboot will be how Nolan did to the Batman franchise. Transformers Begins perhaps. Dark Robot? Cybertron Royale. You get the drift....",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Why, Ridiculous","Hi,I saw the other two, first one was entertaining, second one was awkward and I just stayed up late to watch this third one......... its long, its rubbish, its by far the worst one......trust me.I cant believe how bad the scenes were between the new bird (who is hot and English and cant act) and Sam, so cheesy, so pointless. Its hard to watch...How do people get away with using such bad scripts, i don't get it. the film costed so much and they couldn't even be bothered to make it understandable, not that i couldn't follow it, i just couldn't comprehend it. It goes nowhere, the editing is terrible and i made no connection at all with any of the characters, the comedy was awful, i wanted to enjoy it and i'm open minded to all films, but please don't watch this, i beg you.The only reason i didn't give it a 1 is because of the SFX, as usual the best bits are when the autobots are going off their tits. But the storyline, acting, stupid soppy scenes and inappropriate credits music are ridiculous, aggravating and tedious.Imagine a great film, like taxi driver, or the lord of the rings or whatever you love. That feeling you get after seeing a great film, you know, when you know you have taken something away forever...its nice isn't it.....................HOWEVERTHIS FILM WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANYTHING TO TAKE AWAY APART FROM A DEEP AGONISING FRUSTRATION, NAUSEA AND A NEED TO WRITE AN ANGRY REVIEW ON IMDb.Michael Bay, I dislike you for planting this mess on society.

Booooooring,"The basics of the story are pure genius, but they don't follow through. A little more consistency would've taken at least an hour off the plot, and I'm not talking about the endless end-fight only. The main story is nice 'n complicated. Lots of inconsistencies to keep it going, but nice in itself. The inconsistencies are pretty tolerable although they're clearly meant to augment the uptime. My girlfriend fell asleep during the end-sequence about five times, while suffering insomnia as I do, I could only think ""take out that goddamn tower, Optimus, so we can get on with the rest of the evening we planned."" Get it digitally and watch the main story till about 1h50', then feel free to skip 5' from time to time, you won't miss out. A cut version, about 1h30', would be pure genius, smashing action and storyline, never wasting watcher's time and giving us our money's worth. As it stands, I re-respect editors in their job, but clearly this thing hasn't had any. BTW if they allot Megan Fox the-kind-of star qualities, it only gets worse with this new kid. And she hasn't got 1/10 the looks (sorry, half wouldn't cut it). It would also be nice of IMDb to respect my carriage returns, but that'll be too much too ask.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not one iota better than Revenge Of The Fallen.,"No, it isn't the re-release of one of Pink Floyd's greatest albums, it's Dark Of The Moon, the third explosion-packed instalment of Michael Bay's Transformers trilogy. The first film was average at best, and the sequel would have been the worst film of 2009 if not for the hopelessly unengaging Terminator: Salvation. Unfortunately, Dark Of The Moon fares no better than its predecessors, not to say that I had high expectations in the first place.Shia LaBeouf returns as Sam Witwicky, the anonymous hero of the human race and co-leader of the Autobots. For the most part, peace has been restored with the Autobots now working as covert operatives solving international conflict for the U.S government. But when a decades-long secret hidden on the moon becomes known, the Decepticons return to wage war against their ancient enemy and relocate their home planet of Cybertron to Earth.Scorsese, Tarantino, Aronofsky, Spielbergall major directors of the modern age have gotten to be just that big on the back of reputation, and a toolbox of film techniques that they use to leave their mark on every project. Michael Bay could also be included among these filmmakers, but for all the wrong reasons. His films are typified by shallow characters, gratuitous explosions and a script that feels like it was written the night before the film's first screening. All of these traits are on full display in this film, and are just one part of why this movie is so disappointing.At a little over two and a half hours, this is the longest film of the trilogy, and doesn't it feel that way. The entire film plods along with unnecessary opening scenes and a mind-numbing final set piece. The whole First Act, and most of the Second, is centred on Sam and new girlfriend Carly's personal life, dealing with his failed efforts to get a job, and growing paranoia stemming from Carly's friendship with her boss. You would expect these useless scenes to result in a rushed conclusion, if not for the fact that the climax is also painfully drawn out. This might sound primitive, but I can only watch robots fighting each other for so long before it gets repetitive and I begin to lose interest in exactly who's fighting who, and why.But not all the blame rests with Bay. Writer Ehren Kruger delivers an uninspired script packed with action-hero clichés and one-liners that are just plain lame. If you want to give the goodies the odd 'tough-guy' line then do so, but don't have a two-on-two battle won by the Autobots end with 'class dismissed'. I don't expect Oscar-winning writing from these kinds of films, just enough creativity to keep it from feeling stale before even the film's halfway point is reached.Dark Of The Moon also suffers from obvious follies, recognisable by even the most casual film-goer. Why does a robot need a headscarf? How does a robot grow hair? Why do two robots that have barely ventured outside the NASA headquarters have thick Scottish accents? And on at least two occasions, the protagonists hide behind a wall and go unseen by the baddies, when in actuality a five year-old could find them in a game of hide and seek. Things like this just scream of an overall lack of effort in allowing audiences to suspend their disbelief.It's easy to say that Michael Bay and Paramount Pictures had the last laugh, since I left the cinema in disappointment having already parted with my money. Truth is, if another Transformers is made, I will see it if for no other reason than to expand my mental library. The mere fact that this film is cohesive enough for people to understand what in the world is going on is all that keeps it from falling into the chasm of films that should never be exposed to human eyes. But this is little consolation for an all-round failure in filmmaking.I'm yet to check if any part of the soundtrack syncs up eerily with The Wizard Of Oz.

Where's John Malkovich?  Where's my refund?,"This movie is so much like the first one, but only in regard to leaving out major characters in favor of crazy special effects in the finale. It's like a trademark of the ""series"" - introduce characters, set up the premise, and then trade in the characters for some outrageous, over-the-top and pointless action scenes to close everything out. Also, the plot is really bad, and the coincidences that had to happen to make said plot anywhere near plausible are so implausible that it's nowhere near plausible. I just gave myself a headache. At any rate, the robots look incredible, so the movie gets a 4.BUT - this is definitely going on the list of movies I want a refund for. Please listen to me and don't watch this movie in the theater.

*A Spectacle of Action and Visual Delight*,"""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic experience that catapults the franchise into a realm of ambition and spectacle. Directed by Michael Bay, this third installment is a stunning blend of heart-pounding action, cutting-edge visuals, and a narrative that intricately weaves the fabric of history with futuristic lore.From the moment the film opens, viewers are thrust into a captivating alternate history, revealing the role of Transformers in pivotal moments of the past, including the space race and the Apollo 11 moon landing. This creative backdrop serves as a brilliant canvas for the film, elevating the story beyond just a simple battle between good and evil. It's a reminder that the universe is rich with possibility, and the Transformers have been intricately involved all along.The visual storytelling is nothing short of extraordinary. Each frame bursts with vibrant colors and jaw-dropping CGI that pushes the limits of what audiences expect from a blockbuster. The Autobots and Decepticons are rendered with a level of detail that makes them feel more alive than ever, with intricate designs that showcase their personalities amid the chaos of epic battles. Whether it's the stunning transformation sequences or the sprawling urban combat in Chicago, every action scene is a meticulously crafted symphony of destruction and kinetic energy.The emotional stakes in ""Dark of the Moon"" also resonate on a deeper level. The relationships between characters-both human and robotic-are explored with surprising depth. Sam Witwicky's journey is no longer just about saving the world; it's about self-discovery and the bonds forged in the fires of conflict. The evolution of characters like Optimus Prime and Megatron drives the plot in thrilling directions, making their conflicts both personal and universal.The film's score, composed by Steve Jablonsky, enhances the emotional impact, sweeping viewers up in a tide of adrenaline as the melody echoes the themes of bravery, sacrifice, and loyalty. It's a soundscape that lingers long after the credits roll.""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" has its critics-some pointing to the film's length and moments of melodrama-it's undeniable that this movie makes a bold statement. It encapsulates the essence of what a summer blockbuster should be: a thrilling ride filled with wonder, action, and moments that tug at the heartstrings.""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is not just another sequel; it's a transformative (pun intended) exploration of the power of unity in the face of overwhelming odds. It invites audiences to dream bigger, fight harder, and remember the unseen heroes in the shadows. A true testament to the franchise's mission, this film stands tall as a monument to creativity and imagination in modern cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Hands-down the most visually awesome action spectacle you'll see this summer- this third entry is easily the best 'Transformers' movie to date,"We are happy to announce that ""Dark of the Moon"" is our vote for the best film in the trilogy. It isn't just the bombast that puts it ahead of its predecessors; rather, this third movie boasts a stronger plot and well-developed characters- human and machine alike.Like this summer's ""X Men: First Class"", writer Ehren Kruger legitimises the sci-fi premise in a real-world context by taking a revisionist view to past events. Through the extended prologue, we learn that the space race of the 1960s was really a cover-up to investigate the remains of an alien spaceship crash on the far side of the moon. Bay injects this alternate history with gravitas by using both archival footage of JFK and Richard Nixon and re-enactments of what went on inside NASA as well as the White House, and this terrific opening portends a darker film than what we have previously seen in the past two movies.Bay and Kruger makes good on this tantalising promise with the new human and machine character additions. Chief among these is Sentinel Prime, once the leader of the Autobots during their war with the Decepticons on their home planet Cybertron and a father figure to Optimus Prime. Sentinel's allegiance and subsequent actions blur the line between good and evil amongst the Autobots and the Decepticons, and for lack of a better description, make the machines more human and also more interesting.On the side of the humans, it is Patrick Dempsey's Dylan, boss of leading man Sam Witwicky's new and equally Megan Fox-hot girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) who turns out to be unexpectedly intriguing. At first no more than a romantic rival to the recently graduated Sam still struggling to find a job, Dylan turns out to be- pardon the pun- more than meets the eye once the war between the Autobots and the Decepticons unfolds proper on our planet.While there is significantly more depth to some of the characters and the story compared to the earlier films, Bay still resorts to the kind of easy humour characteristic in the first two 'Transformers' movies. Yes, despite his promise to tone down the goofy humour, there's still plenty of it on display whenever Sam appears on screen without some sort of battle raging around him.It's a pity too that Bay also uses acting veterans John Malkovich and Frances McDormand only for cheap laughs- Malkovich as Sam's tyrannical boss; and McDormand in an essentially one-note character as the no- nonsense national intelligence director Charlotte Mearing. Also unfortunate is Bay's frenetic handling of even these made-for-laughs scenes, which would have worked better with a lot more subtlety and finesse.But of course, the above two qualities are not what Bay is known for- despite the benefits a more varied change in rhythm could have done for the film- and sure enough, it is this brazen attitude that serves him well in the plentiful action bombast that follows in the last hour. Bay begins his non-stop trail of destruction from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., but he reserves the bulk of his firepower for Chicago.By the time Bay is done, little of Chicago's skyline is left- none of the iconic buildings whether Hotel 71, the Tribune Tower, Marina City or even the Trump Tower manage to escape unscathed. But this Bay-hem is also utterly, absolutely thrilling, and features quite possibly some of the most intense action sequences you'll see on the big screen this year. Indeed, Bay has learnt from the criticism of ""Revenge of the Fallen"" to hold his shots for longer so that his audience can get a sense of the awesome scale of the unfolding action, and my goodness does it totally rock!The highlight of this colossal climactic sequence takes place inside a toppling skyscraper as Sam, Carly and returning face Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are hunted by a serpentine Decepticon known as Shockwave and forced to slide down the glass exterior of the toppling building. Other breathtakingly exciting extended setpieces include one where Sam and series regular Lennox (Josh Duhamel) are dangling off a metal rod whose sharp end is lodged inside a Decepticon, and another where Optimus Prime faces off against a group of Decepticons led by wounded leader Megatron who makes a return from the previous film. These are especially awe- inspiring when viewed in 3D, and Bay, who was convinced of the format by James Cameron, grasps the additional dimension to amazing effect.Never mind that only 60 percent of the film was in fact shot in 3D (with the rest, especially the closeups, shot in anamorphic and then post- converted), this is probably one of the few films since ""Avatar"" to thoroughly make use of the format. Nowhere is this more evident than in an aerial sequence where a group of paratroopers led by Lennox infiltrate the Decepticon-infested Chicago city, all the while pursued by flying enemy robots. Shot composition by d.p. Amir Mokri is excellent, and there is excellent use of foreground and background to create depth in every scene. The added dimension also helps illuminate the other technical achievements of the film- the mix of physical staging, live-action stunt work, location shooting, and visual effects just seamless and simply remarkable.On pure visual spectacle alone, ""Dark of the Moon"" beats both of the earlier 'Transformers' movie and in fact probably anything you'll see this summer- so kudos to Michael Bay, who has clearly outdone himself by creating his most exhilarating work to date. Yet this third film in the franchise also emerges its strongest entry not just by visuals, but also by a well-grounded plot and rich character additions. Sure it's pure summer popcorn entertainment, but on that level alone, it succeeds immeasurably and on sheer entertainment value, this is the must-see blockbuster of the season.www.moviexclusive.com",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just because it is a third installment doesn't mean it must be a farce,"The third (and hopefully final) installment in the Transformers franchise is just as weak as its immediate predecessor and far weaker than the opening salvo in the trilogy. The scenario setup had promise though. The Apollo program and the space race were an elaborate front to get to the moon and check out a UFO which crash landed there. This crashed ship turns out to be a casualty from Cybertron and naturally holds some cargo which both the Autobots and Decepticons desire. These events are combined with more historical fiction including Chernobyl and with quality writing could really have taken off somewhere intriguing. Unfortunately, Michael Bay chose to focus on an extremely uncharismatic Shia LeBeouf and his insecurities of unemployment, jealousy concerning his girlfriend, and wishing he had more recognition from his previous attempts to save humanity. To extend an even bigger weakness, John Turturro is also back again and now seems like even more of a Daffy Duck sidekick instead of an actual human being.Michael Bay tries harder this time to make the hand-to-hand combat amongst machines work but anyone sitting in the audience will continue to find it quite challenging to tell the difference between Autobot and Decepticon until they somehow untangle themselves. Also, the humans scurrying around beneath their robotic feet while dodging falling bits of building somehow never get accidentally squished which should really give a lot of credit to the machines situational awareness.The Autobot leader, Optimus Prime, reprised his ministerial role and speaks only in philosophical platitudes which contribute nothing to anyone and is most likely why he receives far less screen time to perch on his soap box and spout them at whoever is unlucky enough to be in the room when he begins a sermon. His speeches resemble a page-a-day motivational calendar.The female lead this time, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, is not Megan Fox but is interchangeable enough that it does not matter. Casting also added ensured the new accent brought a British accent with her to make her even sexier to the American male audience. The first hour of the film has her getting in and out of quite a few low-riding vehicles in extremely short dresses which have most of the audience straining to catch a glimpse. I wonder if Megan Fox left this series before or after she read this script; she dodged a bullet here.The new additions of Patrick Dempsey, Francis McDormand, and John Malkovich hold their own with limiting material but Ken Jeong's character is just flat out ridiculous. John Turturro is already in the film to provide the lame comic relief; adding Jeong helped make the first hour even worse than it was already shaping up to be.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
action action and action,"The best so far, action all the way and a CGI eye candy. I especially liked the first minutes of Dark Of The Moon because they used real footage from the moon landing and the who and why suddenly Russians and Americans wanted to go to the moon, because there was something on the other side, the dark side of the moon.I was happy that the stupid humor from Revenge Of The Fallen (2009) was left out of this flick. And the voices of the robots that annoyed me in Revenge didn't annoy me here somehow.Also have a look how Megan Fox was finished in this flick due a few sentences and if you listen closely yo can spot that Michael Bay finished her off. Out Megan Fox and out was her career. The new comer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly the new love of Sam (Shia LaBeouf). Shia performed excellent again, Rosie was just in it for her body and legs. Alos on board was John Malkovich (Bruce), always nice to see him but his new teeth made me watch that in stead of the flick itself. I would also like to mention John Turturro as Simmons, he's so funny.The effects are again extremely well done. The start of this flick and Buzz Aldrin being involved made it all more believable.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not very good.,"the stars goes for the special effects, the rest is worthless. One to many smart one liners in this movie. Rosie Huntington should never have been a part of this, and if you really disagree then someone have messed with the intentions of her casting - cuz she's boring and I can't see what the meaning of her part of the movie is - other than standing here and there in tight dresses.Shia is OK. But that does not save this franchise.I could puke for all the one liners this movie has implemented, and someone very very in lack of imagination should have chosen to make a coca cola commercial instead of wasting ours and their own time on this project. Transformers has been deemed dead after this failure. Franchise over!",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"TRANSFORMERS: DARK Of The MOON (Michael Bay, 2011) **","The original TRANSFORMERS movie from 2007 was about the only Michael Bay effort I had enjoyed. The first sequel (which came out 2 years later), however, was a dreary mess and, while its follow-up has been touted in some circles as the best of the series, a local write-up gave it the thumbs-down; having watched the film for myself, I have to agree with the latter opinion!To be fair to it, the first half is not bad – even if one has to swallow the ruse that Apollo 11's 1969 Moon landing (complete with stock footage, and barely look-alike actors in long shot, of JFK and Richard Nixon, not to mention the presence as himself of one of the real-life astronauts involved in that historic moment i.e. Buzz Aldrin!) was really a covert mission to inspect the crash-landing of a massive space-ship emanating from the dying planet Cybertron! It transpires that the leader of the benign Autobots, Sentinel Prime, had succumbed in that disastrous escape flight but his body is retrieved and revived by his successor, Optimus Prime (who had already featured in the first two entries).Their nemeses, the Decepticons, soon learn of this and they determine to put their hands on the remaining set of pillars (they are already in possession of about a hundred others) that would save Cybertron and guarantee their dominance. However, Sentinel is not quite what it is played up to be, having sold out to the Decepticon chief, Megatron (which itself lies in a state of disrepair for much of the proceedings, the result of its failure to gain the upper hand in the two previous TRANSFORMERS pictures). In the wake of this, humans decide they can no longer trust the Machines and the Autobots are banished; this concept of 'aliens' being misunderstood, feared and ultimately hunted down was also at the core, as was the JFK cameo and the fact that a famous political incident has been incorporated into the narrative for that matter, of X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (2011) which actually preceded this viewing!Anyway, mixed with all of this are the usual suspects – Shia LeBeouf (who after two adventures is still basically at the point where we first met him, despite his having been honored with a medal for valor by none other than President Obama!), his girlfriend (Megan Fox having been dumped by the production, her character is suddenly deemed fickle and unworthy of our hero{!}, so she is replaced here by the likewise stunning but even less able acting-wise Rose Huntington-Whiteley and John Turturro (returning as the eccentric ex-CIA operative who has almost gone bourgeois in the interim). Also on hand are Frances McDormand as a supercilious CIA bigwig (her would-be comic banter with Turturro belongs in a Coen Bros. movie but clearly not here!), the even more incongruous (and basically irrelevant) casting of John Malkovich – evoking Jack Nicholson – as LeBeouf's touchy boss and Patrick Dempsey as Huntington-Whiteley's own hunk of a superior (who is improbably revealed as being in cahoots with the evil Decepticons!).The worst part of it, though, is the fact that the climactic action bout takes up the entire last hour and it does not even prove especially exciting (more often it is noisy and inordinately muddled) apart from the spectacular set-piece in which the protagonists are trapped inside a leaning skyscraper: when eventually thrown out and made to slide down its façade, they are required to shoot at the windows underneath in order to break their fall and literally drop back safely into the building!",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best movie ever made,"Just seen the premiere in IMAX 3D and Michael Bay has nailed it. After two fairly good transformers movies he has delivered the crème de la crème. This masterpiece had all you could want and more. A sensational plot (not gonna spoil it for the rest of you) bringing together more of the side characters, countless action, many emotional moments and times of laughter, and the 3D made James Cameron's Avatar look like something made by a 6th grader. Also The much criticized Rosie Huntington-Whitely greatly surpassed expectations and left me thinking Megan who?. This film is amazing and must be seen even if you are not the biggest Transformers fan. 10/10. Heres fingers tightly crossed that Michael changes his mind and comes back for a few more. Would love to see what he could do with the Unicron story and Megatron's reincarnation Galvatron.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Like the First Two, You'll Like This!","Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the third installment in the highly-lucrative franchise. Regarding whether this film is any good or not, my title for this post says it all. This movie is very similar to the first two films except the visuals and effects are even more over-the-top which I didn't know they could do. I happened to like this film because this is my kind of movie. I enjoyed the two and a half hours of explosions and more battles between the Autobots and Decepticons.In this film, Sam Witwicky returns as the hero who saved the world except he can't find a job. He has a girlfriend that is not Megan Fox. He gets caught up in these robot fights again when the Autobots are betrayed by one of their own and the Decepticons are intent on destroying Earth by moving Cybertron, their home world to Earth.The acting is pretty good with one exception. Shia LaBeouf is pretty good because you know what to expect out of him. John Turturro is solid and as usual, brings more comedy to the film. I liked the additions of Frances McDormand and John Malkovich's charm because they are two wonderful actors. I didn't like the new chick because she just seemed phony and pathetic. I wish they brought back Megan Fox because she can act a little bit.Overall, this is a film with impressive visual effects even thought it sort of lacks a plot. I didn't mind that because I wanted to see cool fights and extreme visuals. That is exactly what I got. I love these kind of movies because they are perfect examples of summer popcorn films. I don't know how they did the visual effects for the last hour of the film, but they were impressive. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not worth the ticket nor the time if you're free riding,"I liked the first film. I didn't desperately love it, but I liked it. I thought that film had some heart and soul in it. I think this sums it up pretty well: I felt shivers down my bones (I get that easily) when the Autobots revealed themselves.The 3rd installment is just as bad as the second was. Don't pay much attention to those who say it's better - it's just as bad but in a different way. The 2nd was way too packed with action and mindless scenes where we were supposed to care. The 3rd has much less action, which should not be a bad thing. However, the lack of action is replaced by meaningless characters doing, well, pretty much nothing of any consequence.I'd just like films like these to have characters with some level of dignity. Why is John Malkovich such an ass? He's like crawling on the floor ranting something incomprehensibly stupid when seeing the Autobots. John: Walk in the room, have a look and have some dignity and grandeur about yourself.A very very poor film indeed. With this budget, what could you have made... oh my. I give it 3/10 - which 2 points more than some films have gotten from me, because at least I could watch this one to the end without falling asleep.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awful,"Cool effects, but absolutely nothing else. The story was too thin to carry it longer than a half hour, yet it runs 2.5 hours. There isn't one likable character (though John Malkovich and Ken Jeong are pretty funny in their brief appearances). Many characters are introduced late in movie, and then only because more bodies are needed to populate the screen. I'm not really certain who the intended audience is here. Hasbro produced the movie, ostensibly to keep the toys selling. Yet, the movie is clearly not for kids. Autobot violence is one thing, but there are scenes with guns that go too far. The language is also too strong for kids, with several s--t and even a couple f-bombs dropped in for bad measure. It is also much too silly to be taken seriously by adults. Despite a couple tearful attempts, there is no heart or soul to it. The direction is very inept and Bay seems to still be getting the hang of melding live-action with CG action. I suppose he will keep going until the toys stop selling.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Marginally better than the second film, but it still contains many flaws...","Collectively the two previous live-action 'Transformers' instalments have grossed over $1.5 billion dollars worldwide between themselves in a little more than two years, so it was always inevitable that Bay and Paramount would re-team for a third film to round out the robotic trilogy. However, just like its previous cinematic instalment, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is a poorly crafted, overlong, robot-infested-mess which is populated continuously with cheaply written dialogue and over-the-top acting.In 1961, John F Kennedy tells the American public that they will endeavour to put a man on the moon before the end of the century, but what the American public isn't told is that the space-race has been commissioned to reach a Cybertronian craft that has become stranded on the dark side of the moon. However, nothing is never simple as it seems, as Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is once again drawn away from his post-graduate job-hunting and attractive British girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and is placed slap-bang in the middle of the reoccurring war between the Autobot protagonists, commanded by Optimus Prime, who must once again stop the villainous Megatron and his Decepticon partners from destroying planet Earth.At two-and-a-half hours in length, 'Dark of the Moon' is just a long, tedious film to watch, which is primarily down to the films incredibly disjointed plot. For the first two acts of the film, Bay continuously jumps between the romantic-comedy and action-adventure sub-genres, before deciding to simply settle on an all-out extended action sequence, which then culminates in a third act which contains nothing more than exploding robots and extended scenic destruction. In between the constant on-screen destruction important plot-points are information is seemingly thrown at the audience hoping to create anything that can be seemingly considered a workable and engaging plot. Despite having a potentially workable premise in using the moon landing of 1969 to establish a link between the extra-terrestrial robots and humanity, it is instead reworked into a complex plot involving years of conspiracies that are never fully explored nor investigated.Alongside the disorganized plot, Bay once again attempts to place considerable emphasis upon the actions and choices of humanity, rather than the Transformers themselves. For example, in during the beginning of the final climatic fight sequence, Sam is about to save his girlfriend himself from a dangerous, metal-laden fortress, however as Epps (Tyrese Gibson) is unable to follow due to the impending doom that lies ahead he instead offers the pesky young adult a hand-gun, just in-case he encounters any large and sophisticated robotic killing machines. This is the conclusion of a sequence which shows all the former soldiers coming together out of retirement to help Sam and the human race, before they decide that the situation is ultimately too dangerous for them. All the while the Autobots are eventually introduced back into the situation with yet another preposterous explanation that just further cements films lack of structure. This focus upon humanity isn't helped either by the stale acting and cheesy script which despite newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley attempting to work beyond stereotype she is unable to do, as the script clearly has her labelled as nothing more than 'Sam's attractive love-interest'.Once again Michael Bay has attempted to circumvent the simple rules of filmmaking by filling his third Transformers film up to the brim with energetic action-sequences and detailed computer generated imagery hoping to cover the fact that it contains a convoluted and difficult plot, sub-par acting and terrible dialogue. 'Dark of the Moon' would work perfectly if the final climatic fight sequence was released as a stand-alone short film examining the effects of modern-day technology on film-making, but as a two-and-a-half-hour feature film, the third film in the Transformers franchise misses the boat (once again) completely.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
awful!,"Mickael Bay is coming back with his new season of the ""Transformers"" road show.Let me start with an anecdote : do you know how Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were created in the 80's ? The target audience were kids, so the marketers came with a list of what kids used to adore : comics, reptiles, kung-fu films and pizza! For the exact same reason, Mickael Bay and Paramount marketing dept are coming back with robots, race cars, heavy weaponry ... and centerfold girls! And that is why Sam (Shia LaBeouf) is an adulescent, a teenager who depends on his girlfriend and his parents for a living. Anyway...The introduction of the film (linking the Apollo program with fictional events) is appealing, but the rest of the script makes absolutely no sense. The motivations of Sentinel Prime are absurd, and nothing is really logical in this movie.The cinematography is awful. The action scenes have no rhythm, and Bay constantly relies on camera shaking and slow-motion. The SFX are awful, robot 3D models are difficult to visualize.Acting is terrible. Of course, LaBeouf does not how to play, but I would expect something better from Malkovitch and 'Torturo'! This is really a film you should avoid.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
