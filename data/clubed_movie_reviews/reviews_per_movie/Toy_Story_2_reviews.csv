Pixar is improving: near perfect...,"I just saw Toy Story 2 an hour ago and I must say that, despite all the great reviews, I was still surprised about the quality....It started absolutely marvellous; one of the greatest and humorous opening sequences ever. The plot is really smart, the animation is brilliant and the humor...Oh man! The last 50 minutes must be the most fun 50 minutes I had in years and believe me, I'm NOT exaggerating. It seems impossible to imagine the fun the writers must have had, because this is a true film-fest whether you do like  Disney-esque films or don't.Having this fast-paced storyline, John Lasseter & Co. exploited it to a maximum. Cameo's from Pixar-characters (Geri's the coolest), unexpected and obliged references to other big films (really love the Jurrasic Park one), great new characters (Wheezy!!), and more jokes and gags rammed in an animated feature than you'll ever see and of course the out takes.The action-department is also greatly represented in some astonishing sequences with great, original shots and angles. The music is moody and Randy Newman is at his best with the really non-disturbing, appropriate song about Jessie, which is definitely the message of this film.O.K., I know I'm raving, but I really meant it when I chose the ten and clicked the ""Vote"" button. This film is great and I recommend it to every film-lover.A few downsides (this hardly affects the overall film) are I think, first of all the lack of originality, which is excusable and acceptable for a sequel. Second, the still somewhat jerky animation of the humans (I know they said it was supposed to be, but I disagree that). And third: the ratio, 1:1,85 (I thought it was the theater, but Pixar is forgiven, seen the quality of the film.) These are minors things and my decision is final, Toy Story 2 is certainly included in my top 20.O.K., now you may stand up and ring a friend to go and see it, come on!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Funny, Exciting and Thoughtful: What more do you want?","PIXAR has done the impossible, and significantly improved on their original groundbreaking film Toy Story. Not only is the movie hysterically funny, but every time I thought I knew where the plot was headed something completely new and original was thrown into the mix. One minute I'm laughing hysterically at ""Tour Guide"" Barbie, the next I'm nearly brought to tears watching a sequence where Emily grows up and leaves Jessie behind.What more can be said? If you think you're too old to enjoy something like this then I feel sorry for you, because this film has more to say about friendship, loss, loyalty and the value of life itself than any of the so-called ""grown up"" movies I've seen this year.I rarely do this, but I'm rating this one a ""10"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A great sequel,"This has to be by far one of the cleanest and most well-designed movie to come from any studio for a while now. The plot is trim and concise and this film is not just for kids, there are plenty of grown-up themes to satisfy even critical viewers. The animation is tremendous, especially if you pay attention to the details, and the cameo from Geri and the underlying Star Wars spoofs are just great. All in all, one of the best films I've seen to date. Just one disappointment, no outtakes during the credits.

Collector's Item,"Hugely entertaining sequel, that lacks its predecessors compact and harmonious storyline as well as its dark subtext. Instead, we've got our toy friends on an epic rescue mission through town, along with some all too obvious pop culture references - another Star Wars parody, please?! - and sightly forced action moments.But it's still a good movie, full of funny one-liners and meticulous care for detail. The characters - old and new - are as amiable as ever, and here and there Pixar is still able to achieve moments of great beauty and wit.7 out of 10 double Buzzes",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Entertains adults just as much as it will children. One of the years best films. ***1/2 out of ****,"TOY STORY 2 (1999) ***1/2With the voices of: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Kelsey Grammer, Joan Cusack, Jim Varney, & Wayne Knight Director: John Lasseter   Running time: 85 minutes   Rated GBy Blake French:In an era where audiences are given such few family movies, and in a time where such films are seldom given decent scripts, ""Toy Story 2"" is a jolt of lightening in the fast fading genre of unobjectionable entertainment. Over the past several years we've received filmmaker's poor attempts at granting us enjoyment with an orphaned raised by jungle apes, bouncy green slime, a massive gorilla reeking havoc on a major city, a child fending off robbers by himself near Christmas, a small boy's attempts to rescue a battered dog from his cruel owner, a canine playing football, a colony of ants in trouble, a talking mouse, and even a film version of an old cartoon about a man filtered with countless gizmos. None of those desperate family tales work. I think you can understand through these examples that when a great children's film does finally open, and entertains adults equally as much as it mesmerizes its target audience I give it the honor of being one of the years best movies.""Toy Story 2"" continues the traditional lives of the characters brought to our attention in the original movie released in 1995. What makes ""Toy Story"" unique is the fact that the characters are mostly toys. The familiar faces include everyone's favorite cowboy Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Hamm the piggy bank, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the cowardly Tyrannosaurs Rex, the Army Sergeant, Little Bo Peep, and the Slinky Dog. The sequel film introduces several new characters in its presence consisting of Prospector Pete, Jessie the Cowgirl, and antagonists, a  greedy human named Big Al and robotic video game figure called Zurg. The plot has to do with several of the toys rescue attempts to save Woody from a money hungry thief who intends to sell him to a different country.Just a few days ago I screened the somewhat similar, although unsuccessful, family comedy ""Stuart Little."" That movie failed because it attempted to blend our human world with the likes of pure fictional fantasy; a talking mouse that acts like a human. It is hard to except something like that without an explanation--giving the filmmakers no choice but to get into a complicated, logical explanation that would bore the majority of an audience. ""Toy Story 2"" needs none of that explication. It contains its illusion outside of our world, creating a tale that inspires our imagination. The filmmakers do not try to compare the likes of toys being alive with reality. It creates its own atmosphere which seems unfamiliar and magical. It is a place that lives within our dreams; everyone has hoped for their toys to come alive at one time or another. ""Toy Story 2"" brings this world to life to the quality of the original ""Toy Story."" This movie is a landmark in the gender of animated family comedies that should be treasured for all that its worth.Brought to you by Walt Disney Pictures.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not as good as the first one.,"Toy Story 2 is just not as funny or as clever as the first Toy Story. There seems to be lots of filler (ie. needless action and chases) and not enough witty interaction between the characters. Even the voice performances seem to be a little lackluster. Still, I laughed out loud more than a few times and was only slighty bored in the middle section.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Wonderful, imaginative film","This film is definitely a pleasure and a joy to see, a very well done sequel.  I wouldn't be surprised if it would spawn yet another sequel, raising the bar even more for computer animation, such as this film has done.

Excellent Pixar Entry,"When Woody (Tom Hanks) is stolen by a toy collector, Buzz (Tim Allen) and his friends vow to rescue him, but Woody finds the idea of immortality in a museum tempting.Clearly the ""Toy Story"" series is the crown jewel of the Pixar Studios. As of 2015, they have had three films and they may be making more (which is a big gamble, but they are three for three thus far). Some people have argued that this film is better than the first film. They may be right. It is at least as good.The added ""villain"" of the toy collector (Wayne Knight) was a great idea, and gives Woody a back story that was missing. Was it necessary? Maybe not. But it brings these characters to life, and shows us that life exists beyond Andy's bedroom. Such a grand adventure for such small heroes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Better than the original,"I thought the original Toy Story was great.  I went to this movie hardly knowing anything about it.  Toy Story 2 exceeded my expectations; it's better than the original Toy Story.  This movie works on two levels.  It's aimed at younger kids, who will love the wackiness of the characters and the situations they find themselves in, though some of the jokes might sail over their heads (but they'll laugh anyway).  It's also aimed at adults, who, when I saw it, laughed louder than the kids at some points.  The voice work is excellent, especially Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, reprising their roles from the original.  The supporting toys (Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, et al.) have much bigger roles this time around.This movie has everything: Andy's new dog Buster; two dueling Buzz Lightyears; partying Barbie dolls; three 3-eyed aliens from the original; even the Evil Emperor Zurg!  I can't emphasize enough how great this movie is and I highly recommend it for kids and adults.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another Instant Classic From Disney,"""Toy Story 2"" is equal to its predecessor. Some may say it is better (I am not sure about that) but it is on par with the original. This time Woody is stolen by a greedy toy collector and it is up to Buzz Lightyear and their friends to rescue him. The film is great-looking, the voice characterizations are all perfect and the film's screenplay is so intelligent that ""Toy Story 2"" would have been successful under the worst of circumstances. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Even Better Than The First 'Toy Story',"Here's yet one more sequel that more than lived up to its original great start. The first Toy Story was outstanding. This is just as good, if not better.Very fast-paced and very entertaining, this doesn't have a lot of laugh-out-loud parts but is definitely fun to watch with many good lines. What I appreciated was the lack of a nasty villain and any evil overtones, as was the case with the rotten neighborhood kid in the first film.I also appreciated the fantastic surround sound on the DVD, along with the magnificent colors. Not to be forgotten is a wonderful, tear-jerking song in here, sung by Sarah MacLaclan. It gets to me every time.When you factor in all the nice characters, music, colors and sounds, this has to be one of the most beloved animated films of the modern era.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Amazingly Good,"It is very rare when an excellent movie is followed by an excellent sequel. Toy Story 2 has done just that. The blending of wonderful animation artistry, terrific writing and great voice overs continues thanks to Pixar. Lots of films claim to be appropriate for all ages and rarely are. I'd recommend this movie to adults with no children! Toy Story 2 is that clever.Toy Story 2 has a great time making fun of itself and other movies such as Star Wars and Jurassic Park. The humor is constant and is simply right on. As Toy Story was a buddy picture, Toy Story 2 pokes fun of commando rescue films, as well as computer games and barbies. But as with Toy Story this is a film with a heart highlighting not only the friendship of the original group of toys but adding some interesting new ones too.Toy Story 2 is an escape into a rich and wonderful fantasy world.

Although Jessie talking about her Emily with Sarah McLachlan singing is very mesmerizing. I liked the rescue party much more. I especially love crossing the street in the traffic cones. The best new character has to be Tour Guide Barbie. She makes all the other toys better. Whenever the story moves back to the rescue team, it gets back to fun and humor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Toy Story 2 (1999),"There are few sequels that can equal or even surpass its original, and for an animated feature, perhaps Toy Story 2 is the first of its kind that didn't end up going direct to video. I'm unsure why I hadn't caught this in the theatres, given that I've thoroughly enjoyed the first Toy Story. I've taken 7 years to finally watch this gem, and of course, to include myself into the legions of Pixar fans out there who have watched every single animated feature they produced.Toy Story 2 remains the only sequel that Pixar put out, though I'm rooting for The Incredibles to make another appearance on the silver screen. Bringing back its stellar voice cast like Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, and favourite characters that have endeared themselves to us, I'm thrilled that there is so much more story that can be told of our favourite toys in Andy's room.What worked, at least for me, is that the story and characters appealed to the child inside. I own quite a number of toys as a kid, and yes, I outgrew them, although most of them are still stored in boxes somewhere around the house. Perhaps some of them are small collector's item in their own right, and as a child I did wonder if the toys do come alive to wreck havoc around the room before they retire in time and clean up before I wake up.Of course toys do not come to life (or do they?) but here in this sequel, the exploration of the friendship theme takes on a different dimension when Woody finds himself with other toys from the same collection as he is - a cowgirl Jessie, his trusty steed Bullseye, and a prospecting character known as Stinky Pete. The dilemma he faces is whether to cast aside his constant fear of Andy abandoning him for good, and opt for life with his new found family in some museum somewhere, where he'll be appreciated for many moons to come, or to return with Buzz and his friends for the life he has grown so accustomed to.The adaptation to change, loyalty, abandonment, friendship - a lot of themes for a children's movie, but that again is the appeal of Toy Story, that it can be viewed at different levels, for a child who can enjoy the animation and the story at one level, and for adults to reminisce and enjoy it on another. By deftly handling the different themes, and appealing to different segments of audiences with the same movie, Pixar exhibited exactly why they're top dogs in this field.As always, the music and animation are excellent, and given that I'm watching this now and found it enjoyable, I think they have a film that can stand the test of time. I hear of rumours of a third Toy Story movie, and if that were true, I'd say bring it on!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Impressive,Not too often that a sequel is as entertaining as the original but Toy Story 2 manages to achieve this rare feat.We get to spend more time with the characters we developed so much affection for in the original.The Toy Story saga has found a way to create special moments of magic that have touched a lot of people over the years.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The best Pixar film (so far) and a good bit better than the original,"I liked TOY STORY but didn't love it. It had some wonderful moments (I liked the creepy and destructive kid next door), but it seemed marketed almost exclusively to young boys. In light of this, I was absolutely thrilled when I saw TOY STORY II, as it's a wonderful film for the entire family. For the boys, you have the familiar characters of Woody and Buzz, for the girls you have a new girl toy (Jessie) and for the adult, you have some great characters as well (Stinky Pete and the guy in the chicken costume). Plus, the writing is so amazingly clever and engaging you can't help but love the film. I particularly loved the showdown with Emperor Zurg, Barbie's guest appearance and all the cute little touches as well as homages to toys of yesteryear. And, for once in my jaded career as a reviewer, I have absolutely nothing negative or critical to mention--I enjoyed every minute of this delightful film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Begins with great fanfare, but it can't sustain that level of excitement","Disney/Pixar's sequel to 1995's ""Toy Story"" is over-inflated with fun. Though it smoothly introduces several fine new characters and has colorful voice-over work and energy to spare, the plot this time (taking some of the toys out of the bedroom and into the big cruel world) doesn't sustain much interest. Woody gets snatched at a yard sale by a toy collector and learns he's a high-priced rarity in the antique market; Buzz, Slinky Dog, Rex and Mr. Potato Head come to the rescue. Best moment is the funny sci-fi opening (which manages to be satirical and exciting), and Woody's introduction to his heretofore unknown history is wonderfully presented. The big rescue, while lively for younger viewers, is lengthy and full of manic action; there's so much bombast (and hollering from the stars) that the intricate details and warm nostalgia which earmarked the first ""Toy Story"" slowly slips away. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Cute Toys Are Back With A Bang For More Adventure,"It's been about a decade since I last saw 'Toy Story'. Thus, it would be unfair to compare that with 'Toy Story 2'. Pixar has produced numerous gems since the first 'Toy Story'. This one is a sheer delightful adventure and it's not one that is only limited to entertaining children. There are the charming characters from the old one and some wonderful new characters that include the energetic Jessie the Yodelling Cowgirl, the hot barbies and Woody's faithful and hyper steed. The animation is superb and looks refreshing. The story too takes a new turn that presents the dilemma of whether one should live an eternal life of wealth and security or an unpredictable life that at least promises a few years of love. The actors do a fine job lending their voice. Hanks and Allen are back as Woody and Buzz and Joan Cusack is a treat as the vivacious Jessie. But I must add that I loved Buzz's gang that includes the hilarious Rex and the lovable Slinky, the resourceful Mr. Potatohead and the cute Hamm, and their attempts to rescue Woody and bring him back home. There's a beautiful song by Sarah Mclachlan that dictates Jessie's pain. The sequel being a huge hit just proves how timeless the characters are and I want to see 'Toy Story' again just to follow the whole story. It's already been a decade since, but I wonder whether they'll make a sequel and what the fate of our toy friends will be once Andy has grown up. 'Toy Story 2' is an unforgettable adventure with a beautiful soul.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This is one of those rare sequels that's even better than the first one!,"""Toy Story 2"" (1999), this took a legendary first movie idea, and made a sequel that's even better. Still to this day, it's nothing short of an iconic film, just like most of the other films made by Pixar Animation Studios! Everything is once again 100% perfect, and fires on all cylinders. The story is more complex, yet more engaging than the first movie. The plot line is very unique and creative, it pulls you in right away and keeps you hooked from beginning to end. The voice acting is stellar from all of the voice actors. The CGI animation holds up to this day, as does the animation in the other Pixar films. Finally, the soundtrack is phenomenal and it truly brings this movie to life. You can play a little part from any part of the music score, and be able to identify what movie it is right away. That just shows you that you have a memorable soundtrack! Pixar, without a shadow of a doubt, makes the best CGI animated films of all-time. ""Toy Story 2"" took the creative premise from the first one and dove even further. There is more character development, more going on and takes a perfect movie and rises it up to 11. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. I give this film a full 5 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. This movie is perfect for people of all ages. If you haven't seen ""Toy Story 2"" yet, which would surprise me greatly, I mean seriously, who hasn't seen it? Go watch it, I guarantee you'll love it!

Excellent sequel,"Toy Story 2 brings as back to Andy's toy chest and all those quirky little toys that inhabit it. By now Buzz Lightyear has become an accepted and valued member of the extended family and a lifelong friend to Woody. But once again the peace and quiet of the toys is disturbed, this time by Woody being kidnapped by a toy collector.Toy Story 2 hits primarily the same points its predecessor did. The fear of being abandoned, the fear of loosing one's friends, the fear of change. In a nutshell, the fear of growing up, told through the medium of sentient toys. But the story is different enough that, even though the basic message is the same, it feels like a continuation of a story rather than a repeat.It helps that the characters have grown. Woody and Buzz especially. Sure they still have their individual personalities, but I like that they have become such good friends. The new characters are also a lot of fun and have a great backstory connected to them. I could watch a whole movie just about them.But yeah, it is very similar to the original and there is something to be said about novelty. This is a very good movie, especially for children, but it is not the original. You're going to love seeing all your beloved characters come to life once again, but you're probably not going to learn anything you didn't learn in the first film.Does this mean it's not worth a watch?

Computer animation finally comes of age,"All I can say is, the Hollywood convention for naming sequels is unfortunate.  You don't see so many numerals in literature.  What would have happened if `The Lord of the Rings' had been called `The Hobbit 2'?  No-one would have taken it seriously.  If only someone could have found an alternate name for `Toy Story 2', I wouldn't have such a hard time convincing people that it's the second film that's the real triumph - the delightful masterpiece `Toy Story' was trying to be.It's funnier; the animation - well, the art direction, anyway - is better, less concerned with ersatz photo-realism; the musical score is immeasurably more stirring; and the songs actually fit.  Most importantly, the rules of the Toy Story universe are clearly described - and adhered to.  It's an ironclad rule that a toy NEVER moves while being observed by a human.  In the original, as you'll recall, one of the main obstacles is overcome by breaking this rule - which trivialises the whole story, since there are a hundred occasions in both movies where it would be useful for the toys to be able to move while being watched.  To see the sequel is to see things done RIGHT.Furthermore, `Toy Story 2' obeys another golden rule the first film breaks: NEVER deliver a sentimental moral when (a) the sentiment is hard to take seriously, and (b) the success of the story depends upon it being taken seriously.  The original is all about how important toys are to children. In the case of Woody and Buzz, I'm sceptical about this; and in any event, who cares, since it's the toys, not the children, who are the main characters.  The sequel is all about how important children are to toys. That's why the sequel is so much richer.Yet I feel safe in recommending the film to everyone who loved the first `Toy Story', since I'm sure everything lovable about the first is still there.  Buzz and Woody are much the same (but somehow deeper).  And the three-eyed alien dolls are back - with more screen time!Maybe it's a mistake to even think about the original, though, because the sequel is magnificent not by comparison, nor by association - it's simply magnificent.  I'll content myself with mentioning just one more thing: the `bloopers' we see over the end credits.  (I gather `A Bug's Life' did the same thing; but since `Toy Story 2' is almost certainly the superior film, this is of no moment.)  A number of live-action movies have adopted the loathesome practise of showing out-takes and discarded footage over the end credits.

Yes, the animation is outstanding, but so was the animation in the first one.  The only good point was the ""music video"" sequence of the cowgirl's past performed to a beautiful Sarah McLauchlin song.  Otherwise, I didn't laugh out loud once.  I was bored silly.

"Great plot, great characters and laughs for all ages  not really a bad word to say about it","In every toy's life there comes a time where damage and fading interest will take its toll. For Woody this comes when a ripped arm sees him left behind on the shelf awaiting repair while Andy goes off to summer camp. When another toy is taken for a yard sale, Woody goes to rescue him only to find himself trapped at the sale and picked up by a collector  who recognises the worth of the rare dolls. The gang set out to rescue Woody but, with his value as a collector's item and his new friends around him, will Woody want to be rescued?Pixar are going to have a flop sooner or later  either they will misfire or the usual mix of material will start to feel stale. However this has not happened yet and it certainly did not happen with this sequel to their great Toy Story. Keeping similar themes the film delivers a plot that is quite moving at points and has plenty of thought for adults to ponder while the kids laugh at Buzz falling over. In fact this mix of adult material and kiddie material is, as ever, the film's appeal as it does cater so well to both extremes of the market.The plot is great too and is well supported by great characters in the main who really draw us into the story  considering how often computer effects can just be 'effects' and nothing more, it is to Pixar's credit that so often you just forget these are effects and see them as characters in their own right. The plot gives them plenty to do but their delivery is also spot on  actors can have off days and get their body language wrong, but here the computer characters can be manipulated just how the director wants them to be  this really helps the delivery of the character as body language and movement is a big part of it. The voice work also really helps and, as before, everyone is spot on whether they be just delivering jokes, playing comic bad guys or dealing with more emotional stuff. Hanks is really good, Allen is much better than his TV work and other films would suggest and the support cast is very good  with great turns from new voices such as Knight, Cusack and Grammer but also the regulars of Shawn, Ratzenberger, Varney and Rickles.The laughs are consistent and great. I'm sure kids love it but for me the adults get the best deal  getting the universal laughs as well as the adult stuff and the loads of movie references. I won't start listing best bits or references but suffice to say that the film gets it right  enough straight laughs and enough general references to make sure the film lasts and is not tied to the period in the way that, say, the Scary Movie films are (by spoofing recent films).Overall this is a very funny, very enjoyable film that has a great plot, great characters and the cast to back them up. The laughs are good for all ages but the adults will get the majority while the kids miss most of the better stuff. I don't like gushing, so I'd like to counter my praise with some critical observations but, to be honest, I don't really have anything bad to really say about it. A great film to see with the kids.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A pleasant sequel,"A very pleasant sequel, which I personally enjoyed much more in a recent rewatch.While the CGI might be a little bit dated for modern standards, the clever writing still remains fresh to this very day, with a rather endearing plot and delightful characterization.The overall tone is decidedly more sentimental than the one from the first movie (Which had a surprising number of jokes often verguing into black comedy territory for a Disney film), but there is still plenty of fun to be found here. In addition to that, the emotional scenes are narratively effective and never feel forced, setting the tone for the excellent third part in advance.Wish I had appreciated it more back then, since the first three Toy Story films managed to encapsulate perfectly well the magic Pixar used to have, back then in the time when the motto ""Story is King"" was in full display, rather than merely following modern trends.8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It won't be the same coming from me,"Whilst on another adventure, Woody faces a huge dilemma about his future.'Toy Story 2' is an excellent sequel that wonderfully mixes comedy, emotion and great character work in a spectacular animated feature.It has character moments and humour on par with the original and introduces some strong new characters. Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammer and Wayne Knight are inspired additions to the cast. Much like the original it uses the brilliant toy universe concept to construct a very enjoyable plot.Where I think it is stronger than the original is the emotion and character arcs, particularly involving Woody and the Round Up characters. Toy Story for me has always been about the angst of parenthood. No better is it captured than in this movie with characters like Woody and Jessie embodying the fears associated children growing up and forgetting about the ones who love them unconditionally. It is shown incredibly well in one heartbreaking, sucker punch of a montage sequence.Much like the original and used to even greater effect are the music and sound effects. Songs like 'Woody's Roundup' and 'When Somebody Loved Me' are memorable and used fantastically.It almost goes without saying that the animation and spectacle is of the highest quality. 3D animation is more than likely taken for granted these days but when I first saw the sequence with the 'Cleaner', I was blown away.All the voice cast are on top form as always.For me it's a 9.5/10 but I round upwards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
They made this movie within 9 months. 9! Don't give up on your dreams.,"This movie, without question, fails to live up to the purity of the original. Right down to the callbacks and the often slack narrative, TOY STORY 2 only further highlights the truly unique experience of the first one. One of the few crazy ideas that alchemized into something thoughtful, character-driven, and thrilling, there's no way it could be replicated. I mean, just look how A BUGS LIFE turned out.But with all the baggage held against the sequel, it's also without question it's the most ambitious. Thoroughly expanding its story to deeper, more existential questions, it's the rare sequel that earns its EMPIRE STRIKES BACK level praise. It's finally a movie that questions what truly makes for a great life for a toy: standing behind glass walls and loved by everybody forever, or live with a finite relationship with a child destined to grow out of you soon.Buzz gets the backseat this time around, centering the story on Woodys turmoil while his space friend endure some hijinks to rescue him. People might say his side story is the sole weak point but I'd argue it's necessary for the story; it's a lot of heavy themes at play, so the gang deliver just the right amount of humor to level the tone.By now, everybody knows the Prospector turns out to be a last minute bad guy at the end. My take on this is how seamless of an antagonist he is; the idea that all toys are destined to be thrown out looms heavy on these characters. So much so that any of these characters can snap to immoral tendencies at any minute. This is why Kelsey Grammer delivers a phenomenal performance here. He's comforting as the Prospector but you can clearly hear the history behind it all. You can hear the desperation of his character, let alone Jesse and Bullseye too, and the film slowly builds that desperation into villainy that seems tangible.As for Jesse, let's just say there's a particular moment with her that personally spoke to me. Not gonna say which though, seems like an easy answer.Again what can I say; TOY STORY 2 is a grand achievement that could've done much less.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Solid Sequel Lacks Some Fun,"In addition to pushing the envelope in what animation could do, ""Toy Story"" was such a crowd-pleaser it was a no-brainer to make a sequel. To their credit, the creative team at Pixar used their brains anyway. ""Toy Story 2"" is enjoyable, at times rousing entertainment the whole family can enjoy, but the sometimes clumsy attempts at injecting seriousness into the first movie have become much more overt and annoying.What's right with ""Toy Story 2""? A lot, beginning with the eyepopping improvements to the animation technology just four years brought. In ""Toy Story,"" in 1995, the human characters like Sid and Andy's baby sister looked more cartoonish than the toys, while Sid's vicious pet Scud looked like an escapee from a late-'80s Commodore computer game. By 1999, the humans are so lifelike it hurts, especially if you are fat and balding like Al (and me.)Add to that a clever story arc that allows Woody the cowboy doll (voiced by Tom Hanks) to leave Andy's room and discover his true origins, which turn out to be a great deal more impressive than he imagined. A Howdy Doody-like relic of the 1950s, Woody turns out to be quite a prize antique, especially when paired with fellow members of his old Roundup Gang, as assembled by Al, the owner of a giant toy retailer who has stolen Woody from Andy's mother and plans to sell the set to a big-money collector in Japan.The revelation of Woody's past is pretty clever, especially when we see excerpts of his old show with hilariously bad marionette work. The comedy involving the greedy, porcine Al (Wayne Knight) is well-done, as is the emergency work back in Andy's bedroom to get Woody back where he belongs. The once-acidic Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) turns out to be quite the whipped spud now that there's a Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris) in the room. ""I packed your angry eyes, just in case,"" she says, and it's dynamite voice casting, like so much in the first movie.I never quite got into the Roundup Gang, however. Joan Cusack tries too hard as the spunky cowgirl Jessie, while Kelsey Grammer, terrific in his work as the Simpsons nemesis Sideshow Bob (an obvious inspiration here) brings nothing new to his role here. They are so dull that you wonder why Woody would even think of spending his time with them.It's ironic that the creators said the story was designed in part to deal with the limited availability of Tom Hanks, because I missed Tim Allen more in this one. Actually, he has a dual role, as two different Buzz Lightyears, one being the space action figure we saw in the first movie, the other being an upgraded version freed from Al's Toy Barn who joins the rescue mission. But the original Buzz, now that he's with the program, is a pale echo of his old self (which was more of a friendly, fair-playing rival of Woody's than a second banana) while the new Buzz recycles a lot of the fish-out-of-water lines old Buzz had in the first film, because, like old Buzz in the first film, he's just out of the box and doesn't know what's what.The movie goes off into some strange existential territory for a while, about the futility of a toy's existence which takes itself very seriously. Woody decides to leave Andy, seeing clearly a future where the boy will chuck him for more grown-up pursuits. One comment I read here asks if this is right; that many children, seeing this movie, might be reluctant to give a toy to charity, which is what we see happen to Jessie here. Worse crimes have been committed in the name of art then discouraging toy donations, but it does feel like this film is advocating an unnaturally backward position upon its core audience.Yeah, okay, enough dime-story philosophy. You will have a good time watching ""Toy Story 2"" if you liked the first one, and most people did. It's funny, fresh, and exciting, especially with the rescue mission, and the animation is spectacular. But why do people say this is the better film? Other than the technology, it's in every way a lesser product.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Toy Story 2: My Good, Bad, and Ugly","The Good:
Pixar realized the need to expand on all aspects of this film, because they knew technology available improved and the end product needed to reflect that. And, as a sequel they knew there would be an expectation to raise the bar already set fairly high by the first film. To help achieve that higher goal Pixar truly doubled down on the scope of the narrative. Woody, Buzz, and company spend their time in a variety of locales and are subject to the dangers of the outside world significantly longer than in the first installment of the franchise. By leaving the bedrooms of Andy and Sid, and the arcade of Pizza Planet, Toy Story 2 ramps up the stakes by adding depth to the question ""Will they or won't they succeed?""The Bad:
A more ambitious and complex story also requires more diligent storytelling to ensure that continuity standards carry over from the initial installment to its sequels. Perhaps there's a good excuse in the narrative failings of this film in the production complications, but there are failings in the storytelling nonetheless. Most glaring of the film's misses are inconsistencies of the film's physical reality. Even as animated films typically benefit from their ability to stray from the laws of the natural world, Toy Story didn't establish these kinds of deviations for the franchise. And so, without an understanding that the Toy Story universe differs from the real world even in small extraordinary ways, when toy horse, Bullseye, can match speed with a passenger plane, or when a bowl of cheese puffs spills and covers the entire floor the thematic depth of the film takes a backseat and leaves the audience asking ""How?""The Ugly:
As with the first film of this franchise this film is likely only truly surpassed by its successor, Toy Story 3 (Lee Unkrich, 2010). Pixar increases the thematic depth once again from film to film showing its evolution not only in available animation technology, but with storytelling. With Toy Story Pixar presented is with a simple story of jealousy, friendship, and purpose. Those themes return in Toy Story 2, but also includes more about discovery of self, self-worth, and the pitfalls of ego. Stellar narratives are not singular to the Toy Story franchise among Pixar films, but as these films released Pixar demonstrated its ability to craft a franchise through deep emotional connections between the characters and the audience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Joan Cusack has an annoying voice!!!,"OK, am I the only one who thinks that Joan Cusack is one of the biggest casting mistakes in all of animated movie history? Her voice is screechy, whining, grating and unconvincing as a cartoon character. Why the studios thought she would be good as a ""voice"" mystifies me. She spoiled this movie the first time I ever saw it because her range as a ""cartoon voice"" is non-existent. Even Tom Hanks' voice in this sequel is sometimes annoying and grating, but Cusack as a cartoon character just does not work! Cusack is fine as a leading lady when she is not playing in a cartoon.Annie Potts was perfectly cast. My favorite continues to be Wallace Shawn -- nobody compares to his voice talents. As in the first film, Mt. Shawn outshines everyone else as one of the most endearing characters in all of animation history. For some reason, Rex always has the best lines in this film.One of my favorite parts is when the toys cross the busy street using orange pylon cones. That was very clever, if someone contrived.Overall, a good movie, but not one of the best for the reasons stated above.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A Perfect Sequel,"Toy Story 2 is a perfect sequel. That doesn't mean it's a perfect movie, but it follows up on the original in a new, exciting, and meaningful way. Not only did The Universe expand in a way that makes sense for the universe and the plot, but also we got backstory on who woody is. This film feels much more alive than it's predecessor. It captures the excitement and morals of the first and multiplied them by 2.
My main reason for liking this more than the 1st, is because of the themes of abandonment in this film. The ""When Somebody Loved Me"" Scene never fails to bring me to tears. You feel for Jesse and even Stinky pete, because the film showed you what they have been going through, and how woody's actions could possibly change their situation. The dilemma Woody has to go through is heartbreaking, because both sides are actually logical and ethical. There were even times where I felt that Pete was doing the right thing.
The animation in this is alright. Obviously 90s CG animation isn't gonna look amazing, but I felt like the design of some of the humans were bad even for its time.

"The toys seems bigger, but are (to me) smaller...","I must admit that I'm not such a big, big fan of this movie. This is a good and charming movie, but I must admit that I like the first movie much better. This is one of the most overrated sequels ever, even this movie was a huge financial success worldwide.OK, now it's sounds that I'm just complaining about this movie. I enjoyed this film and I'm still enjoying it. But this movie is a little bit more sentimental than the first film, it has more emotions and that's why I think this film is weaker. It contains serious subjects matters like being abandoned, etc. It's okay that Pixar is making a movie about serious subject matters and it makes it more emotional. But it seems darker than the first movie.The script isn't bad, but comparing to the first film where it was more action sequences involved, the story of this movie is a little bit futile. Randy Newmans score is disturbing the story instead of supporting the story.

The voice cast continue to excel and the new additions are perhaps some of the franchise's most iconic characters, too.

"It's good, BUT. . .","Don't have any major axe to grind with this one; it's an enjoyable and entertaining movie, perfect for the whole family. Go see it. But please don't make the ridiculous claim that it's better than the first one. The first one had the true spark of originality - this one is a mere updating, a scrupulous ploy to revisit all the good bits pioneered by its predecessor. Don't get me wrong - it does an exceedingly good job of this, and finds creative and imaginative ways to recycle the material without making the audience feel that it's just seeing the same old thing again (I particularly liked the way it worked in a *second* Buzz Lightyear action figure, so that we could have the fun all over again of a Buzz totally clueless as to his own doll-hood). But, really, when you get right down to it, we *are* seeing the same old thing again: the characters haven't expanded or grown any (how can they, after all - they're TOYS!!) and the plot mechanism is exactly the same - a daring rescue mission to save a toy in trouble. And it suffers the same malady which infects every sequel, the desire to do everything bigger and more opulently, which undermines the low-key charm the original had; instead of staying within the parameters of the neighborhood and a back-yard world, TS2 takes its heroes, more improbably (and impersonally), through crowded city streets, local shopping malls, high-rise office buildings, and finally into the bowels of a large modern airport. All of this is done with wit and originality, but it seemed to contradict the fundamental premise of the first one, which is that any step outside of the bedroom is a dangerous and unlikely one for a toy to make.  What's more, the egregious Sarah McLachlan song in the middle of the movie is one of the most lachrymose bits of over-stated sentimentality ever seen in a Disney movie and almost made me want to bolt from the theater in disgust. The first movie had nothing so wildly embarrassing (the Randy Newman songs being utterly perfect).The moral quandary Woody faces here is interesting, but it's almost too big a theme to introduce into a story of this nature. I was left unconvinced that he would choose the road of built-in obsolescence, represented by going back to Andy, as opposed to the assured ever-lasting fame of being enshrined in the museum. I ended up feeling sorry for the Stinky Pete character, who was supposed to be the villain but in actuality made some pretty good, hard-to-refute points about the ephemeral nature of being a mere child's plaything. You might say I was thinking about this too hard, but the story premise is an intriguing one, and seems to invite more allegorical and philosophical speculation than it delivers; it pulls back in the end and reverts to its big adventure chase mechanics. It seems to me that the first Toy Story did not make this fundamental mistake of biting off more than it could chew; plot, theme, and action were all perfectly integrated in that movie, making it truly one of the minor classics of our age.Anyway - just needed to get that all off my chest. TS2 is an enjoyable movie, no question about it, one of the best of the year. But because of the absolute perfection of its predecessor, I just couldn't help feeling it was somewhat hollow and regurgitated. Here's hoping that Pixar does the smart thing and puts Woody, Buzz and the rest of the gang permanently away in some digital toybox somewhere, letting them live on forever in the shimmering perfection of our memories.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Battling Films,"Shucks, my original comment for this was deleted. Here is a replacement.My admiration for Pixar to date is significant, on the order of rat filmmakers that seem to care about ideas in film. There aren't enough of these, so if you find one (here a collective) that not only has intelligent notions of cinema but also make successful movies, you have to celebrate.Overall, I think this is the weakest of the Pixar films, because it is the least visually adventuresome. What they did instead was explore what I call folding and did so in the written bits, following a pattern where films include the dynamics of other films in some way. ""Blue Velvet"" and ""2001"" are sort of landmark films along these lines, where film types become actual characters. Here the folding is just as radical, perhaps more so because the story overtly mirrors what they are doing.Here's the setup. Buzz  actually an army of Buzzes  draws his existence from space movies, specifically ""Star Wars."" Woody draws his from cowboy movies (actually TeeVee shows) specifically ""Howdy Doody."" Each prototype ""doll"" gets pulled into his original cosmology. That's the background, what usually serves as the establishing world for a movie. Pixar even uses this in the first shots where other movies work to introduce us to a world.Within this movie in the movie context is a foreground story: about the value of ""play"" which we are reminded is a re-enacting or borrowing of stories. Its what life is, I think and we are reminded in the script. They'd trade one day of human play (meaning recovered movies) for an eternity in a sterile heaven.I know that there are many in Hollywood who talk about this sort of story dynamic. There are few that would dare to build a film around it, and very, very few who could do it, make it as visible, overt as it is here, and have audiences be happy for such immersion in reflective dynamics.Interestingly, the original comment was tossed by IMDb along with a couple hundred others of mine because I failed in a similar enterprise. Someone complained because the original included an observation about religion being recovered narrative and increasingly recovered cinematic narrative. That reader at least did not like such baptism.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Heaven forbid  I didn't like it,"I'm starting to wonder if there is a purgatory for people like me who actually admit to people that they don't like mainstream films that 'Everybody Loves'. Like 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' and just about every Meg Ryan film, I just plain didn't like 'Toy Story 2.' (I can hear the audible gasp.) It's not that I am completely jaded when it comes to 'kids' films  or even more specifically Pixar films  I think I chuckled once or twice during the original 'Toy Story' and I actually liked 'Finding Nemo.' While I'll admit that I was basically forced to watch those two films and 'Toy Story 2 for that matter actually, just because it is on the IMDb Top 250 list, I am not afraid to assert that I enjoyed the former two. The latter though. Ugh.'Toy Story 2' basically picks up where the first left off, the conflict this time being that Woody is stolen and is about to be sent to a Japanese museum with three other toys from his 1950's television show. The other toys he normally hangs out with have to try to rescue him before this happens.I chuckled once, and that was when they showed the 'Rock-em Sock-em Robots.'That was pretty much all I could muster for this film, which I found to be boring and lame. The story was topical in terms of the whole 'collector' idea, sure. But it was flat and just plain banal. I didn't find the little one-liners remotely endearing, and what I found nostalgic in the first one (the toys themselves) were old news by the second film.I guess I'm not cut out for these kinds of films; either I expect a little more, or I just don't like typical kid's films. Unfortunately, when a film is released and people go absolutely nuts over it and tell me that I 'have' to see it, and it appears on the same list with films like 'Citizen Kane' and 'Annie Hall', I expect a higher-caliber offering, and others have to expect that there are going to be people who don't like the films that 'everybody' likes.

I did expect more from the Riders in the Sky (I'm a big fan of theirs) involvement of cowboy songs, but then none of the audience got the references to boomer TV shows either as the parents in the audience were way younger than me.Kelsey Grammar was mis-voice cast as the old prospector; he's best as Sideshow Bob on ""The Simpsons;"" I don't know why they didn't pick a wily Western voice instead of snobby Eastern voice. Joan Cusack was a live wire as a cowgirl. Wayne Knight was as terrific a villain like in ""Jurassic Park.""But the animation was fun and the story quite clever. I figure the theme of playing and loving toys rather than saving them for collectors benefits Disney in the long run, as they encourage people to buy two of each!The ""outtakes"" at the end are also funny satires.(originaly written 1/16/2000)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Again my favorite Pixar film of all time much like the first Toy Story.,"Ah, yes, the olden years. What can possibly go wrong? Okay, so after I reviewed A Bug's Life, now I guess it's now the time for me to review a sequel which is my second favourite Pixar film, Toy Story 2. Why? Because right after the olden years, I have been a huge fan of the first Toy Story. Now with the sequel though, me and my friend Harry Kingston have been quoting all the lines in one day. Much like I reviewed The Jungle Book though, we've been quoting all the lines from these two Disney films non-stop. Oh, boy, I really do love animation! Right then, Buzz Lightyear again played by Tim Allen, is on his mission to find the Emperor Zurg right in the fortress. Whilst he find a battery, he found Zurg and defeats him but didn't and you can see that it's only a video game that Rex is playing. Woody, once again played by Tom Hanks, has got a ripped arm which is about a couple of minutes cause Andy has been playing with his toys, so he got shelved and started having a bad dream. As he wakes up, he found Wheezy the squeaky penguin and found a yard sale outside but was interrupted because Andy's mum coming to pick some old toys and took Wheezy with her, so now Woody had to get him back and was taken away by Al who works at Al's Toy Barn. As Woody is in the room where the unexpected toys are in here. One is Bullseye, second is Jesse played by Joan Cusack and third is Stinky Pete. As Woody don't know them but they do because they knew him from the TV show. So Buzz and the other toys, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Rex, and Slinky Dog, (which again portrayed by both actors) set off on the adventure to save Woody. Now as they're watching their TV show, Woody told them he has to get to home but Jesse got upset about it. As Al went to the room, he saw that Woody has lost his arm which is a funny scene. Now the funniest part though is that Woody tries to get his arm back but the TV is unexpectedly on. OK, there are some funny moments in this which I remember. Buzz and the gang found Al's Toy Barn and hide in the orange cones by walking the road and Buzz says ''Drop!'' and ''Go!'' everytime the car or truck gets by. The old man comes to fix Woody and his arm and like AL says ''It's just like new!'' As Buzz finding Woody, he saw a toyful of Buzz Lightyear's like himself and the other Buzz confronts him and drop him in the box and he gang comes across the Barbie store. As Woody know that Jesse is not happy after Woody is happy to get his arm back, Jesse remembers the flashback about that she was someone's favourite toy. As Woody go to leave, he decide to stay and Jesse is happy. So Buzz and the gang still looking for Woody, they heard Al coming, they went into Al's bag. Buzz had found the gang cause he saw Rex's tail and catches up with them but couldn't but did before Emperor Zurg is here. So as Al didn't take his bag, Buzz and the gang had to get out of the car and found an hole of the building and heard an earthquake which is an elevator and Buzz and the gang had to climb up to it. As they found Woody, they stop Jesse and the others and got Woody but was interrupted by the other Buzz Lightyear letting them reveal that he is the real Buzz Lightyear. Buzz told Woody to get back home but he didn't want to and decided to go with Jesse, Bullseye and Stinky Pete so they left. Woody watched the TV show and revealed that Andy is in it and changes his mind and decides to go with Buzz and the gang and told Jesse to go with them and Bullseye but Stinky Pete locks the thing and Woody found out that he is a baddie and got interrupted by Al who is late. So Buzz Lightyear and his gang were confronted by the Emperor Zurg and Buzz fights him and him and his gang go on the taxi where the alien from the first film is in and rides off. That's an awesome scene since I was a kid. As they're here they hide and go to the suitcase fortress to find Woody and Stinky Pete was defeated and now Woody, Buzz and Bullseye had to rescue Jesse. As Jesse is saved along with Woody, they go home and Andy is happy to be back home and find new toys. And now Woody and the gang are home and reunited to infinity and beyond Oh, and Wheezy has been fixed cause he got his squeaker back. Oh dear lord God. I have been watching loads of animation and this back in the older years and me and my old friends from old school had been non-stop quoting. That's what we all love to do. I have been watching Toy Story 2 on BBC 2 back at Grandad Bill's caravan after me and my parents been watching the first Toy Story back at Whitby. I think all the animated films are all on BBC 1 and 2 and I know all of the Disney classics and Pixar films by heart. Every scene, every quote and every song. There's also outtakes at the end of this film and they're are so funny I've been laughing at Stinky Pete farted in his box. This is an amazing movie. Really is just awesome all the way through. Much like Toy Story which is awesome, both films are really awesome and that is Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are all great films. Definitely good as each other. Yes, I know it's too much words and sentences to put out but that's just why I love watching animation and my friends quoting all the lines in every dialogue with me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pixar makes the world a better place!,"I just saw this movie for the first time 15 minutes ago. I'm a big fan of Pixar films, but I somehow missed this when it was in the theaters. Then I got married, and my wife wouldn't allow me to see it until she had seen Toy Story 1, and we could see it together.Anyway, we saw Toy Story 1 a few weeks ago (first time for her, tenth time for me - I used to babysit a lot), and today was the big day - Toy Story 2. I had a lot of expectations, and was not disappointed. I am 30 years old, and this movie made me feel like a kid again.Thank you, Pixar!!Next year, Toy Story 3, which I will definitely see in the cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A rare sequel that can equal it's original.,"After the events of the first movie, Andy has just gone away to summer camp and Woody (Voiced by Tom Hanks) has been taken by a greedy toy collector Al ( Wayne Knight) as later he discovers that he originally had old friends known as Jessie the Cowgirl ( Joan Cusack) and Stinky Pete ( Kelsey Grammar) as he was a famous puppet who had a phenomenal TV show back in the 50's and Al wants to complete his collection so he can get dough from the toy museum in Japan and Buzz Lightyear ( Tim Allen) with companions Ham ( John Ratzenberger), Mr. Potato Head ( Don Rickles), Rex ( Wallce Shawn) and Slinky Dog ( Jim Varney) to rescue him.One of the best sequels out there alongside ""Godfather part II"", ""Empire Strikes Back"", "" Dawn of the Dead ( 1978)"", ""Aliens"", ""Terminator 2"", "" Evil Dead II"", and ""Superman II"". After the major breakthrough of the original classic, John Lasster ( creator and director of the original) decided to do a sequel that extends the first movie's storyline and i think it surpasses the original movie in every way with more emotion, more laughs, and more outstanding CGI than ever before! i also love it how the original cast are reunited once again with a new cast of characters.Most definitely the best movie of 1999 and a winner all the way!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy story 2,"I thought the original Toy Story was great. I went to this movie hardly knowing anything about it. Toy Story 2 exceeded my expectations; it's better than the original Toy Story. This movie works on two levels. It's aimed at younger kids, who will love the wackiness of the characters and the situations they find themselves in, though some of the jokes might sail over their heads (but they'll laugh anyway). It's also aimed at adults, who, when I saw it, laughed louder than the kids at some points. The voice work is excellent, especially Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, reprising their roles from the original. The supporting toys (Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, et al.) have much bigger roles this time around.This movie has everything: Andy's new dog Buster; two dueling Buzz Lightyears; partying Barbie dolls; three 3-eyed aliens from the original; even the Evil Emperor Zurg! I can't emphasize enough how great this movie is and I highly recommend it for kids and adults.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not something to be played with,"Toy Story 2 is a sequel that managed to be just as good as it's predecessor, is it better than the original? I don't know about that, is it just as good? Absolutely, I just watched this for the first time after loving the first one forever, and it is an awesome sequel to an incredible origin story.Toy Story 2 might just be the funniest movie Pixar has ever made, there are so many funny moments that it's hard to keep track of all of them, but while also being really hilarious, it isn't afraid to go to the more emotional side of storytelling, it has a straightforward plot that is quite easy to follow and many very suspenseful scenes, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are awesome in the film and it's got one of the most compelling stories I've seen in a long time.Toy Story 2's characters also manage to work extremely well with each other, Jessie and Bullseye were great additions to the cast and it's got a great character betrayal near the end, and a phenomenally satisfying ending, this film is wonderful and an incredible sequel to one of the best origin stories of all time.I'm gonna give Toy Story 2 an A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Not as funny, original or overall better than its predecessor","I just noticed that Toy Story 2 has been voted in the Top 65 movies of all time. Hey up there, what are you thinking? OK, just here me out here for a second.Lets talk about Toy Story. It was the first completely 3-D movie ever made, truly a milestone in cinematic history. Sure, compared to the dazzling beauty of Final Fantasy and Shrek it may look dated, but its still a classic. Nothing can take that away from it.Toy Story 2 as a movie, not a sequel, is good. There are a few minor adjustments made to the animation to make it appear better but Woody, Buzz etc. wouldn't exist if it weren't for the original. First off, I think TS2 is a bit too long and overdrawn for an animated movie. Buzz could have been used a little more than he was, and the Emperor Zurg sub-plot was slightly bizzare and un-necessary.I liked the way the original was a buddy-buddy comedy which wasn't serious and didn't involve a romance as the basic plot. In TS2 it was way too predictable that Woody and Jessie would fall in love. The rendition of ""When She Loved Me"" was the films downfall and an obvious flaw. It was totally un-needed and made the film more serious than it should have been.Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack) was somewhat, a boring character and shouldn't have been used at all. Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammar) never made a big impact and was a wasted chance. Buzz (Tim Allen) is as good as he was in the original but seemed too much like the supporting cast in this one. Mr. Potato Head, Rex, Slinky and Ham shuld have been used more. When the cast is too big the best characters don't get enough screentime. One thing the movie needed was a character that would bring chuckles everytime he/she spoke ie. Donkey in Shrek.Overall this is an adequate movie but an unsatisfactory sequel which seems to be aimed more at children than adults. 5 out of 10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The toys return,"Toy Story 2 (1999) is a perfect sequel to Toy Story (1995).

The new character Jessie voiced by Joan Cusack is good and the backstory for the toy is heartbreaking once you see it, and there's Woody's horse Bullseye who can be a lovable toy.There are a lot of funny action scenes and there are some references to other movies.

This Toy Story is truly excellent and continues the legacy of the original,"Toy Story, when it came out in 1995, was something of a revolution. It was a definite groundbreaker, on the level of stuff like Star Wars, for nothing like it had been seen before and since then, it has had a slew of followers, none of which have quite lived up to it's greatness (even from Pixar themselves). To date, I have seen story around as often as I have seen Terminator 2 (six or seven times) and, fittingly it ranks up there with my favourite films. So you could imagine my surprise back in 2000 when the sequel to Toy Story, Toy Story 2, continued the legacy of the original. Sure, it isn't quite as groundbreaking, but hell, whatd'ya expect, it's a sequel! To think that Disney was going to make this one straight-to-video. That would've been disgraceful for a film of this magnitude. I have 'only' seen Toy Story 2 around three or four times. As fate would have it, I saw it again last night. As a teenager, I am almost ashamed to be enjoying this film, but hey, that's Pixar for you...not only do they appeal to little kids, they appeal to adults and teens as well. They've always had that mystic quality about them (with the exception of the disappointing A Bug's Life).The plot is decidedly interesting. Woody winds up with a few old collectables from his old show, The Roundup Gang. Turns out that he is of a lot of value. There's Stinky Pete (look for a hilarious outtake at the end credits which shows why he is called 'Stinky Pete') and Jessie the cowgirl. It is here that, us, as the audience, witnesses a somewhat overly sentimental yet interesting deconstruction of Jessie. How she was abandoned by the girl who loved her. Woody, it would seem, will have to face up to a similar problem when Andy grows up. Buzz Lightyear and his crew get caught up at a toy store. On the way, some funny pratfalls do ensue, such as the regimented wackiness of the 'replacement' Buzz and those three aliens (""Look! It's the mystic portal!""). The outtakes at the end also give us a good reason to stick around.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen show their funny sides. It is clear here that Tim Allen can be a funny guy sometimes (shame we rarely see this) and he appears to have found his calling with the character of Buzz Lightyear. Tom Hanks plays Woody like he did in Toy Story; as philosophical yet somehow optimistic cowboy who does not know where to go. They are well supported by Joan Cusack and Kelsey Grammar, who play their characters, Jessie and Stinky Pete, appropriately.There is of course, the animation to discuss. As usual, I will not discuss Pixar's animation in any great depth, since you, the reader, will know what I will say: about how dazzling, clean-cut and colourful it is, etc, etc.In short, Toy Story 2 is a wonderful film which should not be missed for the world, by kids, adults or even teens. It is right up there with the best of Pixar, second behind only Toy Story. That is only due to the fact that the first Toy Story is more groundbreaking. Try as they might, Dreamworks' best, both of the Shreks, cannot realistically match up to either of the Toy Story movies. Time will fly by as you watch this.

Good Movie but might not attract older viewers,"Toy Story 2 (1999, Dir. John Lasseter)Whilst Andy is at summer camp, Woody is accidentally placed in a yard sale. Al, a greedy toy collector spots him and sneaks away from the yard with the toy. Whilst Woody is meeting up with new toys, Jessie the cowgirl, Stinky Pete the prospector and Bullseye the horse, whilst Buzz Lightyear and the rest of the toys enter the real world outside the house to find him.I remember seeing this movie when it was originally released. I must have been around 11 or 12 then. At the time, i absolutely loved the movie. It had a great story, wonderful characters and just looked brilliantly. Now I'm 18, i decided to give the movie another viewing. I still found the characters wonderful to watch, and the visuals of the movie good (although not as good as recent Pixar films), i just found it hard to watch it on without thinking whether this would be classified as a children's film or not.

Almost Unwatchable...,"Well, where to start?... I was a huge fan of the original Toy Story. Saw it 3 times in the theater including the night it came out, own the DVD. I've only seen the first hour or so of the sequel - ended up walking out of theater when I went to see it the day it came out. This is another ""we have to save a toy"" plots. The first one was a ""we have to save a toy"" plot. If you like that and want to see it rehashed, then perhaps you'll like the sequel. Toy Story 2 seemed to me as A) a direct-to-video movie, and B) made for a younger audience. I've tried to watch it several times, still turn it off around 45-60 minutes in. At least on DVD I was able to skip to the end to see how it wraps up. The toy collector plot was simply boring, as were the new characters. Some clever ideas; instead of running into a bunch of the 3-eyed aliens, how about a bunch of Barbies? Actually, why not set Toy Story 2 mostly in a toy store? Imagine the amount of visual gags available, who cares if its basically the same plot? Toy Story 1 was original and entertaining from start to finish - Toy Story 2 was just annoying (the cowgirl, horse and toy collector stuff was uninspired - and I LOVE westerns - probably great for toddlers). I see great reviews so apparently its a loved film, until I can make it through the whole thing, I guess I'll never understand... There is no way I would even bother watching a 3rd one if they make another sequel - especially considering the great reviews for part 2. AND after Cars? Lost a lot of love for Pixar. Unless it says ""Directed by Brad Bird"" I'll probably pass on Pixar from now on.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Successful sequel,"Toy Story was a successful beginning for Pixar and this is the flagship film for the studio. It was slightly worrying that they were looking to sequel the original classic. The sequel is one of those rare films that maintains the quality and emotion from the original. Toy Story 2 is a worthy film and Pixar delivered an impressive film. Sequels make the unnecessary mistake of bloating the film is additional cast, but not here. I don't believe it's better than Toy Story, it just maintains all the impressive quality and continues it here. It's just another worthwhile journey.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Very Good,"I watched the first movie on vhs when I was a kid, but I watched the second movie very late in my university years.

Takes the greatness of the first and expands on it,"How Pixar managed to connect with its audience in Toy Story 1 is repeated here and expanded upon. Toy Story 1 was a great picture, but this one actually eclipses it in scope. The examining of people's relationship with their toys (and the guilt they have upon growing too old for them) is fully developed and given weight. That results in a slightly dark tone to the picture, but a necessary one for the story. This gets played out even further, but to less effect in Toy Story 3. Pixar balances on a very thin tight rope here. Make it too playful and action packed, and the human element is lost. Make it too introspective, and the film becomes sorrowful. But combine the elements just right, and you get...magic! Most sequels suffer from not having the shock of the new. This is not the case here. Not only does the depth and emotional tug of the story grip us, but we are actually happy to be back ""playing with"" Woody and the gang. It's like seeing old friends again and meeting new ones. As always, Pixar proves it is a master of direction, animation, humor, and warmth, but it ups the ante making this a near masterpiece. Finding Nemo amazingly enough would even outdo this picture. Another great movie from a studio that can do almost no wrong!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"excellent successor to an already brilliant original, great script, fantastic cast","This worked for me for three reasons.  1) a great, funny film in itself, 2) I loved TOY STORY, and 3) the trailers ran for three seconds and so didn't give anything away.  I also didn't know who would be in it apart from the main characters so it was fun guessing along the way.  What is really apparent from watching this film is how far the technology has progressed since TOY STORY.  This was already evident in Pixar's more recent offering, A BUG'S LIFE which boasted of great attention to detail and a blooper reel attached to the credits.  The first time I saw TOY STORY 2 I caught the reel, but the second time I wasn't so lucky.  This has caused a real hoo-ha on Sydney's 2BL 702 and I think it's dodgy and ungenerous (since they're in such a good position) for the distributors to have two different versions floating around.  Especially since I saw it for the second time so I could enjoy them all over again.  But, on with the film.  The fantastic visuals combined with the funny script, STAR WARS references and in-jokes (2 references made to films by Tom Hanks) make this a great sequel which surpasses its predecessor.  My favourite part would have to involve the second Buzz Lightyear and that raised eyebrow and megawatt smile of his, the true sign of an American *hero* displayed on publicity posters cracks me up every time.

"""Toy Story 2"" not only lives up to the original film but achieves its goal of giving the franchise a deserved evolution, technically and in narrative aspects","It is a fact. Children grow up and nothing can be done to avoid it. And with this growth, important things, like childhood games, are left behind, as are his old companions: toys. This is the fear of the cowboy Woody and the thread of the great Toy Story 2, a sequel to the 1995 hit. While the first film showed a new way of making an animated feature, telling a fun story of companionship and self-discovery, this second example showed that this technology could be used to bring computerized characters amid even more real and complicated dilemmas, but without ever forgetting laughter and fun.A few months after the events of the first film, a new dynamic was established in Andy's room. Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) share the position of the boy's favorite toys and also the ""management"" of the troupe, with the old rivalry giving way to a great friendship. Not even the puppy Buster has shaken the relationship between the boy and his toys, having been an addition to their adventures. However, on the eve of a trip with Andy to Cowboy Camp, Woody ends up having a tear in one of his arms, causing the boy to end up leaving the sheriff at home, raising him in fear of being thrown away. When trying to rescue another toy from a used store that was also broken, Woody ends up being stolen by Al, a greedy owner of a toy store, leading Buzz to organize a rescue team to save his friend.From this premise, the second Toy Story wants to rethink the meanings of toys, bringing them to a more robust scope than that of the predecessor, which was simpler in comparison to its sequence. In this sense, the superlative approach, common to sequels, that animator John Lasseter and the screenwriters give to the misadventures of Woody and company is an adjunct to the question of market and commercial brands. After having worked with jealousy and envy in the first film, the message of this sequence is more attached to the strength of friendship and the fact that time tends to pass too quickly. Toys have a very short time to be loved by children and, understanding this, Woody succumbs to the idea that it might be better to be sold to Japan, where it could last forever, displayed in a museum. Again, the characters have a depth and a sense of integrity so outstanding that it is difficult not to get involved with their trajectory. Lasseter and his Pixar partners have always taken this care to bring the characters to life. This can be seen in any of the many productions signed by the studio and is no different in Toy Story 2.Here, the secondary characters get bigger roles, the journeys go through more grand environments, new toys are presented. It is very symbolic, for example, that Sheriff Woody's captivity, after being kidnapped by a collector, is an ordinary apartment. When the cowboy sees through the window of Al's (Wayne Knight's) home, the scale is completely different from that observable by Andy's room. Even more powerful is the scene that introduces the cowboy to his previously unknown fame. Woody, who previously only knew his owner's love, perceives a whole world of admiration for him. However, objects and yo-yos with his face do not have the same value as Andy's signature on his shoe and, further on, the journey that Buzz Lightyear begins to rescue his partner.The new characters contribute to Woody's drama. Jessie (Joan Cusack) has a very particular tragedy, which is accompanied by the song ""When Somebody Loved Me"". More than complementing the past of the cowgirl, part of Woody's old television gang, the sequence moves the narrative, creating expressive contours for the sheriff's journey to take other directions. In contrast, the Miner (Kelsey Grammer) realizes a Manichaean threat. The horse Bullseye, on the other hand, has its expressiveness conquered from a clear caricature - that of the crying and friendly pet -, however, which brings more sincerity to the confrontations in question. And there are many conflicts permeating the cowboy saga, starting with the very first, looking for his hat, feeling lost without it. As a collection, the hat is a must. As a toy, Woody doesn't need him to be loved by Andy or to be who he is. From the sadness of realizing that the sheriff does not have his most important accessory to the joy of finding him moments later, Al exemplifies the exact opposite. The script already starts quite vigorously, in the first act, all its dramatic and narrative proposal, which is renewing itself naturally.Directed again by John Lasseter (with Lee Unkrich in the co-direction), Toy Story 2 is pure fun. Each new situation presented to the character's triggers others, making the narrative always in high rotation. Merits of the script signed by Andrew Stanton, Rita Hsiao, Doug Chamberlin and Chris Webb, based on the story of Lasseter, Stanton, Pete Docter and Ash Brannon. Great shots were included in the script for this adventure and well-drawn references to well-known feature films were put in the plot (like the very inspiring scene of the Rex dinosaur chasing the car of the other toys, a joke with Jurassic Park (1993). 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) and The Exorcist (1973) are other productions cited during the plot.In this plot, parallel to the time that the protagonist is kept in prison, Toy Story 2 entertains more, with more jokes and more extroverted situations. Even though it is less rich in dramatic nuances, the richness in the argument continues. Mr. Potato Head now has a wife, Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris). Buzz Lightyear finds a corridor filled with other specimens of himself. And Barbie dolls are finally presented, possibly the culmination of an impersonal toy market with no life and personality. Most Barbie, in this case, has a pre-determined behavior, as with the Barbie Tourist Guide (Jodi Benson). Already with the soundtrack so personal and affectionate by Randy Newman, it corroborates sentiment in the scenes of Woody's discovery of his past. Buzz's plot, in search of his friend, is a clearly intentional repetition of that of the first feature, just reversing the roles now. This does not mean, however, that there is no novelty and a sense of purity in the reconstruction of this premise. A Buzz is also pure, even though there are so many ""equals"".We also have the excellent introduction to the expansion of Woody's mythology with the puppet program of the Western characters. The episode show is very funny, with the characters talking to animals, just as it happened to people and animals Lassie and Rintintin, but even that doesn't make the hero change his mind, he doesn't want to leave Andy at the same time that he has to think and weigh whether his attitude should be to return or stay with his new friends, who have the trauma of waiting for a long time, holed up without the prospect of leaving the cardboard and isopores that surround them. Jesse is desperate to realize that she will return there, and this causes a major crisis of conscience in the protagonist. There are great balconies, like when Woody tries to run away and has the biscuit-shaped snacks scattered around Al on the floor as an obstacle. It's funny how director John Lasseter plays with a reversal of scales, something small for the man is huge for toys, as well as reversing the scene in which Buzz and the rescue group do damage in traffic, leaving cars in terrible state, without even realizing it.The human villain, also known as Chicken Man is a disgusting subject physically and spiritually, he is two-dimensional, evil and selfish, like all other humans, and as much as this is shallow, it makes sense, after all, this is a story of toys. Al's Toy Barn was the scene of many homeric moments, from the obvious references to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, Jurassic Park and of course, a return of Buzz to the previous condition to understand to be a child's toy, with a counterpart of his, who interacts with those who inhabit the local retail trade. It is funny how even his friends did not realize that they got the wrong Buzz, but it is natural, after all, they are the same as when hanging on the astronaut's rope, they put Rex, the character with thinner arms to stay on the end, so if he falls all would also succumb.For so many augments, the feature is consecrated as a superlative to its predecessor. And in technology we also have a growth, because the quality of the animation has grown from the first to the second copy of the franchise. More layers and more textures were implemented. So, the use of lights imposes new outlines on the objects on stage. The pinnacle of this showcase of technical power, however, is the scene where Woody is repaired, refurbished to serve the purposes of an item on display, no longer a toy. Computer graphics make the content great. But, ultimately, this greatness in size is not enough to overcome the power of intimacy and love, which ends up being taken up in the characters' resolutions. The impostor Buzz himself, who appears in the middle of the narrative as a joke and also as a reference to the issue of toys as a franchise, finds a closure in the contact with his personal father.Although it has a less memorable track than that of its predecessor, ""Toy Story 2"" not only lives up to the original film but achieves its goal of giving the franchise a deserved evolution, not only from a technical point of view but also from a narrative one. Based on several of the old concepts and expanding the universe as a whole, with new fun, charismatic and funny characters. Pixar continues with its first sequel, of its first classic, once again amusing children, making adults reflect on the value of friendship and companionship.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Fine Sequel to a Fine Film,"When I saw this film for the first time over ten years ago, I thought that it was a great achievement in animation and film.

With its inception, almost each film released by Pixar afterward has won the category but two or three times, most recently in 2010. I think that if the category had been around when this film was released, it could have easily won. I admit, the story was not as fresh as the original, but was worthy with the addition and expansion of new characters, like Jessie and Bullseye.

Unfortunately, when Woody rescues his fellow toy, asthmatic squeeze toy penguin Wheezy, he is unexpectedly taken from Andy's home and ends up in the apartment of an eager toy store owner who has a collection of cowboy toys from a 1950's television show called ""Woody's Roundup"", and the toys are his fellow stars, Jessie, the yodeling cowgirl, Bullseye, who is his trusty horse, and the old prospector, Stinky Pete. Most of the toys are excited on a world tour to Tokyo, Japan, but Woody just wants to go home. Meanwhile, Buzz and company set out to find Woody and bring him back home. This sequel is more characters, more story, more music, brings the emotion spirit of Toy Story. And for the first time, Buzz has a duplicate.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Scope widens on Pixar's toy universe,"These days we're not so surprised when an animated sequel lives up to or surpasses the original, especially when it's made by Pixar, but it was an unusual feat for 1999 when ""Toy Story 2"" did it. Although a bit more repetitive and fan-serving than boundary-pushing, the film's ingenuity, commitment to its characters and emotional themes made it a loveable continuation of the groundbreaking work of the original.The story sees Andy going away to cowboy camp, during which his mom holds a yard sale. Woody, during a valiant attempt to save an old toy penguin named Wheezy (Joe Ranft), is unexpectedly stolen by a greasy toy collector (Wayne Knight), forcing a rescue team comprising Buzz, Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky (Jim Varney) and Potato Head (Don Rickles) to find and save him.With Andy swept aside, most of the action takes place out in the world, widening the scope of ""Toy Story"" and creating exciting new scenarios for the characters. By the same token, it loses a little bit of the realism that made the initial concept special. Toys sneaking across major city roads hiding under traffic cones is closer to slapstick than wonder-inducing. In the first film, when Woody and Buzz sneak about Pizza Planet in fast food containers, the same idea is in place, it just feels more high stakes and believable than in this movie, which blows the lid off the toy chest.Getting a little overly imaginative is a small knock on a film that nurtures a deeper love of its characters and furthers their story. Woody discovering his origins and meeting other characters in cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack), horse Bullseye and Stinky Pete the prospector (Kelsey Grammar) introduces the concept of collector's items into the ""Toy Story"" universe, while Buzz, free of existential crisis, finds the tables have turned from where he was opposite Woody in the last movie. The story aims to enrich its original themes with new notions that speak to the purpose of toys in our lives.The film's most poignant moment comes accompanied by - yet again - a beautiful Randy Newman song performed by Sarah McLachlan, which reveals an obvious truth to the audience but one that's painful for toys: abandonment. The song puts the larger story into perspective, in addition to making you cry and feel guilty for any toy you ever moved on from.Preposterous as it gets, Pixar's crew has a ton of fun with ""Toy Story 2"" and it shows. Having fun while keeping characters at the center and employing genuine themes that go deeper than kid-friendly morals, they strike gold yet again for all ages.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"You'd think with all my video game experience, I'd be more prepared","Like in the original, Woody is worried about no longer being Andy's favorite. I don't know, I guess they really badly wanted to make another, even if they couldn't think of that different of a plot? It's not the exact same thing, they do something different with it, but I'm not sure it was necessary. We learn some of the sheriff's background, and the way that space themed stuff took over the popularity for westerns in the 60s is made text.From right away you can tell that 3D animation can do much more than in the first one. Human eyes, teeth and fingers especially look infinitely better. I love all the Star Wars(and even at least one Trek) references. In this we see that while humans can't know the toys are alive, pets can, which suggests that sometimes, if your dog is doing something you don't quite understand, maybe it's actually playing with one of your dolls or something. It sometimes gets scary and creepy. Some jokes are for adults. The terrible Randy Newman songs are significantly more palatable here, where better singers with less annoying voices perform them. In this one of the antagonists is a grown man, a collector, who wants to make a lot of money selling an action figure. I guess he is supposed to be off putting to children? Also, this one has a brief appearance of a female version of Sid(who draws on toys) because the filmmakers hadn't gotten that out of their system yet, apparently. I greatly admire the new cast, featuring the old ways charming Joan Cusack, the immensely talented Kelsey Grammar, and the underrated Wayne Knight.I recommend this to big fans of the 1995 film. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

'Nemo' and especially 'Shark Tale' have later proved how good an animated film can really be... In my opinion, the only characters that are actually fun to watch and do have some character development are Mr. Potato Head and Rex the Dinosaur.

The score and songs are even worse. The new characters are impossibly annoying, while the old supporting cast has more screentime, with awful results as they also become annoying while also separating the two stars the whole movie.The adventure is not bad, but it gets beyond silly with all the toys going out of home, with a story that never gains any tension, poorly presented, in which there are no arcs for any characters and the little drama that exists seems forced.

A Worthy Sequel To A Landmark Motion Picture.,"After dazzling the world with its groundbreaking debut feature & following it up with another imaginative story, Pixar Animation Studios' third feature film finds them returning to the very story & characters that made its studio a household name. Considered by many to be one of those rare sequels that outshines its predecessor, Toy Story 2 keeps alive Pixar's winning streak and is as inventive, entertaining & fun as the original Toy Story.Continuing the adventures of Andy's toys, Toy Story 2 begins with Woody being stolen by a vintage toy collector & owner of ""Al's Toy Barn"" who brings him to his apartment where he meets Jessie, Bullseye & Stinky Pete and learns that he's a valuable collectible based on a 1950s TV show. On the other hand, Buzz Lightyear devises a plan to rescue Woody from his captor & enlists the help of Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog & Rex.Directed by John Lasseter, Toy Story 2 opens on an impressive note with a visually striking sequence that instantly showcases the various improvements Pixar had made in computer animation, only to follow it up with a few more breakthroughs as the plot progresses. The 3D animation is far more refined, colour composition is accurate to a greater degree & while the characters retain their original design, they're rendered in a more seamless manner.Screenplay is fabulously written for the team behind it delivers a story that's as interesting, witty & original as its predecessor. Cinematography makes more dynamic use of camera as well as colour palettes, images are sharper & finely detailed than before, Editing is brilliantly carried out for the most part & steadily paces the narrative but its middle act could've used a few more trims. And Randy Newman keeps the story fresh, alive & energetic with another fantastic score.Reprising their respective roles from the last film, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen & others once again step up to voice their characters with sublime effectiveness while out of the new additions, it's Joan Cusack who leaves the most lasting impression with her exuberant take on Jessie. Its homage to earlier classics is wonderfully carried out, the themes are nicely addressed & although it employs the same out-of-box thinking that made Toy Story a historic success, everything about this sequel feels fresh, new & redesigned.On an overall scale, Toy Story 2 is another fascinating blend of a heartfelt story, rich set of characters & cutting-edge animation from Pixar that's ingeniously directed, deftly written, gorgeously photographed, firmly edited & mesmerisingly scored and is a work of quality filmmaking that sets a new benchmark for sequels in animation. While Toy Story is superior in my opinion, Toy Story 2 still manages to be a worthy follow-up to its predecessor & is another timeless classic from the animation studio that has always dared to think differently.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An outstanding sequel,"This film is a Toy Story's sequel and continues the story of the toys depicted in the first film, in particular Woody and Buzz Lightyear, two inseparable but unlikely friends that portray the past and present of the world of toys: one is a rag-doll cowboy, the other is a futuristic astronaut. In this film, Woody will discover his own past of fame and prestige after being kidnapped by a collector of antique toys and put in contact with toys that are part of his own collection: his horse, an intrepid cowgirl called Jessie and a miner named Stinky Pete. Directed by John Lasseter, who continues his earlier work, the film retains most of the voice actors that were present in Toy Story.Despite the bad reputation of sequels, this film managed to remain the level of its predecessor, developing to him a coherent sequence of events. This sense of continuity between them was achieved largely thanks to the maintenance of technical staff and initial voice actors. The novelty of this film, in fact, is the introduction of new characters, directly linked to the past of Woody (which the audience will discover along with himself), who will have a major role in the outcome of the film. The collecting is a matter intelligently placed in this film, allowing to reveal a little of what has been the history of the toys, from the fifties until today. Less interesting had the soundtrack, despite the appointment of ""When She Loved Me"" for the Oscar for Best Original Song. In fact, after the resounding success of the soundtrack of the first film with ""You've Got a Friend in Me"", also nominated for the statuette, it would be difficult to obtain similar impact.For all these reasons, this movie deserves to be considered one of the best sequels of animated film and a great family film and deserves to be seen and reviewed by young and old.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Even Better than the Original,"A delightful and incredibly well made follow-up to the original classic, Toy Story 2 doesn't just succeed as a sequel, but even proves to be one of those rare sequels even better than the original. The original all star cast returns for the sequel and they have never been better. In addition to the cast from beforehand though, we also have the lovable Joan Cusack as Jessie, Kelsey Grammar as the sinister Prospector, and Wayne Knight as one of my personal favorite characters Al (aka the Chicken Man). The film is quite clever, with plenty of hilarious gags and laugh out moments, as well as the delightful amount of heart that Pixar is known for. The animation is gorgeous as always, and the script does seem to focus on a few Star Wars cliches obviously for laughs, but luckily there is still plenty of original gags to enjoy and so much top notch nostalgia for any human being who remembers growing up and toys being the best thing in the world. In the end, Toy Story 2 is a clever and original sequel that manages to continue its story without ever feeling forced or dried out. It improves upon its predecessor and proves to be yet again another animated classic to rewatch again and again.

"Branching out and upping the ante in comparison to the first, but pulling it off with a certain charm.","There's little doubt Toy Story 2 attempts to go above the 1995 original; a sort of betraying of the first one's rules in keeping the realism of these toys coming alive and interacting with their surroundings for sake of greater escapades and larger adventures. In short, it works; but realising how absurd the film may have turned out and noting how grounded and enjoyable it turns out in actuality, is the true pleasure. In conforming to whatever written rule or code of conduct the toys seemingly had in the first film, in relation to keeping the magic of their life a secret from human beings, the first maintained a wondrously consistent close knit sense that avoiding all manner of extravagant activity was a good thing; rendering the finale with Syd in which the code is broken all the more dramatic and involving. Toy Story 2 sees the toys commit grand theft auto; cause a motorway pile up and execute all manner of expansive activity in airports, on runways and other such public places without much trouble - all whilst seemingly going unnoticed. But it is to the film's great credit we become so wrapped up in the tale, a tale of rescue; honour and friendship, despite these absurdities; as the ideologies and the true extent of the point of their existence in both the protagonist and supporting toys are questioned. This is certainly one of the most philosophical films about a child's play thing you'll ever see.Like the first film, Toy Story 2 sees one toy excluded from the space of Andy's room at their new house after having successfully moved at the end of the first one. On this occasion, Woody is stolen at a junk sale on the front lawn of Andy's house during the rescuing of another toy up for sale; the crime perpetrated by an eccentric, chain store owning toy collector named Al (Knight) whom recognises Woody as a rare and expensive collectors item, also a part of a collection of Western themed toys from the 1950s. With an ultimatum in place, the going away of Andy to something called 'cowboy camp' during the summer holiday, the usual gang of Andy's toys in Buzz; Potatoe Head; Rex and Hamm venture off to find him - as Buzz and the other toys take off to rescue Woody before Andy gets home, the camera enjoys a slow crane upwards so as to encompass Al's high-rise which towers over all the other buildings as the magnitude of their mission is enforced.Primarily, the study of a toy's fear of being replaced from the first film has been updated to that of a toy's shelf life running out in regards to an owner's lust to continue using them. 1995's Toy Story was a circular adventure unfolding out of the Utopian space that was Andy's room, an adventure which saw Woody having come to terms with having to coexist with a newer, fresher, more post-modern toy as Buzz's own arc was explored in that he was not, in fact, a space ranger himself. Here, the venturing away from Andy's new room allows Woody to come to terms with the 'issue' or 'problem' of Andy's growing older, and that it too is a serious topic infused within the life of a toy one needs to come to terms with and coexist with, leading to acceptance.If anything, the film opens up with a mini-narrative of which resembles a short cartoon; the sort of which you might have play before the feature at a cinema years ago. The expanding of the opening short into this dramatic and blown out of proportion epic as Buzz Lightyear attempts to infiltrate and defeat his nemesis Emperor Zurg is systematic of Toy Story 2's own branching out into larger, more grandeur adventures. We ought to know it's not real, because Buzz resembles his old, deluded self. As the film develops and Woody is taken to a large high-rise marked with a sign in its reception stating ""No Children"", so as to further infuse the watching kids in the audience to 'side' with the toys and further dislike Al, Andy's toys strive to get him back and Woody himself encounters Jessie (Cusack), Stinky Pete (Grammer) and a horse named Bullseye; of which the four of them combine together to produce Woody's Roundup Gang, a franchise favourite with the kid's back in the 1950s.The film is enjoyable in its inter-cutting of Al's own plight, which includes the bickering with some Japanese businessmen whom are purchasing the Roundup Gang, his strand providing short, sharp bouts of comedy; with Andy's toys' journeying to the building, as Buzz's superiority is emphasised in his cracking of whom the kidnapper is, and Woody himself facing a moral plight of his own in regards to whether he abandons Jessie, Pete and Bullseye so as to return to Andy. In particular, Woody's own arc sees him somewhat loose his head when it transpires he is quite the celebrity figure; both then and now, something that is observed and dealt with within the universe of the film as a relatively negative thing when said character realises there are things that are more important in life. The film wonderfully blends in all of this with its grander physical comedy and the cynicism of both Hamm and Potatoe Head, something that clashes with various other toys whom become involved along the way, one of whom is a second Buzz Lightyear doll acting as a short, sharp and refreshing inclusion. It's bigger, but not better; although thoroughly enjoyable all the same.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I was just as entertained by this one as I was the original,"Again a well put together movie. A lot of the same characters are back for more in this sequel. It's a very typical story, characters are introduced, bad guy among them, the problem is put out and it's up to the characters to solve it before the movie ends. Just like the first one there is a really good balance between what kids would find entertaining and what adults would so this one is easily watched by the whole family.The only thing I would criticize is the story feels very similar to the original and because I binged the Toy Story franchise it was fresh in my mind when I watched this. So they lose points for originality but still a great move and would totally recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

I loved this movie as a kid and I'm happy to say I still do. Best of the three hands down.,"Despite the numerous times I watched this movie as a kid. When I chose to sit down recently and re-watch Toy Story 2 I came out of it with the same love I did oh so many years ago. All my favorite scenes like the ones with the other buzz and the airport scenes still thrill and entertain me. Even some of the emotional scenes still got me a little choked up if I might add.Now when it comes to kid movies I tend to check out. Seeing as I'm in my 20's, but when it comes to Toy Story I'll still watch these and I don't care to admit it. So when Toy Story 4 comes out next year I'm there. As for my final thoughts on this one despite this movie coming out in '99 it doesn't look dated, and the pop culture references are still funny today. I'd recommend it to parents who are thinking of showing it to their kids.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Disappearing Belt!,"Toy Story 2 is a great movie.  This film moved me in a way that movies haven't done in a long time.  Clean and good fun (except for one phallic reference that is most likely over kid's heads).I did notice something the second time I saw the film.  There is a scene where the new Buzz has his belt disappear.  About an hour and fifteen minutes into the film, when new-Buzz runs down the air shaft and tells the other toys to advance, you can see the belt.  The scene changes to the toys running past Buzz and ""Huh?"" where did the belt go??  You've got to be quick to notice it, but I guarantee it's there.  Somebody must have gotten fired over that one!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 2: Everything You Could Want,"Following on from the success of its predecessor, Toy Story 2 launched Pixar even further into the animation stratospere. It was only whilst deciding to watch this and the original in preparation for the upcoming third installment that I realised I had never, not even as a child, seen this before. Struggling to understand how, I rushed to right this wrong.Picking up a few years after the first left us off, Andy's toys live a happy coexistence with his new puppy. When a less functional member of their tribe is taken to the yard sale taking place at the front of the house, Woody mounts his canine steed in a rescue mission. Identified as a rare collector's item by a snooping customer, he is stolen, to be shipped to a museum in Japan. Cue the Buzz led rescue mission, and another miniature adventure.This one starts strongly, giving us action on a gargantuan scale before pulling back and revealing it to be a game played by Rex: a perfect reintroduction to the characters' world and the start of a recurring joke. We soon meet the puppy, the bark of whom closed the last installment, and see how he has been embraced as a member of the animated family. Things continue in much the same manner as the original, the style of humour all but identical, perhaps a bit more mature, as indeed was its target audience by its release. The same tone too is to be seen here, Woody's early setbacks much akin to his first despairing thoughts of abandonment upon Buzz's arrival. Once the primary plot gets rolling, we get the mix of action, adventure, comedy, and drama of the first all over again, with a whole host of new characters and settings. Particularly amusing and entertaining are the interactions of Buzz and the newer model of himself he finds, his role now reversed to that of Woody at the beginning of the first film in convincing the deluded toy that he is just that. Woody's story is marked by a nicely darker element of being someone's toy, and one which will undoubtedly resonate thematically with installment three. The last half hour or so is full-on action, suspenseful stuff which has everyone rooting for the heroes. Everything you could want for what it is really. Again, this provides a sufficiently compelling kids' film, but one which lack the emotional wow factor of such greats as Wall-E.Again, Pixar delivers a consistently entertaining movie which will doubtlessly fulfill the cinematic needs of all the kids who see it. Regarding its alleged increase in quality over its forbear, I tend to disagree, though it is very close. Having never seen it until recently, I guess this one just doesn't have the same sentimental legacy for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I'm not kidding when I say that it's actually better if you're an adult,"So here's the thing. I don't think the first Toy Story is great. It's good though, I gave it a 3.5. I hadn't seen it since I was probably around 10 years old, and the same goes for this one. I barely remembered anything about the first.With this one, when I realised that one scene was starting, I said out loud ""oh, here we go"", and the tears began flowing almost immediately. There aren't many films that have drawn visible tears from me, and this one not only did that, but left such an imprint on me that the first few notes of the song gave me an instant Pavlovian response, and also I was crying over the abandonment of a piece of fabric and plastic.So yeah. I like this a lot more than the first, in short. The voice acting is just as fantastic as before, it's directed much better, and while it is admittedly ludicrous at this point that no one in this world realises that toys are alive with some of the stuff they get up to in this one, you all know none of that is really why this is getting a 4.5 from me.This one gets that high of a rating because everything about it is so much deeper and more thematically interesting than the first one, which, even if you love it, you have to admit that it is really simple in comparison.Whereas this one is exactly what I want to see from a kids' film - it's simple and enjoyable for kids, but there is also a deeper layer in it for the adults watching. When I first saw this, I was still playing with my toys and thought I'd never give them up...and funnily enough, by now I have, and watching this now, it's not just that there's more to think about if you're an adult, it's that it actually makes the film better if you are one.So basically, I bloody love this film, and if you haven't seen it since you were a child, I urge you to watch it again, and if you've never seen it...do it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Overrated,"I really don't understand the hype over this film. Top 25 of all time? Definitely not! The storyline is only average although it it slightly better than the original toy story but not by much.The animation is great as others have mentioned but that in itself does not make a great movie... I've seen saturday morning cartoons with equally impressive animation.There are a few funny scenes but the movie's plot is much too shallow for adult. It is a great simple film for kids to enjoy but I was very bored throughout most of the movie. The most enjoyable part of the movie is the nostalgic pleasure gained from watching toys that I used to play with as a kid come to life.I give it a very average 5 stars. Again good for kids, boring for adults.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The 3rd Pixar Film and a perfect Sequel,"This is the sequel to the famous Toy Story movie. It was released in theaters 4 years after the first. And 1 year after A Bug's Life.Not only is it Pixar's first sequel but it was also a big hit back in 1999. It received more money at the box office than the first. And was given an Award for best Sequel and best Aniamtion.Anyways story continues when it's like a year after what happened in the previous one. It has the original voice talents from the original, including Tim Allen and Tom Hanks as the 2 main characters.The designs of the characters are similar to the previous Toy Story film, only with some improvements on the extra characters in the backgrounds, and good detail involving dust particles on a book self.It starts with Woody looking forward to cowboy camp with Andy, his owner. But didn't go when his arm got a torn a little. Woody felt bad that he didn't go with his owner.Sometime later when he saved a toy from being sold at a yard sale, he's been spotted by a Toy Collector, Al who is interested in him. Andy Mom refused to sell him Woody, so Al managed to steal Woody when Andy's mom is distracted by an accident he caused, and took off with Woody.Now Buzz Lightyear and the Other Toy must hunt down and find Woody before Andy gets back from cowboy camp.This movie is great and never gets boring. I enjoyed a little more than Toy Story 1, but I still like the original, just this one has more funny parts to it. It even introduces some new toys, and bigger locations.Those who liked the original will like this one also. If you heard bad reviews about this movie, ignore them cause this is one of those rare sequels that are good for a change.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Toy Story's sequel soars to infinity!,"Disney and Pixar studios team up again and brought us the sequel to the imaginative adventure story about a little boy named Andy who loves playing with his toys, especially with cowboy doll Woody and space ranger figurine Buzz Lightyear. In this sequel, where I think it surpasses the first film with more fun, adventure and entertainment, Andy is away at summer camp and Woody is kidnapped by Al's Toy Barn greedy collector Al McWiggin. He wants to sell Woody along with his cowboy collection-set dolls (from a TV show which Woody learns he was once the star) Jessie the Cowgirl, Stinky Pete the Prospector and Bullseye the Horse to a museum in Japan. The thought of being immortalized forever is tempting to Woody, but his friends back at Andy's house, Buzz, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex and Hamm attempt to rescue Woody.Like its prequel, this movie is filmed in brilliant, colorful and detailed computer animation. The story is full of surprises and adventure, from Woody's meeting his new TV Show Round-Up gang to Woody's friends braving the streets and Al's Toy Barn to complete their rescue mission.Comedy and humor are in abundance here, with some of my favorite funny scenes include the parts where the aliens' constantly pester Mr. Potato Head and Rex's running reflection in the toy car's mirror (a reference to Jurassic Park); you will find many other pop culture references throughout this movie. In addition, I enjoyed seeing the introduction of other new toy characters including Weezy the Penquin, Emperor Zurg, Mrs. Potato Head and Barbie - each like the rest of the toy cast giving his/her own unique personality and toy characteristics. I like the fact that in this movie, all of Andy's toy characters establish more rapport and teamwork than in the previous movie.Hands down to a great directing and writers team for making one of Disney/Pixar most memorable movies; it's non-stop fun, excitement and adventure, and it also reminds us the value of friendship and being there for someone. One of Disney's best work and overall is one of the best movie sequels of all time.Grade A",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of those rare sequel that exceeds the original,"Toy Story is already perfect. Toy Story 2 manages to even exceed its predecessor. As is common with Pixar, Toy Story 2 is an excellent film filled with over-the-top comedy, fantastic visuals, score and mature writing. It expands the franchise and adds more characters without feeling stuffed.While the first film deals with mainly with Buzz and his fall, Toy Story 2 is about Woody and a sudden realization that he is expendable to Andy in the long run. The film also borrows the same premise from the first but is not a mere copy. In Toy Story 2 themes of age and purpose are explored without becoming preachy. When Woody was stolen and taken to a toy collector who plans to sell him, he encounters his past and realizes that he was once a famous toy. Joining him is his round up gang composed of Jessie, Bullseye and Stinky Pete. Convincing Woody that he'll find more meaning and love as a display in a museum, Woody has a crisis of either leaving his owner behind or joining his round up gang. Woody initially denies the offer and this reveals the other character's motives. Jessie was also once owned by someone named Emily but left her when she grew up. Toy Story 2 is a fantastic tale about mortality, even though the toys don't necessarily die, because even toys have to find purpose in life for without purpose life is meaningless. It all culminates in an airport chase scene. Stinky Pete is a menacing villain who can take matters into his own hands. Once again, Stinky Pete is properly written to have real and believable motivations.The supporting cast are not mere accessories. Buzz's story is continued from the first film with the introduction of Emperor Zurg. Rex is a game junkie who loves playing Buzz's game. His arc concludes simultaneously with Buzz's.For a film supposed to be sent directly to home release, Toy Story 2, quality wise, is beyond home release. A masterpiece and one of Pixar's finest.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Tom Hanks is best when you can't see him,"And Disney is best when it doesn't suffer from Not Invented Here syndrome. It's hard to believe this is a Disney production with this depth of character and plot.Hardly anyone on this list mentioned the great Randy Newman music.  The song ""When She Loved Me"" is as fine a song as you'll find anywhere and is used to very good effect.  The animation is not what I'd call silky smooth.  It does not make the movements of people very realistic, but the facial expressions of the toys are done better than many actors we are accustomed to seeing. Numerous animators are credited.  The ones who did the faces deserve some special recognition, but what award is there to do that?This is one of the few sequels that is better than its predecessor.

more profound than gotterdammerung,"Some films just come at you from nowhere & completely subvert your expectations. I'd seen TS1 - I can't remember when, probably around a recent Christmas - & been unexpectedly entertained & amused, so when I sat down to eat my tea last night & found yet more golf on the News Channel & the usual carp elsewhere, I idly flicked to BBC1 & happened upon TS2. My digit hovered over the remote, but, well there was nothing else on & it would be instructive to see how much worse it was than TS1, so, half-heartedly, I continued watching. I rapidly became engaged, I'd missed a fair chunk of the film, but it wasn't difficult to work out the plot. And the toys' characters drew me in. The first rule of any narrative is that you have to care about the characters. That's why I gave up watching Mad Men; ultimately the protagonists were so devoid of any humanity I didn't care whether they lived or died, so something of a paradox that a bunch of toys should have more more emotional depth. Then, with superb timing, they introduced an intriguing moral dilemma for Woody, an actually intractable dilemma which was only partly resolved at the end of the film - rightly so, because it is genuinely intractable, & has to do with the physical nature of our being. Then the cowgirl sang a song. It was a small song about the nature of a child's love for a toy. Except the toy is a surrogate for that forgotten part of us, the spontaneous, loving part of us that we can only know as a child. And thus our relationship with our parents, the World, &, if you like, God.She sang & I wept.Ridiculous, I know. The prospect of a sixty rear old man crying over a children's film, but there you go. It's certainly not something that any amount of Wagner, with its overblown, egomaniacal combatants has ever been able to do. Finzi's Dies Natalis has come close though. There you have it then. A beautifully constructed, fast-paced, funny, clever, good-hearted film - even the villains are given some sympathy for their all too human (sic) failings - carrying an unpretentious depth of moral message.

I have to admit though, it was a little better than Wall:e. Wall:e was just awful, and had no sense, but this one was very little like that. Pixar did make this, and that's what makes it good because they are a great group that can make a story, but the brand new characters were pretty bad.

Good Sequel,"Toy Story 2 (1999)*** (out of 4)Nice sequel to the 1995 smash hit has Woody getting stolen by a toy collector who plans to sell him to a museum in Japan. Buzz, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm and Slinky Dog decide to go and try to rescue him but Woody gets some pressure from his other collectibles that it might be best to start a new life elsewhere. It seems many fans consider this one a lot better than the first but I wouldn't go that far. While this is still an impressive little gem I do think it falls a tad bit short of the first film for a couple reasons. The majority of this film centers in on Woody, Buzz, the rescuers and of course the new toys who want Woody to stay with them so that they can be sold off as a complete set. The group goes on several adventures while the majority of the other toys from the first film are at home and off the screen. I think this is one of the problems with this film because many memorable characters simply aren't in this film and to me that is a letdown. The first movie had one great joke and adventure after another and a truly remarkable imagination. It's fair to say that this film has that same imagination but just not as wide as the previous movie since it did feature more characters. With that said, this is still a charming little film thanks in large part to the voice work of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. They certainly have no trouble getting back into their roles and the same is true for Don Rickles, Joan Cusack and the underrated Jim Varney. We even get Kelsey Grammar as a rather unfriendly part of Woody's collection. The Big Al character by Wayne Knight is one of the new folks that I actually enjoyed as I thought he summed up that obsessive collector quite nicely but at the same time he can't hold a candle to the mean kid from the first. The adventure that the group sets out on is pretty funny and the highlight is a terrific sequence where they're trying to cross a busy road when all mayhem breaks loose. The final ride through the airport is another nice sequence and as you'd expect the animation is terrific. TOY STORY 2 is certainly a good movie and one well worth watching but at the same time I think it falls well short of the first film.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Solid proof that sequels are not always inferior...,"TOY STORY 2 expands on the originality of the first ""Toy Story"" by turning the plot into a rescue mission that must be performed by several of the main character toys led, of course, by Woody and Buzz Lightyear.Once again, the voices perfectly match the characters, the special effects are brilliant, the script matches the clever aspects of the original, and the story actually has a lot more scope with more of a feel for the dramatic and dangerous world of airports, stolen goods, elevator shafts, street traffic and all sorts of predicaments that combine laughter with terror.TOM HANKS and TIM ALLEN are back as the voices for Woody and Buzz, as are many others from the original cast. A nice new addition is Stinky Pete the Prospector, who also happens to be one of the best animated and most interesting of all the computer-generated figures. There's also a Mrs. Potato and a Cowgirl mate for our hero.All of the technical aspects mark an improvement over the original and the quality of the script and story is just as good, marking one of the few times that a sequel more than matches the inspiration of the first film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A really fun movie,"If you enjoyed the first Toy Story, you'll like Toy Story 2 just as much. Simply don't anticipate any major surprises. The first significant computer-animated film-and, until The Iron Giant, the best-was produced by Pixar and Disney's groundbreaking partnership three years ago. However, The Iron Giant technically combined traditional and computer animation. The breathtaking, mind-blowing visual magic of the medium is somewhat diminished now that CGI techniques are a staple of so many new movies, and the novelty of those pixillated color schemes is a little too common.While Toy Story 2 falls just short of the original in terms of, well, inventiveness, it is still head and shoulders above most of Disney's recent work thanks to its numerous, kid-friendly messages of solidarity and the need to accept change with a grin.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 2,"Now that ""Woody"" and ""Buzz"" have well and truly buried the hatchet - and not in each other, they both hope owner ""Andy"" will take them to his summer camp with him. Sadly, though, ""Woody"" has hurt his arm - so is left behind, only to narrowly escape being sold in a car boot sale. Worryingly, though, he is spotted there by toy museum owner ""McWiggin"" and is promptly kidnapped! It now falls to ""Buzz"", ""Mr Potato Head"" and the rest of the gang to track him down and spring him, with his new friend ""Jessie"" before they are sold to a collector in Japan. Not all of the toys are on board though - and poor old ""Woody"" has to be wary of the double-dealing ""Prespector"" whilst ""Buzz"" finds that, unlike his abducted friend, he is not exactly unique! There are now plenty of fun escapades for all concerned to keep this high quality animation entertaining. That said, I don't really do sentimentality, and I found this to be a little more so than the first one. The introduction of ""Jessie"" accompanied by the rather sad story of her abandonment (set to an equally sad song) did drag the pace down a bit for me, but when the action kicks in again, then we revert to a first-rate, team-driven and wittily written tale of camaraderie, loyalty and ingenuity. Messrs. Hanks, Allen and Rickles keep up their established good work, this time joined by Joan Cusack and an on form Kelsey Grammer as ""Prospector"". It could be argued that the first ""Toy Story"" film was a marketing man's wet dream; this second feature is very nearly as good and demonstrates the enduring and engaging nature of the characters who value each other above all. Rare for a sequel to rival the original, but this gives it a good try!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
doesn't hold up as an adult,"Just to be clear, i don't rate kids movies as kids movies. this is good ""for a kids movie."" i loved it as a kid. but as an adult i found very little enjoyment from it. it made me laugh more than the first one, but still not enough. and unlike the first, it was difficult to get through. entire scenes, mostly the ones with the cowboy gang, were basically unwatchable. this feels like a straight-to-dvd sequel that no one watches like aladdin 2 or lion king 1.5 (about 4 viewings, 6/22/2020)",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Entertaining,"I thought that ""Toy Story 2"" was very entertaining and funny. I haven't seen the first one yet, but I noticed that that wasn't really needed to enjoy the sequel. What I also liked was the more serious aspects of the film; the importance of being loved, of being shown love. The only thing I didn't like was the girl cowboy, Jesse?, since she seemed to be screaming on the top of her lungs all the time.

(9.7/10) An amazing sequel that expands the universe of the original,"This is hands down the best Toy Story movie out of them all. It expands and builds on top of the first movie so excellently that you have to wonder how they made a movie this good in less than a year. It explores themes of belonging and what it means to be a toy. The film focuses on 2 different plots: Woody finding out about Woody's Roundup, how he's a valuable collector's item and meeting the other toys (Jessie, Bullseye and Stinky Pete) and Buzz Lightyear teaming up with the rest of the toys to save Woody from the toy collector. The plot stays interesting, the jokes land and the ending is climactic. What else do I even need to say, this movie is amazing and an instant classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A nice, entertaining cartoon who does wonders with technology","Pixar's on the rise. I must admit, there was a time once where I was skeptical about digital animation feature films: being a cartoon nut, i thought that digital animation was a threat to good old toons, representing the triumph of form over substance.

Over these past years we've seen some astounding examples of digital animation movies,balancing the right mixture of technology with a good story and cast, and TS2 is no exception.

Great film for adults and children,"A terrific, smart, funny movie.  Toy Story 2 tells the story of how Woody become separated from Andy, and the toys' determination to rescue him from Al, a greedy toy owner voiced by (and looking like) Wayne Knight (""Newman"" from Seinfeld). Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and the rest of the cast are back as Woody, Buzz, Hamm, Rex and the other toys from Andy's room. In addition, there are also a number of new characters including Jessie, Stinky Pete, and Wheezy. While this film contains some humor that only adults will get, it is, like its predecessor, largely geared for children, and teaches some valuable lessons about friendship and devotion to others.  Terrific animation, great vocal work, and a fun movie for anyone of any age.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Falling with Style Part 2,"When Woody is stolen by an avid toy collector, the other toys in Andy's room hatch a plan to rescue him in this ambitious sequel that takes the toys out of their comfort zone, exposing them to the world at large. Their interactions on the outside are certainly quite funny, causing road accidents and chaos by driving toy cars through a toy store, however, the best aspect of the film is how it furthers the personal identity themes of the first film. Both Woody and Buzz are provided with detailed back stories for their design and Woody has to wrestle with whether to join the toys from the set that he originally came from while Buzz finds himself up against another of him who likewise believes that he is a real spaceman and not a toy. Often cited as the weakest of the first three 'Toy Story' movies, 'Toy Story 2' is certainly a little too sentimental for its own good (Jessie's flashback drags on for too long) and not all the jokes work, but it remains fairly engaging to view, even with the novelty aspect of the first movie not the same. The toy characters are simply fun and interesting to follow around, often displaying surprising ingenuity while on their rescue mission. The film additionally touches on some interesting issues not covered in the first movie, such as the vulnerability of toys when being played with and the sense of loss when owners grow up and move on. No, the magic might not quite be the same here as in the ""falling with style"" original, but it is great to come across a sequel that at least tries to take the material in a different direction.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

One of the best sequels of all time!,"There are many movies that come with a sequel that aren't nearly as good as the original. There are few exceptions to when it comes to the sequel being better than the original. For instance, after being in the Godfather Part II many people said it was better than the original. I haven't seen any of The Godfather's so I can't say which is better. Many people may hate for this, but I thought Mission: Impossible 2 was better than the original, although they were very different movies, so it was hard to be compared. Toy Story 2, I would have to say is the best sequel I've ever seen. It was better than the original for many reasons. It had a better story line, and it had better action too. There was much more adventure to it. Last, but not least, there were new characters also. There were many funny parts in this movie, especially with the cones. Buzz, I'm your father. I'm going to play catch with my dad. It was a riot, this movie. I can't believe it got an 8.4 rating too. It deserved it though. One person said, Some Like it Hot was better than this. I didn't see what was so funny about that movie.The plot of this movie is simply this. Woody discovers that he is a very rare toy from the fifties who was a hot seller. The reason he knows is a rare toy is because he was ""toynapped"" by the owner of AL'S TOY BARN. The reason he was kidnapped is because, he was going to shipped off to a toy museum in Japan, with his round up Jesse and Stinky Pete and the donkey. The owner by the name of Al, will make big bucks for finding this rare toy. As soon as Buzz, Rex, Ham, and Slinky Dog, see that he is gone, they go for the rescue. Many things will happen in this all new adventure, which I will not tell you. See the movie for yourself.Overall this an awesome movie, especially for Disney. It was much better than the original like I said before. Toy Story 2 deserves 10/10. I hope they come out with Toy story 3.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Good but not that Great,"This film was fun with a few very funny moments (I especially liked the out-takes).  But I was disappointed.  After hearing all the hype and seeing the exciting opening Buzzlightyear sequence, I was hoping for a grander adventure, but most of the action took place in a toy store and a sterile office building.  And there wasn't that much of a philosophical message to really bear mentioning, at least not as much as other reviewers have.  For a more thoughtful animated experience I would suggest ""The Iron Giant"" or ""Princess Mononoke.""  Still it's fun enough to earn a solid 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Play with your toys, but not with their feelings ...","The first ""Toy Story"" was on the same historical significance than ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", it established the digital revolution that would change (literally) the face of animation, forever. This is perhaps why most of the praise was concentrated on the technological achievement, the 'toy' aspect rather than the 'story'. We were all moved by the endearing relationship between Andy and his cowboy doll Woody (Tom Hanks), immortalized in the 'You've got a friend in me' song, we also smiled at the little rivalry between Woody and Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) turning with style into a touching friendship, and we all laughed at all the secondary characters populating this great adventure, from Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) to the cowardly dinosaur (Wallace Shawn) but nonetheless, we revered ""Toy Story"" for the amazing visual experience.But in 1999, ""Toy Story"" was already part of history, and any similar movie would most likely be judged for its content. And being the sequel to a successful film wouldn't be enough to ensure its success or its reason to be released on the theaters. And this is where, in the case of ""Toy Story 2"", the writing makes all the difference. Indeed, after exploring the psychology of toys within their relationships with their owners, the second opus goes further in that existentialism by confronting the toys to both their future and past. The story starts when Woody is stolen by a guy working in a toy factory, panning to sell it to a toy collector in Japan, among other props from the same Western theme, including Bullseye, Woody's legendary horse, Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl (Joan Cusack) and Stinky Pete, a Gold Prospector (Kelsey Grammar) still living in his package.Like the best sequels, when you think no new character can steal the show, you have one that gets instantly stuck in your heart. Any viewer would see in Jessie, the premise of a predictable romance with Woody (well, there are some romantic vibes between the two toys) but there's more in Jessie to earn our sympathy: a wound from the past, the revelation that she too had her 'Andy' before the worst happened: she got old. Her melancholy is expressed through a touching song 'When She Loved Me"", and a sad nostalgic sequence showing a little girl playing with her cowboy doll, before her main interests would become make up, clothes, phones and (ugh!) boys I love that sequence, it is as deep and emotional as the unforgettable montage from ""Up"" and for once, it confronts teenage girls to their constant obsession to become women fast. If only because a 14-year old girl would think, ""why do I want to grow up?"" ""Toy Story 2"" accomplishes something great.And there's more in that scene that induces this guilt, the rejection endured by toys, and the realization of Woody that the happiness he lives with Andy is only a matter of years, before hormones tickle his mind and make him think about girls. Then, Woody imagines that the eventuality of being owned by a toy collector is the only light of hope for such a dark fate, at one point, he is almost excited to know that he'll live with someone who'll value him forever. After all, wasn't he a big star who had his own Western TV show in the 50's? Why would he end up in a dump, a box of forgotten items or a dusty attic? What Woody doesn't know is that all his friends came to rescue him, lead by the real hero of the story: Buzz Lightyear. And in their perilous adventure, they discover where they come from: a toy factory, offering us a marvelous sequence whose highlights are a Tour Guide Barbie, and the magical moment when Buzz discovers the Buzz Lightyear shelves.Basically, there are two parallel stories in ""Toy Story 2"". Woody discovers how valuable he became because he's getting rarer and unique, and Buzz sees how worthless he is, having so many replicas, outside Andy's house, he's not the center of the universe, and is easily replaceable. But both are wrong, because there's one thing, that puts them on the same level of worth, they have ANDY written in their feet and that's the difference, for one little kid, they are priceless. It might be temporary but the excitement is worth being lived, a toy is to be played with, not to be worshiped and valued, and that's the mistake collectors commit. I am just collecting old comic books (yeah, I'm a geek) but I don't think I ever find time to read them, so where is all the fun? Stinky Pete tries to convince Woody that he's wrong, but since he's the only toy not to have been played with, his reaction is explainable, we understand his bias.But let's not spoil the rest of the story, because beyond all this existentialism, ""Toy Story"" is an extraordinary adventure movie, playing with the concept of toys evolving in the real world, including their own world, allowing them to solve personal issues. The film is amazing for children's eyes, and insightful for nostalgic adults, it's entertaining at best, and certainly one of the sequels that almost outshine the original, to the point I wondered why it wasn't Oscar-nominated for Best Animated Feature and Best Writing. Anyway I spent a great moment watching the film. And normally, I hate the bloopers during the end credits, even for comedies, but in that particular case, I'll make an exception. The ending was hilarious, a fitting (temporary) conclusion for one of the greatest animated film of the last 20 years, which is saying a lot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A lot of fun for kids and the family,"Toy Story 2 brings us back to the magic of toys being able to talk and do things without us knowing. Woody is now falling apart and accidentally gets sold/stolen at a garage sale by a collector who is mearly interested in money because apparently Woody is a collector's item. He was an old TV show that became a merchandiser's dream along with some other crazy characters. But of course, the other toys don't want to loose their friend, so Buzz, Mr. Potatoe Head, the dinosaur, and the slinky dog go out in the city to find Woody.My favorite sequences were getting across the highway and how the toys used the traffic cones causing a huge accident. Also, Buzz meeting another Buzz Lightyear toy who believes he is a real astronaut and the two get mixed up with the group. The outcome is just a lot of fun. I would recommend Toy Story 2, it's a classic Pixar.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A bit disappointing,"When Toy Story 2 came out, I was very excited.  I felt Toy Story was the best animated film that I had ever seen and therefore a sequel was practically mouth-watering.  I was also encouraged by the reviews that it had been given.  Almost every critic had given it top-marks. So when I finally decided to go to the cinema, sat down with my popcorn, and got comfortable, what did I see in front of me?A Star Wars parody!?!?Seeing as this was the fashion twenty years ago, I was very disappointed that they had chose to do this for the first scene AND carry it on all through the film.  Although, I did like the ""playing catch"" scenario.  But there was a lack of originality all round.  This was a key feature in the first toy story and it needed to be in this one.  The new characters  (very few of them, may I add) just weren't interesting or appealing enough.Overall, there were quite a few redeemable features that could suggest if another was done, it could be better, but there needs to be a marked improvement. Now, I may be being harsh, but it's only because Toy Story was so great and I was really expecting an improvement.But, hey!

"A great sequel, yes better then the first, but not lets be getting carried away with the hype.","This was a great sequel, Pixer and Disney, should be proud of what they have achieved. The story line was great, the extra characters, meant it was not just another Toy story 1', but a film in it's own right. It also had an extra depth, which seemed to lack before in the story. I think the script was well put together, and the directing was great.However overall for all its greatness, it is not the best film ever, when all the hype is over, people will just see this as an above average family movie, which it is. I think Pixer still has a lot of power to surprise with what they can produce. I don't know about other people but in my cinema they had a feature called `Dinosaur', the CGI, in that just blow my mind away, and so for all Toy Story 2' had a lot of great effects, but Pixer next feature I'm sure will be better in all respects.Well going back to Toy Story 2' the show would have not been the same if it was not for the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen who did another splendid job, bring the characters to life.

"The ""Core"" Story of Toy Story","Hot Take (maybe cold take): Toy Story 2 is the best Toy Story movie and a top 5 Pixar movie. This is the ""core"" of Toy Story. Buzz and Woody get along, Andy is still a kid and the gang is all together.Everything about this movie is brilliant. I feel like as the film was written a single line was written on the story board: ""What Happens to Toys when Kids Grow Up"". This fear is quickly instilled in the characters (particularly Woody), which ultimately pans out in Toy Story 3.There is an incredible depth brought not only to Woody, but Buzz and Jessie as well. The ""When She Loved Me"" scene is marvelous storytelling and rivals the opening of Up when it comes to heartbreak. Simply put, Toy Story 2 is perfection.Best Character: Woody

Rotten Tomatoes,"So, I would like to think of this review not much as a review on the movie, but rather on the critique that I saw this movie receiving on Rotten Tomatoes. So, I was looking through the is it of top movies on that site and noticed how Toy Story 2 has become the highest rated movie on the site, which really got under my skin. I'm not usually one to be critical of other peoples opinions, but after watching my fair share of films, not in a million years would I put Toy Story 2 as my number one movie. I understand that it is difficult to compare Toy Story to most other movies due to the significant difference of the graphics, but (in my opinion) there are so many movies that are better than this movie. I do not understand how a group of critics who make their living off of analyzing movies have concluded that the movie deserves 100% on the ratings. In 1993, one of the most heart touching movies ever (Schindler's List) was released. This movie was surpassed no only by this excuse of a high rated movie, but also by ""The Social Network"". The next year in film produced a dynasty of films which included (Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption, and Forrest Gump). Ultimately, Forrest Gump snatched the Oscar for best picture, but proceeded to only receive a 75% (ish) rating from the critics, as opposed to Toy Story 2 which was nominated for ONE Oscar (a soundtrack related award), which it didn't even win. So I have started to question what critics qualify as a good movie, because not in a million years would I (and most other sane people) compare the artistic depictions in Toy Story 2, to The Shawshank Redemption, or Goodfellas, or Fight Club for that matter. I am giving this review 5 stars not to trash the movie, but rather because five is the median of the possible ratings I could give. (Just to clarify now). It's past midnight in my room right, 85 degrees in my room, laptop on my lap, overheating. I'm sweating horribly due to the heat, but yet I continue my rant because I'm frustrated. I am frustrated because after watching my fair share of A-list movies, I wouldn't even put Toy Story 2 in my top 100 (and based on the rating the movie has on here, I can safely assume that most other people agree with me on this site). I guess I will end my rant by stating that Rotten Tomatoes has annoyed me. I have always been loyal to this site, and rarely gone onto that excuse of a Movie Review site.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The best one of the series!,"...and I dare say most underrated as well! Well, this a review I'm FINALLY gonna be typing out for a film that really deserves it.And I think it deserves a rating HIGHER than ""7.9"" - like seriously?? I read that earlier it had a ""8.1""!Now I watched the first Toy Story a ZILLION times before this sequel was released - and rightfully so. I mean I was no more than 5, and the playroom with the television set & VHS player was just my jam! (NOt to mention those fun CD games I used play on Windows computers) But, I'm even quite a big movie buff today; but most of the time, I now usually make YouTube videos discussing the issues of Science, Creation, Evolution, and Dinosaurs.Anyways, this film was the very first movie I saw in the THEATER! I was just 7 years old! And at that point in my life, not only did life feel so innocent & easy, but I liked movies not so much for their story, but more for their visuals - and Toy Story 2 had that in DROGUES! (As well as ""Phantom Menace"", though that's a flick generally everyone almost hates.)Furthermore, most often times, I seem to meet people (especially in Japan here) who either know more about the first Toy Story, or the most recent 3rd one. I feel as if a lot people aren't referencing this movie ENOUGH! And though it is somewhat generally well-known, I still feel as if doesn't get enough attention it deserves! I mean, you've got a much better story (compared to the 1st or 3rd one, IMO), lots of new characters (Zurg being my favorite), an AMAZING intro with Buzz (which quite literally BLEW me away when I was just 7 years old in that theater), there being comic references to Japan (the country where I was born & now live in - which kinda asks the question, why isn't this film more famous here if Japan got referenced a lot, like in ""Cars 2""?), amazing plot twists, a climax that takes place in an airport (Oh, and I just *love* airports & airplanes - they're my favorite form of travel, though I haven't used them very often), jokes that work with both children and adults, great pop-cultural references (like ""Star Wars - Empire Strikes Back colorful characters, stunning animation, great character study, pretty memorable songs, soundtrack, scenes, and quotes, HILARIOUS blooper end credits that just keep making me laugh over & over etc.And a good thing the movie was nominated for an Oscar (AT ALL!) for the song ""When Somebody Loved Me"" - and rightfully so. That's a song that my sisters kept singing out of the blew almost every year I was growing up - just to mention for laughs.But I believe it's THIS movie that should've won PIXAR an Oscar for Best Animated Film much earlier - not Toy Story 3, really; I think that's one that should've gone to ""How To Train Your Dragon"". I'm serious.And I almost felt something was LACKING from the 3rd Toy Story; I don't know if it was the look of the animation, or whether the ""traveling"" feel was absent, or if the jokes were too lame, or that I didn't cry at the end, or if the possible fact the movie seemed purely fueled by nostalgia purposes - I'm just still confused as to why it's made it on the Top 250 on IMDb.Shouldn't it be THIS movie instead!?Or who knows! Maybe the 3rd one DOES deserve to be up there, and I just don't know something that others do.And it's definitely one of the movies that Tom Hanks should be known for on his IMDb profile, rather instead of say ""The DaVinci Code"" or ""The Green Mile"" (those are just two films I can't stand, 'cause I either find them too overrated, too controversial, or just too weird) - Hanks' voice is just so well-acted in this movie (or fair enough, in the other two Toy Story's), I just imagine all the gestures & hand motions he must've done behind that microphone. lol Hey, he's an actor - he be as colorful, or over-the-top as he wants.Toy Story 2... It's just too good! In my opinion, it's WAY better than either 1 or 3. Not only do I think this is this one of the greatest sequels ever, it's also my favorite PIXAR movie, one of my favorite Disney movies, definitely one my favorite movies ever, and surely one of greatest movies of all time!!(FUNNY TRIVIA: It was this movie from where I learned the basic directions of LEFT & RIGHT - and my memory keeps coming back to it! hahaha)Someone PLEASE get this back onto the Top 250 on IMDb! I BEG you!10/10PS: But now, I wonder what they're gonna do with Toy Story 4??

Enjoyable; but...,"While I certainly enjoyed this movie it made me long for the days of ""real"" animation.There were clever jokes, a lot of suspense and somewhat believable characters....But it all looked too plastic.This is THE ""Toy Story"" that Mattel allowed 'Barbie' to be in...  It fits. The movie is as plastic as she is.There was some clever writing -- but the 'jokes' were a little too predictable.The animation was perfect -- too perfect...  Real objects do not reflect off the floor or other objects the way these animated objects did.  Please note that I did not say characters... they simply became objects.It was just too polished; and therefore looked false.Most of the voices were instantly recognizable -- which doesn't add to the movie.My ""willing suspension of disbelief"" was more than just challenged -- it was trampled.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The best CGI Animated Film Yet,"I was wondering how Toy Story 2 would stack up to it's predecessor , as the first film was both visually incredible as well as being entertaining for both child and adult.  Well this film, in my opinion, not only met such lofty expectations but surpassed them as well.  Once again Pixar has raised the bar for CGI rendered animated films.Just as the first film gave the viewer a truly three dimensional animated world to see, this one filled in the gaps.  Thanks to exponential advances in computer technology, TS 2 is even more visually stunning than the first. There is more detail everywhere.  From the expressions on the faces of the human characters, to the dust that has settled on ""the shelf"", the animators have set a new standard.But what makes this film a joy is a very well written script and screenplay as well as a lot of humor for both child and adult.  One of my favorite parts in the film is when Buzz is fighting in the toy store with another Buzz Lightyear who is still caught up in the idea that he is a ""real Buzz Lightyear"".  In this fight Buzz says ""was I really this delusional?"".  The re-introducing of this sub-plot into the story was not only innovative but it put an original twist on it.  Very clever.All in all I would say that this is a superb film, exceeding the first one. I would recommend it to anyone, young or old.  Go see it.  If you are a lover of film, as I, you will be happy you did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Great film,"Great film. 'Toy Story 2' obeys another golden rule the first film breaks: NEVER deliver a sentimental moral when (a) the sentiment is hard to take seriously, and (b) the success of the story depends upon it being taken seriously. The original is all about how important toys are to children. In the case of Woody and Buzz, I'm sceptical about this; and in any event, who cares, since it's the toys, not the children, who are the main characters. The sequel is all about how important children are to toys. That's why the sequel is so much richer.Yet I feel safe in recommending the film to everyone who loved the first 'Toy Story', since I'm sure everything lovable about the first is still there. Buzz and Woody are much the same (but somehow deeper). And the three-eyed alien dolls are back - with more screen time9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Great sequel to the first TOY STORY!,"After the success of TOY STORY, Pixar would make a few more films and TOY STORY 2 was announced for a worldwide Thanksgiving release in 1999.I did not know what TOY STORY was at the time, but as they say, a sequel means three things: 1:) a sequel that will be good as the first film, 2:) a sequel that will be good if not better than the first film or 3:) a sequel that is just gonna flat-out suck.In the film, Woody is stolen by a toy collector named Al, prompting Buzz Lightyear and his friends to vow and rescue him.However, Woody finds the idea of immortality in a museum tempting. Many of the original characters and voices from the first film returned for the sequel and several new characters, including Jesse, Barbie and Mrs. Potato Head were introduced.The story of this film is interesting and I think the action in this film is really good. The screenplay is well written and the dialogue for all of the toys was really amazing and fantastic.TOY STORY 2 has been considered by audiences and critics alike to be one of the few sequels that outshines the original and it continues to be featured frequently on lists of greatest animated films ever made.I like the acting. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and the rest of the returning cast members from the first film returns and they all do good if not better than they did in the first film. This film marked Jim Varney's last performance of his career as he died a few months after this film's release.The new characters are amazing. Jodi Benson plays the voice of Barbie and she does amazing in this film. Joan Cusack does the voice of Jesse and she does an amazing job in her part that she plays. Kelsey Grammar plays the Prospector and he does a very good job in this film as he would in X-MEN 3: THE LAST STAND and TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF EXTINCTION. Estelle Harris does the voice of Mrs. Potato Head and she does an amazing job in her role.The music by David Newman is once again amazing and cool. The score is just cool and yes, the TOY STORY theme song is amazing and really cool this time and once again sung by David Newman.Overall, TOY STORY 2 is one sequel that outshines the original film and Pixar wrote a heck of a story that does better than the first film and that is one heck of an achievement. 10/10 - ABSOLUTE SMASH HIT!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

An improvement on the original..,"Well, I saw this film in Australia on New Years Eve. I enjoyed it far more than the original, as it has more interesting bits in it. The spoofs of Pleasantville/50s US TV shows, Star Wars, etc. is good and there's only 1 musical number in the middle as opposed to about 3 or 4 in the original, which is much better.The comedy works even better this time around with tongue-in-cheek digs at the original Toy Story goings on and the little snippets of former Pixar productions, such as the Tin Toy Demo which appeared on the TV set, when Hamm is flicking through the channels.Rex is my favourite character in the entire film.. but all the characters and the new ones work well in this film.  Just one thing though, do not try to analyze this film for any implications might have regarding merchandizing of Buzz Lightyears etc., just go out, get the coke, the popcorn, and enjoy it.. it's great!10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
John Lasseter is the new Hitchcock: smuggling disturbing ideas into mass-market movies.,"Sometimes you beg for an epiphany and it doesn't quite come.  TOY STORY 2 is easily the best film of the year so far, funnier, richer, more inventive, frightening and emotional than anything else, because animation can do everything live action can do, and so much more.  Even the songs this time round are enjoyable (except, maybe, Jessie's lachrymose lament).  It deals with unbearably complex dilemmas with a maturity untapped by the likes of AMERICAN BEAUTY.  This should surely be enough - maybe I expect too much.It's been peculiar in reviews to see critics' astonishment that a mere cartoon could actually carry so much weighty baggage.  They mustn't watch too many cartoons, because films from PINOCCHIO to THE THREE CABALLEROS to THE LION KING offer a similar assortment of riches.  Maybe they're secretly afraid that their precious actors will be made redundant.2 works on many different levels.  Most immediately satisfying is the Hawksian romantic-comedy action movie, in which we watch men in action , at work, facing dark realities, positing loyalty and friendship as shores against the ruins.  This strand has a sublime emotional ambiguity, as on one level Buzz and friends repeatedly risk their lives to save a friend (Buzz is the Hawksian hero who must redeem himself after the first movie), while Woody (who also must redeem himself) at last finds a family, somewhere to belong just as he seemed outmoded and unloved.This difficult choice between friendship proven in action and mere family ties is brilliantly, painfully revealed, and there are no easy answers. For the benefit of resolution, the family is not a love interest, which could have made things more awkward, and one member is made villainous for convenience, but the questions raised are still valid.The film also works as an essay in making strange and unreliable the domestic and conservative.  On the one hand, there is something satisfyingly Surrealist about a house in which objects have more life than its human inhabitants - the different strands of reality set up by Buzz's opening adventures suggest that this may be the dream of an over-imaginative boy. There is a lack of fixity and control in having objects, bought by you to do your bidding, acting independently; it makes the solidity of the home unstable and unpredictable.Yet, on the other hand, this alternative community is itself ordered in its seeming chaos, with almost military precision, and even before its terrifying adventures, its threats ARE the domestic, the fickleness of a child, the thoughtlessness of a mother, the vulnerability that privileges menacing villains.2's great brilliance, though, lies in its expressing an awareness of its status as a sequal with the existential crises of its two heroes.  Woody starts the film with a lost hat (traditional emblem of masculine wholeness, virility, sexual prowess etc); he damages, then loses an arm; is abandoned and has a sublimely terrifying nightmare where the solidity of his existence crumbles, and he imagines the abyss of death.Already shaken in identity, he is kidnapped, wrenched from familiar bearings, while performing a heroic act, and finds out that he is not a single, whole Woody, but part of a vast Woody legend, connected (as is this film) to a venerable tradition, repeated and reproduced ad nauseum, through merchandise.  His sense of wholeness destroyed, he accepts his fate, his destiny away from the world of life that is Andy's bedroom, to the sterile immortality of the museum.In TOY STORY, Buzz already came to an awareness of his own limited masculinity.  But, in the film's most astonishing conceit, he faces a catacomb of Buzz Lightyears, and is forced to confront not only his lack of uniqueness, and not only the deluded image of his former past, but a new improved model; like Woody, Buzz becomes aware of the transience of life. The film opens with Buzz as intrepid action hero, only to be shockingly destroyed and shown to be a puppet in a computer game.The image of two Buzzes and their evil father point to an awareness of the ambiguity of being a sequel (as a son is to a father), but also the powerlessness of anything in a postmodern world; there is no such thing as the film as unit - it is splintered outwards through merchandise, sequels, promotion etc.Of course, 2 is most cherishable for being an incredible work of animation. So we're a bit jaded after STORY, but the CITIZEN KANE-like depth of field, the unheard of cinematic fluidity (which is not just trickery, but emotionally charged), the vibrant suburban colours, the ingenious characterisation (love Newman as, well, Newman), the awesome set-pieces (my favourite?  Either Woody's dream or Buzz and friends crossing the road) and exciting action, the musical-like freedom and audacity, the ingenious compositions, the very tangibility of the characters unavailable to live action, are all breathtaking.  In the end, I think I prefer the classical simplicity of STORY to this film's more varied daring, but who cares? This is the greatest sequel since THE GODFATHER, PART TWO, and it's a pretty good world that can find space for both these films AND a bolshy Hawksian heroine.

Probably the best Pixar sequel (doesn't have much competition though),How can a movie top the original by so much.

The animation is way better than TS1 and A Bugs Life which is incredible how they managed to fix it so much after just 1 year with Bugs and 4 for TS1 but here we are. The only bad part is the uncomfortable part with Al's crusty musty Cheeto dusty hands but that lasts like 6 minutes so it's forgivable.

A very charming movie that is worth seeing.,"This was a great movie!  I enjoyed the first and rarely think sequels equal or surpass the second, and this one easily equals the first Toy Story.  The plot was well written and the dialogue between Woody and Buzz, as well as the rest of the cast, is superb.  Much of the movie's humor is placed within the dialogue, and I enjoy movies like that.  The situations that Buzz and his pals find themselves in is humorus as well, but the dialogue that happens during those scenes is what makes the movie hysterical.The only part that was a little annoying is that the movie could have ended in three places, but it didn't.  The movie felt it dragged in places, but the ""extra"" scenes didn't take away from the movie either.  It was a very good movie and is definitely worth seeing.

"Brilliant, a must see for all the everyone.","We are only just creeping towards the end of the years second month and I already believe that I've just watched perhaps the best film for the year. Toy Story 2 is a must see for all people, kids and adults alike.For those of you that are unaware, not that many of you I'd imagine but, Toy Story follows the lives of a group of toys belonging to a child named Andy. Everytime Andy isn't in the room the toys come to life, I always knew that happened when I was a kid and now we have the proof. These toys get up to stunts and thrown into adventures, not all of which turn out to be fun, and this film follows the course of one such adventure.The basic plot inlvolves Woody (Tom Hanks) being sold off to a toy collector by accident. Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and a few others set off to get him back.The entire film is produced through computer generated images and they are absolutely stunning, its sometimes difficult to see the difference between these scenes and those in everday life. Obviously this adds to the realism of the picture.The script then backs up this world class animation. It achieves this through its humour, both slapstick and subtle throughout. Also through the characters of each toy, they each have there own personalities, which believe it or not, you will be able to relate to throughout the film.You care about whats going to happen, its sometimes edge of the seat stuff. The classic good guys versus bad guys, no hidden agenda, no political stance, no blood and guts, no swearing or vulgarity.

If more people would support films like this we wouldn't have to wonder why our kids grow up thinking that violence is the answer to every problem in life.  And it was a fun film for adults that can be kids at heart, too.  Please, keep these films coming.........",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Was much better than the prequel,"I wasn't so attracted by Toy Story as I did not find it so amusing and heart warming as the other Disney movies. But Toy Story 2 had the perfect zing that made it a really good movie. Here are some of the main things that the creators have improved in the movie which has made it better than the prequel:1) Woody was not shown too talkative and he didn't keep shouting like a mad person all the time, that's because he had lesser role in the film.2) Buzz Lightyear was my favorite in both the movies as he is shown as a brave, a bit cartoonish character who risks his own life to save has friend's life.3) Jessie and the horse were really good in the film. Jessie was not annoying in the movie at all, even if she kept sulking in the movie. Her voice casting was done perfectly and I felt really bad when she told about her life.4) There were many new characters in the movie who added zing to the film. The film also parodied Star Wars in one part of the film which was really funny.5) Mr. Potato head was not annoying in the film and also went to rescue Woody.6) There were few other side stories in the film which made the film more interesting.There were a few things that the film could have improved:1) The barbie dolls in the film didn't look too real and bright. The looked more artificial even when they became alive.2) Nobody could see the toys moving through the streets even though they were hidden and caused a number of accidents.3) There a few things that were similar to the prequel. The should have not copied anything from the prequel, or even if they copied, they should have shown it a bit different.Apart from these minor flaws, the film still was enjoyable for all ages.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A phenomenal sequel,"Pixar's first full-blown masterpiece. I'm rewatching them all and will see if any top it (Wall-E, Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, and The Incredibles have a chance, but we'll see), but for now I'd say it's my favourite Pixar movie.The original was already a fantastic film that could be enjoyed equally by kids and adults, and Toy Story 2 just takes everything that worked about that one and improves on it. Arguably, the main character arcs aren't as perfectly or tightly written, but on the other hand, there are interesting new characters and the film finds an unexpected and genuinely emotional dilemma for Woody.The other thing that I thought wouldn't be as impactful was the freshness of the animation, as Toy Story 1 was the first all-CGI animated movie and therefore stood out, but thankfully Toy Story 2 offers a huge improvement in the animation department. More varied environments, better lighting and reflections, more detailed objects, smoother movements for the characters, human characters that that don't look too uncanny, and a whole lot more things moving at once on screen are some of the improvements, and they came a long way as animators in just four years.As for the other improvements? Great new characters mixed with the old ones, even more humour, better villains, even more iconic/memorable scenes, and a greater emotional impact. The scene dealing with Jessie's backstory isn't just one of the saddest scenes in a family movie- it might be one of the saddest scenes in a movie full stop, and it's a brutal emotional gut punch that makes both Woody and the audience reconsider who Jessie is as a person completely.Not enough good things to say about this. Complaints-wise, maybe Buzz's story here isn't as good as his part in the first, and arguably one or two too many pop cultural references? But even that didn't really bother me, and honestly, there's so many jokes and almost all of them land.A fantastic watch, one of the best animated films of all time, and also one of the greatest sequels in movie history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The best pixar sequel until Incredibles 2 came out,I remember 25 years ago this fall that i saw Toy Story and loved it. Then came Toy Story 2 which was great. It was worth enjoying in the theater and i would love to get it on 4k soon. Lots of movie refs in this one and it sets up for Toy Story 3 which is just as good as the 4th one.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Who says sequels can't be great?,"Toy Story 2: When an evil toy collector kidnaps Woody, Buzz and the gang set out to rescue him.  But will they get to Woody in time, or will he be sold to a toy museum?This movie is proof that not all sequels have to suck (Aliens notwithstanding).  Once again the creators have crafted a solid story line, with the addition of several well-rounded new characters (they're not just there to provide colorful scenery).   I particularly enjoyed the winking nods to blockbusters past (the Star Wars take was hilarious) and the numerous in-jokes for the adults in the audience.  As always it's fun to play spot the Disney product placement (I saw characters from Bugs Life, Aladdin and the early Pixar shorts among others).    But the best thing about the sequel is the animation.With Toy Story, Pixar took computer animation to a level that most people only dreamed of (rent Wargames or Tron to see what ""cutting-edge"" used to look like).  Rather than rest on their laurels, the animators have gone a step further and deliver beautifully rendered landscapes, seamless action sequences, and even more realistic human characters.  Also, the amazing attention to detail - numbering the parts on the landing gear -makes you forget you are watching a cartoon (I kept expecting to see a gaffer's hand slip into view). This film leads me to believe that it will only be a matter of years before digital characters start replacing co-stars in live action films.If you're looking for a film the whole family can enjoy, this is it.  Just try to avoid the matinee, or the screaming will drown out half the filmAlso, make sure you stay until the end of the credits for the ""outtakes"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
flawless,"My wife and I loved the original toy story, and for good reason. In my opinion, it is a modern classic that upped the ante for animated films. Toy Story 2 ups the ante again.  The animation is breathtaking, the storyline wonderful, the music sweet, the humor funny, the message timeless. Need I go on?  If this film isn't a 10, then I don't know what is.  Everyone I saw, adults and children alike, left the theater with a smile on their face. If you see it and think it isn't a top notch example of its genre, you should have your head examined.

One of the ONLY animated FILMS ever!,"There is a rule in the movie world that some things are MOVIES and some are FILMS. Movies are just there to make money or fail at making any points or sharing any real ideas. Films are there to inspire and challenge the today you are in, or add thought to what would otherwise be a movie. Toy Story 1 was on the boarder of Movie and Film, I believe it to be a movie more than a film. However Toy Story 2 is no question a film. It's about growing up and moving on from a parent's point of view. But what makes it a film is it's inspiring touches that make it about what the viewer thinks it's about. As I think it's about how one should live there life before they die. Should they worry about what happens when you die? Should they try to preserve themselves by joining a group of people and living in a glass case? Or should they love and share love with whomever excepts it? Well our hero is faced with all three but chooses (wisely) the love theme.Woody is worried about Andy (his owner) throwing him away when he gets his first rip. He's afraid Andy will discard him since he is now a broken toy. (I guess this could relate in many ways to how adults fear their children will put them in nursing homes when their old and crazy). Woody then meets a group of toys that form a complete collection with him. This collection is rare and when assembled will be cased in a glass box for viewing only. (This sounds like religion in how it tells everybody to stay away from any fun they might have and makes them with fear.) This fear is very real in Woody as he is a broken toy and now knows he can't play (live) forever. After some really fun sense their is a point when Buzz Lightyear (Woody's counter part.) gives a speech about how isn't it better that Woody enjoy his limited time with Andy and have a neverending storybook of memories than to trap himself in a box where kids can look at him but the memories will be limited. This rings a bell with every parent. I could go on and on with reasons why Toy Story 2 is the greatest animated film to date, and will probably (like Beauty and the Beast) hold up for years and decades to come. **** (out of ****)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A strong follow-up to the tremendous 1995 hit, Toy Story, but the sequel is not quite up to the same standards as the original.","First of all, it should be noted that when I say that Toy Story 2 is not up to the standards of its predecessor, I do not mean the computer animation, which is just as spectacular as it was in 1995, if not better. One of the things that the 1995 version really tried to do (to some extent) was to avoid actually showing human faces. We never see the faces of adults particularly, and the faces of the children that we saw (such as Andy, the vicious Sid, and his pathetic little sister) are obviously animated and do not fit in with the level of reality achieved by the rest of the film. In Toy Story 2, we see a lot more faces, and while they're still never done quite right, it's good to see that they have made a significant improvement in this area.In the original Toy Story, we were so fascinated to see a presentation of the real life that we all imagined that our toys had when we were away that that was enough to make a great story for a great film, while in the sequel we are taken a lot deeper into the lives of our toys, which possess a lot more than even the extensive amount of emotion seen in the first film. The toys seem to possess a much deeper sense of neglect than was made clear by their competition over who is the favorite toy in the first movie, and we are even treated to an overly emotional and altogether unnecessary song called `When She Loved Me,' which really only serves to sadden the entire film and slow it down.There is an entirely new antagonist presented in the character of Big Al, the toy baron who desperately seeks Woody as the last toy to complete a classic collector set which he is planning on selling for some huge amount of money. We learn about Woody's past in this way, and he is faced with the conflict of staying with his friends (Andy's toys, as well as Andy himself), or returning to what I guess would be called his family, with the unfortunate addition that if he decides to do that, he will remain in a box and be looked at the rest of his existence, never to be played with or loved by a child again. The characters, thankfully, have all returned for the second movie, and we are again treated to a great show of hilarious adventure with them all, including a wonderful scene in which Buzz Lightyear finally encounters the evil Emperor Zurg, which results in a great toy battle scene that plays respectfully (note that, Kevin Smith, RESPECTFULLY) off of the battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back.The movie is yet another marvel of animation from the people at Pixar, and it does not fail in the least to generate laughs (see, for example, the ultimate result of the battle between Zurg and Buzz). Where the movie goes wrong (and, it should be noted, it goes VERY slightly wrong) is where it tries to insert too much emotion and sadness where it really doesn't belong. It was enough in the first film to see that Woody was so heartbroken as he watched Andy's interest in him begin to fade, but the sequel erroneously thinks that the audience should have tears brought to their eyes, which is just not true.But despite being overly emotional, Toy Story 2 captures the wonderful level of adventure and entertainment that made the original film so memorable, and it solidly earns itself a place as one of the great animated films. Fans of the original film are sure to love it, just beware of an excessive amount of emotion presented in the film. It's a comedy with a little too much heart, which makes it a little lop-sided, but the adventure is undeniably strong.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Rollicking, entertaining adventure","Rollicking, entertaining adventure. Even better than the first Toy Story.Good fun, with some great humour, exciting action and some decent drama and emotional content.As always, the CGI is great. Nothing to fault about the special effects and animation.Voices are spot-on, as with the first movie. We have the characters from the first movie, of course, but a few new ones too. Wayne Knight is perfect as Al the Toy Collector - he pretty much just had to be Newman again (though I kept thinking ""Newman!"" every time I heard him!).

The way a sequel was meant to be made.,"After watching numerous sequels, it is very hard to near impossible for a film to be just as good or even better than the original movie. Why?  Well, it's hard to come up with a brand new original script using the same characters and settings.  For Toy Story 2, its task was to bring out the same comedic and amusing personalities back into its old characters with a new good plot and brand new puns and jokes! Toy Story 2 did just that! Plus, the most important of all, it made a great plot to follow up from the original movie that is able to keep the audience entertained.The story line works great and how do the people at Pixar & Disney come up with those hilarious gags to fit so well together? It's great script writing where I won't be surprise and hopefully that a 2nd sequel will come out in another 4-5 years.Of course the plot is important for a sequel, but what else did this movie have that makes the sequel work? Well, it does display the movie as though time has past in-between the first movie.  Andy (Woody & Buzz's owner) and his baby sister looks as though they got about 2-3 years older, plus, new additions to the family and toys were added where the original movie left off. This sequel was made the way sequels are suppose to be made. Unfortunately, very few movies can achieve this goal. All I can say is that I had just as much fun watching this movie at the theater than I did of the original Toy Story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Toys are better than ever,"Don't be confused by the number.  Toy Story 2 is anything but a sequel. Sequels are continuations of original stories, but though the use of unoriginal ideas, a lack of enjoyable twists, rehashes moments from the original, and about half the original cast.  Toy Story 2 is actually an extention of the original.  It's breathes with the life of one of the most wonderful story ever created as an afterthought.Now, a little background for those of you who are behind.  In 1995, Disney, in association with Pixar, released the first fully computer-animated feature film, Toy Story.  The plot was a hilarious buddy comedy about toys, mainly Woody, the cowboy (Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear, the new spaceman toy (Tim Allen).  After some rivally and an adventure where Buzz realizes that he's a toy, the two become best friends.This time around, it's Woody who's in for the surprise of a lifetime. He's priceless.  Literally.  He's a collectors item; A rare doll based of the 50's tv show character from ""Woody's Round-Up"".  When Woody tries to rescue Wheezy from the Yard Sale, he ends up getting stolen by Al (Wayne Knight), owner of ""Al's Toy Barn"".  Thus, it's up to Buzz, Rex (Wallace Shaw), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), and Hamm (John Ratzenberger) to go on an another adventure through the city, the toy store, a skyscraper, the airport, and even a car chase (real car, not RC).Overall, this movie rings as good as the original, or even debatably better.  Just compare it to the Star Wars Episode IV and V fight or the Godfather I and II fight.   Each time the following movie actually seems to be better.  Toy Story 2 is proud to become an elitist member of those few movies.  The animation seemed to be superior thanks to newer computer technology.  And the story itself was both touching without ever going near preachy.  When Buzz says his speech about saving his friend, Woody cause that's what Woody did for him, that's all he says.  No lingering.  Just keep moving on.Odd little fact here: Toy Story 2 almost went the way of ""Simba's Pride"" and ""Return of Jafar"", direct to home video.  However, unlike those two, this movie was destined for the big screen and I applause Disney for giving it another shot.  I am, however, gonna go nuts waiting for the video or the ""dare-I-say-it?"" DVD release.The thing that caught me off guard was the action sequences.  Each one sucked me in deeper than anything I've seen in a long time.  The opening scene depicts Buzz Lightyear's very own video game as an intense action fight between him and the evil Emperor Zurg.  It's later recreated in an elevator shaft with more whimsical and comical results.  As for the climax, a tense piece of work on a airplane, I've never felt more nervous for a pair of pixelated pals in my entire life.  It's momently like those that make me anxiously await the Buzz Lightyear TV show that might be coming soon. (Take that Reboot and Beast Wars.)As for the characters themselves, they all were as great as the last time if they were in it the last time.  Hamm just continues being an extension of Ratzenberger's already perfected Cliff Claven from ""Cheers"".  Shawn's Rex as a video game freak just fits the character so perfectly, it's a wonder it wasn't thought of for the original.  Woody and Buzz are still the preemo centerpiece character's and even if their together time is minimal in this one, you still gotta love the goofy two.As for the new character's, they're all lacking.  The main new character is the cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack) and she's as dull as a school-board debate. The only time you care for her is during the emotional new song by Sarah McLaughlin, otherwise, you just want her screen time to end.  As for the others, Mrs. Potato Head was put in only because she was referenced in the ending to the last one, Bo Peep is still playing fifteenth banana after the Etch-A-Sketch, and as great as it is to see Barbie in the movie, it wonders if Mattel will be happy with the end result (a dopey bimbo who's as plastic as ""BarbieGirl"" makes her out to be).But I guess what makes Toy Story 2 truly great are all the jokes. Especially the gags that are hidden all over the place.  Most people caught a few obvious ones in the first movie (""Hakuna Matata"" in the car, a Mickey Clock on Andy's wall) and missed the more subtle ones (the toolbox in Sid's room is by Binford, as in ""Home Improvement"").  This movie is no exception. First, there is the new addition to Andy's room, ""A Bug's Life"" calendar on the wall.  And then a delicious parody of ""Jurrasic Park' T-Rex tailing the car in the rear-view mirror.  And finally, the ultimate rip on Star Wars ever.  I'm not even gonna hint you about it.  This is one joke that must throw you off guard to be truly appreciated it.Thus, in the end, I recommend this one to anyone who's a fan of toys, classic stories, great action sequences, wonderful jokes, and of course, the original story.  Now, call me a nit-picker but some of the computer effects are just too shiny when compared to the original.  But hey, who am I to critizise Pixar?  I have a hard enought time using paintbrush on my computer.  Catch this movie the moment you can.  Masterpieces like this movie must be treasures.  I only wish Pixar could work twice as hard to create new movies as I anxiously await the next title by them, the currently titled ""Monsters, Inc.""  All I ask for is one thing: hey guys, while you're at it, ""Toy Story 3?""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Superb!,"Once again, John Lasseter and the gang at Pixar have outdone themselves.

I saw this film with my wife, and my four-year-old. We all had a great time. Great slapstick for the kids, incredible in-jokes for the adults. Look for all sorts of Pixar characters sprinkled throughout the movie, plus great homages to other popular films.Perhaps the biggest treat: Before the movie, (at least when I saw it in Suburban Atlanta), they showed Pixar's first short: LUXO, JR.

You've got a friend in me,"Four years passed since the huge success of ""Toy Story"" and the producers Pixar and Disney had not yet fully believed the amount of tickets and the technological innovation and follow-up that they had created. For his part, Lasseter began to work again (after his excellent insect fable) to get a sequel that was at the level of its predecessor, and go if he did, reaching to overcome it in many ways. 'Toy Story 2' is the best example of how to make the perfect sequel, which improves even the first one. The script is more worked, with a wonderful prologue heir of modern science fiction, and the characters are more nuanced and defined, as well as the incursion of new characters that will be decisive in the development and resolution of the plot. The adventures, humor and action continue giving us unforgettable moments that will undoubtedly go down in the history of cinema, worthy of a master. The rhythm returns to no truce at any time of the footage and entertainment is once again top-level for all audiences, wishing that the film does not end.As for the script, Lasseter again gets another absolute wonder that shows all his enormous talent by perfectly combining a hilarious and hilarious comedy with a pure adventure tape in miniature size, and leaving moments for the memory and reassuring the suspense in many sections and the spectacularity in the action scenes.In short, a very good sequel to that wonder that was 'Toy Story', coming to surpass it in many ways as a more elaborate plot and an excellent prologue, with a really fun script and loaded with suspense, adventures and action full of dynamism and a contagious joy, that transform 'Toy Story 2' into an unrepeatable and impenetrable wonder from beginning to end.· THE BEST: the dynamism and the enormous entertainment it provides. The script. The prologue The hilarious nod to 'Star Wars'.· THE WORST: still nothing happens to me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A great sequel,"It was a brave decision to have Pixar's third movie be a sequel but I'm glad it happened because Toy Story 2 is up there as one of the best animated sequels. The animation is better, I can finally look at a human without needing a sick bag by my side. I don't find it as funny as Toy Story but I still got a few laughs. As far as villains go, Toy Story has a fair few you could consider, Stinky Pete is a good villain, arguably better than Sid because he actually has reasons for his actions. Al is decent enough if you count him, and Zurg and Utility Belt Buzz are basically there for jokes, which in fairness I enjoyed the Star Wars parody. Whilst I don't think Toy Story 2 is better than Toy Story, it is definitely a great movie almost on par with the first and better than A Bug's Life that's for sure.Pixar ranking so far:

Buzz sets out to rescue Woody with a selection of the finest toys. All manner of mayhem ensues and this amazingly is probably a better film than the first.

For a Pixar film it is also moderately relaxing, which makes it easier for me to watch it. The characters are well developed, including both the new ones and the old ones.

I can hardly list them all, so you will have to watch this for yourself! :-)There are a few things I do not like about it, as well.

"More Toys, More Story, More Fun",(In this review I will attempt to not divulge any plot points about this fabulous movie so I will be very brief)John Lasseter has outdone himself again. Bettering what is perhaps one of the greatest animated titles of all time (Toy Story) is no easy feat but the creative geniuses at Pixar have done so marvelously.Toy Story 2 is not only a stronger film visually than the original but is more enjoyable structurally as well. The  characters (old characters along with a cast of new characters) are even richer than in the original movie and as the story progresses the mixture of humor and heartfelt emotion hits home powerfully.I have not felt so giddy with excitement while viewing a movie in a long time. At the end of this movie and well after the credits had finished rolling I still had the silliest grin plastered across my face.It would be a huge injustice if I did not strongly recommend this movie as a must see for everyone.

"Not as good as the first, but still a great movie","A lot of people say that Toy Story 2 is a sequel that is better than the original. Well, the first Toy Story is my favorite animated movie of all time, so of course I have to disagree. But that doesn't stop the fact that this is still an amazing movie.Like the first, the animation is fantastic, even better this time. The old characters are engaging, and it's funny as heck. New characters are added this time, such as Jessie, the yodeling cowgirl, who I thought was a little annoying in the beginning, but began to really like as the film went on. Bullseye, a horse who make so much emotion with his eyes and mouth. The Prospector, who acts sort of like a father figure to Woody, and Barbie, who is so sweet it's almost sickening, but man is she fun.There are a lot more villains in this film, the main one is Al, who flat out steals Woody. Zurg, Buzz Lightyear's arch enemy, some might say that the second Buzz is another villain, and there's even a surprise villain, who I won't give away.The movie deals with a lot more adult themes, such as growing up. Woody begins to wonder what will happen to him when Andy grows up and doesn't play with him anymore.The plot is so jam packed that I won't go into it, over all, it's still an excellent movie, but I still like the first one more, even if this one may be better in it's story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Heart-warming for all,"I have a six year old daughter and I was as involved in this movie as much as she was. We both applauded at the end and I cried a few times. This movie is one of the wittiest written, and sweetest movies I have ever seen. I enjoyed the new characters in it and each of the toys has such a strongly written personality that makes them one you feel like owning. The animation was superb as was the music.

"Amazing, stunning achievement","The film follows the continuing adventures of `Andy's toys,' particularly Woody (Tom Hanks), the pullstring cowboy, and Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), the space action figure. This time, the dilemma centers around what happens to toys when they are cast aside for more `grownup' pursuits.It seems that Woody is a collector's item, and is stolen by a greedy toy salesman (Wayne Knight). Woody finds that he was part of `Woody's Roundup,' a 1950's TV show that was cancelled after Sputnik. He meets Jessie (Joan Cusak), a rowdy cowgirl, his horse Bulls-eye, and Prospector Pete (Kelsey Grammer), who has never been opened and is doomed to live inside his box. Buzz gathers the toys (all of the cast members from the first film are back, with all their wonderful talent) and sets off on a rescue mission. The ensuing adventure is not to be missed, with action sequences so fully realized and believable that it's easy to forget this is an animated film. The visuals, of course, are mind-blowing, given the newer technology.The film deals with very poignant issues regarding whether toys should be in a museum or played with until they're forgotten. When Jessie sadly reminisces about her former owner (`When She Loved Me,' sung by Sarah McLaughlin), it was one of the most touching moments I've seen on film in a long time. `Toy Story 2' takes the original in wonderfully new and inventive directions. It is already being called the `Godfather II' of animation; in other words, improving a seemingly unimprovable film. Frankly, the film is worthy of a Best Picture Oscar nomination. Not too bad for a sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The grand toy adventure,"The original Toy Story played out mostly in Andy's room and his neighbor's house. It was a great story but one that felt a little confined, quick excursion to Pizza Planet notwithstanding. Toy Story 2 opens up the toy world, providing room for a great, grand adventure. This story can go anywhere and that creates opportunity for great visuals, great laughs and great, big action. Big action in an animated movie about toys? Yes indeed. What happens when a group of toys tries to cross the road? Mayhem. Beautiful, hilarious mayhem.All our favorite toys from the first movie are back for Toy Story 2. This time the story focuses largely on Woody, who discovers that he is a prized collectible, the star of an old, popular TV puppet show. He finds that he is actually part of a set of toys. There's Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl, Stinky Pete the Prospector and Bullseye, Woody's horse. This is all very exciting for Woody. Or it would be if not for how it is he came to discover all this about himself. Woody was kidnapped by greedy toy collector Al who plans to sell Woody and the rest of his gang to a toy museum in Japan. How can Woody get back to Andy? Well, duh. Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Buzz leads a daring, perilous crosstown rescue mission. There will be many obstacles along the way. And the biggest foe for Buzz Lightyear will be...Buzz Lightyear! What a twisted, funny toy world we live in.If there is any complaint at all with Toy Story 2 it would be that Woody and Buzz are largely kept apart. The chemistry and interplay between these two characters gave the first movie much of its charm and there's a sense this movie misses that a little bit. But there are more than enough good things here to make the sequel a clear success. First off, the film looks spectacular. For as great an achievement in animation as the first Toy Story was the sequel takes it to another level. There are some truly breathtaking visuals here. The story is compelling, with plenty of room for both humor and drama. And some real poignancy too. All the voice actors do a great job bringing their toys to life. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are the big stars but every performer plays his or her part perfectly. All the old favorites from the first movie are back and there are some great new additions too. Joan Cusack is a wildly enthusiastic Jessie. Jodi Benson provides plenty of laughs in playing Barbie. Stinky Pete seems to have a lot of Sideshow Bob in him. And there is room for a human or two in this toy world, Wayne Knight as Al the Toy Collector making for a great villain. Kids will surely love the movie but adults will too. Plenty of sly references and lots of subtle humor that may have the parents chuckling while their children wonder what's so funny. All in all Toy Story 2 is the rare sequel which does not disappoint, a clearly worthy successor to the original movie which was so beloved.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Toy Story 2,"Toy Story 2 is the second film in the Toy Story franchise. It explores more of Woody's origins and what he is based on. It has Andy going to cowboy camp and Woody being stolen by a toy collector during that time. The toy collector (Al) is obsessed with toys relating to Woody and plans on completing his collection and selling them to a museum. With that, we really learn where Woody came from. We get introduced to cowgirl Jessie and horse Bullseye, both originally from the same show Woody was. Getting to know more about Woody's past is what makes it a good sequel. Us getting a Woody's Roundup show would be a good idea for Pixar to do. If they did it to Buzz twice (in both a show and a theatrical film), they could do it with Woody. Knowing his origins as a toy seems to propel his story forward as it can help see how he could grow in the future. Probably my favorite Toy Story movie with the first as a close second. Sure does bring the same amount of emotional depth along plus the Woody being trusted into his origins really makes a good film alongside the nostalgia bonus.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The new characters are all very interesting, especially my boy Buster.While being a solid piece of entertainment through and through, it also manages to touch upon some adult themes like changes in adolescence, existential crisis etc.The star wars references were on point.

The best sequel ever made.,"Toy Story 2 is an absolute masterpiece and a huge improvement over the original in every way. It's a deep character study on what it means to be a toy, has enough laughs to make you pass out, enough tears to fill a pool, and an absolute riot of a cast of characters. Not only is it the best sequel ever made, but it's also the best Pixar movie ever made (with the exception of The Incredibles AND Monster's Inc.). Whether you're a kid, teen or adult, you'll love everything about it in all of its glory. The road to glory is paved in gold, and this is the gold, Pixar has something to be proud of.

"As orginal as the first ""Toy Story""!!!!","This sequel continues the adventures of the toys in Andy's bedroom. Woody gets accidently taken away by a evil toy collector . It is up to Buzz Lightyear and the other toys to save him. To do this they must travel though the dangerous of streets,a toy story, the building where the collector lives and the perils of a very busy airport!!After Woody arrives at the home of the collector, he learns of the past of the toy and the stuff that went with the toy!!He also meets a old man , a young woman and a horse. They were also part of the fad of"" Woody's Round-Up"". Eventually the toys get to Woody after having a series of misadventures in the toy store owned by the collctor.

No sequelitis for the Pixar mob.,"Directed by John Lasseter, Ash Brannon. With the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammar. Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wayne Knight.When Woody is stolen by a toy collector, Buzz and the gang set about rescuing him. However, after meeting Jessie the Cowgirl and Stinky Pete the Prospector, Woody learns of something from his past that is now impacting greatly on his new found friends. Decisions will have to be made and someone is going to be hurt......After the roaring success of the ground breaking Toy Story (1995), news of a sequel was perhaps met with hardly any surprise. What may have surprised many was that it is every bit as good as the first film, even going a bit darker in the theme department, making it a precursor of Pixar movies to come later down the line. Pixar understandThat a golden rule of a good sequel is to not only jack up the action, but also to expand the characters at the same time, and they do this in spades. There's more chases, clashes and all round malarkey, the effects imagery is obviously better four years down the line, while the toy town take on certain other blockbuster movies rewards the film fan considerably. The grim thematics of mortality and abandonment are brilliantly written into the plot, with some of the character interactions worthy of bigger budgeted highbrow dramas, and the set pieces are terrifically mounted, especially for the thrilling last quarter.It was a tough act to follow, but the Pixar crew have done everything one can reasonably expect with Toy Story 2. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's better than its predecessor, but it certainly is its equal, and that is still the highest of praises. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Good fun, characters return with an interesting twist, perhaps even better than the original.","I couldn't actually believe that I hadn't seen Toy Story 2 when it popped up on Television at Xmas, it seemed so long ago and since I enjoyed Toy Story so much there was no reason not to have seen the follow up. Yet I hadn't, for some strange reason it had dropped off my list of what to watch, so I sat down with a glass of something nice and red and returned to the world of toys.There's nothing too different about this movie from the first apart from the storyline itself, the characters and their voices are all the same, and they've recaptured them perfectly for this movie. Probably the only negative point of the similarity is the animation, CGI has moved on since Toy Story and it shows a little here, however what is good is that the animation of Toy Story has a unique quality to it and even if you were to see a few seconds without any recognisable characters you would know it was a Toy Story movie. So although the animation appears slightly dated (especially seeing it years after release) it does help to pull you into that world again.Cleverly though the writers have looked at the world of toys and looked for other challenges that they would face if they really were alive, and they've come up with some superb ideas. They've created situations and scenes that are extremely imaginative and yet so obvious (if you were a toy), and what they've pulled out of these are some great performances for the characters and actors, and some genuinely funny moments. Often with a sequel you are treated to an inferior story and less laughs (with a comedy anyway, with other genres you often get more laughs!) but what they've done here is to raise the bar over the original Toy Story, and frankly it was something I just couldn't believe they could do.The characters are genuinely lovable and understandable, it's all too easy to get attached to them and be pulled into their world. Before long you find yourself caring for them and you'll be feeling their highs and lows, and even a small lump in the throat at times.There were a few nods to other movies in here, again I won't spoil it by listing them, but they added to the adult factor of the film, something which Pixar has really managed to comprehend. They manage time and time again to make a movie which appeals to both children and adults together without any clash of the two. It will certainly be interesting to see where the Disney only sequel will go.Overall it's a very satisfying movie giving you everything you want from a good family movie, whether you be a kid or an adult, or even somewhere in between, it's a great fun movie with some good laughs, and definitely on a par if not better than the original.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A great deal of fun for the young and old!,"The animation, as in the first, was very believable because of its exhaustive attention to detail.

Handled with Care,"I think every kid in North America was excited to find out that there was going to be a Toy Story 2. And, despite a tumultuous and difficult production (including, at one point, the film actually being deleted), it was released to great fanfare.For me, both as a kid and now, Toy Story 2 is better than the original. The stakes are a lot higher, we get some great new characters added to the cast (including Joan Cusack's Jessie, whose story arc provides the bulk of the emotional impact of the film), and there's a much greater sense of adventure in this film.Once again, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are incredible in the lead roles, giving the chemistry necessary to make the Woody/Buzz dynamic work. And, of course, Randy Newman is back to do the score on this one (who, again, I'm not a huge fan of), but I think he does a pretty good job of handling this film. Pixar's second biggest tool of emotional manipulation is the music, so the movie only truly works emotionally if the music delivers, and this film certainly works.Also, not to mention, this film offers up one of the most satisfying scenes in cinematic history with Woody's restoration (no more info to avoid spoilers). It's one of the scenes I looked forward to as a kid when I watched on VHS.The most important thing about this film is that it's not a total rehash of the original. Sure, it's got some of the same elements, but that's inevitable in a film with the same characters in the same universe. They very easily could've done a cut-and-paste sequel of the first one, with another horrible kid moving in next door to torture the toys, but they didn't do that, and I think that's one of the reasons why this sequel holds up so well today. They took the best of the original film, touched up some of the lesser elements, and proceeded forward with great care. This movie is a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Wow.,"This movie has stayed with me for several days now,  and I can't seem to get it out of my head.

The Best of the Toy Story Movies?,"Toy Story 2 had a great plot first and foremost and the animation improvement over it's 4 year old counter part is a testament to the technology of the time. Only their own parent company (Disney) could rival them in that endeavor. They didn't just keep the toys in one place Andy was completely absent in this film until the very end. It had many fun scenes, like the Airplane and Prospector Stink Pete scenes, the back stories for some of them get surprisingly dark and interesting and despite the movie taking place at a table. The flashbacks kept things interesting and Woody's best friend Jessie was easily the character that made the film what it was. The first three films despite having Woody as the lead (obviously) focused on three different characters in Toy Story 1 it was Buzz, in Toy Story 2 it was Jessie and in Toy Story 3 it was Lotso, Barbie and Buzz. Alas all good things must come to an end so Toy Story 4 focused entirely on Woody. Just a keen observation I made after watching these movies a dozen times. Toy Story 2 will always remain the best because of it's tech, plot, story, and acting in my opinion. I want to talk about the villain but that would entail this movie having a spoiler warning so I'll pass on mentioning the name but out of the four films Toy Story 2 had the second best villain after Toy Story 3's insanely good one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Fantastic!!! Better than Original,"Well I know it is hard to believe but it is better than the original. I don't know how they did it but it is fantastic. I love it and will see it multiple times.

This movie is full of laughter, fun , some sad moments and some where you are on the edge of your seat at what will happen next. It does make you think of life from a toys perspective.Oh and in case you worried like I did that all the new characters would detract from our favorites from the original - don't worry they just add to the fun. They even poke fun at Star Wars, Barbie etc.This movie rates higher than 10 and in some ways is indescribable. Just go see it!

I'm impressed,"The original Toy Story was a pretty good animated film, especially good for kids. It was inventive and consistently entertaining, but for some reason, it never quite gelled. I'm beside myself trying to explain what was lacking. I don't know. At the end, I just went about my day without thinking about it much. And I wasn't all that excited about Toy Story 2. I had heard that it was better than the original, but I was skeptical. Well, I finally got around to watching it, and it blew me away. It was extraordinarily good. I have hardly ever laughed as hard. It also has an amazingly intelligent script. Its only problems are a little hyperactivity, which all American animated films are guilty of (if you don't know what I'm talking about, rent Kiki's Delivery Service or My Neighbor Totoro, both children's movies from Japan, and you'll notice how much more relaxed they are), and one TERRIBLE song. Oh my God, it is sickeningly sappy. Otherwise, a nearly perfect film. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Even better than the original...and the original was marvelous!,"The history of film-making has shown that sequels are rarely ever a patch on the original. And only rarely ever can a sequel overcome its predecessor and oftentimes there are complex reasons why. An example was ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2"". The sequel is considered to be better, then again, it was made on a higher budget and a longer shooting schedule.But when a sequel can overcome a prequel when both were made on similar budgets and schedules, then the filmmakers really have outdone themselves. The first ""Toy Story"" was and still is a marvelous, funny, classic animated film that is perfect for family entertainment. Pixar worked their magic again when they gathered the cast and crew to make ""Toy Story 2"", which is even better. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, and the others reprise their roles as the toys that come to life whenever there's no human around to witness. The voice acting, once again, is flawless and the screenwriters did a fantastic job with the script.The humor in the film is even more effective than the hilarious examples from the first ""Toy Story"". A favorite part of mine is when the rescue party out to find Woody, who has been stolen by a toy collector, find they have to cross a busy highway. Rex, after seeing a car crush an aluminum can, simply says in a laconic ""Oh, well, we tried."" and tries to walk away. Like with the first film, I now find the humor, the animation, and the film overall even better than when I first saw and adored it as a child.To make a long story short, ""Toy Story 2"" is a modern-day classic. It outdoes an original, which is miraculous seeing as how the original was magnificent and flawless. It is perfectly-paced, is effectively animated, never falls short on its entertainment value, and is a film I highly recommend for audience members of all ages. It won't frighten children, but it also won't be too subtle for teenagers and adults.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

TOY STORY 2 Even Better Than the First,"Pixar raised the standard for feature film animation with their wildly successful TOY STORY in 1995. It was a fun adventure for the kids that was so well done that adults could enjoy it with them. Sequels are notorious for failing to live up to the original (with obvious exceptions) and TOY STORY 2 could've easily ended up as a direct-to-DVD throwaway in an attempt to cash in on the success of the original. Instead, I felt it surpassed the quality of the first and brought even more to the table. The film follows Woody as the begins to sink in that toys don't last forever. His arm is torn and Woody is shelved, a seeming death sentence for toys. In an attempt to rescue a fellow broken toy from being sold at a yard sale, Woody is stolen by an obsessed collector who wishes to complete his ""Woody's Round-Up"" collection for sale to a Japanese museum. Upon arriving at the collector's apartment, Woody meets the other members of his round-up gang (Jessie, his loyal horse Bullseye, and Stinky Pete the Prospector) and it's revealed that Woody is actually a collector's item spawned from a popular kid's television show of the 50s. As Buzz Lightyear assembles the rest of Andy's toys to mount a rescue operation, Woody must make a decision: immortal glory as part of a museum exhibit or the temporary love of his owner Andy.All of our favorite toys from the first film return with the original voice cast, with a few new additions. Estelle Harris (George Costanza's mom on SEINFELD) is Mrs. Potato Head and Joan Cusack is Jessie; both have some hilarious moments and fit right in with the originals. While Woody and Buzz are the stars, my favorite characters have always been the supporting players: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), and Rex (Wallace Shawn). We get plenty of them as they accompany Buzz on the mission and their romp through a toy store is just great. Despite the awesomeness of the toy cast, one of my favorite characters is toy collector Al (Wayne Knight). Knight is great as the spastic money-grubbing baddie who's finally gotten the final piece to his cash cow.The movie felt more action-oriented than the first. The first TOY STORY had its moments but this film ups the ante with the toys crossing a dangerously busy four-lane road, a twisting chase through a cavernous airline baggage sorter, and an eventual chase over the tarmac to reach a plane. While it is a kid's movie by nature, it's still a fun movie to people of any age thanks to the characters and a universal love of our childhood playthings. The story was well written and Woody's dilemma over his mortality as a toy is an interesting followup to Buzz's moment of depressing recognition that he was indeed just a toy in the first film. Overall, a great family film and easy to recommend to anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Weakest of the Trilogy, It's Still a Roaring Success","In a lot of ways, sequels reveal more about the strength of the original than any amount of repeated viewings. Without the requisite introductions, meet-and-greet and initial character developments, the strength of the core cast is stripped bare. They're left to prove their worth in the great wide open, and what successes or failures they find can be a great judge of their quality. In Toy Story's case, Woody and Buzz's second adventure is definitive proof of what a deep, colorful yarn Pixar had actually sewn in their first feature-length effort. The troupe doesn't even stop for a breath as they plunge right into topics that range from emotional attachment and the importance of a family unit to isolation and abandonment. Of course, such weighty subjects aren't addressed pointedly; instead they're gracefully interwoven into the backdrop of a bright, rousing Incredible Journey-styled venture through the city in search of an important stolen toy. Stuffed with throwbacks that are sure to elicit cheery memories of the first picture, it's also loaded up with new material that's every bit as charming. Though I wouldn't quite put it on the same level as the original, and I felt that the messages of the recent third chapter are more poignant, it still sits near the top of Pixar's portfolio.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

a very entertaining experience,"""Toy Story 2"" is definitely as good of a movie as I expected.  It is simply a magnificent follow-up to the genius of the original ""Toy Story.""  It's refreshing to know that they still make quality movies like this that the whole family can enjoy.  ""Toy Story 2"" is funny, smart, energetic, very imaginative, and definitely an enjoyable adventure.  The characters are all witty and likable.  The story is strong, it is clear that a lot of thought went into making a solid sequel, rather than just some money-making trash film.  Disney and Pixar have done it again with a third success of a film. It definitely lives up to expectations and it is just so unique in a number of ways.  Everyone in the family will enjoy it, as the movie is geared to entertain people of all ages.  The film is very close to being as good as the original; the music isn't quite as good as the first Toy Story, and the idea isn't as original as it was in 1995.  But ""Toy Story 2"" is an outstanding moviegoing experience, one of the best I've had in years.  It is just such an appealing film that gives me hope that the movie industry isn't going completely downhill.  This is one of the best sequels ever, living up to the original as only a few sequels (such as ""Ghostbusters II"") have. The animation is just as unbelievable as ""Toy Story.""  Tim Allen and Tom Hanks do indeed have a presence beyond physical appearance as their characters' voices reflect the actors themselves.

I laughed more than any kid in the theater.,"I'm now 50 and haven't been in a theater with as many kids in the last 40 years. I don't know what the kids liked about it, but I enjoyed a constant supply of jokes, which touched my past experience, to keep me in tears (95% from laughter) for the entire film.

My favourite Pixar flim!,"Toy Story 2 could have EASILY used all the same characters, plot, message and animation of the first movie but instead it took all those and made it better! There are more memorable characters, it goes for a more emotional tone, it looks fantastic (especially for an animated movie in 1999) and it tells an original story about what your place is in not only your own life, but someone else's. Toy Story 3 and 4 were also great but even they couldn't surpass this masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Update: Toy Story 3 Rocks 2 (Duh).,"This time Buzz and Woody, now best buds, are separated by a fiendish toy collector who plans to sell Woody, and Buzz and other Toys must venture outside to save him With unexpected results.One of the only sequels to actually improve on the original, and it must be said the original was pretty good to begin with.The animation was already a massive advancement on the first, the jokes were funnier and the characters more finely drawn, given that it was already their second outing.In fact, forget this. If you haven't seen Toy Story 2 you're missing out. I don't care if you have kids or not, or if you are one yourself, (ESPECIALLY if you are a kid). And if you are, leave this website, I swear too much.What you hope kids will learn: It doesn't matter if things change, enjoy the time you have with something or someone.What they'll take away: Sayyy, my Woody toy is getting on.

The Bots are Back in Town,"A fine fine movie that really is a rarity in many ways. It's an animated movie which works on both the levels intended. Yes as expected it is great for children but unusually it succeeds with the jokes aimed at adults to (and as we adults know most of its competitors fail miserably there). Then we have the double whammy of a sequel that lives up to and in many cases surpasses the original (hard to think of many other candidates for that past the mighty duo of 'The Godfather Part II' & 'The Empire Strikes Back'), and that is even with Toy Story 2's story not being that far removed from that of the original! This time it is Buzz that has to save Woody but from a much more evil perpetrator than the kid next door, this time it is from an adult and not even a normal one at that a toy shop owner who intends to ship woody of to a toy museum in Japan and make himself a tidy sum in doing so. This results in a number of great set pieces which have great elements of action and comedy binding them together. As one expects from Pixar the animation is superb, but as with most of their other movies (and where so many of their competitors fail) it is the quality of the script that is the bedrock of this movie. A tight story with a cracking script that has endless one liners and equal amounts of action, comedy and pathos all welded together by some superb direction make this a timeless classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Fine sequel if not as strong as the first,"Toy shop owner Al kidnaps Woody and plans to display him in a museum in Japan, but Buzz and the gang plan to stop him.Pixar's 1995 triumph Toy Story was arguably the finest animation of all time and its success brought on this sequel which is faster and more daring, if not quite as sharp.This 1999 picture has one of the finest openings you will ever see and will beat any other animation opening; even Wall-E trundling along is no match for this. In space we see Buzz Lightyear zooming towards an alien infested planet and what follows is a jaw dropping action soaked sequence of good versus evil with a fine comic twist.Again we are invited into the toys lives as they face another human tradition that will determine their lives, a yard sale, which sets the story going in a frantic and funny way.Evidently a viewing of the first is a necessity to understand the characters and their environment as this film makes plenty of references to the first.There are plenty of similarities to its Oscar nominated predecessor. For example, the idea of facing demons, adjusting to a different life and importantly friendship. Toy Story was brilliant for having an originality and a great collection of personal messages to its viewers.This sequel feels frequently like the first with the same jokes with the occasional twist. A lot of scenes can be predictable and unfunny.However this film differs by being more relaxed in its storytelling approach. There is more comedy which will delight the family for popcorn viewing. There is a delightful collection of intertextuality from 2001: a space odyssey, Jurassic Park and a hilarious parody of Star Wars: the empire strikes back, which will have the adults in stitches.This is not to say the franchise has lost its sentimental side. This in a lot of ways is more upsetting than the first as it explores the inevitable of when a child no longer plays with toys. This is not a cheesy coming of age representation, but a hard dramatic rite of passage, which will cast your mind back to the time when you no longer played around.As I write a third instalment is being filmed and hopefully we can see another film with great humour and a hard hitting message.The DVD also has a fine collection of outtakes during the credits which are the funniest thing about it.More adventurous and relaxed, Toy Story 2 is quite different from the first with more comedy and another hard message.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Even better than the original,"I loved the original Toy Story, and when I found out they were making a sequel I wasn't sure how good it was going to be. Well, I certainly was amazed when I went to see it. The animation is better, the story line is also better, and there are even more characters and more uproarious humor.The story picks up from where the second one left off, only this time, Woody is stolen by a greedy toy collector. The other toys led by Buzz go off to find him. While Woody is stolen, he finds out who he really is. Throughout the movie, the toys learn a good lesson of morals and making the right choice.There are several references to other movies, making this a very hilarious film, with plenty of action and a creative opening scene. This movie teaches us about the origin of Woody, and even Buzz Lightyear. The animation is quite impressive, and this movie proves that the Pixar company never goes wrong, and is capable of making sequels superior to the originals.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Taking a clue from Kevin Smith,"Toy Story 2 was time well spent at the local cinema, even if you have to take 4 kids along with you!

S. - After the sequels, maybe the villain in this movie wasn't so wrong about the reason he did what he did!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This is not a superior sequel,"Some say that ""Toy Story 2"" is better than ""Toy Story"" and I have to disagree. This sequel doesn't really add a lot of new elements. The creators did think up cool and interesting ways to use the toys or the abilities of the toys was fun at some parts, but that didn't really do it for me. The scene where the toys are running around the toy store trying to find Woody was amusing and all, but to sum it all up it's basically a rescue mission with toys. Except instead of Woody trying to rescue Buzz, the roles are reversed. It just basically adds new toys and some cameos, but besides the creative ways each of the toys act and do with what they are given, I just don't see how this movie can be superior to the first ""Toy Story"" movie. Even the scene with Zurg was not that necessary, it didn't really add or take away from the film.***Might be spoiler*** Buzz who is the character that Tim Allen played, but entertaining cause of the personality and stood out from the other toys. But in this one he isn't as interesting and I know they had to go in this direction, but with it's character but it was still dull compared to his character in the first movie and thus the creators just tossed a second Buzz in the film.All in all, it was a fun movie but definitely not superior to the first ""Toy Story'8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Far more than a sequel,When it comes for a sequel by Disney I am so disappointed with it. But Toy Story 2 is far more Better one for both Kids and Adults pixar has darn it again with a great sequel to a Great film. During my early childhood years I was not impressed by CGI but this on the other hand blows my head away. It was so great to see the toys get a bigger adventure then the Frist one. My favorite part in the film was where the toys are crossing the road.All throe CGI was bit cheesy and the story was slow its still a great sequel over all 9/10 wrath watching make sure you see Toy Story 3 that one rocks.,9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Funny And Entertaining,"I think with the Toy Story movies, we have gotten to know the characters. The gang in Toy Story. We get to know them enough where they could be in a Toy Story TV show as we get to know them and their personalities. We seem to get to know the characters better in this film than any of the other Toy Story movies, and with a couple of characters added including Jessie and Bullseye that remain productive characters through the rest of the series. This movie is also one of the few sequels that does better than its predecessor and seems somewhat more popular. You can watch the movie and understand the feelings of the toys which is explained also in the 3rd movie. Yeah, kids play with Toys when they're young but normally stop playing with them when they're older. The Toy Story movies makes the toys we see come to life, and not in a creepy way or like the Velveteen Rabbit, but really seem like real characters with voices of actors we are familiar with. It's interesting how nobody ever really seems to suspect the toys are alive when they do a lot of things that people would have to notice. Somehow the toys can hide the fact that they're alive as seen in all 3 Toy Story movies.If you watch this movie, I'm sure you'll be entertained, as I find these Toy Story movies about the most entertaining films in Pixar, and so far there have been 3 Toy Story movies. I thought I even saw one Halloween movie for Toy Story at Redbox this past Halloween. So, the characters really are characters we get to know and that entertain us. It looks like they're coming out with a Toy Story 4. I was kind of hoping for a Toy Story 4 after the 3rd one as I like the continuation of the series with these toys. I was wondering if they would, because I thought I heard earlier that they weren't going to have a new film, not having anywhere else they could go with the plot. Well, apparently they are doing a new film. It's interesting how these Toy Story movies date back to 1995 and they don't age. We can be making sequels from them years later with the same characters and they work for us.Of all the Toy Story movies, I consider this one to be the funniest. I can really laugh when I see it, especially at the end with the outtakes. This is the only Toy Story movie I know of which has outtakes at the end. I know the first Toy Story didn't, I forget if the 3rd one did. But, seriously the outtakes at the end make this movie like twice as funny as it is during the end credits alone.I'm sure most of you here reading this review have seen this movie. I'm also sure that if you've seen Toy Story and Toy Story 3, you've also seen Toy Story 2. This one might be my second favorite in the series. I feel like the plot in the first movie works the best, but I feel like this one is the funniest in the series. I feel like Toy Story 3 has a somewhat similar plot to this one. I wonder where they'll go in the next film. I guess we will see in 2 years. I give it a 10/10. It is that well done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The toys are back!,"In the sequel to the groundbreaking Toy Story, Woody, Buzz and the rest of the gang are back for another thrilling adventure. This time Woody is kidnapped by a ruthless toy collector and it's up to his friends to save him before he gets shipped off to Japan and spend the rest of his life behind glass.There's not much to say about this movie. It was as fast paced and exciting as the original. The only difference is that the thrill and awe you had when you saw the first one is gone, but you still get lost in the movie and forget that it's all animated. If it's possible, the movements and scenery are even better than before. While the human characters still have a little while to go before they look correct, they're getting close. The musical scene with the very sad and touching Sarah McLauchlin song had some incredible images of trees that looked exactly like the real thing. The story was a little more out there than the first one, as this time the toys had to leave the house and venture into the neighborhood to save their friend. But it was still very funny. As in most animated films, the movie moved along at a very fast pace. Something was always going on which is something that doesn't normally happen in live-action films.There was also the added treat of seeing Pixar's first animated short, Luxo about two lamps that explained why Pixar has a lamp in their logo. It was cool seeing how the company got started by making an inanimate object become human and then seeing how far they've come with Toy Story 2. So overall, this movie has everything the first one did and some more. It's very exciting and entertaining and good for the whole family. Definitely worth seeing again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy,"Each nursery is her child's personal world. The world, at first glance, is wrong and illogical, but one has only to look at it through the eyes of a child, and it becomes holistic, interesting and unique. This is a world in which every toy acquires an individuality and personality, whether it's a simple pair of binoculars on legs, a dinosaur or a dog whose body is a spring. There are relationships and events in this world. Basically, most fantasies simply consist of villains, heroes and their intermediaries - victims of the event. But the most amazing thing is that the memory of one game is transferred to another. And all relationships, too. Every child always has their own pets - toys, which are given key roles in games. Toys that people travel with, going beyond the world. Toys that you least want to part with. They are a kind of idols of children...The ninety-fifth year was truly revolutionary. And this cartoon made a real breakthrough in the field of computer anima.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Toys with character, and so much more...","I am a huge fan of the first Toy Story, I thought that movie was just brilliant, although there was something lacking, I don't know what that was, but there was something not quite complete about it. That's where the next installment comes in.This next Story is mostly about Woody. When Andy's mother decides to get rid of Woody because his arm is ""broken"", he is picked up by a toy collector who recognizes him as a collector's item from way back. Woody is ""kidnapped"" by the collector and the rest of the toys decide to undertake an expedition to rescue him. Fairly straightforward up until now.But that's where the movie starts to pick up the pace and with rollercoaster speed the story unfolds and with it the characters blossom. It felt like watching The Empire Strikes Back all over again after having loved Star Wars so much. The characters all seems to become these living figures with problems and worries. Woody has to come to terms with his past, Buzz has to battle himself and find out that there are loads and loads more like him, Mr. Potato Head is married now, Rex has his quest with the Buzz Lightyear video game (""My claws are too short!!!"") etc etc. Even the aliens are coming to reprise their role. Too much to tell here.But the most wonderful thing in part two are the additions. Woody's forgotten rooting-tooting wild west gang is hilarious. Jessie, in particular, is fantastic. With the voice of Joan Cusack as her backbone she becomes the one to make Woody realize that without him the gang is doomed to spent another lifetime ""in storage"". Her song, written by Randy Newman and sung by Sarah McLaughlin, about her former owner losing interest in her was heart-breaking. Woody's horse is the new comic-relief, and plays this part to excellence. Stinky Pete (with the voice of Kelsey ""Frasier"" Grammer) is wonderful in his own devious kind of way. Another ""addition"" to the story is Zurg, already glimpsed in the original movie in text, now he becomes ""flesh and blood"" and has a terrible secret to reveal to one of the other Buzzes. Wayne Knight (Newman from Seinfeld) gives just the right frantic toy-collector nerdy feel to Al, owner of the toyshop and abductor of Woody to complete his collection of Woody's gang to sell them to someone in Japan. All in all a lot of new wonderful characters that you can feast your eyes on.The worst thing that happened to me while watching this movie was that the performances were so convincing, by the gang in particular, that I started to feel guilty about myself having toys (Star Wars) still inside the packaging. A horrible feeling crept over me, and I almost wanted to go home and rip open all the packaging and set the toys free from storage. I managed to restrain myself just in time not to ruin my valuable collection (horrible me).I absolutely love and adore this movie, I want everybody who has a shred of human decency and love in their body to go out and rent this gem (although it is mandatory that you watch the first to set up the characters). A must see for everybody.10/10PS. Please stay for the credits, these are hilarious.

The Only Good Movie From Pixar.,"Out of all the movies made by Disney and Pixar, ""Toy Story 2"" is the best. In fact, this makes the first part long-forgotten!

"""Toy Story 2"" - A Captivating Sequel Full of Adventure and Emotion","""Toy Story 2"" is an impressive sequel to the beloved animated film ""Toy Story,"" expanding the fascinating world of toys in a thrilling manner.

A Sequel That More Than Holds Its Own,"The follow-up to 1995's masterpiece, ""Toy Story 2"" manages to compliment the striking execution of the original while opening up the emotional depth the first film exhibited so successfully. The plot is cleaner than the original (Woody the Cowboy is kidnapped by a greedy toy store owner to complete a set being shipped to a Japanese museum for megabucks) but the conflicts that arise are more complex (Woody is torn between two loyalties: his friends at home and his reunited family; and the toys are made to realize their mortality as their owners grow up and discard them) and the satire more profound (collectibles as pure profit centers). The sublime voice cast of the first is reunited here (Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Wallace Shawn, Annie Potts, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Laurie Metcalf) but the addition of Wayne Knight, Kelsey Grammer and especially Joan Cusack (as Jessie, Woody's sidekick little sister) is equally as fantastic.

It was planed to be direct-to-video!,"Toy Story 2 is the sequel to the movie Toy Story of 1995 and when the movie was in the drawing broad it was planed to be a direct-to-video sequel for up to 1999 Discey had a habit to make such films and always lacked the magic of the original theatrical installment. The examples are too many to count, but just for the record some of them are The Return of Jafar, Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas, Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World and The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. All of them are either disappointed or down right a insult to the original, with the exception of Lion King 2, which although it isn't great ,its story and character are decent.But due to the popularity of the original and the quality of the story the Discey studio decided to give to the film a proper theatrical release. So in 1999 the film opened and immediately critics, audience and in general everyone loved it! Some of the critics even said that it out shined the original. Personally I disagree for the Toy Story trilogy is so well made that I see it as one animated film of four hours and forty minutes run time!Now the story follows Woody, Buzz and the the rest of the gang to their new adventures. During the film Woody is stolen by a collector who wants to sell him for profit and has it is know you mess with one, you mess with everyone and so the gang organize and send a rescue team with Buzz himself as the leader! I loved that Buzz when he saw his friend in trouble he didn't though twice to go and save him, this shows that after the events of the first Toy Story how close are these two, indeed one of the best bromance in cinema history! Also we learn about the history of Woody as a Toy and the depth of Woody and Buzz friendship, man a Cowboy and a Space Ranger as best friends, awesome.In the previous film the theme was identity and that you can determine it yourself. Here is how much important is to be part of a family, team and generally have a place to call home. And the trouble our rescuers face in order to save Woody really shines that importance and put Bernard and Miss Bianca to shame! We also meet new characters that are just as spirited and fun as the main cast with Jessie steal something more than the show, Buzz you know what I mean ;).To conclude, just watch it and if you have kids watch it with them, for this is one of the best family films of all time, and for those who have already watch ""I am your father"". Even then Star Wars was referenced in films!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A genuine treat that improves on the original and entertains all.,"What a load of fun. Toy Story 2 manages to be better than the original, which was already pretty darn good. The Pixar stuff is so captivating. But the technology is not what makes this movie work so well. The characters, dialogue and action operate on enough levels to keep adults and children entertained. When something slapstick is happening for the kids to enjoy, there's some obscure or deadpan piece of wit to lay on the adults. This layering goes on throughout. It might be wishful thinking, but if Babe deserved a Best Picture nomination a few years ago, Toy Story 2 should get at least the same consideration. It made no mistakes and offered generous helpings of tenderness, excitement and laughter. You can't ask for much more from a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Beautiful and fun but...,"I really liked Toy Story 2. It is very good, watching it is fun for all ages and it's in my opinion the most beautiful movie ever made by Disney. Everything is very colorful and the toys are so perfect that they look real (although the humans are still strange). And it's not interrupted in each 15 minutes for a nonsense musical play like almost all other Disney's movies do! And the references to Star Wars are hilarious. But even being almost perfect, I can't give TY 2 a 10. I said it was the most beautiful film but not the most touching. I watched the whole movie smiling, laughing sometimes and having fun but it's impossible to fell something, to fell sorry or cry because Woody will go to a Japanese Museum, or because Jessie is living in a dark box. They're toys! And worse, made by computers! It's very hard to enjoy the scenes that should be touching. No, you enjoy those scenes, like them, but not because you're sorry but because everything is majestic, every single detail is perfect. In fact, it's hard to LOVE them.Here, at IMDb you can see how people are exaggerating. TY2 is great but it's not the 16th best movie of all the times. Of course Toy Story's secret is that it was enjoyable for all ages and almost impossible to hate. Look at me, I really thing it doesn't deserve this but I'm giving it an 8 or 9 and, in fact, I'm helping this siyuation to continue.Well, it's not so hard to give it a 10 but when I look at my 10-movies I can't even compare them to Toy Story 2. TY will never be better or even similar to movies as Election, Go, Pleasantville, The Sixth Sense, Hilary and Jackie, Valmont, Deconstructing Harry, All about My Mother, Mallrats, Clerks, Shakespeare in Love, Cruel Intentions, Next Stop Wonderland.... God, look at Eyes Wide Shut: a great movie, 10/10 but as it's 'hate-able"", received a lot of 1s. And others amazing movies as Dogma are almost out of the Top 250 because of this ""exaggeration"".For non-USA viewers, I would recommend to see TY2 with captions not with ""voices from your country"". This way you'll enjoy a lot more as Disney spends a lot of money in voices, songs and sound effects what may not happen when it's being translated. And it's fun to see some famous voices as Tom Hanks' in Woody. So, enjoy TY2, love it but don't expect one of the best movies of the history.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pixar have an almost unique ability to appeal to everyone.For Pixar fans there were the usual in-jokes - anybody who owns the DVD version of 'a bugs life' will recognise the toy repairer as 'Geri' from 'Geri's Game' which won the Academy Award for best animated short in 1997. As an extra bonus, they also showed Pixar's first animated short 'Luxor Jr.' at the start of the film.Just brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Worthy Sequel to a Classic,"This was a movie that I originally saw in theaters. I don't think I've seen it since. My wife, Jaime, put this on since our daughter, Mackenzie, sat down and watched part of the first one. We thought that maybe we'd luck out with putting on the sequel. Plus, we're both big fans of the original. I wanted to see how this follow up worked after all these years.What we get here is building on the original. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) are now friends. Andy (voiced by John Morris) is going off to cowboy camp during the summer. He always takes Woody. There's an issue though, while playing his arm becomes nearly detached. They don't have time to fix him so he's left behind.Andy's mom (voiced by Laurie Metcalf) decides to have a yard sale. A broken penguin toy (voiced by Joe Ranft) is taken out to sell. Woody goes to save him and he's seen by Al McWhiggin (voiced by Wayne Knight). He runs a toy store and he knows the value of what he's found. Andy's mom refuses to sell it, but Al won't take no for an answer. He steals Woody.The reason is that Woody is from an old 1950s show. He was part of a run where there was a horse named Bullseye. He was friends with Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), who is a cowgirl, and a prospector named Stinky Pete (voiced Kelsey Grammer). They're excited that Woody is there, hoping they'll get sold to a Japanese museum. Woody needs to get back to Andy though.He is intrigued to learn about what he's from. Buzz and the gang also try to get him back home.Now what I'll say is that this held up for me. What I like is that there isn't a drop off. It feels like continuing with the story. It adds more heart to what was already there. Buzz and Woody are more similar than we realize, the former is just a new fad. Woody doesn't even realize that he's a toy based off a show that was popular back in the 1950s. I love the building on the mythology there.He also is faced with a tough choice. Jessie had a loving owner, but she grew up and passed her along. She hasn't found someone like that and she misses it. This made me tear up a bit, thinking of toys I had in the past. I loved this look.There's also this fan theory that I knew about before watching this. I believe it's true. The concept was that Woody belonged to Andy's father. Since he's no longer with them, this toy was given to Andy. She refused to sell it to Al, even saying that it is a family heirloom. This toy would also have been popular when she was growing up, along with the father. That adds even more heart to me.All that is left to say that this is once again well-made. It is fun to see the 'what-if' toys were alive when we aren't watching. That would explain why things aren't where we think they should be. This isn't the classic hand-drawn animation that I prefer, but it still looks great. The voice-acting is amazing across the board. Fits the characters so well. This had big shoes to fill, following up a classic like it did. I thought it was worthy by building on what made the original great. Highly recommend it.My Rating: 9.5 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Better than the original,"Like all the other commentators, I agree that this is better than the original. Moving, exciting, and thoroughly captivating. At one point, I looked at my watch and noticed we were an hour and a half into the film, and we still had two large problems to resolve (involving both Woody and Buzz). Amazingly, the plots were resolved without any ""hokey"" gimmicks.Everyone in my family (Me 35; Mom 34; Son 10; Son 7; Son 5; and Daughter 3) loved the movie and thought it was better than Toy Story.

"With all the charm, energy, and character investment of the first and more humor and complex plot, Toy Story 2 actually builds off the original successfully","I had heard that Toy Story 2 was the weakest of the series, so after being pleasantly surprised by the first, I was ready for a forgettable sequel. Instead, Toy Story 2 brought both more emotional stakes and humor throughout. The humor is the thing that really stood out (Hamm saying ""You heard of kung fu? Well get ready for pork chop!"" is absolutely hilarious), and was a mix of child and adult targets for the jokes that worked well. The end credits bloopers jokes, the adorable alien men, the Star Wars reference, and countless great lines all worked perfectly for me. In addition, the scene with Jessie's backstory was a heart wrenching adolescent development story that made us love Jessie in the span of a couple minutes. The plot twist with the prospector was a solid and legitimate one, and all the characters had their distinct personalities and humors as in the first. The ending had a bit more suspension of disbelief and wild turns of events (speaking of suspension of disbelief, it seems crazy how valuable Woody is - if he was such a big phenomenon, how are there not more of him available?), but it was still easy to not worry about it overmuch and get carried away wtih Buzz, Woody, and Jessie's energy. Far from a letdown, Toy Story 2 is very effective and funny and dare I say just slightly better than the first, even if the ending is just passable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Don't pass this up.....,"I have personally seen Toy Story 1 at least 20 times with my children and by watching part 2; I must admit they're both thumbs-up movies. I thought how anyone could make such movies so real until the 2nd one came along. The first Toy Story does not picture human beings very much but those characters like Woody, Buzz Light-year, Mr. Potato-Head, etc. are so true-to-life that you take them for real. Every movement they make mimics a real life. A salute to the cast, crew members, producers, and also Disney and Pixar for a job well done. The creative energy and technology that were put into these films remain impressive today, and the themes are timeless. One doesn't usually pin too much of 2nd's and 3rd's, especially when the first one is already so good. Toy Story 2 had proved me wrong. Now I think, if I see the 2nd, I wouldn't want to see so much of the first anymore. Toy Story 2's human characters are just so real and adorable. You must watch both, the first, then the second, in any case, to appreciate them both. It is not a continuing story line but you have to watch the first to know how they all came about. It's a wonderful movie which will touch the hearts of children and adults alike. Highly recommended again If you have kids you and must own this DVD collection. It's a movie they can be watch over and over, plus its part of history. The first Toy Story was the first 100% computer generated movie. That alone makes it worth while, but adds the fact that it is a great movie and you have a winner. Toy Story II is one of the exceptions when it comes to sequels. It is actually better than the original. I have put this movie on my list of ""All Time Favorites.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Toy Story 2 Puts the Fun Back Into Movies.,"I didn't see Toy Story 2 the day it came out, but every review and every person kept repeating the same thing over and over: ""Toy Story 2 is better than the original"".  I decided not to pay too much attention to the hype until I saw the movie myself and form my own opinion.Here it is: Toy Story 2 is better than the original.Don't get me wrong.  I thought the first movie was fantastic, but this movie was a blast to watch from the second it started to the end credits.  I laughed out loud at several points in the movie because of the in-jokes, fast one liners, visual gags and the not-too-subtle parodies of Star Wars, Jurassic Park and even the original Toy Story.  A lot of lines were reused from the first film, but the context of how they were used in these new situations were clever.  This is an intelligent movie and doesn't talk down to the viewer, regardless of age.  Did I mention the CG effects (the movie itself?) in this film were even more of a technical ""wow"" than the first movie?I liked the new characters, which fit in with the old favorites and the storyline without seeming like there were an overwhelming abundance of characters.  Each character made their own contribution to the plot, however minor, and the story never seemed to drag on for me.Overall, this was a fun movie to simply sit back and enjoy.  It's thoughtful, funny and yet another quality animated movie from 1999.  This year seems to be the one that the animation genre truly gets its due.  If a Part 3 is ever made, I hope Disney maintains the quality that the first two films of the series have set.Incidentally,  Jessie's song will probably make a lot of people feel really guilty for ever abandoning an old toy. It certainly pulls on the emotional heartstrings.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Funny, Witty, Warm and Fuzzy","The original Toy Story was a great film. This one is every bit (and every pixel) as good - if not even better, in some ways. I went with my wife and two boys (ages 9 and 7) and we ALL loved it. It's amazing that an animated film can pack in so much emotion. There were a few moments, between the laughs, that I even fought back on a tear. Great job, Pixar. Thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Fantastically funny. Best of 1999!,"Like most people, I liked this better than the first one.. probably because it was so different (similar to Babe and Babe 2: Pig in the city). What I found most humorous were the ""out takes"" at the end, especially the dialogue between Mr and Mrs Potato head. I'm still laughing about it!! I'd only seen ""A Bug's Life"" days before so I was still in a Pixar-world. Yes this is definitely one for all the family, and a movie I'm sure everyone will enjoy regardless of race, religion or culture. I (23) saw it with my boyfriend (also 23) and did not have any children with us. It is a 'happy' movie and will leave you laughing till your eyes water. It has ""Simpsons""-like gags and spoofs (I haven't even seen ""Star Wars"" but picked up that spoof at the end) but without the unnecessary sex, violence or offending issues that ""The Simpsons"" has. This is a must see, definitely the best of 1999! (I gave it 10/10).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar Does it Again,"What words could do justice to this INCREDIBLE movie? Pixar, which topped the excellent original ""Toy Story"" with last year's ""A Bug's Life"", has, in turn, topped THAT.

Beyond infinity!,"These days, every film Pixar makes is hailed as a masterpiece, based on the winning formula of sophisticated computer animation and lots of jokes that parents can get as well. But many of these films could have been made using conventional techniques, and although the jokes may be sly, the basic premise of the plot is frequently dull and familiar: heroic, cute outsider wins the day and gets the girl. In my books, more recent efforts fail to truly match the original 'Toy Story'. The uniqueness of 'Toy Story' is based on two things. Firstly, that the plot depends on switching between two levels of reality (the toys, who are the leading characters, lie passive as their owner plays with them but (just as we all liked to imagine they did) play among themselves when the children aren't around). Being able to assimilate this fantasy world within a real-looking environment is this central to the film. And secondly, mapped to an adult domain, the subject matter of 'Toy Story' is actually desperately bleak: what we have is an allegory for human obsolescence and death, and the delusional strategies we employ to hide from this unbearable truth. One feels for these toys, even though they win out in both of the two movies, because we know that in the end, there is only the promise of inevitable defeat.'Toy Story 2' isn't quite as fresh as the mould-breaking original, but the scriptwriters have done a good job of taking its ideas forward, adding new levels of self-awareness (and self-referencing) to the plot. The jokes are good, the morbid streak remains, the only down-side is that we now expect all our animations to look this good. Together with its predecessor, it probably represents the most subversive film Disney have ever made, and a movie even Uncle Scrooge will enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of those worthy sequels,This movie is better than its original. Obviously because it is higher rated and it made more money and in my opinion better story. It involved more of th characters other than focusing on the fued between Buzz and Woody. Im sure a third one will be on its way though i havent heard of any franchise being made.

In Toy Story 2, Woody must choose between staying in a museum forever, perfectly preserved as he is but never played with or to go back to his old life. It's a wonderful joyous message that says that toys are meant to be played with, life is meant to be lived. No one is meant to sit around and get stodgy and old in a museum.

The animaton is rich and filled with enough detail to make you aw.  The voice cast works well together and obviously know how to do a good movie.

I'm really starting to enjoy this,"After viewing the first one I must say I was not sure this film would be good, since I thought the original, Toy Story, was an average film. But I thought: Hey it is Disney, so how bad can it be?' And guess what I was right. This is a good movie and in my opinion a better one than the first, but after seeing this one I'm sure I'm going to watch the original again in the near future.What I really liked about this movie, was that it was not only pretty funny (especially Rex the dinosaur and Buzz Lightyear) but that there was plenty of action, excitement and last but not least a lot of emotion. It really showed us, especially young kids, how many of treat our toys. This movie is a good reason to hold on to all of your old stuff or give it away to other children and not just to throw it away, for it will be of great emotional value to you some day too. But this is not just a kids movie. Adults will enjoy this one too, because of some great jokes involving movies (the Star Wars stuff was really hilarious). Of course not everything was great. I especially liked Woody, Rex and Buzz, but there was also one irritating little character and that one was the Cowgirl Jessie, she was just too happy and that made her annoy me sometimes, but hey, characters are different and you need not like everybody and Jessie being irritating did not cause me not wanting Woody to help her so there is just one more thing for me to say: WELL DONE Disney, the Toy story keeps getting better and I'm already looking forward to Toy Story 3.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
They've done it again.,"Yesterday I attended an advanced screening for this film in London's West End; it was screened in a large theatre full of students, not kids, because the company running the preview were testing out the film on our age bracket particularly (ie people in their 20s). An recipe for disaster? A case of a theatre full of people watching the wrong film? The hell it was...Each and every person in the theatre loved it. Being a Brit who's lived abroad, I'm used to the idea of people cheering and clapping at the parts they particularly enjoy... but only in America. This film was enough to provoke such a response from even us non-emotive Brits however, and on a great many occasions. We laughed loud, broke into cheers regularly, and actually applauded at least five times. I was too busy enjoying the film to keep count.Why? Well, the humour in it is NOT exclusively aimed at for kids; that's not to say they won't find it funny, but I defy an parent to watch it without at some point saying 'my kid's not going to get that', or even, in the case of a couple of surprisingly risque gags, 'I HOPE my kid's not going to get that'...Also, it was basically an action film. After a comfortable few opening scenes which establish that all is well, it doesn't take long for things to go a bit awry, and then more so, and soon there are toys all over the city and the tension becomes genuine. The laughs keep on coming however, and there is (with the exception of a single concession to the notorious Disney Song) not a single unentertaining moment to be found.There's a different take on the Toy idea (what if you're outgrown?) and almost any possible inclusion you could wish for as far as references to the first film, or others, or scenarios that are dying to be explored (like a now wisened Buzz meeting another Buzz who still thinks he's a toy). And then there's all the new characters (the implied arrival of a Mrs Potato head at the end of the first movie is gloriously realised, for example) are as amusing as all the old favourites, who all enjoy large roles in the limelight.It's also comforting to see that they've kept to the overall look of the original. You can't help but think that they could draw people a lot more realistically if they wanted to, but they don't; because then it wouldn't feel like the same world. This is an excellent example of how Pixar treat their movies with a lot more importance than they attach to their (also spectacular) visuals.If you loved the first film, go and see this one. There is nothing they could have done that they have not, and nothing they shouldn't have done that they have. Once again Pixar have remembered the most important thing about filmmaking; all the computer visuals are very well and good, but if there's no substance to the movie you're wasting your time. This is clearly a movie that was sat down and thought about, and the results are breathtaking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The characters are great, Buzz Lightyear is as cool as you would expect out of an really cool actiontoy (I'm going to get one as soon as i get the chance to), another great character is the hysteric toy dinosaur that complains about that he can't play TV-games properly because his arms are so short! Simply said this is a great movie!!!!Tip. Look for the blooper shots in the credits, they're really funny!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Nowhere near as good as the first film, but still visually mesmerizing.","The original Toy Story (1995), established a new sub-genre with its computer animation done by the magicians at Pixar Studios. It is an amazing film. So, we definitely needed a sequel. The second film is nowhere near as good as the first one, but it is still a joy to watch. The animation is mesmerizing. We do have a cute story handed to us, but there were some bad spots that bothered me. It seemed our two main characters Woody (Hanks) and Buzz (Allen), spent too much time in the movie separated. I always felt that they worked best together.The film-makers took too many liberties referencing other movies, like seen in the Scary Movie series that they lost me, with that device, by the time we got to The Empire Strikes Back. And, I'm sorry, but even a movie like this needs to explain better how two toy dolls can drive a real car to the airport. The classic Randy Newman them song ""You Got a Friend in Me"" was done this time, quite well, by Robert Goulet.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Better Than The First One,"Toy Story 2 is way better than the first one. Even if I do have the first Toy Story on VHS, Toy Story 2 is funnier.

The New Buzz,"I used to love the follow-up 'Toy Story 2' more than its predecessor. After a good 3-D viewing in 2009, I flip-flopped them. Yes, I think #2 was awesome, near perfect, and just as much fun and inventive as the first one, but I think it was slightly off. Just barely. I think it's Cusack's 'Jessie' that I found almost unbearable to watch. Sure, I get her character and where it's coming from, but God, she was annoying and hard to get past. On the positive, she gave the only notable song, and a good one too, in the series so far: ""When She Loved Me"" by Sarah McLachlan. Other than that, they certainly up'd the ante for the technology (even with only a few years in between), the action/adventure, comedy but all the while kept the great ""family/friends"" feel and morals. To switch things up, Woody now has been ""toy-napped"" and it's up to Buzz and peers (still great, never missing a beat from what made them all masterful in #1) to rescue him. I loved the additions to the ""story"" such as the Barbie's, Knight's Chicken/thief, the new Buzz (love the explanation given to what stores did wrong the previous Christmas) and Buzz's nemesis. This was a fun movie to start with and as it progressed, it got a lot better. A lot more fun, adventure, touching and inventive. Rarely will a sequel live up to its original, and 'Toy Story 2' is one of the best ever. It's very apparent that the crew, directors, cast, animators all had enormous fun putting this out, adding all of their own little homages (also seen in #1.)

A Sequel that works? Yes!,"I expected TS2 to be more of the same --- holiday fare aimed at pushing sales of fast food and Disney merchandise, but not much of a movie (that was my opinion of Toy Story). But this is a big surprise! Toy Story 2 is a sequel that actually improves on the original, extends the story and the characters, and -- if this is possible -- improves on the graphics. It's a huge help to have the original ""voices"" back. Of course, the merchandising hook is still there, which makes my grown-up cynicism treat the movie somewhat unfairly. But I enjoyed it more than the original. Time to add some Pixar stock to my portfolio!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I liked it...,"Toy Story 2 is and isn'tt like what the first one was (besides the terrific computer animation that makes the characters look 3-D like) which is good. Good because it gives the film-watching audience a new story to feed from the toy world. This time Woody isn't in the confrontation he was with Buzz Lightyear (favorites), but this time he has too choose between going old and his master Andy throwing him away, or living forever in a museum. Like other Pixar films, this isn't just a moral choice and lesson for kids, it's interesting for adults too (adults and kids alike will enjoy the puns with old toys, quotes and characters) because it is a decision that though is colored over, has a deep meaning in life.But, unfortunately bad because like most sequels, the first is in this case is better. It isn't by much, but mostly in the means of comedy (some of the humor in this film is just *too* silly, while the first maintained a better pace with its jokes and gags). Don't worry though, it isn't all bad, but I just feel some sequels aren't as livable to their precedors. Still, I found many of the new characters and the new story (not to mention the extraordinary animation) to be quite entertaining and I recommend this film to anybody.

A remarkable achievement for a sequel to a groundbreaking movie.,"For all the flack that sequels get, there are the occasional few that surpass the original. Whether it's flipping the script by making the first movie's villain the hero (as in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)) or merely having room to grow the characters past their introductory stories (like in Spider-Man 2 (2004)), a well-done sequel should advance the story of the franchise and not just repeating the success of the first film. Toy Story 2 (1999) is one of those rare movies that does an excellent job of advancing the groundwork laid in Toy Story (1995).Not only does Toy Story 2 now have its original semi-villain, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), as the hero saving Woody (Tom Hanks), but there's also room to explore what in means to be a toy in the context of collectors items instead of just as a child's plaything. Considering how revolutionary the original Toy Story was as the first completely computer-generated full-length movie, it still had a lot of visual rough edges that are hard to ignore by today's standards. This is where I think Toy Story 2 really shines: its visual polish makes everything a lot more believable.While there are definitely a lot of top-notch jokes and visual gags in this film, it's also worth noting the immensely emotional heart that it carries as well. Jessie (Joan Cusack) has an absolutely tear-jerking song that cuts to the core of the theme of the film: eventually, toys are forgotten by the children that once loved them. This would be the turning point for Pixar, which would then show how easily they could make emotionally gripping moments in films meant for families. Even though we could have gotten a straight-to-video cash grab for this movie, I'm glad that it stands as one of the best sequels ever created.A remarkable achievement for a sequel to a groundbreaking movie, I give Toy Story 2 5.0 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of the few times a sequel is better than the original.,"""Toy Story 2"" is better than the first by a long shot.

Pixar's first true masterpiece came in the form of this movie.,"Pixar Animation Studios has always made great films. But as far as these movies go, there have been five that were just superb and basically flawless. Toy Story 2 was one of them, and its predecessor was not.Now don't get me wrong, I love the first film just as much as the next guy, but I think its sequel was just a tad bit stronger. It didn't just re-hash Toy Story, it expanded upon the story that was already there in the first movie. It's even referenced a couple of times in this, which is something you don't see often in a lot of animated sequels. The characters are great, the story is great, the movie is just great. Toy Story 2 also holds a special place in my heart as the first movie I ever saw in a theater.Overall, I think Toy Story 2 is a brilliantly crafted animated classic, and anyone who dislikes this film - or any of the Toy Story movies, for that matter - wouldn't know quality film if it punched them in the face.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Perfect Studio Film!,"1999 was undoubtedly one of the greatest years for film since the 1970's. It was the year that brought us the darkly brilliant ""Being John Malkovich,"" the spellbinding film ""The Insider,"" and the richly beautiful ""Topsy Turvy"" (Please note I am excluding the instant classics ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" ""The End of the Affair,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Boys Don't Cry,"" ""The Straight Story,"" ""All About My Mother,"" ""The Cider House Rules,"" and ""American Beauty"" due to time constraints as I could write paragraphs on how much I adored each one of these films). Yet I make no apologies for saying that ""Toy Story 2"" deserves to sit with these amazing artistic achievments as one of the greatest films of the late 1990's. No, it does not offer any particular new insights into the human condition, or brim with originality. But what ""Toy Story 2"" is the perfect studio film. It is that perfect Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers dance that can be marvelled at time and time again, and coax tears out of the most cynical of souls. The film brilliantly interweaves a magnificent tapestry of comedy, fun, family entertainment, and pathos that is only rarely exhibited in today's cinema. As I watched the film in an audience full of laughing children I both found myself smiling so big that my face began to hurt, and gently crying.I loved this movie. It is great for both kids and parents alike.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great fun for fans of the first film.,"The makers of ""Toy Story"", which made history as the first family film entirely animated by computer, actually manage to outdo themselves here. This sequel packs a lot of energy and adventure, as well as some real poignancy, into its trim 93 minute run time. Better yet, it's quite interesting and thoughtful in the way it portrays the relationship of toys to their owners. Yes, all of us do grow up and, to an extent, outgrow our childhood playthings, but when we are young, our toys can mean a lot to us. And ""Toy Story 2"" memorably illustrates the idea that any toy has worth if it it utilized, and loved, by a child. It is ultimately this lack of self-worth that drives a certain character in their mission.Woody (Tom Hanks, in fine form) ventures outside to save a wheezy squeaky-toy penguin (Joe Ranft) from falling victim to a yard sale. Unfortunately, an unscrupulous, ambitious collector (Wayne Knight) sees Woody, recognizes him for his worth, and steals him. You see, once upon a time, the character was a TV phenomenon, spawning all sorts of merchandising. In the collectors' apartment, Woody meets the other characters from the show - Bullseye the horse, Stinky Pete the prospector (Kelsey Grammer), and ""yodelling cowgirl"" Jessie (Joan Cusack), who awaken him to his history. And Woody soon finds this enticing. Meanwhile, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and several of Woody's fellow toys embark on an often perilous mission to get Woody back.There's so much action in this that it could actually rival a typical live-action treatment of such material. Family members will enjoy the thrills - as well as the abundant sentiment, and the many genuinely funny moments. New characters such as Jessie and Bullseye are quite endearing, and some of the old favourites are as hysterical as ever. Wallace Shawn is particularly hysterical as toy dinosaur ""Rex"", and there's a brief gag referencing ""Jurassic Park"" that made this viewer laugh out loud. One could argue that it's all a little TOO much, with the screenwriters, directors, and company throwing one big roadblock after another into the path of our heroes.One clever touch is to revisit the idea of a toy that has no idea that they are, in fact, a toy, and takes themselves much too seriously. This happens when Buzz encounters another of his brand, and the other Buzz keeps making things difficult. Al the collector is just a perfect opportunist slime ball, and Buzz' nemesis Zurg is a hoot (there's an unexpected reference to a legendary moment in The Empire Strikes Back along the way).You sure can't argue with success: this formula of Pixars' has worked much more often than not.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Surpasses the original,"Some four years, I saw the original ""Toy Story"" and thought it was one of the best movies of 1995 with groundbreaking computer animation and a story that was just as entertaining to adult as it was to kids.  But last year, when Pixar's second film, ""A Bug's Life,"" was somewhat disappointing due to its pandering a bit too much to kids and word was out that the sequel to ""Toy Story"" would be a lowly direct-to-video release, I did not have much hope that this sequel would be any good - even when they announced that it would be released theatrically instead of direct-to-video.  But, boy, was this movie a surprise - it expands and deepens the original and seems even more clever than anything Pixar has created so far (which, given the high quality of their output, is saying a lot).  The fantastic computer animation, which almost makes the original look primitive in comparison, is really just more icing on the cake.  This film, like the original, is watchable again and again (and if you're under six, again and again and again every day).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Still the best CGI movie to date, not to mention one of the best cartoons of all time.","CGI movies are becoming more popular (I just saw Monsters Inc, and there were previews for 2 or 3 upcoming CGI films) and this year (2001)alone there have been 3 major CGI movies. But while everyone has fallen under the Shrek bug, I believe Toy Story 2 (which I saw for the first time after I saw Shrek) is still the best CGI film to date. While I did laugh at some of the barage of parodies in Shrek, and smiled a little even during the gross and even questionable scenes, Toy Story 2 is still leaps and bounds ahead in story, character development and just overall fun.I love Toy Story, don't get me wrong, you have to give credit to the first full length CGI movie, but with Toy Story it was ""Ok, let's make the first CGI film"" with Toy Story 2 it's ""Ok, let's make the greatest CGI film."" One thing that I think Pixar is the best at when it comes to CGI is character emotions. You can see any still from a Pixar film and know immediatly what that character is feeling. Even toys with limited movement, such the dinosaur Rex or Mr. Potato head, have so much personality. Heck, I know what the Etch-e-Sketch is thinking. When Jessie tells her story, it the most emotional scenes I've seen in any CGI movie.Toy Story 2 has it share of pop-culture references, most obvious is the paralellism between Woody's Round Up and the Howdy Doody Show, and the Star Wars spoof. But they blend into the story well. And some kids movies have a tendancy to have a gross factor to get laughs, but Toy Story 2 is funny without being gross.I like other CGI films like Shrek, Final Fantasy, Dinosaur, but what really makes this films is how much personality every character has. They're toys, and not even that, just animated toys, but you will be surprised how much to feel for them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A great one for all ages,"It was a great time with great laughs for everyone. The story carried well and, as most other reviewers have suggested, the animation is great. There is a scene where ""The Chicken Man"" is asleep where it almost looks like they got Dom DeLuise to lay there (they didn't). There is ample suspense (had my daughter quite worried for a while), but just plain fun too.My only complaint is that they went a bit over the top with some of the Star Wars and Space Balls references late in the picture (they were cute, but they didn't know when to quit). Other than that - great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Evolving its characters and themes,"Toy story 2 offers improvements in every film-making aspect of the previous film, as well as a new plot expanding and building upon the world. In short, it's an entertaining family film and a worthy follow-up.The animation is very well done, with different surfaces, textures, and reflections scattered throughout and making a more thoroughly detailed setting. The large amount of side characters from the first one get to do a lot more this time around, Buzz and Woody's roles are reversed and create a more interesting dynamic for one particular scene around the second act, and the new characters such as Jessie and Al are great. The voice cast are all hilarious and fun in their own rights, with personal stand-outs being Kelsey Grammer and John Ratzenberger. The overall theme of abandonment and the fear of it is another surprise to what Pixar is willing to explore, and is handled just as subtly and maturely as you'd want from a family film, until the 'When She Loved Me' sequence just gets you.As a side note, the Zurg and Second Buzz plot is very funny, but feels unnecessary and almost disconnected from the overarching plot to fill in the runtime and reach the 90 minute mark. But as aforementioned, it is very funny and just as entertaining as the rest of the movie.Overall, Toy Story 2 is a great sequel, surpassing the quality of the the first movie and matching it's predecessor in its innovative execution, with barely a bump in the road.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
WOW!,"Ok, ok. I know this is a cartoon and the target audience is mainly children but WOW! I can honestly say that this was one of the most entertaining movies I've seen all year. I was completely engaged from beginning to end and my mind never wandered once. And just in case you're wondering, when I went to see the evening showing of this movie, the audience was comprised completely of adults. There was not a single child in the theatre.For those of you who never saw the first movie (and I'm not ashamed to say that I say that one too), this movie brings back all the original characters and introduces some new ones. Walt Disney also did a very smart thing by bringing back all the original voices. In some of their other movie sequels (Pocahontas 2) they change the voices of the original characters which ended up taking away from the movie. The story line revolves around the rescue of Woody. By a strange sequence of events, Woody accidentally ends up in a garage sale and a slimy toy dealer steals him for a private collection that he tries to sell to a Japanese art dealer. Buzz and the rest of the gang witness this theft and organize a rescue mission that takes them from the safe confines of Andy's (the boy who owns all these toys) home to the big city. Along the way they meet some other interesting toys and encounter all kinds of unusual problems that they find some very creative solutions to. The ending is slightly predictable but in this case, who cares! It was a very fun movie to watch.The voice acting was absolutely excellent. All the actors were able to bring out the characters of each of the toys and create feeling and humor. And the humor!!! It was outrageously funny. The humor was obviously clean but I have never laughed so much. The computer graphics was excellent and they did somethings that made me wonder ""how did they do that?""Overall, there is not a single negative thing that I can say about this movie. It never slowed down nor were there any inconsistent plot flows or poor acting performances. Everything about it was entertaining from beginning to end. For those of you who are parents, you HAVE to take your kids to see this movie. For you adults, you HAVE to see this movie (guys, this is a great date movie). Am I making myself clear yet?

Toy story 2 Movie Review,This is by far the best sequel in Pixar or animated movies. It's so good. and I sometimes like it as much as the first toy story. It had the humour. It also has the emotional scenes like the emotional scene with Jessie. Another thing that's great is the new characters that they add in this movie. Jessie the cow girl is amazing she steals a lot of this film for me. Woodie and buzz have moments where they don't know if they will be the same. The conflicts are better than the last movie witch is really impressive there are really no flaws to this movie it's just not as good as the first. The main issue would be the movie have random moment s that could be a bit better. I still love this movie and the franchise and this movie is totally amazing and is a masterpiece in my opinion. This movie shows that you need to work together and use your head to break though. The main Villine of this film is better too in my opinion but still again not as good of a movie. The sequel is mind blowing when you think about it they needed to make a sequel that let up to the first and it delivers in a amazing way.

I am moved by the quality, the story and the extordinary detail that keeps you looking all that long!A 10 to which all others will compare!

A Perfect Sequel in Every Respect,"Toy Story is a tough act to follow. The first film is nearly perfect in every way imaginable. But Toy Story 2 not only meets the high standards set by it's predecessor, it comes close to surpassing them.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen return as Sheriff Woody and Buzz Lightyear respectively, and this time, Woody is stolen by a greedy toy collector. Woody and the gang discover that he is actually a rare toy based off of a classic 1950's TV show called ""Woody's Roundup."" He meets the rest of the toys from his roundup gang in the collector's apartment, including Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl, Bullseye the horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector. He soon discovers that him and his new friends are set to be sold to a museum in Japan. All the while, Buzz gathers up a group of toys to go rescue Woody from his captor and bring him home.All the original cast returns in this sequel, and some new cast members appear as well, including Joan Cusack as Jessie, Kelsey Grammar as the Prospector, and Wayne Knight as Al McWhiggin, the toy collector. All the new voice talents and characters support the old ones as well as help develop them further.This time around, the animation is much improved upon. The characters and environments look more realistic and detailed. Another aspect that is improved upon in this film is the comedy. While the first film is also absolutely riotously funny, the sequel ups the ante a bit, and the film is even funnier than the last one.Overall, Toy Story 2 is a magnificent picture. The writing is tight, witty, and clever throughout, the characters and story are moved forward in a positive direction, and it leaves you feeling good afterward. Another thing I failed to mention in my Toy Story 1 review is the musical score by Randy Newman. I'm personally not a fan of Newman, but his work on the Toy Story films is by far his best work. Toy Story 2 is one of my favorite animated films made, and while it doesn't quite pass up the first, it comes pretty darn close.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great,"Great. One of the best I've seen.... no, no, wait. Probably the best I've seen this year so far. Mind you, 'Man on the Moon', 'Bicentennial Man', 'Magnolia', 'Cradle Will Rock' and 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' are still on the way, but this movie was certainly worth my while.Thanks for your time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A very funny film.,"The amount of detail that Pixar studios puts into their films is really amazing. The reflections and the shadows on characters and surfaces alike is really cool. Toy Story 2 is just as good as the first Toy Story, in some ways even better. It seems the film is more comfortable with its characters and the humor doesn't seemed forced at all. I can't imagine a better film for small children to see and adults as well. I have alot of friends who won't watch animated films because they are made for children. I think that my ""grown-up"" friends should stop thinking these films are for children and start realizing how great animation can make you feel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"It was good, but I liked ""A Bug's Life"" better.","All I had heard about this movie was ""best of the year"" and ""better than the first"".  What everybody failed to mention was that while it was a slight improvement over the origional, it was not beter than the last Pixar Pic, ""A Bug's Life"".  I will be more anxious to see the sequel to that one.I guess that my only disapointment was that they did not show more collectable toys at the collectors apartment.  (You would think that since the guy owned a toy store and that Pixar used to be a ""Lucas"" company, that there would have been Star Wars action figure cameos.  But the only collectables you see are ""Woody's possie"")One of my favorite parts of the movie though, was the ""walk on"" done by ""Geri"", (the old man from the short which proceeded ""Bug's Life"".)Aside from minor disappointments, ""Toy Story 2"" is a solid movie, and about just as good as the first. (the story is almost as good, but the advanced graphics somewhat make up for it)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Worth seeing.,"There are several reasons why this film was better then the original.  It was funner because the toys went to more places besides Downstairs in Andy's house and to next door neighbors.  And the ending is very tense.  The original cast is back (including Tom Hanks, who I think is one of the GREATEST actors of his time)including some new toys.  Barbie?? When the old Toy Story came out I heard that Mattel wouldn't allow Barbie to be in the movie.  Hmmm....I wonder...  And there were some parts where I allmost burst a gut I was laughing so hard.  There's just something about ""angry eyes"" that is so darn hillarious.  And being a ""Star Wars"" fan you can bet laughed for five minutes straight after the little spoof.  So if you ever have time go and see this movie.  I guarentee it'll be worth your time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
THE BEST MOVIE I'VE SEEN THIS YEAR PERIOD,"Lets just say I can't wait to see it again. This is hands down the best work Disney has done since Aladdin.

The film is geniously animated and has a surprisingly well told story, yes, it is a good movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of the best Pixar sequels ever.,"Back in the golden age of Pixar when they were still new to making movies, they went ahead and did their first sequel (and only one for 11 years before more came out), they made Toy Story 2 and it's without a doubt one of their greatest.What I think what makes this movie one of Pixar's best is that they really concentrated on the movie, like the animation and the story. Along with the behind the scenes of this movie, I can't imagine how stressed they were with it by redoing the entire story in under nine months before the due date, making the animation better than the first movie, and almost losing the entire file and yet one computer saved everything. I mean, wow, that takes a lot of blood and sweat just to make this movie possible.The movie is better than the first one, it has more action, more characters to love, and they even made Jessie's backstory really emotional. There's one scene that still amazes me to this day and that's when Woody's eye gets clean, you can see the dust getting wiped out and all sparkly again, too this day I still have no idea how they made that happen and yet it was the late 1990s, that one of the moments that shows how great Pixar can really be.This is under my top 5 favorite Pixar films ever, and it shows why. Before they got out of hand with sequels, this one the only sequel they ever made and their animation kept getting better and better as time went by.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Excellent well put together movie for Adults as well as Kids,"Toy Story 2 is a fantastic movie that will make you laugh! It is a well balanced movie that will make you want to come back again and again! It is entertaining for kids as well as most adults! Excellent drawings, music and Voices also help to Keep you happy during the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The toys are back,"You know, it's exceedingly rare for any sequel to hold up to the original, even more so if said films are animated. But somehow, four years after Pixar changed cinema forever with Toy Story, the first 3D animated motion picture, they did just that with this exceptional followup. While there are a few nods and references to jokes and scenes from the first film, the story is far from a retread. Instead, it feels like a natural progression of what we saw in that film. Not only do we actually get to see some of the franchise Buzz is part of, including meeting Emperor Zurg, but we also get a look at Woody's past, one he doesn't even know about, complete with three great new characters that make up his old gang. There's more of an adventure aspect to the film; they're not stuck in one location the whole time, which was fine in the first film, but we needed something new. And the theme of the toys facing the prospect of Andy eventually growing up is the perfect followup to what we saw before, and would be explored more fully in the next one.The cast of characters is as great as they always have been. Woody and Buzz are two of my favorite characters ever who both get some fantastic character development in this one. Plus, bringing in a second Buzz who's as nuts as our Buzz was in the first one leads to some big laughs. The new characters are strong too. I'll admit, for the longest time, I didn't like Jessie. I found her voice annoying and her personality abrasive. However, in this most recent watch, I've discovered a whole new appreciation for her and what she brings to the table. She's still my least favorite, but I actually like her now. And the rest of the cast is great too. It really says a lot about the writers that they manage to fit so much for everyone to do in just 90 minutes without it feeling crowded.The animation in the first film may have been groundbreaking for the time, but some of it is a little dated. This film thankfully doesn't have that problem. The perfect examples of how great the animation is can be found in the aforementioned looks into Buzz and Woody's past. The epic opening sequence of Buzz infiltrating Zurg's fortress is perfectly offset by the later scenes showing the Roundup show merchandise, as well as an episode from the incredibly low budget show itself. We also get some fun action scenes, especially the climax, and some of the usual great camera angles presenting a toy's point of view. The songs are excellent too, including one of the all time big tearjerker numbers that still gets me every time.Overall, while the first Toy Story will always be my favorite, I can't deny that the second film is absolutely spectacular. It's peak Pixar, released at a time when they could do no wrong, and I love it. The third film's great too, while the fourth is decidedly not. But, that's a story for another time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good childrens movie,"I was watching this back to back with the original Toy Story and liked this. I thought that it's a very good children's movie.

A fabulous sequel,"It's not often that you can say that a sequel is of a higher standard than the first movie, but this is one of those occasions! Toy Story 2 has the same charm and magic as Toy Story, but this time you feel like you can relate to the characters more and the graphics are much better. It might have just been me, but I also felt like I emotionally connected with the characters and their circumstances better. I definitely recommend this film as something to watch as a family, because adults will enjoy it just as much as children!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
My All-Time Favourite Movie,"What is it about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's funny, sad, wonderful and all around brilliant. The film follows Woody (Tom Hanks) being stolen by a greedy toy collector (Wayne Knight). What Woody doesn't know is that he's a valuable collector toy and that he was part of an old 1950s TV show. The rest of the gang must rescue Woody, but Woody finds himself in a difficult position: go back to Andy, knowing he'll outgrow him, or stay with Jessie (Joan Cusack) and the Prospector (Kelsey Grammar) to be looked at for generations.This film includes in my opinion the best song ever written for film: When She Loved Me. A very sad and beautiful song that really gets to you. It's an ABSOLUTE CRIME that it didn't win the Oscar. Almost as bad as the Twilight Saga existing.Toy Story 2 is not only the best sequel ever made, it's also my all-time favourite movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"""The Toys Are Back!""","When Woody is stolen by a toy collector, Buzz and his friends vow to rescue him, but Woody finds the idea of immortality in a museum tempting.You can consider me a huge fan of the original Toy Story. Pixar made a home run with that film, bringing elements for both adults and children to enjoy. But 4 years later, Pixar comes back with a sequel, that will seriously convince you otherwise. Toy Story 2 is five-million times better than Toy Story, no exaggeration. And that is still calling the original an amazing film. This one combines action, adventure, and best of all: heart. Some of the scenes will form tears in your eyes. Woody's decision whether to stay or go. Jesse's flashback about being abandoned. Like another reviewer has stated, this is not just a kid's movie. It combines everything that'll satisfy everyone's needs of movie entertainment. Of course, there is still those mild childish moments. But keep in mind that Toy Story IS a children's film and not made just for adults. Aside, I can think of no other complaints of this film. Everything is just done perfectly! In fact, Toy Story 2 cannot be topped from Toy Story 3, but who knows? If you enjoyed Toy Story, you'll love the sequel. (Who knew sequels could be better than the original?) If you were not so sure of Toy Story, who knows, you might end up loving this one. With the original mostly taking place in Andy's house or Sid's, this one takes the adventure everywhere possible! A toy store, an apartment, an airport, and everything you can think of. The animation really has topped the predecessor, succeeding in anyway possible! Now you can just maybe read the character's lips, foreshadowing future animation. The voice acting (yes, again defeating the original) is more styled and fun. The plot, yes, is bigger and badder and faces all sorts of problems. In fact, this film is a childhood dream; almost perfect. The film touches anything you can think of and even including fun! I enjoyed this one far better than the first, but we'll see what the third has in store. Toy Story 2 will always be a memory for me nevertheless. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Excellent movie alone or as a sequel to the original-- A rare thing!,"This rare sequel is a great movie unto itself. That is so uncommon with sequels, it should get an Oscar in a new, special category-- just for being as good as the original. Moreover, it intelligently portrayed the characters and the movie's ""world"" in a truly sequence fashion. That is, in a plausible universe where situations develop and grow, ""Toy Story 2"" actually shows what one might expect a few months later (from the supposed time of of events in ""Toy Story,"" the first movie).So often sequels smell like desperate movie business deals-- adding in ridiculous and artificial complications and dangers, and emphasizing ""shtick"" that the producers think the audience loved about the original. This shtick-- tag lines and quirky mannerisms-- then become fodder for billions of fast-food drink cups, and endless TV commercials that grind every last bit of potential pleasure that might have been gleaned from the movie into the dirt and dust. So often, a sequel only manages to undo the pedigree of the original.Not so here--  ""Toy Story 2"" is a great movie, with or without the first; yet it also adds value and enjoyment to the first film. In the future (a ""Toy Story 3""?), the two flicks will definitely become a treasured boxed set of DVD's, to be seen and enjoyed together. I gave this a ""10.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A welcome surprise: No letdown!,"Maltin's assessment hits the target exactly: if anything, this tops the entertaining first outing of Buzz and Woody. The first had as its focus a rather contrived rivalry and reconciliation between the two, which seldom made one forget these were only inanimate toys; this one somehow makes one almost suspend  disbelief in the stronger characterizations of the two ""leads"" and the supporting cast; and in the development of the symbiotic relationship between toys and their owners, much like that of pets and owners. The rapid alternation of the toys between movement/speech and stasis whenever a human looks their way was very impressive. The garage sale signs and the box dumped behind the Goodwill type truck I found very touching. A particular ""kick"" for me was ""Guide Barbie"" in the toy store and the chorus line of Barbies behind the penguin in the last number. Perhaps it's my male bias, but I found it rewarding to note the Barbie shallowness as compared with the lifelike personalities of the other toys.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Fun for kids and adults,"OK, it's not up to the original, but it comes REAL close.  My only complaint is that the original was funnier--this one had it's share of dead spots.

Contrary to a previous comment, the final scene is with Wheezy perfect! Without giving anything away, I'll say that the voice is instantly recognizable (though it's buried in the credits).

The characters I liked in Toy Story are back, and this chance to know them better is delightful. There are also some great additions that I also enjoyed. This is a movie made by professionals, who care about the very last tiny detail. For example, the realism of the toys' movements is amazing, and they know exactly how to use this to make you smile.

Toy Story 2 (1999) - The Toys are Back with New Members!,"Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, and the gang's all here for another round-up, and this time, they brought new visitors. While Woody gets captured by a toy salesman, he realizes he's the star of his own TV show, and meets his fellow members of the Woody's Round-Up series, which includes Jessie, Bullseye, and Stinky Pete the Prospector. Although I really enjoyed watching the true heart of these movies, and seeing the return of our friends, learning a new secret to the Woody character, and even enjoying the new characters, I felt that this type of Toy Story movie kind of separated the true meaning of the series, and it kind of felt like something was missing from this Toy Story sequel. I felt that there was a strong heart to this movie about letting go when getting older. But I don't really think they used that much of that particular message to make the movie more heartwarming. I still enjoyed that mishap, though! The characters are still memorable, and they still know how to make us laughs. Even our new characters light up the screen, so it was really nice watching newer and brighter characters join the group.

Buzz Lightyear and the rest of the toys attempt to rescue, and Woody must choose to come back with them or join his roundup gang again. The film is clever and full of references to many, many popular films.

I think the ultimate goal of computer generated films is to re-create reality, and Toy Story 2 is one big step closer.There was plenty of humor too.  Except for a the Barbie parts (which I don't think Mattel would like), the movie feature the light-hearted jokes and gags which only a Disney animated film can give you, and the timing was perfect. You don't feel neither overwhelmed because there was too many gags in too little time, nor bored because the jokes were far between.  Just the right amount of humor make this film enjoyable.The best thing however was that the movie was more than just eye-candy.

All over again!,"Having this fast-paced storyline, John Lasseter & Co. exploited it to a maximum.

The music is moody and Randy Newman is at his best with the really non-disturbing, appropriate song about Jessie, which is definitely the message of this film.O.K., I know I'm raving, but I really meant it when I chose the ten and clicked the ""Vote"" button. This film is great and I recommend it to every film-lover.A few downsides (this hardly affects the overall film) are I think, first of all the lack of originality, which is excusable and acceptable for a sequel.

"best animated film ever, period.","wow! This movie absolutely dazzled me with fantastic animation, a great story with some great gags, and new, imaginative characters. I also enjoyed the numerous references to other films. TS2 was much better than the original TS. The humor was funnier, and the action and gags just never let up! The original did have some flat spots, but this flick was just super. From the opening scene with Buzz Lightyear in space to the climactic scene on the airport, this is a great treat, a movie that adults might enjoy even more than kids.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
just as good as the first,"After the success of their first movie together, Disney/Pixar went ahead to make many more movies together, but soon they returned to the movie that started it all, Toy Story, but Disney's initial plan was for Toy Story 2 to be a home video, but upon reading the script and seeing the reels they noticed the possibilities of another blockbuster lurks, so Disney pumped money into it, recalled the voice cast and Toy Story 2 was made, a wonderful additional to its 1995 original.Toy Story 2, picks up from where the last one stopped, and it didn't neglect to let us know that Andy himself is getting older; the puppy and the Mrs Potatoe Head toy mentioned at the end of the first film are also featured in this movie, their addition to the clan, was so well done that you will not feel like they were crowding. Then the adventure in this movie is not a Woody trying to clear himself, it is a save woody adventure. The movie's directing is just as good as the first, the score not so great but it is negligible and the CGI is upgraded.The movie plot sees Woody (Tom Hanks) get stolen by a collector, the other toys noticed this theft and with Buzz (Tim Allen) hell bend to save Woody, recruited some other toys: Rex, Mr Potatoe Head, Slinky Dog and Hamm the piggy bank on a journey to go save Woody from his captor.The crew that went to save Woody made the movie for me; their addition took the scope away from what the first movie was all about, Woody and Buzz. This movie too is about Woody but now some other toys too are involved in this outside rescue.The idea for a sequel was being put together after the release of the first, but production faced a lot of hiccups on the way mostly due to Disney's set release date of the film costing Pixar to work at a fast pace to meet the set release date. The movie story had a lot of recycled ideas that were in the draft of the first film, which were discarded. This ideas included but not limited to, the obsessive toy collector, who here in this movie is the main antagonist (Sid Philips, Andy's former neighbor before they moved was the first movie's antagonist).Upon its release Toy Story 2 cost 90 million dollars to make and it recruited over 480 million from the box office making it a commercial success. The high approval rating of the film puts it in the league of movies (rare movies) whose sequels are regarded to be just as good as the original or even better.Toy Story 2 is a fun and great movie.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
What rhymes with plastic? Fantastic.,"I have just finished writing a review for 'Toy Story' and now I am reviewing the superior and fantastic sequel called 'Toy Story 2'.In this sequel, Woody gets captured by a man who clearly has an obsession with collectible items.It is now up to Buzz Lightyear and Woody's other friends to save him.Meanwhile, Woody meets 2 new toys.One is a cowgirl named Jessie and the other is a doll called Stinky Pete, who lives in a box.Woody tells them that he needs to go home to his owner Andy, but the others claim that if Woody leaves Jessie and Pete, they will be put away to never be loved by anyone.Things get even more complicated.If Woody stays, he must travel with the duo to Tokyo.Will Woody go home or will he go to Japan with his new comrades? 'Toy Story 2' not only captures the originality of the first movie, it also combines it with plenty of adventure and splendid animation that makes this sequel a real fun surprise.I mentioned in my review for the first 'Toy Story' that I managed to catch the 2 movies at once at the movie theater in 3-d.The effects may not have been great, but that doesn't mean that the movies weren't any good.This is a splendid movie that's not just a kids movie.It's a movie that everyone of every age should not miss.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Just too good!,"Sure it wasn't sophisticated humor but everything about the movie was too good.

As entertaining as before,"One of the greatest sequels around. 'Toy Story 2', whilst marginally inferior, still manages to create the same magic that the original has - which is mightily impressive.It, at least to me, has less humour but what it loses there it makes up for in the premise, which is arguably more interesting when compared to the 1995 film. I very much enjoy it, especially the location of the finale.Tom Hanks is again fabulous as Woody, while Tim Allen (Buzz) & Co. remain as entertaining as before. They also introduce some cool new characters, with the standout being Jessie who is voiced astutely by Joan Cusack; Jessie's backstory is so well done. Al (Wayne Knight) and Pete (Kelsey Grammer) are good additions, too.There are some tremendous scenes here, that one for Cusack's character and the conclusion are my favourites alongside the ultra satisfying restoration scene; the end credits are amusing, also. It's all fun.The other two sequels are brilliant, but this is the pick of the three. I'd highly recommend, evidently.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Childrens film for adults alike,"The greatness and superiority of Disney is very obvious when watching a movie which has as much class as Toy Story 2. Everyone has seen the first film and opinion was that it couldn't really be stretched and that what made it so good was the novelty. It was a good movie, but good because it surprised the audience with the technology. Things are different in No.2. John Lassetter has made a movie which can rank alongside any other great movie seen in the last 100 years. There is still the cleverness which can be expressed by saying 'this was done on computer' but ahead of all of that is a great childrens story with enough humour and class about it to impress adults as well. I will not discuss the premise as it is hardly Sherlock Holmes, but I will tell you assuredly that for 75% of this movie you will have a smile on your face and a laugh in your belly. They have definetely moved things along a little with the technology as well, so much so that human characters look real and halfway through the film you could swear that the toys are as well. The script is very clever and has similar brilliant one-liners as the first. this truly is the future. Actors who don't need 20 million a movie. Crew working for their art. And a movie which is out to, very simply, entertain. Toy Story 2 cannot be bettered as a movie, and though a better film will come along, this will always rank as a major point in the history of cinema, bigger than the first.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A very worthy follow up,"With the massive success of the first Toy Story, a sequel really had to deliver to not be forgotten and fortunately this was very much on par. I look at this movie as yet another brilliant part of a perfect trilogy in my eyes. In this installment, the gang are back and this time, Buzz will lead a rescue mission for Woody, who has been kidnapped by a man looking to get rich from Woody and his roundup collection. This film gets a little more visceral in some parts, as segments such as new toy Jessie's back story with a girl who ""abondened"" her and even Woody questioning his place with Andy after his arm is ripped. The fun, however, is still here and our favorite secondary characters are once again prone to give us the laughter we yearn from these movies. Toy Story 2 is yet another accomplished Pixar project and a great continuation of its most accomplished movie series. As far as I'm concerned, this movies are as awesome as movies can be.Rating: 8,5-9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 2 - Genuine Marvel,I went to see Toy Story 2 in a packed cinema filled with kids and adults. Even though I missed half the film due to kids screaming and parents chastising their children I still took enough away with me from this film to know that what I saw was a genuine marvel.The in-jokes and humour were just brilliant. After a while I forgot I was watching an animated piece of film and just delved into being gripped by the action. Even that soppy song in the middle about Cowgirl Jessie was strangely moving and this was one point when the whole cinema was silent.I will see Toy Story 2 again so that I can get all the bits I missed. Can't wait for the DVD so that I can see and hear it in all it's glory.Bravo Pixar & Disney. This is what cinema is all about.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
First Class All The Way,"Toy Story 2 is one of the best sequels out there and has took as a follow up to the first film to a whole new level. This is about Woody and what he's really about. He's the main character of a TV series and has to choose if he belongs with Andy or in a toy museum. That makes the story very engaging. The humor also gave a ton of laughs. The characters are all likable old and new. And the animation really holds up to this day. This is definitely a sequel you must check out if you're in the mood for either comedies or watch a Pixar film. This movie is not just one of the best sequels, but also one of the best animated sequels out there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A welcome followup that expands in all the best ways,"Hands down, the best entry in this series - and that's saying something because they're all high-quality. ""Toy Story 2"" hits all of the notes of a good sequel: broadened scope; growing character stable; deeper story; and it's just more *fun*. Buzz Lightyear's identity crisis is surpassed by Woody's fear of frailty (mortality in a movie about toys!) and the overriding importance of being there for Andy. It's a story told with heart, a heightened visual flair and an excellent script. And watching it this time around as an adult, the added humor was a real treat. The downside is that the Sarah McLachlan song is even more heart-rending today.Considering this was originally planned for the Disney direct-to-video grist mill of the Eisner '90s, *and* was nearly deleted before completion (seriously, that story is wild), PIXAR pulled off a minor miracle here. It's a movie that treats both its audience and its characters with respect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The best sequel ever made.,"My headline sum up the most admirable thing about Toy Story. Pixar had enough respect towards their 1995 mega hit to put effort into making a spectacular sequel.Woody is faced with hard choices here about himself being a collector's item and therefore immediately desired by the toy enthusiast Al who brings him to his own place with lots of merchandise. One of them is a TV-show with co-puppets a cowgirl named Jessie, a horse named Bull's Eye and a prospector named Stinky Pete.Jessie is a really well made character with an emotional back-story which always makes me cry a little. The song ""When She Loved Me"" is a perfect song illustrating her emotional scars. That song easily ranks among Randy Newman's best.Every conflict faced in this movie is perfect. When you find yourself torn between both choices, you know it is great. Woody wants to stay with his newly acquired fame and free his new friends from being left as an incomplete collection, but also to go back to Andy.There are also a lot of great laughs. Lots of jokes about other toys and the situations they find themselves in. I could go on for ever about how much I like Toy Story 2.Go see it if you haven't and do your kids a favor and show all Toy Story movies to them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Is There Such A Thing As A Perfect Film?,"After the first Toy Story film (released in 1995) wowed audiences, the public clamored (despite the Pixar policy of not making animated films into sequel franchises) for an encore. Thus, in 1999, Toy Story 2 was released and, remarkably, surpassed even the highest of expectations, besting the original (no small feat).For a basic plot summary, this film sees Sheriff Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) get ""kidnapped"" by a money-hungry toy collector, who needs the Woody doll to complete the now-infamous set from the classic ""Woody's Roundup"" TV show (the origins of the Woody doll). With Andy away at cowboy camp, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the rest of the toybox gang plot and execute a rescue mission. Little do they know, though, that Woody, upon meeting the rest of his gang-- Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammar), horse Bullseye, and Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack)--forms a bond that may lead him to spend the rest of his shelf-life inside a museum.What really makes this film work is that the writers/producers made the brilliant decision to include Woody's backstory into the movie, as it would have been very easy to focus (once again) on Buzz and have the cowboy play second-fiddle. Instead, the story actually hones in on Woody and the big decisions he must make. Of course, the entire film is also filled with hilarious sight gags, situations, and jokes that both children and adults will enjoy with equal enthusiasm. In terms of both humor and storytelling, this effort eclipses the original by quite a wide margin.Plus, the addition of the Bullseye and Jessie characters are welcome (and vital) new additions to the show, as their presence leads to some pretty tense emotional drama. In a music-video montage involving the girl Jessie doll, you may find yourself holding back (or letting go) tears. The best part of it is, you won't even feel as if you are watching nothing but a bunch of carefully constructed pixels...you will come to view them as characters as real as you or I.Thus, in a remarkable feat, Pixar was able to improve on the ground-breaking original Toy Story and take things up even another notch. As Toy Story 3 currently begins playing in theatres across the country, it will be interesting to see if the ante will be upped once again. As usual, it will be a difficult task.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great movie can't wait to see it again on DVD.,"Another great film from Pixar, Inc.  The most important part of a movie, in my opinion, is the story.

Now if they could only lose the Disney name. My favorite part was the airplane rescue, hanging from the front landing gear, almost forgot it was a cartoon.

Much better story and animation than the first,"I watched the original Toy Story movie when it came out, and I probably watched the second one when it came out as well. Recently I watched both back to back in the same day, and I have to say, while the first installment of the franchise is a monumental piece of filmmaking because it ushered in a new era of animation-parts of it don't really hold up. I mean that a lot of the animation of the human characters is horrifying, it looks really, really creepy. The second movie, even though it came out a few years later, the animation looks much better, although it's not totally perfect. The animation at this point was not at a stage where things are not creepy. For example, there is a dog character in the film that is animated more like the idea of a dog than an actual dog. They were still having troubles animating real creatures. The toys look really awesome in this and I have to say even though the story of the sequel is a lot more complicated than the original I actually prefer this one. The whole franchise has this idea of growing up and what you lose when you grow up, and the toys are kind of there as a sort of mirror that children can look at. They know it's about the toys being sad that Andy's growing up, but kids can also realize oh yeah I'm going to grow up someday, and I'm not going to be playing with these toys any more, and you know things are going to change for me and I think that metaphor is at the heart of the franchise. It's in this part of the story as well, but there's also this idea of collecting toys and preserving the history of childhood. I think it says something also about how adults view childhood and how children view childhood. Adults want to make childhood this kind of picture that they sometimes remember, and they want things to be like, oh you know, I watched this movie when I was young, and I'm going to show you this movie, and we went here when we were young, and I'm going to take you here. We kind of want our children to have the same experiences that we had when we were young, and it's kind of an artificial exercise. That's why the movie works so well because it's all about that conflict of this artificiality of preserving the past and recreating the past and on the other hand being open to what actually happens in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Better than the first one,"This sequel really surprised me, even being as young as I was when it came out in theaters, at how fun, vibrant, and new it turned out to be. Not only is it as good as it's 1995 predecessor, it is far better in many aspects. For one thing, there is more development out of all the characters in Andy's room rather than just Woody and Buzz along with the addition of Jessie, bullseye, and Stinky Pete, Woody's Roundup gang who kept the comedy going the entire time. The animation is also far more realistic, notably in the airport and elevator scenes it looks like real life with no special glasses required. The message is more melancholy than the first, but just one you want to shake your head at and go ""True, true"" like the old Budweiser commercial. After Toy Story 3 came out, the ending to this one is a spine chiller, as it began an 11-year wait for the conclusion to these toys adventures with Andy that may not have wanted to be discovered by fans after the great time this movie provided. 10/10 Neck and neck with it's successor as the best in the series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Perhaps the best movie of 1999,"I know the Academy will not vote accordingly, but Toy Story 2 may very well be the best picture of 1999. Not only a great improvement visually and thematically over the 1995 classic original, this film is a fantastic demonstration of what makes going to the movies a worthwhile pastime. Not only immensely entertaining, witty and visually impressive, this film incorporates the timeless themes and virtues of individuality, accepting one's identity, bravery, love of family, sacrifice, imagination as well as coming to grips with one's own mortality. It is ironic that a film can be so profound and yet so entertaining. This is simply one of the purest entertainments ever made filled with film geek references, three dimensional characters and honest life affirmations. This must be seen on the big screen to be truly adored. My only complaint: where is Andy's dad, and are toys a legitimate substitute for a father?

One of my favorites of the year,"I was astonished at how good this was and how much I enjoyed it. Not only did I appreciate the characters of Woody and Buzz, but Jesse really got to me too. This movie has a huge amount of confidence; none of the spectacular animation effects were just to impress, yet they were just amazing. For example, the ""crossing-the-street"" scene where each time the ""traffic cones"" stop a bigger disaster happens had a rhythm and a momentum that made it impressive on its own merits, yet it wasn't just a gratuitous ""show-off"" sequence. And all the little things (seeing Rex in the rear-view mirror as a quote from Jurassic Park, the ""I _am_ your father"" sequence, the Barbies, the ""angry eyes"" - don't we all need a set of those?, etc.) kept my attention. Everything works. The movie turned me into a 10-year-old kid who lost all track of time watching it - and that's because the story and the writing are top-notch. I laughed, I cried.Just a couple more points It's interesting that two of my favorite films of the year were G-rated - this and ""The Straight Story"".

Not near as good as the first,"When this movie came out the hype generated a lot of positive feeling around this movie, which I think attributes to it generally being rated better than its predecessor. Even here on IMDb's top animation list, Toy Story 2 is far ahead of the first and it has no hopes of catching up.What killed this movie for me was the introduction of strange new characters. I never warmed up to Jessie and Bullseye, and I don't consider The Prospector a very worthy protagonist. The set of new characters don't further the greatness of the first Toy Story, and I felt I had nothing in common with them.I was enjoying Toy Story 2 only when the original crew was on screen, rather than Woody's new friends and enemies.The musical scene was probably the point I realized that Toy Story 2 was not going to live up to the first. Really, If you watch the first again, you'll realize that what the first film was centered around (Buzz and Woody's conflict), was so much more engaging and true then a bunch of psychopathic toys that have been locked up in a box for decades.I'm sure I'm not alone, and it's too late to switch the ratings between these two movies, but I feel they should be.

"Same formula,same results...which for this is good","In 1999,the PIXAR gang was rife with limited(but growing)success from 1995's Toy Story and 1998's A Bug's Life. Disney and much of the film world still seemed somewhat cautious(if not skeptical),and probably figured a four year wait on following up the to-date signature success entry was a safe number for a company that was far too comfortable with(and at the time,had not yet been shaken away from)traditional,hand-drawn animation. While the success of this entrant did not prove them wrong,it may've opened the door to much more of what we Se today in movies:mostly or completely computerized animation.The story of this Toy Story is pretty much an inverse to the first,only this time,instead of Buzz Lightyear being whisked away from the group somehow,it's Cowboy Woody's turn to somehow get swept away from the herd. When Woody(voice of Tom Hanks)rescues a forgotten toy penguin named Wheezy from being a cheap sale at the family garage sale,he is taken up,bought and locked away by an unscrupulous toy store magnet named Al(voice of Wayne Knight,which may've been the most inspired of this inspired vocal casting of this film). Without their traditional leader,the toys get behind Buzz(Tim Allen,just piling on to his ""Kid/Family friendly"" career in movies and t.v.) to try and rescue their friend,for which the journey is going to be a lot more perilous than the last time out.The whole gang is back for this one: Don Rickles as Mr.Potato Head,John Ratzenberger(A PIXAR favorite)as Hamm the Piggy bank,the late JIm VArney as Slinky Dogg,Annie Potts as Bo Peep,R.Lee Ermey as the Toy soldier leader,Wallace Shawn as T-Rex and Estelle Harris as Mrs.POtato Head. Added to the mix(and Not to the least importance)are Joan Cusack and Kelsey Grammar as Yodeling Cowboy Annie and Prospector Stinky Pete(respectively),two toys from the obsolete line of characters from which Woody was brought out of,both wanting to reunite with Woody permanently. Additional voice help is a myriad of talent,much of whom(such as the late JOe RAnft)are also PIXAR regulars,and add a lot of solid background to this effort.

"Wild, wacky, fun, thrill ride",Who says a sequel is never better than the original? The opening sequence in Toy Story 2 was exciting and imaginative. The jokes were plentiful and witty. There are original ideas here--not just a rehash of the first one. And the movie is full of substance for both kids and grownups. Even the movie-short that precedes the film was fanciful and wildly entertaining.,9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Outstanding!,"I was impressed with Toy Story 2.  The animation is smooth and the look of the film is amazing. What makes it even better is the wonderful story that we get to view. Continuing on with the basic premise that I believe,(toys coming to life when we're not looking) we get an even bigger adventure that goes beyond the next door neighbor's yard.  Woody gets kidnapped and it's up to Buzz, Slinky Dog, Rex, Mr. Potatohead, and Ham to get him back.   We also get a glimpse of what a toy must feel like when they're discarded and no longer played with. Sitting up on shelf for viewing only is a pretty lonely existence for a toy.   I can't say any more or that would spoil the fun of this great movie.  Grab the family and rush out to see this one.  A great adventure for all",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"for kids, or adults?","great animation? for sure. good story? well, it seems more directed at adults than kids, all the stuff about children outgrowing there toys?  this means more to grown ups than kids, who ARE in the middle of destroying there toys, cause that is what they're for.  and the only people that keep toys in boxes are collector types.  I saw it full of adults and kids.  the adults were wetting themselves laughing.  the kids were just sitting there,sure they were making noise, but it was no ""A Bugs Life"" reaction, which was huge.

best of the toy story films,"When toy story 1st came out it took the heart of everyone watching. Pixar then had to do the impossible and they did. Toy story 2 the best animation film their is, this film has the effect of the 1st one and much much more. Buzz and Woody the best friends the best characters share the adventure of the toys that come to life. With a stellar cast of voices including Tim Allen and Tom Hanks. The wild ride of toy story 2 which get you off your seat and excite all ages especially kids. Disney lighten the heart of all, if you grew up with out watching Disney you need a lesson in time. From Andy room to the toy shop to the airport toy story 2 takes you across the town with laughter that will make you cry of it.

I wish more sequels could be like Toy Story 2.,"Honestly, I didn't expect much from Toy Story 2 when it first came out. After all, Disney sequels up to that point weren't really high quality. However, Pixar was a different animal and managed to create a sequel that is almost as strong as the first movie and certainly better than many animated children's movies. The story builds on the original premise and expands it in a way that feels natural. It offers plenty of humor and some true, gut-punching emotion. Plus, the new characters fit right in to the existing group without making things feel crowded. I wish more sequels could be like Toy Story 2.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pure and absolute magic.,"One of the best films I've seen Disney do ever. I haven't enjoyed a Disney sequel this much since The RESCUERS Down Under. The characters are great and the voices are terrific. The setting is beautiful, and the camaraderie with the toys (and the filmmakers behind the scenes) make for a film which could only be described as pure and absolute magic. However, with the talented Jim Varney's tragic passing, I hope Pixar can still continue the Toy Story tales. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen among others do a great job. I...I have to go see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Pixar made it funnier, but not as magical, but I would still recommend it","""Toy Story 2"" is the sequel to the classic ""Toy Story."" This time around, Woody is kid-napped by a wicked Toy Salesmen, and his friends go out on a journey to rescue Woody at Al's Toy Barn. Meanwhile, in the shop, Woody meets Jesse, Bullseye the horse and Stinky Pete.""Toy Story"" is my favorite Pixar film, along with ""The Incredibles."" However, I don't think that this sequel lives up. Bias? I don't think so, and I sure hope not. My reason for this is because the film is so different. Let me explain.It seems to fall down a bit when Woody meets Jesse. I don't think Woody's history was necessary, and seems a bit weird. Woody's Round-Up gang seems to more closely resemble a group of stereotypes than real cowboys. Watching Jesse yell ""YEE-HAW!"" seems to resemble the ""Dukes of Hazzard"" movie than anything else and I don't think that ""Toy Story 2"" should be compared to that.What else seem to be a bit odd are the ""Star Wars"" parodies. Parodies are a funny addition to cinema, but it makes the film lack the heart-warming quality of the original. I simply don't think that parodies really work for these types of films.The third reason is the story. The ending takes darker twists and turns, but it still doesn't seem heart-warming. Who says ""Toy Story"" ever needed to be complex? Who needs a twist at the end? I enjoyed ""Toy Story 2.""It's a great family film, but I'm sorry to say it doesn't live up to the first one.7.5/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Excellent Job TS II,"Simply a WONDERFUL film!Everything was done right.  The story line, the plot, the chase, the adults laughing, the children in hysterics!  A perfect movie for any occasion. Whether it is to take a child to, or a date!  The movie left the viewer satisfied and already waiting for Toy Story 3!I would have to say my favorite part of the movie was when Chess Player from the preview to the movie ""Bugz Life"" came in and started fixing Woody.  The attention to detail that he payed to Woody was seen throughout the movie by the PIXAR studios!I am disappointed that they did not have any post credit interludes!  I waited for them up to the last second and my girlfriend laughed in my anticipation of them!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not as good as the first but still great!! Another Buzz Lightyear to the rescue,"The original Toy Story set a new level, one that you would struggle to beat. The sequel although not beating it does remain close to that mark and doesn't fail to impress. This one has moved forward in the sense of the animation, with the effects being even more impressive and although the story isn't quite as good it still manages to take us on an exhilarating journey.This sequel starts with all the toys playing happy families. They still get up to their usual tricks when Andy is out the room and still manage to replace themselves just as he comes in. Woody is anxious at the start, struggling to find his hat, the one missing piece of his outfit ready to accompany Andy to Cowboy Camp. They find the hat and Woody is relieved to be able to go but when Andy decides to have a five minute play before he heads off he accidentally rips Woody's arm meaning Woody will have to stay behind after all and up on the highest shelf ready for repair.Woody's second problem is when Andy's mother has a lawn sale in his absence and poor Wheezy (a squeaking penguin) is placed out in the yard. Woody being an all action hero uses the dog to transport him to the sale and save his friend, however a toy collector spots him and steals him, knowing it will complete his collection and earn him big money. It turns out Woody is part of a collection known as the Round-Up Gang. The collection have been locked away in storage for years waiting for Woody to be found and now he has they are all set to be jetted off to Japan and be looked at through a glass box for the rest of their lives. Woody, at first, is reluctant but upon getting to know Jessie the Cowgirl, Bullseye the horse and Stinky Pete the Prospector he falsely believes that he is more part of something here than at Andy's as Andy will eventually grow up. This scene is shown in a heart moving song from Jessie's point of view another great piece from Randy Newman although he doesn't perform.Buzz and the gang decide to rescue their faithful leader and head off into the wilderness, known as the real world, in search of him. Buzz, Slinky, Mr Potato Head, Hamm and Rex however all encounter their own problems, like meeting another Buzz in a toy shop who they mistake for their Buzz (he performs very much like when Buzz was introduced into the first film) a busy intersection crossing in which they must cross using traffic cones (a brilliant sequence) an aisle of Barbie dolls who each toy can't get enough of and Buzz's long lost enemy, Zurg. All obstacles on the quest to find Woody and to do all the things he has done for them in the first film.The film doesn't surpass the original but at times it definitely matches it. Some of the humour is top class, with the other Buzz providing a lot of laughs especially with our Buzz's reactions to him. It is like watching Buzz and Woody's initial meet in the first one. The chemistry between the other toys on their journey is also well written with each character being very three-dimensional.The same however can't be said for the Round-Up Gang where I found myself less interested in their story than I was with Buzz and the gang's journey. This is where the film lacks compared to the original as only half the story is engaging and we would rather see Buzz's problems than Woody's. The Round –Up Gang aren't as fun with Jessie becoming annoying and Stinky Pete having a sudden turn. Bullseye is also very 'Looney Tune' and although I didn't mind this others will. Unfortunately these are the few problems with the film which don't let it reach the heights of the original. Also the climax seemed to be over far too quickly and seemed far sillier than what it should have been. I understand that the whole concept is unbelievable but an unbelievable concept can be made real but when a stuffed horse is running at the same speed as a plane I was thinking this is getting a little bit too silly now. I can draw the line at five of them driving a car.Don't get me wrong the film is great and I found myself laughing at so many points, especially the Buzz vs. Buzz scenes, they are great. There are also references to the first film and to other films that you will find yourself enjoying pointing out. Despite my slight issues with the film it is still a worthy addition for Pixar and for the Toy Story franchise. It doesn't quite reach the heights of the original but let's be honest not many animated films ever will.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It was totally Fun and Cool,"The movie was totally fun and cool.When, Rex is playing a video game, that time Buzz Lightyear is so awesome.The last scene was totally thrilling.When, Buzz,Potato Head,Slinky,Hamm and Rex are crossing the road, that scene is totally thrilling.When, Woody wants to get the arm from Al, that time all the chips are fall down, that scene is also 's thrilling.When, duplicate Buzz, and the other toys are in the Al's bag, that time the original Buzz chases the bag, that time Buzz is very cool.When the toys are driving the Pizza Planet truck, that scene is totally awesome.I like Bullseye because he is very cute and he is very fast.When, Buzz is chasing Al's car, that scene is totally cool.The toys in Al's Toy Barn is very beautiful and cool.The belt worn by Buzz is very cool.Even, Zurg is totally awesome with his gun.The video game played by Rex is totally awesome.I should really appreciate the creators of ""Toy Story 2"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Very entertaining and funny!,"This movie is very special. I was amazed by the special effects and how real it all looked. What impressed me the most were definitely the emotions. It is incredible. These are "" toys"" ( I should basically call them characters) but they have feelings and the makers of this movies are able to show them easily. No matter if they are happy, sad, angry or whatever, their mimic shows their feelings perfectly. These animated toys do a better job than some actors. Have you noticed how Woody sometimes moves and has the mimic of Tom Hanks? It's incredible! They had Tom give Woody his voice and then they also made Woody move like Tom. And to anybody who has seen Tom in his movies it's an obvious similarity. The screenplay was very funny and I just love Mr. & Mrs. Potato Head ! I highly recommend and give this movie 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Toy Story 2 is nearly as consistently entertaining as it's predecessor,"Like the original Toy Story, I first saw the sequel when it originally came out and it happened to be a birthday wish I had to watch it. Not as consistently funny as the first but it was still very entertaining with basically Buzz and Woody changing roles and attitudes and new characters like Jessie, Bullseye, and Stinky Pete adding to the appealing characters lineup. Also, Randy Newman added some new songs like the wistfully sad one called ""When She Loved Me"" sung by Sarah McLachlan or the ""Woody's Roundup"" TV show theme performed by Riders in the Sky. The additional characters are voiced by such familiar talents like Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammar, and as Al of Al's Toy Barn, Wayne Knight. Like I said, it takes a while before the laughs came but when they did, they provided more fun entertainment for the recent 3-D double feature of this and the original Toy Story that I just rewatched with my movie theatre working friend. So on that note, rush to this and its predecessor as soon as you can! P.S. My friend that I just mentioned noticed a character mention our current hometown of Baton Rouge in the airport scene. R.I.P Jim Varney and Robert Goulet who warbled ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" at the end. And those ""bloopers"" during the end credits are still sooooo hilarious!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Review: An excellent, fun movie.  9/10","The first Toy Story was an excellent, groundbreaking movie.  Toy Story 2 surpasses its predecessor and joins that very select group of 'better sequels'.  As with the original, the plot is a typical chase-and-rescue affair.  However, the way that director and co-writer John Lasseter executes it is exceptional.Again, the unstoppable duo of Woody (Tom Hanks, just as well voiced as he acts) and Buzz (Tim Allen) are the stars.  The success of the first movie has helped to attract a constellation of Hollywood's vocal stars playing memorable characters such as Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberger), Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack) and the Prospector (Kelsey Grammer).The storyline this time around is basically a reversal of the original's - this time Buzz gets to save Woody, after a toy collector kidnaps him.  The main moral issue is that, after Woody finds out he is a valuable toy, whether he chooses to stay and be ""admired by children for generations"", or to go back to his beloved Andy.But the morality of this tale is not what should interest you.  Toy Story 2 is marvelously witty, with numerous injokes about Star Wars, computer games, and much more.  What makes this film so special though is the way it appeals to everyone of both genders and regardless of age.  The animation by Pixar is twice as stunning this time around, and the opening sequence is both funny and exciting.  And with the advent of Digital Light Projection, the characters will look even more stunningly lifelike.  There are even some hilarious 'out-takes' at the end, as with Pixar's other smash hit animation, A Bug's Life.Basically what I am saying is that everyone should go see this movie - I guarantee that you will have fun, unless you are genetically predisposed against enjoying yourself.  Toy Story 2 is a great piece of fun.  Roll on Toy Story 3.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story 2 has done what is either the best or worst thing a sequel can do...,"... Be better than it's predecessor.In the first 10 minutes, we see everything pixar (which is everything to make a perfect movie) It starts with something purposely cheesy and humorous (flying credits) spectacular animation (you can see that the entire movie) movie references, comedy, and in the next part of the movie, the brilliant heart filled moments.(side note: I am watching this movie as I write, and I noticed an A BUGS LIFE calendar in the back round, more tradition of Pixar) As the movie continues, we see humor for both kids and adults, we see some great animation that makes the first movie look terrible, and most importantly, Jesse's story. (told with the perfect music) if you look on youtube, most people who look at that video say they were twenty or thirty and began crying like children in that sequence.The Voices are amazing. Kelsey Grammar, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, John Ratzenberger, and everyone who's names elude me for the moment, did a fantastic job.The only flaw in the entire movie is the epilogue. It just seemed a little too(I know it makes I am defying the point of an epilogue by saying this) epilogish. It just seemed a little too must-be-rapped-up even to the point of unbelievable things on TV (even for TV)This movie is great, well animated, brilliantly written, and great use of music, sound combo, everything came together into a perfect fit of film making. Next to Ratatoullie, it is my favorite pixar film",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Improves on original,"I love the first film and it was very important to my childhood, but this was even bigger to me. Everything is done better. The jokes are even funnier, the drama is more dramatic, the animation is better, the voice actors do an even better job in this. Every last thing is improved. The world we see is larger than the one in the first movie therefor it has a more universal feel that there is more than just Andy's house. The fun I have with this film is beyond numbers.

Hmmmm.....,"What can I say about Toy Story 2?  It has a great story that both a child and an adult can tolerate, some great animation that surpasses what we saw in the first and a touching message that Disney brings to the platter so very well in every animated movie they bring to the silver screen.  Bottom line is this is just as good, if not better, than the the original.  The one aspect of the film that shines is the conveyed feeling of how a toy is not only ""a toy"" but an entity that has been given life by its owner.  How much you love a toy is how much it will live.  Great stuff here.  Of course, Tim Allen and Tom Hanks are great. I'll stop talking about it so you can just go see it.  You'll have a great time.

The Rare Sequel that's Just as Good as the Original!!!,"Toy Story 2 is a 1999 computer-animated film and sequel to the 1995 groundbreaking blockbuster hit ""Toy Story,"" released by Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios (now Disney/Pixar). This was Pixar's third full-length computer-animated film and after the successes of ""Toy Story"" and ""A Bugs Life,"" Toy Story 2 was expected to do the same. And it did, becoming the second highest-grossing film of '99 (behind the much anticipated ""Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"")!!! In this sequel, Woody (voice of Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen), Rex (voice of Wallace Shawn), Slinky (voiced by the late Jim Varney), and the rest of the gang are back!!! This time, our heroes face an even greater challenge!! When Andy (voice of John Morris) goes off to summer camp, Woody becomes the subject of interest for greedy toy collector Al (voice of Wayne Knight), owner of the local toy store. Once he sets his sights on Woody, he begins to think of a plan that will make him rich. After Woody is kidnapped, Buzz and the gang devise a daring plan to rescue him. When Woody arrives at Al's place, he meets some new toys including Jessie the Yodelin' Cowgirl (voice of Joan Cusack), Bullseye the Horse (voice of Frank Welker), and Stinky Pete the Old Prospector (voice of Kelsey Grammar), all of whom starred on an old show called ""Woody's Roundup"" with him back in the day. Can Buzz and the gang rescue Woody in time? Like I said in the title, this sequel is just as good as the original! It has great animation, great story, great new characters, and a memorable song (""When She Loved Me"" almost had me shed a tear when I first saw this).

How many sequels are THIS good?,"Not many.Good children's movies are hard to come by today, because some of Disney's summer movies the past couple years were....let me put it nicely....bad. But Toy Story 2 raises the stakes of these movies...not only intricate computer work, but a good plot.  Woody and Buzz are on a new adventure when a money-greedy toy collector finally completes his collection...let's say, illegally.  The detail in the movie was surprisingly realistic and mind-boggling.  Also, I enjoyed this movie much more than I expected to enjoy it, because it was not too childish, but not too complicated.  Any age could like this movie.  It's action-packed and contains the humor usually thrown in with animated Disney movies.One thing that's good about this movie is that it requires no knowledge of the first movie, but the creators assumed that you knew...so if you're a Gemini like my mom, and see Toy Story 2 first, see the first one to enjoy it more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The best sequel of all time,"If you discount ""Empire"" as part of a sequel, and unlike many of the people who address the board I always feel that the Godfather part II feels like a rehash of the first with the similar ending. The first ""Toy Story"" was a film that pushed the boundaries of what computer animation could do, but it feels like a tester, like the first. It doesn't go to places with the script and characters the way that this one does. There are moments in this film that move and pull on the heartstrings in the same way that the Disney master-classes of the past such as ""Snow White"" and ""Dumbo"", especially with such intricately marvellous moments such as the cleaning of Woody and Jessie's song that even now manages to wring a tear out of me.This movie starts where the last one left off with Buzz and Woody being the best of friends, however after an accident whilst being played with, Woody's arm is ripped and he is left on the shelf. After coming to terms with the fact that he may be binned Woody, through a natural series of events, discovers who he is and the fact that a child of Andy's age having a toy like Woody all becomes clear.The voice work of Hanks and Allen is as good as ever, but with Kelsey Grammar and a hyper Joan Cusack (YEEE-HAAA!) added the cast improves no end. The animation in this film has also improved, and even though it is not of the standard of Monsters Inc or the Incredibles, it's still very passable.This film feels like what I wanted out of Toy Story and didn't get. Buzz is more likable, Woody's fantastic and the message within the film of the true value of loyalty and friendship, with the sad part being that the price we pay for these things is eventually loss.If the first film was a test of what the animators could do, then this is a test of what the writers and directors can do with the new toy of computer animation.Results of the test...Straight A.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

a classic sequel,"in the history of sequels, most of them are not as good as expected. But this has an acception! It is in fact a lot better, in terms of animation, than the original. It is in fact all round better than the orignal. Apart from the songs, which fails to recieve the Best Song oscar, and are not as memorable as the first. But who cares, when you got a story line which is fun, adventurous and excitement, despite the reversal of Buzz saving Woody this time rather than vice versa. Randy Newman did not need to waste his lyrical magic in this rich plot. But he is good at it so it does not really matter. This reversal on the main plot did not work at all in Men in Black 2. Also, the toy restorer is none other than the old man from the Oscar-winning animated short film, Geri's Game! You do not get guest appearances rarely in animated films.

This Toy is still in the wrapper,"When Pixar brought the original Toy Story out in 1995, many people were stunned at the quality of the movie. This was no mere theatrical release. It looked like live action, but it was all done on a computer (or, more precisely, many computers). The toys looked staggeringly real. They looked not like cartoon characters but what you might find on the floor of a kid's unkempt room. And what's more, they had more life than most characters played by real-life actors.A standard axiom of animated feature films says that the greater the original, the lesser the sequel. The higher the roman or arabic numeral after the title, the worse the quality will be. There have been sequels to Snow White, The Jungle Book, Aladdin, The Lion King, and others that were measurably worse than the original films. It's a pattern as old as movies themselves, and of course it applies to live-action movies as well. In general - good original = bad sequel; great original = so-so sequel.And this is where Toy Story 2 breaks the rules. Ah, those folks at Pixar (and, of course, at Disney). While the original took place largely in Andy's room, the second film wanders out into the streets of the city - and even to a toy store! All of the gang is back from the first one, including the late Jim Varney as Slinky Dog. What's the plot? Woody (Tom Hanks) is swiped from Andy's front yard (he wasn't supposed to be sold, don't fret!) by a toy-store owner (Wayne Knight) looking to cash in on Woody's value as a collectible. Naturally, the other toys, led by Buzz Lightyear, launch a rescue mission. But does Woody want to be rescued? We're introduced to three new characters, the other dolls in a collectible set from a long-ago TV show. You know, kind of like Howdy Doody, only everyone was a marionette. With Woody completing the set, these toys are to be sold to a Japanese museum. Will Woody go with his new friends and live in a museum, or will he return with Buzz and company to stay with Andy?The movie introduces some wonderful, thought-provoking material. Kids will be entertained by the exploits of Woody and his friends, but they'll learn without knowing they're being taught, and that might be the most effective way for kids to learn lessons anyway. For example, Woody has a moral dilemma - go or stay - and while he resolves it diplomatically, he doesn't (or the screenwriters don't) take the easy way out. Also, our old pal Buzz seems to have matured since the last movie (!) and has his OWN dilemma to deal with. We see these toys' frailities, and it makes them so real to us. Kids see them and identify with the toys. We don't just have superheroes saving the day from evil. We have toys that might just as well be the children themselves, and you have to admire the verisimilitude of the script itself. It's a script that's racuously funny, with some references only the adults will get, and deliciously crisp - it's not a carbon-copy plot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
More from a Golden Age,"With top-notch work from Pixar, Disney, the Simpsons and South Park production teams, Mike Judge and others, the 1990s were the best decade for animation since the 1950s, and maybe the best ever.  And ""Toy Story 2"" continued that hot streak, with  outstanding technical work, a clever and thought-provoking story, and an Oscar-worthy score by Randy Newman.Technically, TS-2 aims higher than the original, and succeeds brilliantly. Yet I slightly prefer TS-1, because I favor the relatively simple charm of TS-1's plot to the more helter-skelter vibe I got from TS-2.  (Also, as a sequel it lacked the inspired originality of TS-1.)  That said, I did one part of TS-2's script that eclipsed TS-1's.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Disney sequel as good as the first... My God!,"Yes, you heard right. After the disappointments of the two Aladdin sequels and the Lion King sequel, Disney have teamed again with Pixar to create a Toy Story sequel... unlike the Aladdin and Lion King sequels, this sequel is good! In fact, it rocks! A good storyline teams up with various cameos from previous Pixar features (including the original Toy Story - e.g the way Buzz gazes up at the new utility-belted Buzz is reminiscent of the way Woody first saw Buzz in the original movie), and even a couple of ripoffs of other movies (Jurassic Park, Star Wars, et al). Great movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
