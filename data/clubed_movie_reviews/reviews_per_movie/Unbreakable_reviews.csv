Hugely underrated and misunderstood movie,"I love this film. I'm the only person I know who doesn't hate it, but I cannot fathom why it gets such a bad rap from everybody. It seems that Shyamalan's films have this a running theme - with the notable exception of the Sixth Sense, which pretty much everyone seems to get. He makes movies that are very subtle, and which seem to need you to focus on them just right to fully grasp what he was trying to do. I've enjoyed all his movies, but for me the alien part of Signs takes a lot away from what I believe to be the central storyline and as such the whole movie suffers a little. Yet I know other people who think Signs is his best, specifically because of the way the alien plot line accentuates the central one.Unbreakable is a beautifully simple film, but I think it has to hit you just right for you to completely get it. All the actors nail their parts, particularly Bruce Willis and his kid. Shyamalan takes an interesting (if slightly fringe) theory and puts it in a real world context, with a real family. Somehow he manages to never go overboard with it and - for me at least - it gripped me from the first moment to the last. Samuel L Jackson's character history is really nicely crafted in the middle of the other plot lines and you get genuinely involved in the people Shyamalan has created.Don't get caught up in all the talk of the twist ending. The ending is good, but if you spend the whole movie waiting for this tumultuous twist you'll inevitably be disappointed, and the movie stands alone without it.Don't go into this movie expecting another Sixth Sense or Signs. It's very very subtle and very understated. If you don't like slow movies, just don't watch this because it moves at a very sedate pace, but I personally think you'll be missing out. You'll likely either love it or you'll loathe it, but at least it will make an impression.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Rich yet subtle,"My kudos to M. Night Shyamalan for proving the consistency of his moviemaking abilities. ""Unbreakable"" is a movie that is rich in both technical brilliance as well as script quality.First, let me get my one objection for the movie off my chest. The ending could have been done better. The majority of the length of ""Unbreakable"" does an excellent job of building suspense, with the wonderfully muted, melancholy acting adding depth and tension to the plot. My problem is that it fails to live up to its own expectations; the ending does not consummate entirely what I expected it to. Somehow, in a movie that took painstaking details to illustrate every step and glance, concluding it in the manner that it did felt almost blasphemous. Maybe in a nameless action thriller it could be passed off as mere hackery. But here, it seems strangely out of place, kind of an enigma in itself...Now that the ugly part is over with, I feel almost obligated to sing the praises of ""Unbreakable"". Shyamalan's prowess with photographic techniques and processes shows through in this, with rich reds and blacks given to scenes of moist emotion and colder colors dedicated to the bleak, uncaring (uncared for?) world. One technique I particularly liked was the manipulation of photographic mediums, some parts using crisp 35mm films and others using angry, shuttered magnetic (or 16mm?) film. In the end, it all worked very well, because each technique seemed to integrate seamlessly with the plot and mood (notice the confusion and panic at the very end?) ""Traffic"" is a good example of processing overdose. ""Unbreakable"", on the other hand, hones it perfectly. The lushness of this movie comes in close second to the wonderful eye candy of ""American Beauty"". I could watch it again easily... with the sound turned off!On the more human side of the spectrum, the acting was wonderful. How nice it is to see Bruce Willis proving himself to be a true A-class actor! His unassuming and insecure behavior worked *perfectly* for this role. Samuel L. Jackson, like always, did a bang-up job with what the script gave him. Robin Wright and Spencer Clark's characters seemed a bit two dimensional, but they seemed to be minor roles compared to the prominence of Willis and Jackson's characters. A little character development would have been appreciated, but if the ending was a result of the time-constraint guillotine, then I would expect the developmental scenes to have gone too.The thing that people seem to complain most about this movie is the plot. I like the premise. A little fantasy in our movies isn't such a bad thing once in a while, is it?",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Thrilling and suspenseful film excellently played and compellingly directed by M. Night Shyamalan,"Interesting film and one of the greatest successes of the magnificent filmmaker Night Shyamalan . This intriguing picture with twist ending revolves around a security guard named David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who miraculously survives a catastrophic train crash outside Philadelphia . His marriage to Audrey (Robin Wright) is crumbling , and he's thinking of moving to New York . David learns something extraordinary about himself after a devastating accident . He formerly had a car accident that was a pivotal point in David and Audrey's relationship. He meets a strange man (Samuel L Jackson) with Osteogenesis Imperfecta , a real but rare disease . At the end takes place a confrontation against a violent delinquent , some camera shots show David in a hooded raincoat , which may be to imply that he's some sort of a caped crusader.A suspense thriller with supernatural overtone full of intrigue , emotion , surprise and plot twists . Shyamalan came up with the idea for the film while filming ¨The Sixth Sense¨ ; of all the films he's made , this is Shyamalan's personal favorite and of course is set in Philadelphia , like most of his films . He is an avid comic book fan, which was made apparent in this film . As in comic books, the main characters have their identified color schemes , David's is green and Elijah's is purple , they show up in their clothes, the wallpaper and bed sheets in their houses, Elijah's note to David, and various personal items, among others. Several camera angles were chosen to simulate the comic book device of a frame around each scene . Excellent performances from the two main characters , M. Night Shyamalan always had Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson in mind to play the roles of David Dunn and Elijah Price. Enjoyable support cast as Robin Wright , Spencer Clark , Eamonn Walker , Leslie Stefanson and Charlayne Woodard, who plays the mother to Samuel L. Jackson's character, is actually almost a full 5 years younger than her on screen son . And as usual director M. Night Shyamalan makes cameo appearances in his own movies, like Alfred Hitchcock, one of his favorite directors , this time as a Stadium drug dealer . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Eduardo Serra . Marvelous and thrilling musical score by James Newton Howard who always works with the director . Well produced and directed by Night Shyamalam , many of his films have car crashes playing pivotal roles and involve two ordinary individuals with extraordinary abilities or events happening to them , one of the people either has connections to a child or is a child, and the one connected to the child is always having marital difficulties . Night Shyalaman is an expert on fantastic films plenty of intelligence and thought-provoking issues as proved in ¨Sings¨, ¨The village¨ , ¨Lady in the water¨ , ¨¨The incident¨ with exception to flop titled ¨Airbender¨ . Rating : Better than average , worthwhile watching .",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"very well made, but curiously stupid","""Unbreakable"" is an extremely well-crafted film. The acting is mostly terrific, with Bruce Willis cementing his position as almost the only actor who can convincingly fill a certain kind of role: an unpretentious, quiet, blue-collar man, no intellectual but also no fool, well-meaning but no saint. As in ""The Sixth Sense"", he is on quiet, controlled form here, but in this film he's more regularly the centre of attention, and he's sufficiently magnetic to carry it off.  Samuel L. Jackson, the perfect Tarantino actor, also excels in a completely different, much more restrained aesthetic.The production is in many ways as good as the performances: measured, pretty dour and unvarnished. Within individual scenes the writing is usually fine, and some of the staging is memorably done - although the director's obsession with precise storyboarding does yield a certain inertia, making this largely a film of fluent compositions rather than dramatic scenes. The trouble is that all this sophisticated film-making can't disguise the fundamental lack of intelligence behind it. It's not that the plot is silly or the idea self-evidently implausible -- that is very rarely a problem so long as the film is made with conviction -- it's just that the idea isn't illuminating, it doesn't tell us much about anyone or anything. Its impression of seriousness is bogus.The family drama which occupies the foreground most of the time is in fact incredibly ordinary: if you imagine this story shorn of its fantastical elements, it would barely pass muster as a TV movie of the week; and (more damagingly) that family story is in no way enriched or even much affected by the journeys taken by Willis's and Jackson's characters. And I don't even think that this film tells us much about comic books or superhero origin stories -- certainly little that isn't squeezed into the opening couple of minutes of Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"" (itself no masterpiece). It's very strange to see so much professionalism and care in all departments lavished on such a thin, underwhelming, half-baked idea for a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Personal Significance,"It seems this movie has taken a bit of heat, known by many as Shyamalan's ""worst"" film. It is often written off as slow moving, and the twist at the end as unoriginal and boring. I've heard people say the acting and camera work was awkward and stale and that the casting was poor. Ironically enough, as more people begin to dislike this movie, the more I seem to fall in love with it. This film has a lot of personal bearing with me, both as a student of psychology and a lover of movies and just plain art. I feel like I've taken this film under my wing during its times of criticism, and now I'd like to try and show everyone what exactly I love about it so much.Shyamalan really showed a stroke of brilliance by getting Serra to be his cinematographer and to play around with the aestetics of the film. I don't know how or where Shyamalan is getting these guys for his movies, but I definitely love the style of each frame he shells out. Serra had been involved with predominately foreign films before Unbreakable. This was his first big American film, and I think you gotta give a little credit to Shyamalan for that. His unique and creative touch really added to the direction. In keeping with the ""comic book"" theme of the movie, you will notice that almost every shot is taken as if you are looking through or in between something. Like the squares of a comic strip. There is also a dark, slightly blue colored filter used throughout most of the film. This gives the movie a very bold, but eerie tone. Showing that the world can be a rough and scary place, but it can also be fought and overcome. It is evident that time and effort went into every shot. It may not slap many viewers in the face as brilliant, but it really strikes a chord with me.As for the score, I am more than willing to argue that this is, hands down, James Newton Howard's best score of his very successful career. It is compelling and booming. It's very powerful, but not over-the-top and excessive. For anyone with the soundtrack, check out 'The Orange Man' and 'Visions'. These are two of the most powerful pieces of any film score around. And I stress the word ""powerful"". Yeah, he's no Hermann or Morricone, but the emotional weight and emotive power of his chords and his overall composition are just downright chilling.The writing and the direction are just as captivating as the score. Almost every line of dialogue and every scene seems to be placed out on an island, alone so that everyone can stop and judge it. Some people might view this as cocky and/or boring direction, but I see it as daring and unique. Much of Shyamalan's writing is done that way. ('…I see dead people…' '...They call me Mr. Glass…' etc. etc.) Another aspect of the film that tickles my fancy is the underlying themes. I do believe, to a certain extent, that people do have somewhat supernatural powers at times. People have been known to make miracles and do unbelievable things. Maybe these things could be 'developed' in some way. These theories are, in a way, intertwined with some aspects of psychology, such as selective attention and self-actualization. If you care to discuss some of these ideas, let me know and I will relate them to the film through my eyes. In short, I do believe there is a superhero in everyone. It may not be through supernatural powers, but it may simply be through the act of reaching out to a person in need. Other themes of the movie, like how completely different people can always be connected in some way and how everyone has their vulnerabilities and weaknesses are intriguing, yet universal. From a psychological point of view, Shyamalan really gets inside the head of OI patients (osteogenesis imperfecta). He then brings this psyche to the next level with Jackson's character. Elijah, is very passionate but very tortured and evil. His interactions with Willis bring depth and focus to both the characters and the story. Certain scenes in the movie are really quite striking and powerful. The shots of Willis in his security poncho. The train station scene. Elijah's breathtaking fall on the stairs and many more speak so loudly to me and say so much in just a simple clip. For some reason this movie just speaks to me, like art. If anyone cares to discuss more about this film, that'd be cool. There is a lotta other cool stuff to talk about with this movie. Just thinking about it makes me want to watch it a few more times. It may not be the feel good film of the year, or the masterpiece that everyone was looking for, but it definitely sits well with me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Very Intriguing Film With Great Ending,"This is a much better film than I ever thought it would be, and intrigues me every time I watch it. Samuel L. Jackson's role is what mainly inspires me to watch this multiple times. His character is amazing and just leaves me shaking my head.This is a pretty low-key movie with the other star, Bruce Willis, playing an extremely subdued role for him, almost too subdued. There are times in here when you keep waiting for him to say something, and he says nothing. Half the time he's barely audible.But he and Jackson play off each other well, and this is very suspenseful film, even if a lot doesn't happen. To explain the story would almost ruin it, because it's preposterous. I'll just call an interesting fantasy-horror film with a little family story tied in with Willis' wife (Robin Wright) and young boy (Spencer Treat Clark).""Unbreakable"" is beautifully filmed, has very little profanity in it, and a strange, strange story with a great twist at the end....one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. This movie is done by the same man who did ""The Sixth Sense,"" M. Night Shyamalan, so if you enjoyed that you probably would like this, too.....although it's so different I wouldn't want to predict who would like this film and who wouldn't. If you're open to try something different, give it a look.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Unbreakable is one of the finest movies in years.,"I guess I can't be too surprised with all the negative responses that Unbreakable is getting.  These days, the masses don't appreciate a buildup of atmosphere, strong character interaction, and stories heavily centered on characters and their psychology.  Unbreakable has all of these traits, and proves to be a superior movie to the Sixth Sense in my opinion.  Too bad it's so underrated.I've seen this movie several times, and I have never even gotten tired of it.  It does deal with comic books, but approaches it with a level of sophistication and intellect never found before in comic book movies.  The movie walks a very fine line between reality and the comic-book world, at the same time walking a very fine line in terms of audience perception. Some chalk it up to be a silly comic-book movie, others a brilliant comic-book movie. And yet, there are still others that maintain Unbreakable's comic book theme does not exactly make it a comic-book movie. It's more of a drama, just like the Sixth Sense was more of a drama than a horror movie.  Both are excellent dramas, but Unbreakable was superior in every aspect.I especially admired the camera movement, and the framing of certain scenes to bring to life an actual comic-book.  I also admired how Unbreakable was very light on dialogue, making full use of subtle gestures, movements, and actions to represent the character's thoughts.  The character's environment plays a similar role and certain colors are often brought up to represent distinct emotions and thoughts the character has.In the end, there are a number of things in this movie that can cause people to quickly denounce the movie, but these are all dependent upon perspective, as there's nothing truly wrong with the movie.  In fact, if viewed objectively and with an open mind, the viewer might be much more apppreciative of Unbreakable.It's clear that many of the posters to this comments area were truly angered by the movie and did not think their thoughts through prior to writing their comments, which is a shame as Unbreakable truly deserves better.  If M. Night Shyamalan's next movie is at least half as good as Unbreakable, I'll definitely be in line to buy a ticket.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Mr. Glass, that's his name. That name again, is Mr. Glass","When I first watched ""Unbreakable"", upon its release in theaters in the year 2000, I thought it was a boring and overrated film. Now that I watched it again in 2020, I still think it is a boring and overrated film, but at least now I can easily bring myself to write a handful of positive comments about it as well. Quite a lot of things can change in 20 years' time, that's certain. For starters, M. Night Shyamalan hasn't made anything but rubbish after ""Unbreakable"", and continued to do so until the fairly successful ""Split"" in 2016, so it's a lot easier to label this one as of his finest accomplishments. More importantly, over the course of two decades, the film grew out to become somewhat of a unique trendsetter and simultaneously a type of underdog in its own sub-genre. Whether or not he intended for it to be one, ""Unbreakable"" sort of is a superhero movie. There have been dozens (far too many, in fact) superhero movies in the past twenty years, but in 2000 the concept was still fairly unique, especially considering the protagonist in ""Unbreakable"" - David Dunn - is a reluctant and highly atypical kind of superhero.Yours truly keeps on nagging that M. Night Shyamalan stole the basic concept for this film from the relatively obscure horror gems ""The Survivor"" and ""Sole Survivor"". True, both films came first with the idea of one single person walking away unharmed from a major disaster that killed hundreds of people, but ""Unbreakable"" admittedly is quite original in terms of linking it to superhero powers. After he miraculous survived a train accident that killed all other 300 passengers, Philadelphia security agent David Dunn is stalked and harassed by gallery owner and comic book fanatic Elijah Price. For you see, ever since birth, Price suffers from a physical condition that makes his bones extremely breakable, and he developed a theory that David Dunn must be his counterpart at the other side of the spectrum; - namely someone unbreakable. Why is this interesting? To be entirely honest, I still don't know, and this immediately leads us to what is still the bottom line: ""Unbreakable"" is a mainly boring and uninvolving film. The ideas are good and the integer performances (notably from Willis and Wright-Penn) are solid, but the slow pacing is intolerable and the ""big revelation"" at the end is quite ""meh"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"a consummate clinic in directing,etc.","M. Night Shyamalan seems to be proving himself quite the auteur. Unbreakable was the cinematic experience I had hoped it would be, especially after The Sixth Sense.  A quiet sense of wonder permeated each and every scene, accomplished with some of the finest cinematography I've seen in the last couple of years.  Director of Photography Eduardo Serra's execution is subtle, understated and absolutely beautiful.Cinematography legend Greg Toland of  Citizen Kane and The Grapes of Wrath fame would be proud of what this film accomplished artistically. I also couldn't help but notice all the long camera takes this film had, reminding me of a few Woody Allen films that let the actors act without the intrusion of the film making process, i.e.; getting a scene covered from multiple and sometimes meaningless camera angles just so the director and editor have something to work with in post production.  The characters seem at times to be acting for the benefit of the others on screen rather than ""us"", the audience, lending a quality of voyeurism to quite a few scenes.  The directors intent is quite clear to anyone wishing to delve a little bit deeper into the story and characters while appreciating how such a vision came to breath on film.With regards to the story, Mr. Shyamalan and his crew have constructed something so rich in visual texture while managing to keep the story subdued and character development full of deep-seated  anticipation.  Every plot point came perfectly without any extra connotations that usually creep into a story such as this (super heroes?).  Without any melodrama both Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson give very authentic performances that help the film keep its ""Any Town USA"" and ""Average Joe Six-pack"" feel very much alive.By virtue of ingenuity and most likely a meticulous preproduction period, Unbreakable manages to be a consummate clinic in directing, writing, acting, and cinematography.  One of the best movies in the past decade.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
M. Night Shyamalan's last really interesting movie so far.,"M. Night Shyamalan followed up ""The Sixth Sense"" with the not-quite-as-great, but no less fascinating, ""Unbreakable"". Bruce Willis plays Philadelphia security guard David Dunn, who survives a train wreck that kills everyone else. After this, he meets Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who suffers from Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which causes his bones to break very easily. Elijah is convinced that David is as strong as the superheros in comic books. But what is there about either of these men that remains to be discovered? As in his previous movie, Shyamalan creates a bleak setting that may be about to undergo a mind-shattering change. This one isn't as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", but you will be shocked at the end just the same. Watch for Shyamalan as the man whom David investigates at the stadium.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unthinkable,"Well, this is the 328th review on IMDB, so I'm probably not going to say anything that hasn't been said yet.I will just say that, more than any other movie I can think of, I am absolutely shocked that this movie has a 7.7 rating and ANY positive reviews at all.  In my opinion, this is indicative of the fact the movie going public no longer understands what makes a good film or even recognizes one when they see it.  Unbreakable was an attempt at a two hour character study, primarily of two men.  I'm guessing it was meant to be a character study because there isn't a plot or story line to speak of.  This is fine, character studies can be interesting, unfortunately we are spoon fed little pieces of information in one scene, and then shown the effect of it in the very next, as if we were being spoon fed the dimensions of the characters.For all the benefit of the doubt M. Night Shyamalan gave his audience in The Sixth Sense, he treats them like complete idiots in Unbreakable, making sure he drops a small foreshadowing to the audience before hitting them over the head with the actual event to make sure they understood.  And even with this heavy handed approach, we ultimately end up with two people we don't care about swimming around in a thin story based on the incredible assumption that someone wouldn't realize that they had never been sick or injured in their entire life until it was pointed out to them.In fact, the entire foundation of premises this movie is built upon is so fanciful and preposterous, that even a reasonable suspension of disbelief is impossible.Lastly, the camera work, particularly the artsy shots, should LEND to the storytelling, not take away from it.  Every time Shyamalan indulges in one of these sequences, he is not highlighting something important, he is reminding us we are only watching a movie.  What he did so skillfully in The Sixth Sense comes across as random and forced in Unbreakable.  Top this off with one of the most ridiculous scenes ever put on film in a serious movie (those who have seen it will probably know what I am talking about, those who don't heed my warning and go see it anyway, just watch for the scene with the kid and the gun), and you have a self-indulgent pile of trash unworthy of even going straight to video.  I don't know if Shyamalan was rushed to get this out, or if he got Kevin Costner syndrome after the success of his first movie and decided that he could mail one in, but Unbreakable is Unthinkably bad.  At the very very least, do yourself a favor and catch it for free on HBO or Showtime, or spend a buck and watch it in the dollar theatres, where it will be very soon I hope, making room for something more palatable.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Slow, thoughtful and clever -but the lack of traditional action or thrills may frustrate some","A massive train crash outside Philadelphia kills 132 passengers and leaves only one survivor.  The survivor, security guard David Dunn walks away completely unhurt from the accident.  Some time later he is contacted by comic book collector Elijah Price who believes that comic books are merely exaggerated versions of truth and that some people are created weak like him while some are created strong in order to protect the weak.  David develops his talents with the support of Price and his son Joseph and, despite his cynicism, starts to try to use his powers to help people on need.The 6th sense was always going to be a hard show to follow up but Shyamalan has managed to make a film that is almost as clever, emotive, thoughtful and slow.  It even manages to end with a twist that is almost as good as sixth sense's was.  The story moves quite slowly, almost painfully at times, however I found this succeeded in making the film feel more thoughtful and less glamorous.  The director even shots the train crash in a very low key manner, as if to make the point that the film isn't about cheap spectacle or visual thrills.  Instead we follow David as he finds his abilities and gradually accepts them, all this side is fascinating although some of the side stories are a little dragged out.  The twist is only the icing on the cake and if you're into the characters the way I was then it is really impacting.  One bit of advice - don't think about it or try to work it out. Thinking about the twist will stop you enjoying the main story and will spoil the film for yourself.Willis is excellent - he doesn't set the world on fire, but he does a very low-key performance as a common man confronted with so much potential responsibility.  He doesn't ham it up but you know that there's things going on inside his head that reflect on his face.  Jackson is also really good - he maybe plays it a little too weird and should have been a bit more of a geek rather than an uptight art dealer sort.  Willis and Jackson should keep making films together from now on, cause even there worst collaboration so far has still been good - Pulp Fiction, Unbreakable, Die Hard With a Vengeance - it seems to be a winning partnership (Loaded Weapon 1 doesn't count as Willis is only in it for 5 seconds!).  A surprise addition to the cast is Eamonn Walker as Dr Mathison, it's a small role but he is a fine actor and deserves to be seen in big films (check him out in HBO's Oz for a real show of his abilities).Overall it's very slow and may frustrate some people, but if you got the 6th sense then you'll probably get this.  The story is moving and thoughtful and the final scene is merely the icing on a very fine cake.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Moving - in its most original sense,"The final plot twist  in ""The Sixth Sense"" made me wonder whether its director could repeat such a stunt, in ""Unbreakable"". Force us to follow the path he wants us to take, by telling his story, slowly, subtly leading us. Make us start to believe we know what will happen next, make us love the characters, then make us *want* things to happen next. Yes, tonight when seeing ""Unbreakable"", all that happens, again. And then, exactly like in ""The Sixth Sense"", he pulls the carpet right from under us, in the final seconds of the movie takes away everything, every expectation, he first gave us. Many people will be so disappointed by this that they will end up hating the movie. So did I, for about five minutes. Now I know the movie will make me think, literally move my thoughts, for a long time after tonight. I want to see it again, right now. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.

Very good...,"""Unbreakable"" is a Drama - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch the lives of two men, one seemingly ordinary and the other with a mysterious condition, that intersect in a world where comic book heroes might be real.I liked this movie because it had not only an interesting plot but also so different than what I had watched before. The standout feature of ""Unbreakable"" is its grounded, realistic approach to the superhero narrative. Unlike most superhero films, it focuses more on the psychological aspects of its characters rather than flashy action sequences. The interpretations of Bruce Willis' who played as David Dunn is exceptional and his character's evolution is solid, while Samuel L. Jackson's who played as Elijah Price is captivating. In addition to this, the movie has a strong concept and thoughtful direction which was made by M. Night Shyamalan.

Shyamalan's second best film,"For me, The Sixth Sense is M Night Shyamalan's best film, but Unbreakable comes very, very close. Maybe it is not a movie for everybody, due to some parts dragging and rambling on just a tad, but it is a thoughtful, moving and compelling film.It is a very well made film with beautiful, brooding cinematography and striking scenery. Unbreakable also features my personal favourite James Newton Howard score for any of his collaborations with Shyamalan, it is so gorgeous and subtle. Even with the odd draggy moment, Unbreakable does have a very enthralling story that resonated with me a lot. Like The Sixth Sense, it deals with the supernatural genre but takes it to a thought-provoking and surreal level.The pace is measured, and for the most part it works. The script is thoughtfully written as well, the characters are interesting(I don't think Willis has had a more involving character than the one he has here) and Shyamalan's confidence and assurance further adds to the many impressive things about Unbreakable. Bruce Willis and Samuel L.Jackson are both fantastic, and one wonders why they didn't do more together.Some have been dismissive of the ending, I actually thought it was fine, though I was underwhelmed by it on my first viewing a few years back. I did say before that The Sixth Sense's ending was the only one of a Shyamalan film that worked, after re-watching Unbreakable I take that back. I still think though the others were either needlessly melodramatic(Signs), laughable(The Village) or both(The Happening). All in all, a great film and one of Shyamalan's better ones. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Some good acting and nice images added to a nice way of story telling make this an interesting movie,"I sometimes don't understand why people dare to say that M. Night Shyamalan is one of the best of todays directors. I'm not saying he isn't a good one, but what has he proved so far? He has only made six (!!!) movies. OK, some of them were great successes at the box office, but that still doesn't mean that you are a great director (I don't consider movies like for instance ""Dumb and Dumber"" as masterpieces either, even though they are very popular with a certain audience). And I don't mind admitting that he sure knows how to build up a certain mysterious atmosphere and frightening scenes. But saying that he's one of the greatest directors, just because of that, I will not. At least not until he has made another 15 or 20 great movies...With ""Unbreakable"" he has kept one of his traditions alive. He has directed the movie, produced it, has played a little role in it and has written the script for it. This time the story is about an ordinary man who suddenly becomes very special. But the seemingly ordinary and perfectly normal security guard David Dunn is not only the sole survivor of a horrific train-crash that killed 131 people, he didn't even have a scratch on him afterwards. A little later, comic book specialist and art gallery owner Elijah Price, nicknamed ""Mr. Glass"" due to his more than fragile bones, contacts him to confront him with an incredible theory: he believes that Dunn is his exact opposite, that they both seem to be 'linked by a curve, but sitting on opposite ends'. He's convinced that comic books are what remains of an ancient system of storytelling, that the superheroes they are about, are based on real people and that Dunn is one of these people. At first Dunn doesn't believe him, but as he keeps thinking about it, he finds out that he has never ever been hurt or sick in his life, his physical strength is larger than normal and he has a skill which others don't...Normally I'm not a fan of movies based on comic books, so I already immediately assumed that I wouldn't like this movie either, just because of the subject. But I'm wrong. This is actually a nice and mysterious thriller with an interesting story and some fine acting. Samuel L. Jackson is very good as Elijah Price, but I guess it is Bruce Willis who surprised me the most. I sure hope to see him more often in this kind of 'serious' roles, instead of in the role of some action hero... The entire movie looks more than OK and I admit that M. Night Shyamalan has done a nice job with it. I hope that he'll make a lot more movies like this one, because I really liked it. I give it a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Just fantastic,"Willis finds out some strange things about himself after being the sole survivor in a train wreck. Jackson tells him he's special. Is he really?Unbreakable really is an act 1 superhero story stretched to feature lenght (Night tells us in an interview). Genius. For once I believe Willis is the person on screen, not that he's playing Bruce Willis, the cool actor. Night uses colors (mostly blue, purple and green) and well chosen camera-angles as imagesystems (word is that the storyboard read like a comic). Most of them really work out well. I loved the slow pacing of the film. It really takes it time to tell us what's going on. As usual Shyamalan puts human drama first in his script. The first scene where Willis meets the woman in the train... You have to see the genius of it. In a few lines of dialog Shyamalan let's us discover the character Dunn.Another reason why I love this film is because Shyamalan shows he has courage to make THIS after the enormous success of The Sixth Sense, which I think is inferior to this film. I just know the studio execs where pushing for something more tangible than this, but he chose this instead. A homage to comic books. And it works! BEAUTIFUL!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Shyamalan Trademark Already Wearing Thin,"Everyone wanted to love wunderkind M. Night Shyamalan's follow up to his break out hit ""The Sixth Sense,"" but in only his second feature, the trappings that have since gone on to utterly ruin his films and his reputation were already beginning to wear thin.Those trappings include lugubrious pacing; gray, dour production design; a tone almost silly in its degree of solemnity; and a ""twist"" ending that feels forced and anticlimactic.I've caught ""Unbreakable"" on T.V. once or twice since seeing it in theatres back in 2000, and while it's not a terrible movie, it's a perfect one to have in the background if you want to take a nap.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbreakable is unbearable,"A germ of a good idea gets buried under a script that needs many rewrites and a director quite impressed with himself. If slow pace worked so well in Sixth Sense, why not make this one twice as slow? Won't that make it twice as good? No. When action does occur, it often occurs with no sense of internal logic. Such as when the son suddenly points a gun at his father to show that Pops is a superhero. This comes out of nowhere. Also, Willis's catatonic performance worked well in Sixth Sense because he had a stunningly good child actor to fill the gaps. Here Willis isn't surrounded by that talent level. Why does he do the things he does? Why is he numb to everything? I don't know, and halfway through this mess, I didn't care. Avoid at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Starts big, but gets as murky as some of the photography.","The premise is great. (Some spoilers ahead so be warned). First, the ""average man"" played by Bruce Willis, discovers he might NOT be average.In an early great scene with ""Mr. Glass"", played by Samuel L. Jackson, Willis must face his inner sadness. Willis, currently a security guard, is told by Mr. Glass that he is sad because he is not fulfilling his true life work... as a superhero and super protector of others.Great premise. A superhero discovered. But then it gets sort of murky...as the photography darkens (maybe it's me, but I want to be able to see...at least in some of the scenes).Too much mystery and not enough plot movement (for me anyway).I do think ""Mr. Glass"" is on to something when he says that comic book superheros are hints of lost legends...or maybe history.But the movie takes a while to get to the point. ""Mr. Glass"" has caused lots of mass tragedies in order to find the UNBREAKABLE person. Thus, he is both a mentor and a MONSTER.A good quality comic book could tell and show you this great story premise, but would snap up the pace.Irritating and frivolous vulgarities - In the comic store, some crude song lyrics are heard in the background with apparently no connection to the plot (And I had subtitles on my DVD when the 9 year old walked in)!!!Worth seeing, but not great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

brilliantly alright,"as a follow up to his massive sixth sense movie. Shyamalan gave us this tale of a man who begins to think he's unbreakable. It's a captivating plot, and a highly intriguing angle in which he tells the story, but it lacks something. And that is general enjoyment. It's slowly spun, testing the patience, and i was fine with it. It drove me in to it's little mystery. It's directed brilliantly, he truly is a film maker of the highest calibre, but beneath the technical brilliance of it, lies a story which doesn't really pay off. Like the sixth sense, there are millions of huge plot holes that destroy any realism it tries to create. And despite the occasional magic moment, it just seems a trek to get through.Performance wise, it's spot on, everything is. If only it was paced and structured a little better. I think the score becomes the most memorable part of the movie. Shyamalan and composer james newton howard, are the new spielberg and john williams. Well lets hope so.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Better than The Sixth Sense,"An hour and a half into this movie I wondered how Shyamalan would wrap the film up in a nice little package, without room for a sequel. I shouldn't of bothered. The film was superb and the ending was a bigger twist than The Sixth Sense. Anybody who doesn't get Unbreakable should stick to Disney films. Bruce Willis proves once again that he can act. Most of the plaudits for Sixth Sense went to the kid and Twelve Monkeys to Pitt, although Jackson is superb as usual, Bruce Willis steals the movie with a subtleness most screen stars cannot portray. Unbreakable is a great way to start off what should be a fine year for movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Underrated,Wow such a good movie but why it is so underrated. You all need to watch it,8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Its all perspective,"I've seen this film before but was looking through my DVD collection to find a film my kid brother could watch with me, without it being a kids film or a comedy. And I found this. In fact, I think M. Night Shyamalan are great for films to watch with people of all ages, as although they explore fairly gritty and dark ideas they are fairly family friendly.On second viewing, I liked this film about as much I did the first time round - I like it, but it holds itself back. A lot.Firstly, the setup is ridiculous, as a 'comic book' film set in reality the concept of Bruce Willis's invincible character seems a little too far fetched to ever be used a relatable figure to the audience, through whom the audience's perceptions are questioned. Unlike Night's other films where the hero's tend to be everyday sorta people (such as Gibson in Signs), Willis is a character totally out of place in the viewer's universe.The climax of the film is under-developed, with the kidnap plot thrown into the film far too late, and so as the 'actiony' finale lacks any really weight or significance which it craves.However, this film is not all about special powers or Willis's character, if you look carefully it's a film about perception. Using the directive (is that a word? I doubt it) masterfully, Night subtly sprinkles the film with ideas and shots in which the viewer's perception is brought into play. For example in the final scene of reconciliation between Willis and his wife, their son is shown in full shot filling a glass up midway of of orange juice, the camera then focuses in on this glass next to the newspaper with Willis on the headline, a metaphor surely for the films objective of asking is the glass ever really half empty? This is further emphasised by the decent twist (c'mon on its a Night film, of course it has a twist), in which the viewer is left wondering whether the set villain is actually the hero of the film.I like this film, mainly due to it's direction and thought provoking message, however as a blockbuster or an entertainment flick I can understand why people think it doesn't stand-up compared to the rest of the blockbusters filling up the local odeons.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Night Time,"Why was this made? To establish a new genre, following on the heels of `The Sixth Sense.' Playing it safe, we have Willis again as confused in the face of the supernatural, a knowing boy, a background wife. Right, and a plot twist at the end. Fund it well enough to ensure a high level of craft and produce not just good box office, but also a new Hollywood trend to ride.It's not going to happen, primarily because this film is just not good enough as an assembly, but also because people can only be freshly surprised once. The last film depended on its writing and the trick of largescale retrospective reinvention. This was a trick of the written word, not something that comes out of the visual medium. In an attempt to be more cinematic, this film ambitiously adds two elements:--An attempt to be self-referential, or at least contain mirrored symbology in the comic book motif--An attempt to build a peculiar world, slightly surreal, presumably to serve as a springboard for plot turns and artsy effectsBut these are implemented clumsily. Part of the problem is Willis. His appeal is based precisely on the notion of an ordinary guy, specifically an ordinary guy in an ordinary world. But the real problem is the writer and we presume his committee of advisors. He is a print writer with a good visual sense. (The scene in the train is very good.) But he is not someone who can visualize the world first and then cinematically animate a story. This trend is already dead, killed by its creator. The comic book thing could have been used well, as it is the root of image-based storytelling. Surely this is what was intended But all we get are a few stares at covers.This could have been an excellent film. But the writer cannot escape the written word.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"It´s not the Sixth Sense, but it does come close","M. Night Shyamalan´s The Sixth Sense was a quite impressive piece of psychological suspense. I saw it in a theater and the end really caught me, and everybody else, offguard. Next Shyamalan did Unbreakable and then my favorite of these three movies, Signs. Unbreakable is an above-average thriller/drama, but still I find it somewhat weaker than the Sixth Sense or Signs. And in this case ""weaker"" isn´t a huge drawback as Unbreakable would still beat 90% of all the so-called psychological thrillers coming out of Hollywood every other second. Only few films manage to create heavy atmospheres and suspenseful moments and even fewer films have talented actors. Bruce Willis might not the greatest actor in Hollywood, but he knows how to do his job well. Samuel L. Jackson is also a very reliable actor and I´m sure that the fact that these two men were both in the third Die Hard movie helped to create the chemistry necessary for movies like this.       Unbreakable is a solid dark thriller, but not as good as Signs or The Sixth Sense. I watched this movie dubbed in German (don´t ask me why...) so I might have missed some more or less important points... Oh well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the masterpieces of our time,"What if Superman was here on earth and didn't know he was Superman?
That is essentially the plot of the movie.
We follow David Dunn, a security guard who is the sole survivor of a catastrophic train crash. David is later confronted by Elijah Price, a comic book expert that says he might have the answer to Davids question ""Why am I the only survivor?"" So David, a man dissatisfied with his life goes to search for what his purpose in life is.I've seen this movie several times, and I have never even gotten tired of it. It does deal with comic books, but approaches it with a level of sophistication and intellect never found before in comic book movies. The movie walks a very fine line between reality and the comic-book world, at the same time walking a very fine line in terms of audience perception. Some chalk it up to be a silly comic-book movie, others a brilliant comic-book movie. And yet, there are still others that maintain Unbreakable's comic book theme does not exactly make it a comic-book movie. It's more of a drama, just like the Sixth Sense was more of a drama than a horror movie. Both are excellent dramas, but Unbreakable was superior in every aspect.I especially admired the camera movement, and the framing of certain scenes to bring to life an actual comic-book. I also admired how Unbreakable was very light on dialogue, making full use of subtle gestures, movements, and actions to represent the character's thoughts. The character's environment plays a similar role and certain colors are often brought up to represent distinct emotions and thoughts the character has.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Rather lacklustre,"Given the general acclaim that this film has received I was hoping for a little more.I always appreciate M. Night Shyamalan's ideas and concepts, but felt like the execution was lacking here.It felt a bit pedestrian and slow, and I wasn't overly interested in any of the characters.There were some cool moments, and the direction was quite cool too, but overall I was left wanting more and felt a bit underwhelmed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
So close to being great,"It's really frustrating to find a movie that comes so close to being great and only a few minor faults are holding it back. Luckily, it's not so frustrating that it ruins the experience. Unbreakable is still an intense and emotional movie and I wish M. Night Shyamalan was still making movies like this.Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a man unhappy with his marriage and his relationship with his son. David is trying to get a job in New York so he can move out of the house and move his life in his own direction. When his train back from New York derails, David is the only survivor and he is sought out by a fragile man named Elijah, who believes David is special.This could easily be cheesy, but Shyamalan wisely plays up the comic-book feeling of the plot while maintaining a certain sense of reality. Bruce Willis is a good choice as the passive David, a man not sure where he fits in the world. Samuel Jackson, always good, is great here; it's probably his best role that I've seen since Pulp Fiction. Robin Wright Penn also has some touching moments as Willis's despairing wife, as does Spencer Treat Clark as his neglected but loving son.The problem is not with the story or cast, but with the direction. There are some awkward transitions and some moments that should have been played out longer; it sometimes feels like Shyamalan is copping out on giving us real drama and instead giving us an outline of what happened. But no matter; it's still an intriguing movie and it has some great images. And while it may not be on par with his The Sixth Sense and Signs, it comes close, and that's good enough.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Rich, dark superhero story (without the spandex!) 7/10","This offering from the director of 'The Sixth Sense' provides a dark, moody depiction of the spectrum of good vs evil.  The film's hard, filth ridden view of modern life sets an excellent scene from which the not so likely hero of good may be illuminated.  The films cast is squarely suited to the cold, slow screenplay. Bruce Willis excels in the leading role which contains suprisingly little anger or comedy, the usual trademarks of Willis.

"Another thoughtful, fantastical tale from Shyamalan.","This fantastical tale from the director of sixth sense takes us into another realm of the; ""it could happen""-""yeah in your dreams"", that Shyamalan creates and takes us into with such gentle persuasion. Bruce Willis is a dull everyman with an unwordly gift...or two, or more. When I realised what world we were being brought into I wanted to shake my head in disbelief, but such is the Director's charm that I wanted more and more.If you accept the premise you'll probably like this movie. My wife, on the other hand, had a fit of the giggles on a number of occasions. It's just that easy to find the movie either enthralling or ridiculous. It moves rather ponderously, but I didn't mind it, as it sets us up for the complete change of pace towards the end. Shyamalan again shows his uncanny ability to pick child stars, Bruce's son is played by Spencer Treat Clark, who comes close to stealing the movie with his earnest portrayal of a boy wanting his dad to be a somebody. Robin Penn is also good as Bruce's patient wife. Shyamalan again appears in his own movie in a scene I did not quite understand. Was it meant to show Bruce's fallibilities?

Very original in 2000. Still a good watch.,"Twenty four years later, this doesn't seem so original anymore, but it's still a fun flick. This off-kilter take on comic book heroes and villains stars Bruce Willis as a man who cannot be hurt, has amazing strength and has never been sick a day in his life. The fact that this is just occurring to him in middle age was the hardest thing to swallow in this film. When we meet him, he is quickly the sole survivor of a terrible train crash. The fact that not only is he the only survivor, he doesn't have as much as a scratch on him draws the attention of another man who is his polar opposite. His body can be shattered like glass. Willis is Willis here. Samuel L. Jackson, nearly always entertaining, plays the other man. Robin Wright is touching in a small role and Spencer Treat Clark is another who is interesting. This was M.

Slightly busted,"Not nearly as good as Sixth Sense, but better than a lot of people give it credit for.  Anyone who says the film is slow has never seen a Godard film. It's dark & quiet, but now slow.  Bruce Willis's performance may be too low key, but maybe it fits in with the atmosphere of dread/sadness hanging over the whole affair (well, see below).The beginning is good and ending is not as bad as people claim (at least it's not a pat Hollywood ending).  And yeah, some scenes are questionable (kid and the gun).MY MAJOR COMPLAINT:  And I've not heard or read anything about this.  It is absolutely unbelievable that Bruce Willis didn't realize that he never got sick or had incredible strength or had a ""6th sense"" for picking out troublemakers in his security job.  C'mon!!  This obliviousness and his ""Droopy Dog"" expression sometimes makes him come off as a bit slow/stupid/clueless - not exactly the attributes of a superhero.  The weightlifting scene, for example.  He's looking at his son and asking him much much weight is on the bar - turn around and look, for god sakes!  Kinda silly.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Underrated and Ahead of its Time,"Drawn together like magnetic opposites, a pair of fundamentally different people try to make sense of the world and their distinct places within it. Bruce Willis plays the stoic, understated small-time security guard, sole survivor of a horrific train collision who can't recall the last (first?) time he was sick or injured. Samuel L. Jackson is the feeble, outspoken socialite cursed with an extra-fragile set of bones, on the mend far more often than he's not. Together, they agree that there seems to be some sort of innate balance to the world - that the shortcomings of one are directly responsible for the abundances of another - and that Jackson's constant distress is a twisted galactic penance for Willis's underutilized superpowers. Working together to test and refine this theory, they form an uneasy alliance, but the truth is destined to drive them apart.Remember when M. Night Shyamalan was the freshest new voice in the business? Unbreakable arrived when that moment was at its fullest, just a year after the runaway success of The Sixth Sense and well before The Happening and The Last Airbender dropped his creative profile to rock bottom. Clearly the work of a longtime comic book reader, Unbreakable represents a darker, grittier, more cerebral interpretation of the superhero genre that hits closer to home than the early Marvel efforts of roughly the same period. The original X-Men was less than six months old when this hit theaters, with Spider-Man still almost two years in the future, but in retrospect, I think the modern Marvel franchise owes more to this Shyamalan jam than their more obvious ancestors. This is less of a glossy Saturday morning cartoon and more of a ground-up reinterpretation. A modernization of those fantastical themes to suit a more cynical age. It has its problems, to be sure - nagging little flaws and eccentricities that would eventually unravel the director's entire tapestry - but the surrounding conflict is so smart, well-formed and engaging, I still find myself willing to let those go.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Masterful filmmaking,"A perversely enjoyable unease permeates this psychological thriller from writer-director M. Night Shyamalan, here following his commercial success with ""The Sixth Sense"" in top form. A comic book connoisseur with an alarming, lifelong bone density deficiency befriends a security guard who was recently the only survivor of a massive train derailment; convincing the survivor he may in fact be unbreakable proves to be quite tough...however, even super-heroes have a weakness. Meticulously mounted film features one of Bruce Willis' best performances; he is altogether convincing, vulnerable, touching, and sympathetic as a modern-day man afraid of what powers he may possess. The film does err on occasion (a sequence in a comic book shop at night is confusing, and the picture's main color scheme--steely blues and grays--becomes visually monotonous), however the wonderful script and performances take the movie to a higher realm for this genre. There is a great deal of art in Shyamalan's presentation (including a gorgeous shot of Robin Wright Penn being carried up the stairs), and he works wonders with the supporting cast--even the two-line players are perfection. ***1/2 from ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

One of the better films of the season,"M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense was a very, very good example of exquisete storytelling wrapped around a good egg full of good acting and suspense.  Unbreakable isn't too much different, with only a few minor things making it no masterpiece.The story follows a average security guard in Philly played by Bruce Willis, who is in a train when it crashes, being the only survivor, with no injuries sustained.  Then, a avid (yet serverely physically sick) comic book collector played by Sam Jackson find him and if you've seen the previews, you get the point.  Some things in common with Shyamalan's past success (an unraveling plot, lovingly played out performances, conflicted ending) with not only the obvious, but also that he has such a trust in his audience of patience and understanding, it is a wonder films like these are made anymore.

Terrible Attempt at Emotion and Drama in this Disappointing Movie,"I'll say it right now, Unbreakable is my pick for worst movie ever made. Not necessarily in terms of quality, I'm sure some Sci-Fi channel movie would snatch that prize, but in terms of writing, acting, and most importantly, directing. I counted how many words Bruce Willis said throughout the entire movie, my final total was 6 (that is not technically true as I didn't really count, but I'm confident my estimate is within about 10 of the actual number). There is an unbelievable amount of epic staring at each other done by all of the characters involved. I really wanted to enjoy this movie when we popped it in, in fact it was my choice to rent it, but by the end everyone in my family was laughing quite hysterically (needless to say the movie was not supposed to be funny). I do not enjoy when a movie is filled with dumb characters, in fact I really hate it when it seems every character is mentally deficient. This is one of those movies. One scene in particular struck me as incredibly ridiculous. Bruce's son decides he's going to shoot Bruce to show everyone that Bruce is truly invulnerable. Bruce and his wife freak out (naturally) and try to get the son to put the gun away. In a moment of unintentional comedy, myself and two other members of my family all said out-loud, ""For God's sake, just shoot him."" The movie would have been over and this horrible scene would cease to poison our minds with contagious stupidity. The big twist at the end was not clever, and relatively easy to predict, meaning of course that it was disappointing and therefore fit great with the rest of the movie. If you are someone who can REALLY get involved in a movie and truly feel the character's pain. then perhaps you will love this movie, but my entire family just couldn't get over how ridiculous everything was and how everyone kept staring at each other in an unbelievably corny way.

Why expend so much energy concentrating on character development when what you're left with at the end is SO MONUMENTALLY INSIGNIFICANT? this entire movie basically amounts to the fantasy of an overgrown boy (Shyamalan) who seems to think that comic books are in some way IMPORTANT. You know, I wish someone would give me millions of dollars to turn my adolescent enthusiams into feature films, but even then I might try to make something that might have some MEANING to someone other than myself. Never before have I wanted to scream out in a theater: ""This is BORING!""God, that INTERMINABLE sequence of Bruce lifting weights!!!If I had to sum up this movie in one word, that word would be ""Bunk."" If I had to sum it up in two words, those words would be ""Self-Indulgent."" The payoff is just not worth the two hours of your life you will expend waiting for it. The fact that so many people seem to think this story is filled with such deep philosophical meaning truly frightens me. There is Style here, yes, but the substance is just SO INSIGNIFICANT. If Shymalan was really so desperate to make this ""statement,"" he should have made it and shown it to his closest friends, thus sparing the public.If you really find comic books so absolutely filled with untold insights that illuminate the complexities of the human condition, I suggest you attempt to work your way up to ""Books."" You can start with Harry Potter. In the meantime, however, here's a movie just for you. It's essentially an overintellectualized version of ""X-Men."" Or ""The Phantom."" Or ""Supergirl.""If, on the other hand, you think that comic books might be an amusing diversion only in the case that you were rendered parapalegic and could only read that, or an issue of Popular Mechanics from 1962, or if you are capable of reading books in which there are not pictures, you might get a lot more intellectual satisfaction out of watching ""Charlie's Angels.""This movie is like a large, elaborately wrapped present containing a single peanut.Which is not to mention that it is basically the same story as 6th Sense: ""Oh, I've got powers, and I must use them for good.""Now lie down and press your fingers hard against your eyeballs.

"Good Flick if You Like Quiet, Intense Movies","If you liked The Sixth Sense, you should like Unbreakable.  There are certain aspects of Unbreakable that were very much in play in The Sixth Sense - Bruce Willis, a sensitive boy, Philadelphia,subtle music, shadows and a sense of isolation.  This movie is even quieter than The Sixth Sense, so if you found Sixth Sense slow going, you'll find this more so.  (In fact, you could pretty easily knock at least three scenes out of the movie and not loose a thing.)That said, I think Shyamalan is one of the best commercial movie makers out there today.  I like eerie, atmospheric movies that don't rely on grossness and hyperbolic action substitute for plot and character.  Both Willis and Jackson are wonderful in their roles as a lucky security guard and an unlucky comic art collector.Yes, there is an undercurrent of the fantastic in this movie; probably not enough to take the Dramatic Presentation Hugo from something ""more obvious"" like X-Men or Gormenghast.  There were a few funny bits about comics fandom (by inference).  Samuel L.Jackson's gallery was pretty tony for a comic art gallery.  And there's another bit (the movie's most unnecessary scene) with Jackson in a comic store and the sales clerk has no idea who he is.

"Unbreakable is one of the most interesting films in the superhero thriller genre, characterized by a deep, thoughtful approach to the theme of strength and uniqueness.","Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, an ordinary man who gradually reveals his extraordinary powers. His confrontation with his ""antithesis"" Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) becomes the central theme of the film. Director M. Night Shyamalan avoids the traditional action, creating instead a psychological story about the search for self, revealing the inner strength and at the same time the vulnerability of man. The film attracts attention thanks to its slow but skillfully constructed rhythm and unusual visual style, which enhances its atmosphere. Although the plot unfolds slowly, every moment is significant and filled with symbolism. Willis as Dunn shows a restrained, deep performance that adds authenticity to the character. The interaction between him and Jackson creates tension, forcing the viewer to reflect on the nature of heroism and opposites in human life. It is a thought-provoking movie that does not lose its significance even years later. Shyamalan proved that the superhero movie genre can have a deep psychological context, and Vulnerable has become a true classic that is worth watching for anyone looking for something more than a standard blockbuster.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing Followup,"This movie is a disappointing followup to the director's very good (but also overrated) Sixth Sense.  The movie is painfully slow and boring except for the all too brief appearances of Samuel L. Jackson who always adds interest to a basically poor film such as this one.  Bruce Willis is the supposedly tortured soul who is ""unbreakable"".  Why no one noticed this in over 30 years is given short shrift by the writer-director.  Also, the supposedly surprise ending could have been predicted by anyone with over a sixth grade education.  All-in-all, I can't recommend this film to anyone, except for Samuel L. Jackson fans.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A Dark, Moody Masterpiece","Another slam dunk from Shyamalan, everything from the acting, score, cinematography, and editing is executed to such immaculate perfection to make one of the best neo-noir superhero films ever. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson have great chemistry with one another, and the artistic choices made by Shyamalan to depict their immense differences in the unbreakable Willis and the glass-boned Jackson are a marvel to look at.The only real negative thing I really have to say about Unbreakable is that the movie concludes with the ""words on a still shot"" trope that makes the final scene feel much more goofy than it otherwise had been depicted. I don't want to give too much away, but if you know, you know.While The Sixth Sense resonated with me emotionally more, I do think that Unbreakable's script is more tightly written, making it hard to pick which one I like more, but I still hold both films in high regards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Well-Made,"A really interesting and original take on the medium of comic books and superhero films, made right before the rise of said genre.Shyamalan clearly has talent, this is my first film of his and he clearly knows how to place the camera, one of the strongest aspects here is the camera placement, movement, and how the scenes play out, where he often chooses to utilise long takes that help the actors bring their characters to life. However, I found the narrative structure to be very weak, especially the third act and the ending, which I found incredibly unsatisfying with a cheap plot twist.Great theme and some solid cinematography. All the acting performances are solid, it feels really grounded and you believe the characters surprise at the events happening. My main problems are all summed up in how the story feels like it leads up to nothing, not a lot is done with the characters or even their actions, it is more concerned with grounding comic book analogies than actually doing something with them.

Also the ending wasn't surprising that made me felt worth watching till end. It had a very normal ""Hero Movie Ending.""The reason I gave 6.5 was because this movie was way below my expectation toward M. Night Shyamalan's movie.

Also, the meaning and the lessons of the movie was a little bit weak that made me felt good of watching. This movie was a bit not memorable.

Mixed bag,"Reading through the comments already posted on this film, it's pretty obvious that opinions are divided on Unbreakable, and for good reason...the movie is a mixed bag.  On the one hand, it really is well-crafted, with stellar to serviceable performaces across the board and some pretty taut moments, particularly the beginning and the last twenty minutes.On the other hand, it has a slow second act and falls short in several areas, particularly characterization, emotion and in a few key moments, plausibility.  Yeah, the ending isn't even close to that of Sixth Sense, but anyone really disappointed by that had unrealistic expectations.  The ending works, it just doesn't really add much to what preceded it, while the ending to Sixth Sense cast a new perspective on everything that happened in that entire film.What really bugged me in Unbreakable was the characters motivations were largely unexplained (both for Willis' and Jackson's characters) to the point that the ending really doesn't pay off the way it is meant to, because we don't really buy it.And as a tribute to the comic book genre, I think it fails.  What makes the comic book genre so great is the how fantastic the stories, the characters, the action is.  To try to ground that in the real world is like trying to take the tackling out of football.  You change it's essence so much that what's left constitutes but a shadow of what makes the real thing so great.Now the hype around Shyamalan will dim a bit, as well it should, as we wonder whether he's a one-trick pony.  I bet he comes back big next time, hopefully riding on something that's different for him and doesn't rely so heavily on a surprise ending.  My rating: 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Is this Bruce Willis or the movie that is unbreakable?,"By making this movie, M Night Shyamalan certainly felt like renewing with the artistic and commercial success of ""the sixth sense"". At the beginning, ""unbreakable""'s got all the elements to become a great fantastic movie in the tradition of ""the sixth sense"". This time it's not the little Halet Joel Osment who's suffering but Bruce Willis himself! He's the only one having survived to a train crash and he hasn't got any broken bone. You can guess it: this situation makes him worried, his family becomes mistrustful, especially his son but more important, a museum director (Samuel L. Jackson) takes an interest in him. Maybe, will he reveal him the truth about the train crash... During a long part, the movie is fascinating. Night Shyamalan makes several odd sequences succeed (the oddest one is probably the first one which is Jackson's birth). These scenes abound in little unseemly details that make the plot progress. Moreover, the director succeeds in giving birth to an anguished climate. We don't see the train crash but everything contributes to distil anxiety. We arrive at the end and this is where the movie lacks of its attraction. Very simply, the conclusion fits badly with the plot and seems simplistic, puerile. Of course, ""unbreakable"" is not so far from ""the sixth sense"", Bruce Willis is always excellent as he was in his previous movie and Samuel L. Jackson is scheming because he hides a mysterious secret too. But however, you can't help feeling a certain disappointment after having seen ""unbreakable"". For lack of being extraordinary, it's an honourable success but that's all.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Subtle and Unique Superhero Story,"""Unbreakable"" is a slow-burning, atmospheric thriller that takes a unique and grounded approach to the superhero genre. M. Night Shyamalan crafts a story that feels more like a psychological drama than a traditional comic book movie, focusing on character depth and emotional weight rather than spectacle. The film's methodical pacing and muted tone set it apart, making for an intriguing but divisive experience.Bruce Willis delivers a restrained yet compelling performance as David Dunn, portraying his character's quiet struggle with a sense of purpose and identity. Samuel L. Jackson, on the other hand, brings a captivating intensity to his role, adding layers of mystery and philosophical weight to the film's central themes. Their dynamic is what truly drives the narrative, creating a fascinating exploration of strength, destiny, and belief.Shyamalan's direction is meticulous, with carefully framed shots and a deliberate, almost hypnotic storytelling style. The muted color palette and minimalistic score further enhance the film's introspective and eerie atmosphere. However, while these elements contribute to its uniqueness, they also slow the pacing, which may test the patience of some viewers.Although ""Unbreakable"" is an intelligent and refreshing take on superhero mythology, it doesn't quite reach the level of emotional or narrative impact that it aims for. Some moments feel drawn out, and the film's quiet nature may leave some viewers wanting more momentum. That said, its originality, strong performances, and thought-provoking themes make it a worthwhile watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Superheroes Are Among Us,"I grew up with comic books, and my husband did not. After he saw this film, he told me that I had to see it. I admit that I did not know what I was watching- until the last 2 minutes. Then I was utterly gob smacked! have seen this movie dozens of times since, and I am still gob smacked that I did not see the totality of what this director was presenting to me. I found the ""twist ending"" in the ""6th Sense"" to be obvious from the beginning; ""Unbreakable"" is more of a twist movie.Watching it again this morning, I still wonder how I missed the many hints that were given to us by this director (upfront disclosure: I am a fan of all of his films), who makes his usual appearance in a scene with Our Hero, David Dunn, played by Bruce Willis. The everyday name of Our Hero; the name of his girlfriend/wife Audrey Inverso (played by Robin Wright), who does inverse the direction Our Hero could have taken in his life; Our Hero's new friend Eijah Price, aka Mr. Glass, played by Samuel Jackson, whom the movie mostly focuses on in the last 2 minutes; all of these are clues to the directors intent. I realize something new every time I watch ""Unbreakable"", and it is my favorite of Shyamalan's films.If you are a fan of the world created by comic books, please see this !

However, as the plot developed and the drama began to build, I found myself once again praising M. Night Shyamalan.  If you enjoyed The Sixth Sense, this movie will not let you down.  Of course it has the episodic twists and the morose undertones that we have felt since Praying with Anger (there is always a modicum of immateriality in all of M. Night's works) but this film also has a sense of excitation that keeps you churning in your seat for more.  Samuel L. Jackson plays an entropic hero that is so well cast, he could rival De Niro on any given subject.  And of course there is Willis, who plays the part of the eudemonistic spirit who we have loved since Blind Date.  Add a bit of Shyamalan magic and you've got a formula for success.I would disect this movie bit by bit, but since this movie is so fresh with style and flavor - I'll let you try and understand why I said its ""X-men meets Frequency meets The Sixth Sense.""Enjoy",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Ok, But It Could Have Been Better.","M. Night S. tries to come up with a movie that will be similiar to his ""Sixth Sense"" but falls a little short. He sets up Bruce Willis' character and Samuel L. Jackson's character well enough, but they don't come together and make the audience feel like it did for Osment's and Willis' characters in ""The Sixth Sense"".Although most of ""Unbreakable"" tries to set up Willis as someone who is going to learn a lot about himself, he only learns as much as the audience deduces in the first twenty minutes, and this leads to an anti-climatic ending, which brings the entire movie along with it. I think this is overall a good movie, and it has many parts in it that capture the audience's attention and make us wonder what else is going to happen, but the characters just don't have that feeling that they are learning about themselves like Willis and Osment do in ""Sixth Sense"".If you liked ""Sixth Sense"" and want a movie a little slower and more low-key than ""Unbreakable"" is a must-see M.

"Not Quite a Masterpiece, But Not WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!","Just saw this tonight and I'm still puzzled as to how I feel about the film. Having skimmed through some of the comments it appears people are either embracing it as a masterpiece or reviling it as a boring piece of garbage. I won't go so far as to suggest this film is a masterpiece, but it certainly skews closer to that end of the spectrum than the other.Things I Liked:1) Bruce Willis.  Lots of people said he was really really boring, which is their way of saying, ""He wasn't being John McClane, he wasn't the Bruce Willis I am used to.  I don't get it.""  Understated acting does not necessarily mean boring.  He was playing a sad, confused Everyman (at least emotionally), it would be ludicrous for him to spout lame one-liners and start crawling into ventilation ducts.  I thought he did a great job.2) Samuel L. Jackson.  The Willis-Jackson chemistry is great here, better than their DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE team-up, and Jackson by himself is fantastic as he almost always is.  He had the more flamboyant and unusual of the two lead roles, so perhaps he had the advantage over Willis, but he manages to keep his character from flying up into the camposphere by delivering fantastical dialogue seriously.3) The comic book as modern mythology idea was interesting although underdeveloped, like the movie itself really.  I wish they had trimmed a good fifteen or so minutes of longing stares and slow motion shots of people standing around so they could have afforded more screen time to developing the movie's central premise, that is, that the power and truth of Mythic Reality can and does exist in the modern world, filtered and diluted though it might be.Things I Didn't Like:1) Okay, I hate to sound like a Bruckheimer-loving yokel, but this movie really did drag.  I'm not asking for even one gratuituous car chase, but please, Night, zip it up a little.  I felt every one of this movie's one hundred and fifteen minutes.2) Like THE SIXTH SENSE, this is a film more or less without plot.  The plot, such as it is, is the growth and self-realization of a character. That's fine and dandy, but I kept waiting for Clark Kent to finally move to Metropolis, so to speak.  Willis spends the whole movie stuck in Smallville here, and when it finally does look as if he's about to maybe tear open his shirt to reveal the big red S (metaphorically speaking of course), they hit us with the ending...3)....which, to put it the least, I did not like.  It was an interesting twist, I'll grant the filmmakers that.  I loved Jackson's final rambling speech, it was great, sad and horrifying all at once.  But then they go and ruin it by stapling a very clumsy, very awkward text card ""Epilogue"" onto the final frames.  Ugh.  First of all, it's not like this is true story (I expected another title to read ""(so-and-so) is still at large.  If you have any information as to the whereabouts of this person, please notify the theater manager."") so that makes no sense.  Secondly, the movie was so drawn-out and elongated (which at times worked and at other times did not) that to truncate the ending like that, to resolve the story in a rush and not even visually but with text, felt like a huge cheat.Overall I give this movie a 7.  Worth seeing at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Great movie,"Unbreakable centres around two characters: David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson). David is at a low point in his life. His wife has recently left him and taken his son, he has a poor job, and appears to be desperately lonely. To top it all he is then involved in a train crash, but he is the only survivor, without a scratch. Something is not right. He is then pursued by Elijah (who suffers from a bone disease that means he can very easily break his bones) who tells him that there is something special about him. David is trying to take all this in while also trying to re-establish relations with his son and wife.Who would like this movie? This is a little like Sixth Sense, in that it has some supernatural overtones but does not involve ghosts or similar. There is a heavy comic book feel to it, which is intentional, but it isn't really like X-Men or similar either except in a very subtle way. So really the overall movie is quite subtle and slow, with some action and an intelligent plot. If that's your type of thing.I really enjoyed this movie. I have seen it several times now and it gets better and better, which is a good sign. I have no specific liking of Shyamalan films (I liked Sixth Sense, but not Signs) but despite this, this is a great telling of a standard story but from a different perspective. Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson are fabulous in the movie, and very well directed. The only acting complaint I have relates to Bruce Willis's son who just spoils some scenes, whether it be through poor acting or direction. The plot is reasonably clever, perhaps a little laboured, but I guess this is necessary for the average cinema audience. The film also has an original feel to it. Also the music which remains suitably in the background for some of the film comes to the fore as a great theme when relevant. 5/5",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Carefully Crafted and Beautifully Executed,"""Unbreakable"" is special. I went into this film without knowing anything about it, and left awestruck. The story is grounded in a way that I haven't seen in many movies in this genre. The pace is slow, and the climax is small, but that is its strength. ""Unbreakable"" is not meant to be an over-the-top superhero action film; it is a simple origin story for both David Dunn and Mr. Glass.I could watch the film a dozen times and pick up something new with the cinematography. Every camera movement has purpose, just like a frame in a comic book. Simply put, this film is carefully crafted and beautifully executed.There is so much to admire about this movie, but the lasting impression is the finale. I love when a movie has a reveal and I have the conflicting response of ""How did I not see that coming?"" and ""That was brilliant and unexpected.""Best Character: Mr. Glass

Unbreakable is .. unforgettable,"Astonishing that anyone would give this less than a 10! In 2000 Hollywood was not completely sure what to make of M. Night Shyamalan so they threw a lot of cash at him and stood back to see what would happen? (They tried the same strategy with AIRBENDER and got a very different result). In this case, the slot machine cranked out coins. Not only a great film but possibly one of the top 100 of all time. The story is iconic, action-packed, mysterious, subtle, interwoven, symbolic -- basically he hit every base but romantic comedy. That, deep within the workings of the script, there was a hint, a soupçon, that comics (er, graphic novels, sorry, my bad) might have a grain of truth, merely added another few million viewers to the already-long lineups, as one fanboy told another told another. Moves along brilliantly, both engages and challenges the viewer. Willis is great (as always -- WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF CASTING A MIDDLE AGED BALD GUY IN THIS ROLE? WOW!) and M.

Lethargic Pace Drags Down This Film,"""Unbreakable"" stars Bruce Willis as David Dunn, a listless, pessimistic security guard whose marriage is on the skids. He is riding a train when it goes off the tracks and all passengers are killed except him. Soon after, he finds an anonymous note on his windshield asking him how often he is sick. This leads him to Elijah Price, a comic book art dealer who proposes an incredible hypothesis that changes David's life.The film has a lethargic pace and a subdued, quiet tone. Just like the main character. I kept waiting for the film to break out of its somnambulistic pace, but that never happens. There are revelations and dramatic moments, but ""Unbreakable"" never breaks out of its contemplative tone.It also never ties up numerous loose ends that were obviously written with the intention of linking characters and plot points. Notes in IMDb report that director M. Knight Shyamalan wrote a much longer script that might have been presented as a trilogy. The ending might as well have included the message ""To be continued...""The story has supernatural elements, as might be expected for Shyamalan and, in parts, feels like a graphic novel adapted to film. If sequels are not coming, perhaps someone might consider a television series. Otherwise, the film's ending is a disappointment.

The only problem that this movie has similar to ''The Sixth Sense'' is the slow moving pace of the movie which makes it seem a bit long but unlike ''The Sixth Sense'' its made enjoyable by some clever humour and a very well done story with some amazing twist and turns. The only other problem with the movie is that more could have happened after the ending but that's what sequels are for and I look forward to seeing one for this movie if its made.,,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Not bad, but needs more","OK, so this is a nice idea (though slightly juvenile): there's a few supernatural heroes in the world and some of them just don't know it. But once David Dunn discovers that he might be a little ""special"" I would have liked for him to have done more with it. Now I'm not expecting this to turn into a Superman movie part way through, but I would have liked to have seen a few heroic acts or, perhaps, a thrilling rescue (over and above what we do see) added to the mix. Lifting weights in the basement followed by one night out with our new-found hero just doesn't cut it. Apart from that, this is quite an entertaining story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbreakable - Review,"This is a movie that I enjoyed the first time I saw but with each viewing my love for it started to grow, and now is one of my all time favorite movies. Nowadays more and more people whenever someone asks them what is their favorite M. Night film, they either respond with The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable and this shouldn't be surprising, this is truly one of his greatest works, the directing is amazing and the cinematography is just gorgeous, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, both delivered excellent performances and they're characters were very interesting, specially Jackson's character, Mr. Glass, also, James Newton Howard's score for this film is in my opinion the best work he has ever done, specially the Orange Man cue. The story of this movie is also really good, it tells a very human and realistic story of a man who has powers, this is not your average super hero story, this is in every way very different and very unconventional. Unbreakable is a movie that deserves more attention and it seems like is finally getting it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An un-super superhero.,"I gave credit to M. Night for trying to tinker with the comic book movie formula and trying to give some more credence to the sub-genre. Howver, in his attempt to mature the film, he has stripped away most all the things that make people like comics.After a train wreck, a single man (Bruce Willis) walks away, not only alive but completely unharmed. He is tracked down a mysterious man (Sam Jackson) with a fetish for comics. It seems the mystery man believes he is a superhero, indestructible. How does a man believe the impossible in a world that is so monotonously real?The film suffers from the outset. What is the most boring part of a superhero movie? The origin; that's the part we all have to put up with before we can finally see the hero doing super things. Most superhero films cover that part of the story in the first half-hour or so and then movie onto the good stuff. Now imagine an entire film of origin, a film that ends just when it should be getting started.This issue is exacerbated by M. Night's employment of uber dark and dreary settings and locations and the horrendously slow pace of the film.Story wise the film doesn't fare much better. We all know he is indestructible, we want to watch him act indestructible, but instead we are forced to sit through 2 hours of him trying to figure this out. Which brings up the subject of plot holes; you want me to believe that he has never been sick, had a cut or broken a bone and he has NEVER taken notice of this. He's a middle aged man for god's sake! Oh, but he has noticed that he has some kind of strange ESP that lets him see what people are doing wrong. Curious...The acting is alright for the most part, but Willis' character is written to be kind of stupid and there is no way to play an slight moron intelligently. Jackson fares better as the creepy comic geek that may have read one issue to many.I again pass credit for trying to do something different with something familiar, but this just wasn't the right thing to do.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbreakable proves you do not need flashy effects to produce a compelling superhero story.,"Shyamalan has had a rough career, with most (including myself) believing he has progressively got worse as a director. He has somewhat got back on track with newer releases but there is no denying that his earlier work was masterful. Unbreakable follows David Dunn, an average father and security guard, who miraculously survived the derailing of a train. Soon after a confrontation with a mysterious individual makes him question whether or not he might have special abilities. What is genius about this story is how intelligent and mature it is. It's not just ""oh, I'm invincible...I'm going to save the world!"". No no no, it's much more grounded than that. The majority of the plot is an origin story, David discovering his ability and investigating past accidents that he was in. We as the audience are mystified, much like David, so anything that he unravels is as much a revelation to us as it is to him. I really admired that approach, it made the story utterly compelling. It raises the question that if you did have such abilities, should you utilise them for the greater good? It deconstructs every motive that your typical superhero has and adds more human characteristics. Shyamalan was great at directing this thriller (let's face it, it's his genre of expertise) with plenty of inventive camera shots, particularly a scene involving some curtains blowing in the wind as we look into the room. Samuel L Jackson was fantastic and added some sympathetic depth towards his character. Bruce Willis was good although struggled with the more emotionally involved scenes. The child actor...sorry but no, wasn't good. The famous Shyamalan plot ""twist"" was something I should've predicted, but dammit I fell for it again! Brilliantly executed. A shame that the ending was too abrupt in my opinion. Also David's poor family life really did not affect him as a character. However, Unbreakable is one of the most compelling grounded superhero films out there. One of Shyamalan's best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Soooo slow, but intriguing","I'm mixed about this movie. First of all, the tempo of the film is very slow and Bruce Willis acts through the whole film like he's hungover or something. On the flipside, Samuel Jackson was good as always, and the direction was very cool.  I liked how shots were framed in mirrors, reflections in glass, between train seats, etc. That stuff was cool to watch. And speaking of watch, I looked at mine a lot during this movie. It took until the ""orange suit man"" scene to wake myself up. By then, the movie had 15 minutes left out of 2+ hours! And I guessed the ending, too (bummer, since Sixth Sense floored me). So, all in all, I gave it a 6 just for the direction and basic concept alone.  Just be prepared to wait over an hour for everything to come together.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbeatable Unbreakable,"A brilliantly built film slowly developing a superhero in the real world. It's not often that a film about superheroes has very little action, but Shyamalan perfectly creates Willis' persona so that the little action on screen justifies and compliments the entire build up.Acting is faultless, Willis and Jackson being the best possible choices for casting, and there are no weak links in the supporting cast. Use of colour and tracking shots are used superbly and audio suits the scenes as well. Typical of the director, the ending holds that all important twist enhancing everything that came before it, although text at the end of a film stating the next stages of the story never land quite right.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

One big yawn,"Am I too picky, or perhaps too quick to figure out plot twists?  This movie was BORING!  The only thing that kept me remotely interested was the fact that it was shot in Philly, on and around the U. of Penn campus, where my son goes to school, so it was fun to spot campus and city sites.  Other than that, the plot became painfully obvious within about a half hour.  The acting was pure "" Bruce Willis has problem marriage, Bruce seeks to find himself, Bruce has revelation. "" There were long and dead-end sequences and scenes that dragged on for no apparent reason, weird camera angles that did nothing to add to the drama, and a most unsatisfying ending that said to me,"" The director is tired and out of ideas, so here is how it ends. Now go home. ""  The extras in the film  ( and they are all over the place ) practically screamed, "" We're EXTRAS! Watch us see ourselves on-camera!"" The kid was a slightly older version of Haley Joel Osment's Sixth Sense character --- another screwed-up little boy who I found myself not caring a whit about. Robin Wright was the only actor who tried to do something with her meager role.  I thought The Sixth Sense was easy to figure out, but this one is even more simplistic.  I'm only glad I saw it in the afternoon, when it was half-price to get in, instead of spending real money on this yawner.

Lately all he does is bore me with the same-old same-old same-old same-old....",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Individuality and masculinity as subject matter,"As a literal superhero origin movie, I have to say, I was bored, mostly because of Bruce Willis performance, but also because his character was a bit too passive for a bit too long.But the human drama presented with the protagonist is actually really deep and interesting. I found things similar to ""The Incredibles"". Bruce Willis' character forgot about his dreams for love. And he regretted it since. He choose ""family"" over the individual. He choose family over his own goals and he was dissatisfied with it, which made him unhappy to the point of almost provoking his divorce, the very thing he sacrificed for in the first place.That's basically the metaphor I see, as a man unhappy by the fact that he let go what made him ""a mainly man"" (the use of his god given abilities, including physical strength) for a more complacent life that looked great when he was projecting his life as a younger man, but with time the power concession in favor of his wife in pursuit of the family unit (the symbolic reason to suppress his abilities, an emasculation), to his terrible boss in a terrible job (wasting potential taking abuse in exchange of economical security, another sacrifice for his family), and with his son (that thinks he's a coward for not using his powers, when in reality it is a sacrifice that the kid doesn't understand yet) made him so unhappy, he lost his will, similar to Mr. Incredible from the Incredibles.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"smart, moody, doomed to under-appreciation","I hope I'm wrong about the under-appreciation. But it seems that a cross-genre movie like this one is likely to leave a lot of people feeling unsatisfied. The two genres are drama (melodrama?) and superhero. It isn't clear for most of the movie just how much of a role each genre plays in this film. It's much more of an adult drama than a superhero movie, so comic book fans may feel bored and under-stimulated. And yet, the superhero aspect is ultimately so important that less fantasy-minded viewers may have trouble suspending their disbelief. This film is made for people who, on the one hand, believe in the importance of pop culture and the reflective importance of the sort of media that the literati may conventionally think of as ""low art"": comics, music videos, science-fiction stories...and, on the other hand, the same people must be in touch with the difficulties of a real life, a life where any fantastic or possibly fantastic elements are typically eclipsed by harsh realities: disease, serious injury, divorce, and the regret of having made a very wrong and very important decision many years ago.Despite a few painfully obvious flaws (the titles at the beginning and the end being the worst), this film is a beautiful work, an engaging story that floats on a fine mixture of sadness and bittersweet hope.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Solid, Fun, But Lacking","You know, I had heard so much about this film, a couple of years ago, I was excited to finally watch it. I didn't remember loving it, when I finally did see it, but I remembered thinking it was just fine, for the most part. Well-made. Interesting. Engaging.For Christmas, I bought my mother the film on DVD, because she adored ""Split"" (as did I, mostly). We just watched the film today, and we both enjoyed it, but I think we both agreed that even though the filmmaking was very, VERY solid, the ending is immensely unsatisfying, due to the lack of a real climax. Many people, I believe, try to argue that the lack of a real, more mainstream climax is due to the arthouse-y vibe ""Unbreakable"" carries throughout its runtime; meaning that it's supposed to be more unique than other superhero films. I understand that argument, but I do not agree with it making the film more special. That's like arguing that the sequel trilogy in the ""Star Wars"" franchise is exceptional because it has Kylo Ren's crossguard lightsaber, which we hadn't seen in any of the films up until ""The Force Awakens"" was released. It's an odd argument for uniqueness.The cinematography and score are exceptional, here. Very impactful.The writing, in total-dialogue, scenes, showing-instead-of-telling-is wonderfully unique, and really gets a thumbs-up from me, outside of its lacking finale. There's some quality work put into every angle of this film. Again: that random twist in the finale is good, but to just end it immediately after the reveal is lame, and I think it ruins the tone of the whole flick, overall. I'm not much into fan fiction, but I can't help but to wonder what I myself could've done to make a more profound, impactful ending. I have a few ideas, frankly, but I won't give them here, because I don't discuss spoilers, in my reviews.The performances from everyone-even Willis, whom seems like he could care less, nowadays, no matter what he's a part of-are exceptional, too, even though I think some things are a little too much for me, when it comes to Sam Jackson's character, whose bones break easily, due to a disease he was born with. The opening to the film, revolving around his birth, is truly horrifying, even for someone like myself, who's not a parent, at the moment. I also would like to give a special mention to the young man who played Willis' son, in the flick. That kid can act, and I'm very excited to see him again in ""Glass"", which my mother and I plan to see, tomorrow evening.Say what you will about Shyamalan and his career's more up-and-drastically-down bumps, but the man KNOWS how to tell a story, most of the time-no matter how unsatisfying it can potentially end-up being.I'm glad I had the chance to see this again before the newest film. It's a fun watch, and I'd recommend it to you, if you haven't seen it, due to the uniqueness it has, but don't rush into this, excited about the many things you've heard, or it will probably be more than guaranteed to disappoint you. At least, that's how I've felt after seeing it both times, with so many years apart for myself to grow, in my love for movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"For the first time, my hat comes off to Shyamalan","I can't be claimed to be a fan of M. Night Shyamalan. Not by any stretch of the imagination. I've only watched one of his films(Signs), but what I hear about the others doesn't particularly help my view. But I must admit, this film did keep my interest throughout. The version I watched had been edited for content, and was about an hour and a half, not the two hours or so that IMDb lists. My interest in this stems solely from my being a long-time fan of comic books, and the media of them. That was the only reason I gave this a chance. I am not disappointed. Be aware that you shouldn't expect a comic book film... or an action piece based on comics. This is still M. Night, and from what I understand, his work is about the build-up, the atmosphere, and the twist in the end. On that, I can't help but be impressed, in fact by all three. The film has something of an undertone of comic books, without ever losing seriousness, as so often happens when the silver screen has such projected onto it. M. achieves that masterfully. Lighting, cinematography, editing, all top-notch. The acting hardly possesses any flaws. The writing is solid, though a few scenes and lines came off silly. The ambiguity and depth herein is commendable. The humor is a fitting dry wit. The film is disturbing at times. The references to both comics and comic book films are great. The twist, I found to be breathtaking. I won't claim that I got everything about this movie, but I was definitely intrigued. Pacing is deliberate.

The Super Sixth Sense,"Although ""Unbreakable"" is essentially writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's prior film ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) remade as a superhero movie, it does integrate the world of comic books into what was an effective formula in the first place. Once again, there's a young boy who believes in something that Bruce Willis is partly oblivious to. Again, that boy cries over the secret in a revelatory moment with a parent. Again, Willis's character has marital problems, and the picture is crammed with pregnant pauses--mostly of Willis looking away wistfully, as though that's his idea of acting in something other than a ""Die Hard"" sequel or retread. This time, however, Willis has the sixth sense--plus, he's unbreakable, and Samuel L. Jackson substitutes in the way of an adviser to the person with supernatural powers. I also like the obligatory (in a Shyamalan movie, that is) twist ending even though it's humorously abrupt, which is incongruent with the otherwise somber treatment and subject matter.Appropriately, Jackson's character invests in comic books instead of the prior picture's psychobabble, too. They inspire him to seek out a real superhero. For the most part, ""Unbreakable"" is filmed in an identical manner of realistic supernaturalism as in ""The Sixth Sense"" and quite apart from Shyamalan's more Hollywood, off-the-assembly-line products that comprise his subsequent oeuvre. But, there are flashes--like the hero's sixth-sense visions of others' misdeeds in the story--of comic-book-like imagery, although this is mostly reserved for the superheroic stuff. ""Unbreakable"" also benefits today as a contrast to the explosion since its release of big-budget and doggedly light and unrealistic action-packed superhero fare from the MCU and elsewhere. In that sense, it comes across as both familiar and refreshing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"""I'm putting together a team. . .""","Unbreakable (2000) -I do like this film, but there are some plot holes that seem a bit gaping.For example, it's a stretch to believe that Bruce's character doesn't remember being sick at some point. Surely he'd need to have actually been sick to notice that he hasn't been. For instance, I haven't had a cold for ages, so when I got one last year, it was hard to remember the last time I'd had one before that, but I knew what it was like to have one.You can't miss something that you've never had. If I'd never had a cold before the symptoms would be quite a shock to me.On top of that he must surely remember that he didn't actually hurt himself in the car crash? It would have been a pivotal choice for him?Also, if he's got super strong bones, wouldn't he also have hair that didn't recede? I'm not good at Human anatomy, Etc, but. . . ?Other than that, it's a really good film. It's full of interest and played well. Bruce's exploration of his ""Abilities"" is not a ridged origin story like those of other, ""superhero"" films, but a steadily paced awakening that seems more based in our own world.If you were to realise that you were super strong or to turn invisible or that you could fly, it would take you some time to come to terms with it and decide how you would act upon it.I love Bruce in almost every film he's done and even Samuel L, who occasionally gets on my nerves, because he's in everything and doesn't vary his characters very much, was very good in this role.I don't think that I truly appreciated this film properly the first time that I saw it. For years I've been believing that Samuel L was after Bruce to try and correct his own issues, by experimenting on his strength to find a cure for his weaknesses, but on the second viewing I realised that's not the case and there's actually much more to it. I really like it and I think that it will live in my brain a bit more now and as a positive experience that I can reference in future for it's unique story.754.15/1000.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Being a man.,"I've watched this film several times, and I thought now of reviewing it after having recently viewed it again.David is a man with extraordinary physical powers. He doesn't get sick, doesn't get injured, but he has a broken family.An accident in his childhood revealed in him a weakness, another one in his youth made him decide to suppress his powers, and a third one started a chain of events that would see him become the man he is supposed to be, and to be a better man for his family and the people around him.Among those events enters Elijah, a character who is fascinated by the history of superheroes and supervillains, and by the original truths that may lie hidden behind the comic industry.And thus he recognises in David a man with extraordinary abilities, after having seen him to be the sole survivor of a terrible train wreck, as he was completely unharmed.He follows him and guides him every step of the way, along the steady pace of the movie and its touchingly atmospheric musical score.The film even begins by introducing Elijah to us, whose weakness is his body, at the complete opposite of David.Little by little, David rediscovers his powers and starts to reconnect with his wife and son.And finally, when he transforms completely into his own, he finds out the terrible truth...",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not As Good As People Think.,"Ever wonder what a super hero movie would be like if they lost all the real fancy powers and costumes? If it were real people living real ordinary lives with zero flash? Unbreakable asks this questions to the viewers.The film is incredibly well shot and shows patience. I really enjoyed Shyamalan using alternate ways to show basic conversations. Like at the beginning when Willis is talking to the sports agent and we never leave the seats in front of them, or when we are with the second survivor before he dies the whole time Willis is talking to the doctor. These little things break the ordinary mold of a simple conversation and adds some interesting elements to keep our attention.Shyamalan, who also writes the films he directs, shows us that he's a talented guy. He knows what stories to craft and how to tell them, sometimes they are a hit, sometimes they are a miss. Then you have his big misses, but I give the guy credit for trying something different each time. From ghosts, to aliens and unknown forces. Kudos to the guy for trying to dive into different genres.Unbreakable is never thrilling, nor edge of your seat entertainment, it's never meant to be either. There are some intense moments though, specifically when his son thinks shooting him will prove he's a superhero. Well written, directed and acted on everyone's part.I liked the film, but felt it lacked to really grab me. It just seemed to be a well done film and nothing more, nothing to want me to explore this world or the people in it. It has a lot going for it too, the cast is great, the writing is superb and it has layers that the viewers peels away at, to get to that ultimate reveal. Yet at the same time, I was never blown away by anything. Not once did I think to myself, ""Wow, this is such a great film"".I know this film has many lovers, and I'm not bashing it, I'm just saying that yes it is good, but not a masterpiece, nor his best work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
NIGHT FALLS,"Uh...let's see. Now I'm sure I saw this before...Bruce Willis...M. Night...a kid..hold on, now...lemme think...oh yeah...This sequel to ""Sixth Sense"" should be renamed ""No Sense"". Completely devoid of anything that could be reasonably termed a ""plot"", Night starts us down the road to nowhere about 14 different ways and then leaves us without any payoff. And the ""surprise"" ending ain't no surprise, either. It's what your 8th grade English teacher used to call a ""deus ex machina"". For those of you who don't remember your elemental Latin...it basically means that the author doesn't have any rational way to end his story, so, instead, everybody gets run over by a big monster truck. The end.And this movie moves slower than ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Never thought I'd live to see it happen. For a reasonable facsimile of the pace of this movie, I suggest putting glue in a bottle of Heinz ketchup, allowing it to sit and emuslfiy for 4 or 5 days, and then attempting to pour it over soggy french fries. Trust me. It'll be more entertaining than the movie.On the plus side (and I'm really diggin' here, guys) there's some nice moody cinematography. And Bruce decided to forego the hairpiece for a change. That's almost worth the price of admission.As for my pal, M. Night, here's a suggestion--try directing one that you DIDN'T write. That's why they have writers. They write stuff. Sometimes it's good stuff. No need to wear all those hats. Go out and buy some of their stuff next time. They need money, too. And maybe another actor, just for fun. I mean, this ain't exactly a nascent Scorcese-De Niro relationship, Sparky. Let's can it while the going's still good.To the vast numbers of you who loved this film...and I know who you are... I got some old ""Green Lantern"" and ""Flash"" comics for sale on Ebay.

I can't believe so many people disliked it!!,"This movie is cool. I thought after the Sixth Sense, M Night was going to have a tough time coming up with a follow up movie. It's unfair to compare the two movies so closely, considering they aren't really alike, but I think this has to be one of the most original ideas for a movie I've ever seen. It certainly is a brave one. That's why I find it hard to believe that so many people are trashing it.This movie is probably a little slow compared to most Hollywood movies nowadays, but it is NOT a slow movie! Anyone who has seen any independent or foreign films might find it fast-paced! It carries pretty much the same pace as the Sixth Sense, except without the occasional scares.And the plot is not hard to follow or far-fetched at all. How basic must it be for people to understand it? It's a pretty basic concept, but I must admit that people who have read a comic or two in their lives would probably appreciate it more. Still, I thought this was a great movie with an intelligent premise. Shyamalan is a genius for coming up with such great ideas. I can't wait to see what he has in store next.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Intriguing Premise But Utlimately A Hollow Shell,"The premise behind 'Unbreakable' is intriguing and competently executed. But ultimately the film feels like watching a one trick pony over and over again. As original as others seem to find this film, it is just another exploration of the mythic hero's journey. And the journey is dull.The acting is as strong as we would come to expect from Willis, Jackson, and Wright. The plot has an interesting premise that attempts to bring the supernatural into a context of concrete reality. And there are a few nicely conceived plot twists including the ending (no real surprise in the end though). But the movie takes so long to get where it's going that it ultimately felt hollow. Ever bite into a chocolate Easter bunny only to find that it's merely a shell? If you are a relatively sophisticated movie consumer M. Shyamalan provides you with the entire content of the movie in the first 30 minutes and then takes nearly another hour-and-a-half revealing a conclusion we already understand. 'Unbreakable' is suffocatingly tedious. We understand Bruce Willis' character is special and Shyamalan uses some effective plot devices to highlight the point such as inferring that Willis has never been ill. Great, but it felt like Shyamlan took another 20 minutes to support it.I read a review that stated, 'Every scene in this movie is darkly silent and eerie.' The movie has the seem feel as 'The Sixth Sense.' Yet I don't feel that the technique was used to good effect here. It attempts to add weight to Willis' growing acceptance the he maybe an extraordinary human but does nothing to further the plot development. All it really does is slow the film down, attempting to milk emotion from the viewer. Every bit of dialog hangs like the breath of a dying man.Watching 'Unbreakable' is akin to slowly peeling back the layers of an onion until you reach the core. Unfortunately it's a tedious process, every layer is the same (as well as the core,) and you can't help but crying even without a lack of emotion. If you enjoyed 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Signs' you may enjoy this movie as well. But I'm increasingly finding M. Shyamalan's efforts nothing more than polished emptiness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A thinking man's movie,Those movie fans who did not grow up reading comics or who require at least 10 dead mutilated bodies per minute will find this movie slow moving and incomprehensible. As for me I reveled in it. I have read stacks of comics and understand the battle of Ying and Yang going on daily as it has been revealed to me through this wonderful medium. In the tradition of a good comic and with a subtle touch M Night Shyamalan brings us a story of the reluctant hero slowly emerging into a very scary reality. He has hid from that reality his whole life. Samual L. Jackson is superb in his role as the Arch Villain trying to find meaning for his life. Hollywood has finally picked up the Super Hero/Super Villain golden egg. Which one of us has not dreamed of having super powers. Unbreakable is part of this emerging gendra of film and a novel one at that. The explosion of Super Hero movies has just begun.,8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyable but could be way better,"Getting at times lost without being able to fully understand the story isn't something I particularly enjoy, and I've found myself lost during the movie. Now that I've seen it I understand it was perhaps the director's intention to make the audience watch the movie a couple of times in order to fully enjoy it... They could have invented a better explanation to why the main character is unbreakable and explored it sooner. The end feels rushed but there are no significant loose ends. It is a movie that one can enjoy watching but not particularly remarkable in any way. That is why I gave it a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Great movie.,"Shyamalan clearly has a gift.  It's not that he can see dead people.  It's not that he is seemingly 'unbreakable'.  It is, however, a fantastic writing ability.  'The Sixth Sense' was indeed a great movie and contained possibly the greatest over the last ten years.  However 'Unbreakable', which is described as it's sequel, has an equally excellent ending.  Without giving too much away, it simply leaves you open mouthed and shell shocked (the words ""no way!"" will probably seep into your mind.There are several similarities between the two.  The soundtrack, camera techniques, even the slow moving Bruce Willis, are almost exact in both of them, which is by no means, a criticism.  Samuel L Jackson is purely marvelous as 'Mr Glass' and provides a perfect backdrop to Bruce Willis' soul searching character, with his 'expertise' role.  I found that both actors relate so perfectly on screen, the idea of a sequel has now become a 'must'.The one problem with this film is that the ending left me amazed by the twist, but I expected something more.  I sat throughout the movie searching desperately for a clue to what the finale might hold and yet a found very little.  However having heard and seen the twist I was disappointed to see the film end so suddenly.  The chance for a sequel has been left wide open due to the fact that the film doesn't really finish!  Basically, the twist is revealed and the film ends.  I was expecting something like in the Sixth Sense, life after the twist.Despite this the film is well worth watching, with breath taking performances from both Willis and Jackson, although personally...Jackson gets the nod everytime as the better.  8/10.  Not all I hoped it would be, but worth waiting for.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Eh. It's alright,"It took a long time but I have finally managed to watch ""Unbreakable"", and I'm left rather underwhelmed.The film takes the normal superhero cliche film and puts it on a much smaller scale. A man who cannot be harmed and a man who can very easily be harmed.The story itself can be wrapped up in 30 minutes or less, but it just drags and drags on and on. Once it finished, I was left thinking... ""What that it?"".It's an okay film, and Samuel L Jackson puts in another funny performance, having the funniest scene when in the Comic Book shop.Now the director, M. Night Shyamalan. I'm just not into his style. After watching ""Knock At The Cabin"", I got frustrated with the constant super close ups. Now he overused making every other scene look like it was a CCTV camera, its so bad and tedius.As I said earlier, the overall film is okay, but I was left underwhelmed thinking ""is that it"" once it finished.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Really though, whats the point?","Watching it for the first time today in 2021. The initial premise was cool....lone survivor on a train wreck without a scratch. Having fancy cameras and A-list actors with a flimsy script is not a movie! Movies need stories and stories need substance! Wheres the calamity? Wheres the purpose and direction? Not every superhero movie needs to be some massive production with explosions but there does need to be an arch. This movie lacks purpose. Sure, towards the ending the plot picks up, but it took a very boring, uninspiring, lackluster route to get there. This could have been an episode in Black Mirror and maybe it would be have been decent, but as a full-length film it proves that style-over-substance is a horrible approach making movies.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

UNBREAKABLE: MY REVIEW,"It is not a superhero origin story. Well, it kind of is, but it is not as simple as that. This is a well-crafted drama about a man going through a mid-life crisis. David Dunn is a security guard who works whatever jobs he can find. He has a son with his high school/college sweetheart and later wife, Audrey. Audrey and David are going through a tough time and it seems like the marriage is about to fall apart, much to the disappointment of their son.Seems pretty straightforward, yes? Actually, no. We don't find out any of this until about half an hour in. We open with David on a train, returning from yet another failed job hunting expedition. He tries to flirt unsuccessfully with a sports agent, discreetly removing his wedding ring before initiating contact.
The train meets an accident, and only David has survived. Audrey, played with great sensitivity and tenderness by Robin Wright, tries to meet David halfway at the chance to restore their marriage and hopefully, the faded romance. It is a beautiful story in itself.Enter Elijah Price, a cool, brilliant comic book historian and collector, who is intrigued by David's story, and tries to encourage him to explore his powers. Turns out, Price suffers from a rare disease which results in extreme fragility of his skeletal structure. He believes that Dunn and he are on the opposite ends of the spectrum, him being acutely delicate and Dunn being unbreakable.In spite of dismissing Price's theories as fantastical and telling his son that he's just an ordinary man, David gradually starts honing his special skills, asking his son to promise not to tell Audrey.I would stop here for the enjoyment of the movie is in experiencing it. It was apparently not well received when it came out in 2000. Shyamalan was ahead of the superhero boom by a decade, but it's not just that. This movie is not a conventional superhero movie even by today's standards. Shyamalan has weaved a poignant family drama into a superhero/supervillain origin story, that is unconventional up to the end. There is no exploding, blockbuster heroics. There is rich characterization and examination of ordinary lives of people, among them two who have extraordinary abilities.I cannot not marvel at Shyamalan's ablity to create mood appropriate to the context. This is independent moviemaking at its finest. The director to serve his story utilizes the presence of two blockbuster stars in Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, and the equally talented Robin Wright.THOUGHT AND OTHER STUFF:Damn Elijah Price is a cold customer. His intelligence and thinly-disguised contempt at the rest of the world is cleverly portrayed by Jackson.Bruce Willis, in his everyman hero role once again before going through a lean phase in the 2000s. I haven't seen The Assassination of a High School President, otherwise he had no good movies except Sin City in 2005 and Die Hard 4 in 2007. The Willissance would have to wait till Red (2010).Robin Wright, such a performer. I can't believe Hollywood didn't fully utilize her talent until House of Cards came by.Intense movie.

The most subtle superhero movie ever,"It's hard to believe that 'superhero' movies ever existed before Marvel's 'shared universe,' but, before bunches of superpowered heroes flew around New York throwing nukes at alien armies, was 'Unbreakable.' To use modern day terminology, it could be best described as an 'origin movie.'However, instead of this origin movie explaining an existing superhero's beginnings, M. Night Shyamalan (back in the year 2000 when every one of his films was Box Office gold) brings us an original take on a person with extra special powers. Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, by all accounts an ordinary man who gets caught up in a train crash which kills everyone on board apart from him. This would be weird enough, but then he's immediately contacted by Elijah Price (the ever-awesome Samuel L Jackson) who claims that David is possessed with the ability never to get hurt by anything.Now, if you're so used to superhero movies where it's wall-to-wall computer-generated action then you're probably not going to enjoy this. It's the very definition of a 'slow burner.' In fact (and I hope that this doesn't come as a 'spoiler') there isn't a single shoot-out, car chase or ensemble cast of superheroes coming to the aid of our protagonist. What you have here is a very 'grounded' take on a person who discovers that they aren't quite as normal as they first thought they were.Samuel L Jackson is always good in whatever he does and whereas Bruce Willis' career is more 'hit and miss,' this is a time when the sheer chemistry between them shines through and both are a joy to watch.I enjoyed it at the time and, in these days of over-the-top Marvel movies, I still think it deserves its place up there with the best superhero movies, even if this is so low key' you may be pressed to put it into that genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A film you can't look away from or you'll miss something,"I'm not a Bruce fan but I liked the 6th Sense. I mean, it was an interesting twist on what is essentially psychic ability. I'm a psychic so films like that attract me. Unbreakable is, in my mind, also about psychic ability more than any true Marvel hero. The original meaning of Empath is High Clairvoyant or one who experiences the emotions of another by physical touching (today the term empath is repurposed by the mental health industry to define highly emotional/sensitive persons but two very different animals). A true Empath literally experiences the sensations of the person they are 'reading' and, thus, know what they experienced in detail. In ancient times, every Pope and King had their own Empath to read the energy surrounding their principal and they could warn them of what was coming. Many films and fantasy films especially, are based on this without realizing Empaths are very real. Today, they are normally found isolating to avoid the clamor of the chaotic overpopulated world. In this film, Bruce is the epitome of a true Empath except the un-killable aspect. Overall, the film was captivating and well-constructed, I thought; the kind you have to really study to keep up with all the little nuances. It does seem dated now, especially the camera-work, which probably was State of the Art in it's time. I found Jackson's character to be very well-done. A lot of the emotion and lines in the end were very moving and can be applied to any life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Another great movie from M. Night,"I do not want to say much, other than to go and see the movie.  I think the style of M. Night is great, he emphasizes everything he does with precision.

Really good movie.,"Unbreakable had a hard act to follow on from the Sixth Sense for M.Night, but i believe he has succeeded in making a superior movie. The movie was far more developed than 6th sense was. While the movie runs at quite a leisurely pace it still holds the viewers attention for the duration of the film. Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson were great in the leads from opposite sides of the spectrum and they received good support from Robin Wright Penn, and the kid from Gladiator was also good. Through the film M. Night uses great camera angles and shots for different scenes ie. Willis and the woman on the train. M.Night also does not treat the audience like idiots and actually tells the story as though his audience is not made up of bungling idiots who need everything explained in detail, this makes a refreshing change for the audience(well it did for me anyway). In fact i would go as far as to say it is one of the most original films i have ever seen. Before i finish special mention must be made of the score. It is one of the best of recent memory and comes into its own in the last half hour. In closing i heartily recommend Unbreakable to almost everybody as it has a great story and is very well made, although i got the feeling when i saw it a lot of the audience disagreed with my opinion. If or when the movie is viewed one should not expect another 6th Sense... expect a totally different movie going experience. Are you ready for the truth?",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

His 2nd Best Movie,"So continuing Shyamalan month we will now review what many consider his ""2nd best movie"" Unbreakable. And I would have to agree on that, even though there are some strange aspects. But we will go over that later on.One thing to keep in mind is that this isn't a very fast moving film, it very slowly paced. But I honestly like a super hero based story line that can run a little slower than most of the action films of that time. Also I think the pace helps create a mysterious atmosphere. Also this is one of the few Shyamalan movies where I actually enjoyed the twist ending. I won't spoil it, but I think its very fitting.There are some weird things about the movies. There was the whole unnecessary M Night Shyamalan cameo, some of the acting was kinda lame, and the pace at times did feel a bit to slow. Also there were a few continuity errors I noticed through out the story. Probably the thing that bugged me the most was that there was some of that pretentious Shyamalan dialogue about ""everything has a purpose"" and what not. But those are really the only big problems I have.Even though it is very flawed, I think Unbreakble is still a movie you should see for its atmosphere and mystery, and it is incredibly engrossing even with these flawsFinal Score:7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
No need to edit this film when it hits the t.v.,"Everyone has rightfully praised M. Night Shyamalan for quite simply a brilliant and original story.  No arguments here.  I think it should also be said that the man should be given extra points for not once using a curse word in the film (aside from a ""goddammit"" from Bruce Willis).  It was like watching a film from the forties.  Shyamalan has revived the lost art of writing dialogue for characters and allowing them to experience the entire spectrum of human emotions without shouting out gratuitous obscenities. He's like the Seinfeld of filmmakers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not a Superhero Movie,"I saw this movie because I wanted to see Split. I knew it was part of a trilogy and it is a Holiday in Portugal so it was the plan for the afternoon.The movie surprised me with the comic book references, but in the end I do think that it is not a superhero movie.It is a movie about a man, David, that is not sure about what to do with is life. He is married and in a train, coming home. A woman sits next to him and he takes is ring off. This is human. He's having troubles in his marriage and sees a beatiful woman. Humans like company and like to socialize. Soon, the train crashes and everybody dies except David.
So deep down we can all take a lesson from this movie. If we are not happy with our lifes, can we do something to change it? Can we help another human being? Can we give our relationship another shot? Afterall maybe if we feel good with ourselves, maybe we can can be happy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Another great movie from a great director, but the ending lacks something...","May I start out by saying, to tell you the truth, this was not the movie I was planning to see yesterday.  But with ""The Grinch"" had sold out before we could get there, and this was the only movie that was interesting enough to see.  I was in for a surprise, because I did not expect what I was going to see, and the result was amazing!Warning: You will be very tempted to talk about this movie for days after, so you must ask people you talk to if they want the movie spoiled for them!!!  Also, do not go to any message boards talking about this movie...chances are, there will be some people who will ruin the fun for all of us and blatantly give the ending/role of the characters away.M. Night Shyamalan, which is known for his first feature film ""The Sixth Sense"", comes out with another suspense/thriller movie that leaves you on the edge of your seat and not one part of the movie is boring!  Mr. Shyamalan has displayed some of the most beautiful, yet disturbing type of directorial style that I have ever seen, excluding ""The Sixth Sense""...let's face it, he is a genius.  Anyways, everybody knows that Bruce Willis is the only survivor of a ""sole survivor"" train wreck, and he is not injured, but that's only a small part of the movie.  But before that, even, it leads you into the movie with a few sentences that appear on the screen talking about comic books.  This is a vital part of the movie, but I will not spoil anything about it.  Samuel L. Jackson also gives a splendid display of acting as a man who is pretty frail and has been hospital-ridden for about a third of his life because of a very rare disorder.  These 2 people eventually meet, but with some unexpected twists and turns.  Since you must see this movie to get something out of me, I will tell you that there is an ending with an unexpected twist, but the ending is lacking a lot more than I expected from Mr. Shyamalan.  It's like a story that ends right on the tip of the climax.  I really suggest, if there is an alternate ending or alternate scenes, please put it on the DVD when it comes out!  This part of the movie, though, in the perspective of the whole picture, fits in rather well and does not affect a high score this movie will get on the IMDb.

Broken,"Unbreakable is a slow-paced, bizarre mystery/superhero movie. The acting by the two leads is good, especially by Willis. The score, I believe is the best thing about the movie; it is simultaneously soaring and grim. The camera work/direction is intriguing at first, but the repeated experimenting with weird camera angles and positions doesn't add anything to the story and only highlights the fact that we're watching a movie. The concept is where the movie really loses track though.SPOILERS AHEAD The movie expounds on a scenario in which one man learns he has superpowers, and tries to depict how this might play out, realistically, in today's society. What it fails to realise is that the inclusion of superpowers immediately nullifies any possibility of the proceedings being plausible. And so, the movie takes itself way too seriously. As a result, the movie is neither an exciting superhero movie with outlandish yet entertaining characters and situations, nor is it a believable character study on real world human beings; the movie therefore ultimately treads the line between the two, with mediocre outcomes. First out, the beginning to the movie was good and interesting, with the train crash bringing much intrigue over Willis' character's possible 'unbreakability'.I first felt the movie began to go downhill when the Samuel L Jackson character(Elijah) was introduced on screen, because in the first of many monologues he says something along the lines of "" I believe comics are a window to history.."" and then goes on to glorify how comics will forever represent humanity's recollection of history and other such ludicrous dialogue, that the proceedings are strongly shaken off their foundations, truly vibe-kill. At various points in the film he states that there originally is a particular way in which heroes and villains exist, but that they are greatly eschewed in the comics of the time. So while he glorifies comics as windows into our pasts, he also detests them for there less than accurate portrayal of good vs evil. Great character consistency.After much plodding and persistence, Elijah succeeds in convincing David to wonder about his health. Sometime during the movie we find out that David and his wife were involved in a car accident several years ago, with all the papers headlined ""Local football star injured in near fatal car accident"". Elijah alleges that David wasn't injured during the accident, but ""faked it"" because he wanted to find reason to end his football career, which in turn was because he loved Audrey very much and was willing to give up a career in football for her. So, David simply fakes that he was badly injured after the accident, and of course the media and the doctors and the nurses and all people simply take his word for it, and so does Audrey, because she too cites the car accident as a reason for David's not having been able to play football anymore. I just do not get how David managed to convince everyone he was so badly injured that he couldn't pursue a career in football anymore, when he clearly WASN'T injured. Whatever the plot needs, I guess.The son with a gun scene was undoubtedly the best scene in the movie, because it was hilarious. ""Friends don't hurt each other."", or something along those lines, was simply unintentionally hilarious.From the information that David once nearly drowned in a swimming pool in his childhood, Elijah cooks up a fantastical theory about how they both have something in common and that is, their weakness- Water. And that is when Elijah comes to the epic conclusion that water chokes people when it enters there lungs. He says ""Water is his kryptonite"", and while that sounds intense, it is actually incorrect, because water would have been David's kryptonite, only if it was harmless to other humans, but the one thing that Elijah doesn't understand is that all humans can choke on water and die. But, this speech about his weakness is a pep talk for David, because very soon he's convinced that he is a superhero and wants to put his powers to use. He observes many criminals, and reasoning that there acts aren't gruesome enough for his intervention, he searches till he finds a murderer and goes after the man. He kills the man and saves the children and leaves. The next day he shows his son his escapade and tells him not to tell mom. For someone who killed a man last night, for the first time in his life, and realized the implications of his superpowers, David is really chilled out. The end however is underwhelming, with the rest of the movie being about only one thing- David either having or not having superpowers, with information for and against this motion having been provided to us alternatively. David shakes Elijah's hand for the first time, apparently, and thus sees the true horror of Elijah's actions. It's rather odd that in their many interactions, David and Elijah never happened to have brushed past each other previously. But okay, well that's the way it happened, so okay. It was revealed that Elijah is responsible for several major mishaps in the world(or was it city?). How he actually does manage to wreak havoc in so many places is left hanging. He's shown to mull around gathering vital stats and information for his plan and then executing it(the train crash incident). Keep in mind that this man who has supposedly committed grave acts of terror, was not really able to come down a flight of stairs at a hint of a pace, earlier in the movie. His plan to find a hero is frankly very inefficient, but I guess you shouldn't blame bad guys for being bad at what they do.Ultimately, Unbreakable fails due to the method of execution of its concept and certain weak points in plot. Despite all this, some scenes are engrossing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Breathtaking,"In a year of lackluster cinema I found Unbreakable to be the most thought provoking and interesting film of the year. While the ending may not be as much of a shocker as it was in Sixth Sense, it's not the ending that makes this movie. Shyamalan manages to mount alot of increased tension and fascination with the characters through a more slow moving and cerebral film. His appreciation for Hitchcock is obvious but the influence on this movie is very apparent and effective. In a day where big budgets and special effects rule it is very nice to see a director come to the forefront on the strength of his storytelling and for how much he doesn't show the viewer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Paint an elephant blue and its still an elephant.,"A movie by Shyamalan is a movie by Shyamalan is a movie by Shyamalan. At least that's the trend which ""Unbreakable"" would suggest. Another plodding and tedious bunch of Hollywood dark kinda paranormal stuff, this film manages to squeeze even less plot into its run time than its Shyamalan predecessor, ""The Sixth Sense"". But, hey, if you had a formula that worked and got $10 mil to do it again, you would too, huh? So, the moral to what is hopefully not a series of Shyamalan pseudo-paranormal spooky nonsense flicks is, I guess; if you liked ""The Sixth Sense"", give ""Unbreakable"" a try. If not, don't.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
shyamalan got me again,"That this is the second straight collaboration between writer/director Shyamalan and Bruce Willis isn't as interesting to me as this: `Unbreakable' is the third film starring Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. The three films and six roles played couldn't be more different.The first is of course, `Pulp Fiction,' a film that launched Jackson to superstardom and re-ignited Willis' career. They play two of the film's main characters, a boxer in a rigged fight and a hit-man who finds spirituality. They have one scene together but even then they never say a word to each other. The two characters have a strange connection though. It's one of those between-the-lines kinds of things that you only notice if you've seen a film as many times as I've seen `PF.' Both performances are arguably their best.Next is `Die Hard With a Vengeance,' which cast Willis as New York cop John McClain again, with Jackson as his reluctant sidekick, Zues. I like the movie but I can never figure out quite why Jackson's character is there other than to give McClain someone to talk to. Nevertheless, the two are in most of their scenes together. For some reason the franchise turns its back on the whole one-man-against-an-army concept of the first two films and turns the third into a buddy movie.Five years later, both men's careers are still sizzling. `Unbreakable' will do nothing to hurt either. I never once thought of Jules Winfield or Butch Coolidge, John McClain or Zeus Carver. Again, the two play completely different characters from any they've played before. Willis plays David Dunn, a guy who can't remember the last time he was sick, broke a bone, or even got a paper cut. He's just survived a train wreck that no one else survived. Not only that, he walked away without a scratch. Jackson plays Elijah Price, a man who would seem to be David's exact opposite. Elijah has a degenerative bone disease that makes them very brittle and easy to break. Elijah has a few hobbies. One is collecting rare comic book art and studying it. Another is finding his exact opposite. He believes that if someone like him can exist, someone who breaks very easily, then why shouldn't someone exist who can't be broken?Let's get one thing out of the way before I go on: Shyamalan is a genius. To have conceived, written and pulled a project the caliber of `Unbreakable' together in the short time between completing `Sixth Sense' and now is incredible. No sophomore slump here. `Unbreakable' will stick to your bones like turkey and mashed potatoes.Unlike `Sixth Sense,' the director takes a few minor missteps here. These are technical faults that can be attributed to having to work on more of a deadline than the last time. Just because his last film was perfect doesn't mean he's infallible. It isn't perfect, but `Unbreakable' is definitely a success.Anyone who saw `Sixth Sense' will recognize Shyamalan's filmmaking style here. The pacing is the same. He again unfolds the story slowly. `Unbreakable' doesn't build to quite the crescendo that `SS' does, but you can see an unmistakably similar formula at work. Each auteur has his/her own.Shyamalan's gift seems to be laying out the clues for those perceptive enough to see them. If you just sit back and enjoy, you'll be surprised at the end. Your jaw will hit the floor with almost as much velocity as it did in `SS.' The more perceptive though, will pick up on the clues and won't be fooled. I was fooled. Again. But that's what makes it so much fun.Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An Elegant Misfire,"I saw this movie close to a week ago now, and I'm still sorting through my impressions of it. Part of the problem is the inevitable comparison to Night's stunning 1999 breakthrough ""The Sixth Sense"". I've read a number of comments that urge viewers not to make such comparisons, but that's neither sensible nor realistic. It's the same director, the same star, the same genre (supernatural mystery) and both are built around an unexpected ending. To suggest that one shouldn't compare the two is like a car manufacturer asking the public not to compare its '99 models to its '00's. The second difficulty in honestly evaluating it has to do with how so many film-goers, including myself, really admire Night's sensitive, understated, almost religious approach to his craft. The man is really trying to enrich the medium, to elevate the art form (okay, I'm sounding pretentious) in a Hollywood climate of stale formula, empty commercialism and happy brainlessness. I like to think of him as the little guy valiantly standing up to all the Jerry Bruckheimers of the world.So I went into the theatre in a state of great anticipation, tempered perhaps a smidgen by the somewhat uncertain buzz that hovered around the film in the days leading up to its release. And it had me in its grip all the way through its taut, hyper-observant opening on the train, where Night is meticulously extracting the drama and suspense from the everyday (sad, hapless Willis flirting with an attractive young sports agent who has had the misfortune to take the seat next to him) and on through the early passages where Willis is coming to terms with the shocking reality of having survived a train wreck which should have killed him. There is in these scenes the wonderful sense that so many great movies share of seemingly ordinary events slowly building towards something EXTRAordinary.But then the film runs into some problems that are very difficult to discuss without giving things away. The first mis-step (or series of mis-steps) is the repetitiveness of the scenes involving Sam Jackson's memorably obsessive Elijah character explaining to Willis his incredible theories on what he might be and represent. There must be four or five of them and they all pretty much cover the same territory, ending similarly with Willis thinking it over then unconvincingly brushing him off with something to the effect of ""YOU have issues. Now stay away from me."" Another flaw, that has been pointed out in many other comments, is the superfluous presence of Willis' wife played by Robin Wright Penn. There is nothing wrong with her performance at all, and she does figure in a major way in Willis' history and the direction his life took. But as far as the present is concerned, she needs to be pulling the story in some direction, creating some kind of tension or conflict and she never does. I understand that Night conceived this as a trilogy and I'm sure she will play a much bigger role in the sequels (should there be any) but in the self-contained universe of this picture, she is a classic example of under-development.There are other scenes that just don't ring true or are just too ""much"". The gun-wielding scene with Willis' son was wildly unbelievable. (Though some others thought it was laughable, I did find the weight-lifting sequence to be charming.) The flashback where the camera closes in and lingers on Willis as a young man as he is about to make his big, life-altering decision, was mawkishly overdone. And the whole bravura climax where Willis finally accepts his ""destiny"" made me squirm. It held my interest, of course, and I wanted very much to go along with it, but it all seemed wrong and ill-considered.Still, I find myself being very protective when others lash out against it. Mainly because the ending, the famous twist, is flat out brilliant. Not only does it cast everything you've seen up to that point in a whole new light, I LOVE the idea of stopping films abruptly and at an unlikely place, rather than wrapping everything up nice and neat. It makes the film live on in your mind afterwards and, to be truthful, despite its flaws (which I'm inclined to forgive considering all the things it does well) this is a movie that I very much look forward to seeing again. For the all the clues, the symbolism, the exquisite technique, and the rare opportunity to witness the work of a director whose mind is not dead, like so many others, but wide awake.After all, a Night misfire is quite a bit better than a Michael Bay direct hit.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

I see dull people...,"NPR was right.I'd heard an unflattering review of Unbreakable on NPR the night before I saw it, but still I held out hope that some of the magic we all loved in Sixth Sense would reappear and salvage the film.It didn't.The characters are not compelling in *any* degree ... Sam Jackson is a total crackpot, Bruce seems about as slow and naive as an eight-year-old schoolgirl, and his kid is *way* too sensitive.  I realize Bruce was intended to be a flawed ""everyman,"" but at least make him an *interesting* flawed ""everyman""...  throughout the film, I couldn't force myself to care a lick about him.The premise is fantastic, the acting was fine, but the writing and direction were horrible.  It seemed as though the film couldn't decide whether it wanted to be serious or a self-parody ... it ended up being an awkward mix of both.  Willis's ""hero"" scenes in particular evoked a theatre-full of eye rolling and exasperated sighs.As for the ""surprise ending"".... if it evoked a ""Wow!"" in Sixth Sense, this time it pulled out little more than a ""OK, whatever.""  By the time it came around, we simply didn't care.All this being said, I have to admit that the movie did stay with me after I left the theatre.  The premise itself is extremely compelling - I would love to see it carried out in a better fashion, either as a more carefully-directed serious film, or as a lighter parody.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A movie about ideals,"A movie about a man, who will do for his ideals everything; or a movie about a man, who is psychically ill and starts doing mass- murders. These are 2 views I had on Unbreakable. An engaging beginning attracted me, so I expected a good- class film. To be honest, I was a little bit disappointed, because there are too many „unexpected“ American accidents. Besides this, theories that comic- books are a form of history are maybe original, but for me they were strange and weird. It is too unbelievable for the age we live in. Unbreakable was sometimes too lengthy, in my opinion it needs more action. A big plus is the camera, which's shots are very uncommon; the soundtrack is also nice.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Night's beautifully crafted ""Hitchcockian"" camera style grabs every inch of feeling and life in the world of Unbreakable, but only hints at the real story of the movie. Grotesque angles and dramatic lighting reminded me of Murnau and German expressionism that influenced the greats like Hitchcock and Orson Welles.

Boring. But it has its good points.,"""Unbreakable"" is somewhat hard to review. It's not a good movie, but it has qualities that are undeniably appealing.The premise of the movie, which is apparent within maybe the first fifteen minutes or so, is completely ridiculous. I have to admit though that it ""worked"", and I stopped snickering before the movie really took off.Actually, the movie never takes off. There's a long, boring build up to a climax that disappoints. At the end, you realize that ""Unbreakable"" was just setting the scene for ""Unbreakable 2"".Regardless of its faults though, ""Unbreakable"" does have its moments. It is just awesome visually. Also, it's unpredictable on a very basic level; you genuinely don't know what is going to happen next (or if you do know what's going to happen, you don't know HOW it's going to happen).So... it's a mixed bag, I guess.

So heartbreaking...,"I was not a big fan of the Sixth Sense.  The ending was SOOO obvious, and the film otherwise was good, but not great.  But the director got such praise for what everyone thought was a great ending, I suppose he thinks these twists are the way to go.  More on that in a bit.So here comes *Unbreakable*.  I have to say, a lot of viewers thought this film was slow, but sometimes a great film requires patience.  I think that this had the potential to be the greatest film of the year.  Beautiful direction, compelling acting and a fantastic story.  Then the ""twist ending"" which the director worked very hard to keep a secret and which every review mentions.  I won't tell you what it is.  I didn't see it coming this time around.  But boy, it sucked.  Very disappointing.  That's what makes Unbreakable so heartbreaking.  What was easily a fantastic movie had all of its potential destroyed in a mere 2 minutes.  You would have thought SOMEONE could have told him and he could have changed it or even dropped the twist altogether.  it was largely unnecessary and wholly unfulfilling.I therefore can't tell you whether I recommend the film or not.

It could have been so much better...,"This film could have been great.  There was an intriguing plot behind it all and a quality cast.  Unfortunately, Bruce Willis gives a reprise of his 6th Sense performance (under-acted and wooden) and whilst it may have worked in 6th Sense it was completely out of place here.  And the script for the most part was either hopelessly unrealistic (with Willis' screen family communicating in knowing looks and monosyllabic utterances) or cringeworthy (some of Jackson's more prosaic lines).  I love films that are about extraordinary things happening to ordinary people, but the characters in this film were just to weird to begin with so the effect was lost.  On a plus note the photography was excellent (alebeit with the director's slightly heavy-handed imagery) and Jackson commanded the screen every time he was on it (no mean feat with the script).  I just think it could have been so much better with a better dramatic actor playing the lead (sorry Bruce!) and a script that didn't try and load every line with a sense of mystery.

The first 30 minutes of a movie,"If one made a better movie out of this one, this film would be the first 30 minutes of it. As it is, Shyamalan stretches a good short story to almost 2 hrs and makes it worthwhile only with his excellent direction, a well-written script and memorable characters.Just as in his previous film, ""The 6th Sense"", Shyamalan demonstrates his ability to power-up his scenes with almost nothing at all - no crying, no shouting, no running around. Some sequences in this film are very powerful, and the most powerful of them all is the one left out altogether: the train crash. Calm moments are the most disconcerting. The characters seem pretty dull at first, Willis just seems to stand around looking really confused most of the time. But the awakening to the fact that he is unbreakable, who wouldn't be? Jackson's frail comics collector is strange and esoteric, bordering on crazy. Shyamalan is a talented director and writer, and this movie is good. But I get the feeling that he rushed to make this film, and that the haste has crippled it somewhat. First of all, like I mentioned above, the entire movie felt like the first 30 minutes of something bigger, longer, better. Maybe a part one in a trilogy or something. Second, the nifty little details that were so abundant in ""6th Sense"" are almost completely forgotten or overlooked here. It's as though Shyamalan decided to shorten the process and cut some character development and some trivia. And the film suffers from it - it is not anywhere near as interesting as ""6th Sense"".There's a twist, too, but this one is not very surprising (especially if one has read ANY kind of super-hero comic at some point in life), and seems a bit desperate. But what really sinks the ending are the completely unnecessary explanatory texts that appear, revealing what happened after the story ended for the viewer. I don't understand the need for that kind of self-mockery. It doesn't help the story, it doesn't add anything interesting to the flow of the plot and it certainly feels like a desperate move or some unimaginable sort. I'm not just talking about ""Unbreakable"" here, I don't understand the need for this in any film (except maybe true stories).I really don't think that Shyamalan ""did it again"", since the contrasts between ""6th Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" are very stark, and the quality of the former is far beyond that of the latter. But Shyamalan is clearly a talent to be reckoned with. He just has to top his debut, which will be very, very difficult. A challenge, you might say.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Skillful presentation of a flawed plot,"The cinematography in this movie is great; beautiful shots abound. The acting is fair, and there are certainly some enjoyable scenes in this movie.That said, someone forgot to remind M. Night that every great movie starts with an interesting story. The ending of this movie is terrible, evoking no emotions or feelings, other than that you've just been ripped off. It's almost as if the movie builds to a point, forgets where it's going, and tries to tie everything together as quickly and haphazardly as possible.

#60,"This film follows David Dunn, a seemingly ordinary security guard who miraculously survives a train derailment as the sole survivor. With the help of Elijah Price, a comic book connoisseur suffering from a rare genetic disorder that makes his bones extremely fragile, David begins to realize that he has always been far from ordinary, uncovering his true nature: he is ""unbreakable."" Armed with his newfound, ESP-like ability to sense and predict danger, David must now use his gift to protect the weak and innocent. Overall, due to its striking visuals, impressive performances by Willis and Jackson-representing some of their career bests-an unpredictable Shyamalan twist and a very creative and intriguing story, this movie is really good, and although it runs a bit slower and is more plot-driven than traditional action-packed superhero flicks, it is still a great starting feature in this trilogy and offers a refreshing, down-to-earth comic book tale that I thoroughly enjoyed my time with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A great film.,"Now, everyone was all hyped about ""Unbreakable"" back in 2000, because the director of ""The Sixth Sense"" had come back. I went because of Bruce Willis and the sweet trailer. I hated the Sixth Sense. I thought it was boring and the ending just confirmed what I thought the whole damn time. But in Unbreakable, I knew also... but because of the comic book tone, I didn't care. I used to read comics as a kid and you always know the good guys are going to win, you just to still love reading them to find out how. This movie was the same way. It was the perfect origin of a hero. It would be sweet to see some more of his crime fighting scenes, but still... the movie was very compelling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

believable superhero,"If there was such a thing as a ""superhero,"" this is the most plausible, realistic idea about what he might be like.  David Dunn has no special powers, nor is he invincible , but his physiological make-up allows his body to withstand much greater physical forces than average human beings. This concept is much easier to accept than someone with x-ray vision or the ability to fly (although superman is more sci-fi/fantasy while ""Unbreakable"" is more of a drama).I did not enjoy ""The Sixth Sense"". In fact, I hated it. Nor do I read comic books (although the trailer doesn't convey the connection). Despite this, I could not wait to see ""Unbreakable,"" and much to my delight I found it to be very absorbing and thought-provoking, although not at all what I expected.Watching this film a second time, I noticed all the ""clues"" and visual images that hint towards the ending, an ending with which many people have said they are unsatisfied.I agree to a certain extent.  The ending could have been a bit more profound, but considering this movie is modeled after a comic book in which the hero discovers his powers, I thought it was appropriate.My only hope is that the release of the DVD includes deleted scenes showing more of David Dunn discovering his strength.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbreakable (2000),"I saw this film many years ago and decided to check it out again. I re-watched a few of M. Night Shyamalan's films this year and just wanted to run through the very best of the lot. Having seen Split earlier in the year and learning of the sequel to Unbreakable coming out soon I think it was just time. I really love The Village and Signs from M. Night, in recent years his films have tanked but in the past he made some really solid work. Unbreakable isn't as good as those two mentioned earlier but its pretty great.The film is a superhero movie about a man who is unbreakable. He has super strength and radar to track criminals, and also can survive accidents without breaking a bone. On the other hand there is a man with a rare genetic disorder where his bones break very easily, he is aptly named Mr. Glass. Mr. Glass encounters David Dunn (the hero played by Bruce Willis) and lets him know about his powers. From there Dunn starts to realize his potential and what it means for him and his family. He also puts his powers into action and uses it to catch bad people who are committing crimes against humanity.This film is not perfect but its incredibly crafty and smart. Its such a subtle superhero film that really is well thought out. Having two opposite men who are on different ends of the spectrum, in terms of what their motivations are and their physical predispositions are is brilliant. M. Night was honestly a master of creating a gripping story with a twist in his early days, and this wasn't an exception. You get two really good performances from the two leads and also feel like the characters are quite strong and memorable. The film does delve into some scary bits, especially when Dunn finds out the crimes of some of the people he interacts with.This is no Village or Signs, or even Sixth Sense but Shyamalan reunites with Bruce Willis for quite an engaging effort that really is a tribute to comic books and the comic book structure. Its also got a wonderful score to boot. Its very easy to get lost in the film and I just love the way key plot points are drawn it and sucks you into the mood of the film. I would recommend checking this out because its one of the finer efforts from a director who was once great.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbreakable Is Like The Matrix Without The Far-fetchedness,"In a few ways this movie is reminiscent of The Matrix. Where David (Bruce Willis) discovers his ""potential"" through Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson), similar to Neo and Morpheus. It likens us to the possibility that a ""sane man in an insane world"" could be an ""insane man in a sane world"" and vice versa.The story is about David, an ex-football star turned security guard with a wife and son who makes regular pay and wakes up every morning with an empty feeling. Elijah acknowledges this empty feeling to David as a sadness and then proceeds to tell him, ""...maybe its because you are not doing what you are supposed to be doing."" David feels burdened by Elijah's theories as evident in not only his skepticism, but as well, his downright defensiveness. Gradually, he begins to accept them however.By the time David comes to his realization, he rekindles the broken contact between him and Elijah, and, as you might guess, comes to understand what he must do. The movie now takes a turn in a very different direction, when David, as a regular man with a genetic edge discovered only by Elijah, must now conquer his doubts and fears over Elijah's theories and any concern he might have over whether or not his actions undermine his sanity, to enter what the audience has all been waiting for to see, superhero territory. Remember, this is the same guy who eats french toast for breakfast with a glass of Tropicana.The movie basically centers around Elijah's theory, which is about the closest link between the superhero world of comic books and ours. We see the burdens David faces when he has to reconcile everything he knows about his basis in real life with that of Batman, Superman, Spiderman and other gods from the pages of panel-by-panel mythology. It makes us wonder about the possibility and explores the brightest and darkest aspects of the human psyche. This ""crossing over"" aspect I found very reminiscent of The Matrix but without the farfetchedness. Which is what drives this movie much more closer to home than The Matrix could ever be.The movie ends on a note that leaves us to imagine the future to come. We are forced to question what we believe to be good and evil.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
UNBREAKABLE : Shyamalan Mixes Real Talent W. Overindulgence...,"UNBREAKABLEAfter his success with THE SIXTH SENSE, M. Night Shyamalan's name became a brand of sorts. In a day when director's rarely get the top billing for their films, M. Night Shyamalan has managed to build up a following strong enough to have all his films labeled ""An M. Night Shyamalan Film"". In today's day, when cinema in general has seemed kind of stagnant, it is refreshing to see a director with such a clear strong vision getting recognition. Though his films since THE SIXTH SENSE have yet to receive the unanimous praise bestowed on that thriller, they have all had the signature stamp of Shyamalan's eye.Ironically, Shyamalan's film that seemed to make the slightest dent on the public radar was his first follow-up to THE SIXTH SENSE... UNBREAKABLE. It takes his typical formula of a slowly revealed secret that is given a huge shift in the final moments of the film, and frames it as an ode to comic books. It tells the story of David Dunn (played by Bruce Willis), a man who miraculously survived a disastrous train accident unharmed while all the other passengers died.There appears to be no explanation for David's survival, and the experience cuts a huge rift in David's life. Already estranged from his wife (played by Robin Wright Penn), David seems to become even more removed from his family as he struggles to come to terms with the situation. It seems no one can provide him answers, except a man named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson). Elijah is a man obsessed with the legacy of comic books as pieces of art, and he also suffers from a protein deficiency that causes his bones to break like glass. Elijah believes that David is a modern day ""superhero"".In his attempts to relay this belief to David, Elijah comes across as a man who has lost his mind. Yet he persistently approaches David with justification for his theory. Turns out David is not only ""unbreakable""... he also has super-strength, a desire to protect people, and impeccable instincts. Elijah continually challenges David to develop these talents and challenge himself... but David is torn between his assumption that Elijah is crazy, the promise he made his wife, and the destiny he might hold.UNBREAKABLE came out one-year after the phenomenon of THE SIXTH SENSE and although it did respectable business at the box office... it never truly caught on with the public. I can only assume it is because of how impersonal the film feels. All the characters are so incredibly introverted that the film feels lifeless at times. It is very slow moving in it's pursuit of the truth... and when David learns new things about his capabilities it is not filmed in a grand way. Everything is kept very subtle, and while that suits the realistic tone of the entire film, it hurts the films pacing.I think in this follow-up, Shyamalan showed many of the skills that made THE SIXTH SENSE so successful. There are some shots in particular that are rather captivating. For example, the opening sequence on the train is filmed in a very interesting manner that works very well as an introduction to David's character and his struggles. In addition, there is a sequence in which David's son holds him at gunpoint that is done very well. Finally, in the last moments when David finally learns to use his powers, there is a particularly chilling shot of a flowing window curtain. However, Shyamalan also becomes over-indulgent at times.There are numerous plot elements here that are granted an unreasonable amount of time whether through story development or extended sequences. For example, in the moments following David's survival of the train crash, Shyamalan takes a ridiculous amount of time. Everything moves in slow motion and in silence for a good 5 minutes and unfortunately it doesn't work. Within the first minute I understood the tension that Shyamalan was trying to capture, but by the 5th minute I was checking my watch. Also, the relationship between Bruce Willis and Robin Wright Penn is poorly done. There is a huge emotional divide between them, and a vast majority of the film focuses on them trying to work things out. However, under the surface of their performances, there is virtually no sense of an undying love.Overall, the film develops in an intriguing manner, but too much of it feels useless. I think quite a bit of footage was included because Shyamalan was looking to strengthen the mood and artistic merit of the film... but in the end the movie needed a little more of a mainstream pacing. By having the film move so incredibly slow at times, Shyamalan loses his audience at times. If the film could have been paced a bit more briskly perhaps it would have reached its full potential. However, for true fans of Shyamalan, this does make for an interesting viewing experience. Many of his talents are evident, though while riding on the success of THE SIXTH SENSE it appears Shyamalan got a little too indulgent at times.... C+ ...",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Expect the Unexpected.,"Once again, M. Night Shyamalan has created a true vision committed to film.

Shyamalan has a knack for creating believable characters put in unbelievable, yet plausible, situations.Going into ""Unbreakable"" I expected a supernatural thriller.  While the film was supernatural it was nothing like I expected.  Shyamalan produced, wrote, and directed this completely original work of film art.  I am a huge fan of original work and M. Night certainly delivered.Bruce Willis plays a Temple stadium security guard named David Dunn, a man who was traveling home on a train when it derailed due to a mechanical functions killing every passenger except Dunn, who wasn't harmed at all. Obviously, this has quite an impact on Willis' character who is searching for some type of answer.  Elijah Price, portrayed brilliantly by Samuel L. Jackson, is a comic collector in Philadelphia who believes he has the answer to Willis' question.  Read what you want from this little bit I have given you but I can say no more.  It will simply ruin all the fun and brilliance about the first viewing of this film.M. Night has one-upped himself with ""Unbreakable"", a far superior film to his 1999 monster hit ""The Sixth Sense"".

It manages to remind us all (well, me at least; I had a wonderfully overactive imagination as a kid) why we still get a little flicker of dread anytime we're alone in a dark room.  If you don't, you are deluding yourself.There is nothing that primal behind the premise of ""Unbreakable"".  I did get the feeling that there *wants* to be a more universal theme there.You see, and I noticed this more on the second viewing, this is less a story of a guy with a strange secret and more the story of as kid and his father.

The moments where this subplot does come to the fore ring the truest (and I'm thinking especially of that beautiful scene towards the end where the father passes the newspaper to his son, the camera pans up, and there is an expression of unmistakable sadness on the father's face).So give this movie a look.

"An interesting premise, but missing something.","This movie has a very interesting beginning: a man (Bruce Willis) survives a train wreck without a scratch. It turns out there are other curiosities about this man, and we get caught up in a mystery that takes some unexpected turns. Where the mystery ends up, I won't reveal, since that would spoil the plot -- I will say that it ends up in a very interesting place.However, that said, I have a number of problems with the execution of the movie. First of all, I didn't care for the directing style at all. Many of the scenes felt needlessly ""gimmicked"" or ""obfuscated."" For instance, there was one scene where two characters are sitting in front of a TV talking to each other. Instead of seeing the characters directly, we see their reflections in the TV screen. I'm sure there's an artistic explanation for why he did that, but it felt goofy and pretentious to me -- like the director was trying too hard to do something ""different."" In another scene, we see about 60 seconds of activity through billowing curtains from outside the room. Most of what you see is the curtains, with only glimpses of what is going on inside. Again, I'm sure it appealed to the ""artistic"" crowd, but I found it annoying and artificial. I've always felt that true artistry should not call attention to itself -- you shouldn't notice it until you watch the film a second or even third time. So the director was too ""present"" in how the scene was played out.Second, and much worse, many of the scenes were lethargic and slow. Long pauses were taken between the actors' lines -- far longer than required for a dramatic pause, far to frequently. Things felt ""slow"" through the entire movie. It was interesting in terms of the overall plot line, but the many of the individual scenes were utterly boring. I saw this movie for the first time on DVD (not in the theater), and more than once I almost reached for the remote and hit the ""fast forward"" button. I will say, it was interesting enough that I didn't actually hit the button; but the fact that I eyed the remote at least 5 different times speaks volumes. If it were a truly riveting movie, I wouldn't have been able to tell you where the remote *was*.Finally, while I won't reveal the ending or what happens in the climax, I will say it felt like not enough happened. After the movie was over, I said out loud to myself, ""That's it?"" It felt incomplete to me. Not in the way that screams ""sequel,"" because things are wrapped up, but the way in which they were wrapped up felt too quick. The way the general plot was structured, if you had read a 1-page treatment of the movie, you'd have said, ""Wow! I bet this final scene will be packed with power and emotion."" While it was surprising, it was not powerful or emotional. It was rather slow and stale, which, sadly, is how the entire rest of the movie felt.Ultimately, Unbreakable was intellectually interesting, but emotionally empty. The performances were wooden. None of the characters really moved me or made me like them. It felt like everyone from the director to the actors to the cinematographer, could have used some caffeine or perhaps some energy bars -- the entire production lacked ""energy."" Unbreakable's probably worth seeing once, but if you don't see it, you haven't missed much -- and it's certainly not worth seeing more than once.My score: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Surprised,"I am truly surprised that there are so many negative comments about Unbreakable.Usually Bruce Willis' acting is too flat for my taste.  However he brings just the right amount of detachment to the portrayal of a man, David Dunn, who is just going through the motions of life, until he discovers that he is ""unbreakable.""Samuel L. Jackson delivers an amazing performance as Elijah Price, a frail comic book collector searching for his ""reason for being."" Price philosophises about comic books representing the mythic archetypal dualities of our common human experience, good/evil, strong/weak, unbreakable/fragile...If I must criticise, I would say that there were several threads in the story that were not fully developed, for example, Dunn's relationship with his family. Yet the telling of the central theme of Good vs. Evil was so artfully done, one will hardly notice.Unbreakable is a simple, age-old story.  It is well told, and well worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
the moody style effectively camouflages some pretty thin material,"The director and star of the supernatural blockbuster 'The Sixth Sense' reunite to see if box office lightning will strike twice: hardly likely, given the astronomical numbers posted by the earlier film. This time around Bruce Willis is again the odd man out, the only survivor of a fatal train crash who begins to suspect he owes his life to something more than mere serendipity. Is he an accidental plaything of fate, or (believe it or not) an unsuspecting comic book superhero down on his luck? A little more ambiguity might have added some necessary tension to the far-fetched scenario, but from the first frame the issue is hardly in doubt, and as a result the obligatory surprise ending (around which the entire film revolves) is unfairly deflated, trading the compelling supernatural hook of its predecessor for an intriguing but esoteric Twilight Zone plot twist demanding a more laborious suspension of disbelief.Writer director M. Night Shyamalan maintains the same somber, self-conscious style that so effectively marked his earlier film, with long meaningful pauses separating every portentous line of dialogue, and a deliberate editing scheme favoring suspense over easy shock tactics. It's refreshing to find a moviemaker not enslaved to Hollywood's current hyper-kinetic visual fads, but it's also safe to say the pacing flags at more than one point: Rod Serling could have told the same story just as well in less than 30 minutes. An economic, two-character cast (Willis, plus Samuel Jackson as his crackpot guide to reluctant enlightenment) makes the whole thing look not unlike a student screen writing exercise, pulled out of Shyamalan's old college trunk and hastily dusted off to help keep his suddenly hot career from losing any momentum.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

As good as any Hitchcock movie, maybe not truly original but for the new generation - as close as you can get.I'd like to see M Night doing some social media related films - that might be interesting, describing the dark side of the internet, catfishing and scams.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbreakable is barely bearable,"Some other reviewers have compared this to the ""Sixth Sense,"" an earlier movie starring Bruce Willis. The problem is that the writer and director of the Sixth Sense knew what their story was about and developed it beautifully. This is not the case with ""Unbearable."" The director put together a film that is dark, dreary and slow paced, with an irritating omnipresent dirge as the sound track. The story is disjointed, confusing and unbelievable. I mean at times I thought it was supposed to be some avant garde surreal or experimental film, where everything is some sort of symbolism. I usually don't get what the director is trying to say in those modernistic movies. Unfortunately, ""Unbreakable"" was not that good and no easier to follow.Bruce Willis plays a security guard with a wife and child that he is apparently simultaneously estranged from and living with. In college he had a promising football career until he and his wife (its not clear whether they were married yet) were in an auto accident that ended his football career. Most of the movie is spent with his son and Samuel Jackson (playing the security guard's polar opposite, a brittle boned and accident prone comic book collector, trying to convince the security guard that he is really supposed to be a superhero.Eventually he is convinced to spend an evening as a kind of vigilante looking for some evildoing to thwart, sort of like a neighborhood watch volunteer who goes on patrol with no cell phone to call 911, no flashlight, and no weapon. We are shown a brief sequence of crimes that he ignores. In addition to being ""unbreakable,"" he is apparently unwittingly psychic and gets some idea of who is thinking about a criminal act. At about that time we hear one of the family say something such as ""at last its over."" I hoped that was the final scene but no such luck. There is a final twist which apparently we are somehow supposed to figure out from newspaper clippings on a wall. It is clear from his horrified facial expression that the security guard understands the twist and then lets the audience in on what the clippings mean.The only reason I didn't shut this off before it was finished was I had invested time watching it and wanted to at least learn where the director was going with this. What a waste of good actors!",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
As bad as it gets,"Oh my God, what a terrible movie. I couldn't sit through it to the end, so I missed the 'twist ending' anyway. About a dozen other people also walked out on it during the showing that I was at. I must be one of the 'mediocre people' that just doesn't get it, and neither did the other members of the 'peanut gallery' I was with, to quote one of your other reviewers. And me with two bachelors degrees - imagine that! Truly, do not waste your money on this schlock, it is NOT moody, beautiful, finely drawn or deep. It is one person's attempt at making a film about good versus evil and linking it to a theme of comic books. It's shot in a horrible grey tone throughout, to symbolize his grey life, I suppose, although Willis's one-note acting could substitute for the mediocrity there. The camera-angles all over the place get very old very quick, this is stuff students at film school come up with. Samuel L. Jackson is the only reason to see it, he's wonderful in every shot, but even he can't rescue this abortion of a film.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Another great movie from M. Night,"It took two viewings, but I finally decided this is a great movie.  The first time I saw it I had great expectations based on The Sixth Sense, but this is not that movie.  It doesn't have the depth of meaning that that movie had, but it is a marvelously crafted piece of film art nonetheless. At some point Shyamalan will have to get past the surprise endings, but nobody does them better than he does, not even the great Hitchcock, who Shyamalan obviously is emulating.  The cinematography here is also less fulfilling than that of the Sixth Sense, where Tak Fujimoto's work is transcendent from the very first frame to the last.  Here the cinematography is more workmanlike, but still up to the demands of the script.  It does drag at times, and the part for the young boy is not nearly as rich as Haley Joel's was, but M. Night is still fascinating to watch as he once again unwinds a totally original, completely absorbing tale.  The use of the mirrors and other reflective surfaces in relation to Samuel Jackson's character is worth a chapter in a book of film history alone.  See it, but see it at least twice!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Intriguing premise, beautiful directing, but a let-down","Unbreakable is a beautiful movie: a bit slow, but a great premise that I won't delve into here. The acting is superb, possibly some of Willis' best with lesser performances put on by the minor players (Jackson's work is excellent as well). The direction, the use of colors, symbolism, etc is simply amazing and ranks up with some of the all-time best directors in my book (see Kubrick, Lynch, Gilliam, Jackson). However, ultimately the ending of the movie is unfulfilling and disapointing. Not that it isn't a clever idea and an interesting twist on the premise and plot of the whole movie. No, it's simply anti-climatic and feels awkward, possibly because of the lack of a real encounter or anything truly moving. It's too bad, because by all other accounts this is a really good film. It just left me feeling a little empty and wondering why I had worked so hard to follow it. C'est-la vie I suppose...",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Examining the Icon of the Hero,"M. Night Shyamalan has again created a wonderful film that is unique and surprising.  Pacing is something Shyamalan pays a lot of attention to and it pays off here just as it did in Sixth Sense.  The story is well thought out with wonderful touches of social commentary that are anything, but preachy.The cinematography and camera work are superb and well matched by the sound design and editing.  The costumes are perfectly real while still putting the characters into the look necessary to represent their place in the heroic cycle that this film represents.  The drama is real, be it harsh, funny, or thought provoking. A great examination of what is a hero.I would say that this film is very in the tradition of Hitchcock; it has a man who doesn't want to be a hero becoming the hero, this man must face things within himself that he doesn't want to, a woman/love is his primary weakness and the thrills come from the pacing and drama that creates the tension we all know and love. The action and music are the spices!Enough about the more technical stuff.  This is the best comic book movie ever made because it concentrates on the subject of the Hero as Icon and explains why comics have had the power they have always had.  Comics are very much like movies an let us hope the audience realizes this by the end of the film. The power of words and pictures (or no words at all) is astounding and if you don't think this is true then you need to think about this idea a good deal more.  This film many well be as misunderstood as the medium of comics, but it will help many see them a little bite differently.The best thing though, is this was still a fun film with good suspense and action for those who need either, or.The acting was top notch as we expect from the primary actors with Samuel L. Jackson showing us again why he is ""the man"", or one ""Bad Mother----"". Willis is once again the super hero he is nearly always cast as, but never so blatantly. This film would not be what it is without these two actors. Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark also wonderfully accent them leads and their themes.A must see for folks who just love film, who love comics, or who love good father and son flicks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Not the best, but better than most.","Perhaps one has to have a long-standing love of comic books to truly appreciate this film, but it sure doesn't hurt.And, no, it's not ""The Sixth Sense.""  Is ""The Old Man and the Sea"" like ""For Whom the Bell Tolls?""  I think not.Anyway...Only two things that bothered me about this movie: Jackson's hair and Willis whispering 75% of his lines.  Willis did that in ""The Sixth Sense"" and it drove me up the f****** wall.Not to give too much away, but the entire ""rescue"" section was grand, everything about it, really.  15 minutes of beautiful camera work, all of 4 words of dialogue, and the empowerment that we all dream of (and I love the ""costume.""  Reminds me of Hal Jordan as ""The Spectre"").I've met a lot of people that complain about the ending, but frankly that seemed to me to be the best part of it all; from the time Willis puts on that rain slicker to the rolling credits, the film finally starts moving, and all the pieces fall into place.Very slightly reminiscent of such comics as ""The Watchman"" (where was Alan Moore in the documentary?  Gibbons showed up, but not Moore, though there was Frank Miller, and I loves me some ""Sin City""), ""The Spirit,"" and ""Batman"" (normal men become superheroes).An interesting movie, and definitely one of the better movies to come out in recent years (not the best, frankly, but it doesn't suck), plagued only by M. Night's incredibly slow pacing.  Granted, it lends to the effect he's trying to create, but too often one's too bored.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
eerie and thought-provoking,"Unbreakable is a worthy follow up to Sixth Sense--it won't gross as much, obviously, but it's much better than Blair Witch II.  Shaymalan does a good job of establishing an eerie mood, and rewards your paying attention through the slow parts with a twist ending that should have you slapping your forehead saying, ""Of course!""  I figured out the twist in Sixth Sense early (honest!) but this one fooled me.  Willis is a little too low key, but still gives a solid performance.  Samuel L. Jackson is wonderful as always.  I give it an 8, and look forward to Shaymalan's next film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Breaking the Sophomore Jinx,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"" is a remarkably well constructed second film.  Following the success of ""The Sixth Sense"" he attempts a movie which, in some ways, echoes the first, and also goes a completely different route.One of the smartest moves comes in the first plate of the movie in which he states the statistics of the vast amounts of comic books sold, read, and written in the world.  This, coupled with a very well performed history course by Samuel L. Jackson in which he equates comics with ancient hieroglyphics, lends credence to the story.David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is an untouchable person.  Without spoiling to much of the movie, his charachter is believed to be, by the Jackson character, a modern day superhero.  In the hands of another director, this film would have been made into a much more special effects, run of the mill superhero flick.  In Shyamalan's hands however, he paces the film in such a way that lends not only credence but also provokes thought.  Acting performances that never step wrong and very inventive camera setups make this film extraordinarily beautiful and engaging.Some have said that the ending of the movie cheats, allowing for a tidy wrap up of the plot.  I believe, however that the ending puts the final cap on the characterization of the roles of the superhero and villain, which, in retrospect, is what the movie is about anyway.While watching this film, I was struck by the thought that, in the first two films of M. Night Shyamalan, he seems to be lending a new ear and a new aspect of the psychological horror movie, realizing that the slasher film is over done.  There was another great director that realized the horror of the mind was scarier than the horror of the eye.  His name was Alfred Hitchcock.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The anti-action movie,"First off, those of you expecting 6th Sense 2, go elsewhere.  If you thought 6th Sense was worthy of ""This Year's Best..."" read another review (though it would be strong this year).It is hard to write a review of this movie w/out giving too much away. Every little detail is crucial, and understated on so many levels.  David Dunne plays a security guard who survives a train wreck.  Samuel L. Jackson plays Elijah who tries to make him see how he survived the wreck.""Anti-action movie"" is really all you need to summarize the movie.  This means that movie is laboriously slow, like M.Night was paid overtime to shoot this movie, and anti-climatic.  Not to say that the climax was a let-down (the popular definition); but moreover, that the climax did not raise one out of their seat, yet still pounded them over the head, like a 2 ton weight, with realization, much like the 6th Sense did to most viewers. The details are subtle, though very crucial, only the discerning and the sophisticated will be able to appreciate it.  Nonetheless, _Unbreakable_ is very effective in its story-telling, creating a genre all its own.  I cannot think of any movie with which _Unbreakable_ can compare.The biggest problems with the movie is the pace, like I said, and the poor exploration of the climax (i.e the twist - I dislike using that word) in relation to Elijah.  It puts too much effort on the viewer to remember those details (especially w/the sleep-inducing pace).  _Unbreakable_ could still be effective as the anti-action movie, and anti-climatic, yet still give the viewer ""twist.""  My feeling is that the studio demanded a twist a la 6th Sense, to bring in the audience.When the movie starts to roll, pay attention to the statistic that it shows the audience.  Pay attention not so much to the numbers, but to the hobby it refers to.  When Elijah describes that hobby, and why it sells, remember what this movie is about, and how _it_ is reality, where hobby had become fiction describing reality.  Also, one more comment:  The irony b/t Elijah and David is amazing, classical text book definition.  Keep these comments in mind when you watch _Unbreakable_ they will make you appreciate the movie more, I hope.++ IMDB rating:  8 ++ genre rating:  10 (first of its kind); public rating: 6",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not what it could've been.,"Now, for starters, this movie was an improvement over ""The Sixth Sense.""  It kept the twist ending at the end alive but also managed to keep an interesting and somewhat relevant plot throughout, something that ""The Sixth Sense"" did not.  Both endings are pretty predictable though.I guess the thing that really bugged me about this movie is that it felt like it spent the entire movie building up the two characters and you see how truly amazing Willis's character is.  Then, at the end, Willis's character finds out that his mentor if you will, is the one that has been causing all of these horrible accidents just to find him.  Now, this is where the movie could've taken off but instead, we are slapped with text that is on the screen that says that the mentor has been taken to a mental institute.  How unexciting of a climax is that?",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Is this movie over your head?,"I walked into the theater to see Unbreakable without any expectations or preconcieved notions.  It seems to me that to a certain extent, it ruins the whole moviegoing experience to go into a movie with an idea or theory of what direction the movie should take or what you should see.  Or even what the movie is really about.  Just sit back and enjoy the movie and let it take you on its story. Then, if you will, dissect it after it is through, not during the film.  At least that is my opinion.  This has some bearing of what I think of Unbreakable.  It has received average reviews (though I put NO weight whatsoever into a ""critic""'s opinion).  However I have noticed that a lot of the user comments here as well as other places leads me to believe that a lot of people did not understand this movie for anything more than face value.  A lot of moviegoers, too many, have short attention spans and a limited grasp of the movies they see (including the ""critics"").  I will not harp on this or the users any further, but it stands to be said and I am willing to believe I am not the only person with this opinion.This being said, you should expect a lot of symbolism and hidden meaning, with this film being written and produced by Mr. Shyamalan.  You don't quite expect the movie to have a ""comic book"" theme, but hopefully you realize it is NOT about comics, as this is just the tool/vehicle used to carry the story of David Dunn/Elijah to the audience.  Sadly, most people did not realize this and wonder why the film could not ""have more action"" or ""deal more with the comic book side"".  The movie has a slower than usual pace, but if you saw the Sixth Sense (don't try to draw parallels) you figure out this is very deliberate and helps tell the story as it was intended.  Changing the pacing would have risked turning this movie into ""X-Men"", and that is totally not what Unbreakable was intended to be, despite the references.I really enjoyed the movie and recommend it.  I just wonder if I am the only one that figured out more of the movie than meets the eye.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not good enough","I've always tried to convince myself that it is bad to go see a movie waiting for a masterpiece. I've done it a thousand times and I'm almost always leaving the theatre disappointed. I remember when i went to see ""The sixth sense"" I didn't know what to expect. A new young director who had also written the script wasn't telling me much... After watching the movie I knew M.Shyamalan would be one of my favourite directors. So when I show the previews of his new movie I was expecting a new ""sixth sense"".Unfortunately that wasn't what i found yesterday when i actually saw the movie. Don't get me wrong; the movie is quite good and surely better than a bunch of other c*** we are watching this time of year. Is it though good enough for Shyamalan? In my opinion NO.The problem with this movie is mainly focused at the story. You immediately understand the main point and you are waiting for something interesting, something different, something special to happen...but it never does!! The concept is great and that proves what a movie genius Shyamalan is but... This movie gave me the feeling of something waiting to happen but it never did. I left the theatre wondering ""is that all?"". You know, the same feeling of something good left incomplete...No-one can say that it is a bad movie. It is perfectly directed (i remember the same scenes with the camera moving up and down following the actors, the same way as in the previous movie), i think both the main actors did their best in the limits of their roles ( i loved the way Willis was moving and talking, plus the fact that in the whole movie he never smiled a bit...)and as expected the photography and the soundtrack were the most appropriate. Most of the scenes were taken in the dark or in mostly ""grey"" environment and the movie in total was perfectly balanced around the characters.But... But it was extremely slow (even for Shyamalan...) and the main problem in my opinion is that it didn't promote the story. This story could open a thousand new doors for someone like Shyamalan but for a strange reason he decided not to follow any of them. After the first half an hour you are wondering why you are watching the same staff over and over again...why doesn't he move forward? Trust me this was the most disappointing part for me...I really cannot explain why a so talented director didn't spot that at any point... I can't believe that watching the movie himself he didn't feel he left the job unfinished... It is a shame because this could be another excellent movie. Instead it is just another ""good"" movie, among the hundreds other that come out each year!! I gave this movie a ""7"" (doesn't this show how subjective i am towards Shyamalan??) but i was expecting a ""12""!!!! Let's hope that he will spot the problems and next time he will deliver a new ""Sixth Sense""!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Beautifully crafted and directed!,"Unfortunately, comparisons have to be made with the debut film from Shyamalan. This is a great follow up but... Plot-wise this isn't quite as intriguing as SENSE. Character-wise the way in which Willis has to come to terms with being who he is, does not compare with the horrors young Haley Joel had to face. In fact the best character in this film is Robin Wright's loyal, enduring wife. Did it need the ""twist"" at the end, or was it merely expected? Both films were beautifully crafted and directed.

This movie is haunted by the ghost of Shyamalan's past.,"There is something inherently difficult in making a movie after striking gold in ""The Sixth Sense,"" and ""Unbreakable"" is haunted by the legacy of it's predecessor.Part of the problem is that this movie just isn't as good as Shyamalan's first film.  (And lest you think the comparison is unfair, be aware that similarities to ""The Sixth Sense"" abound in ""Unbreakable""--it's even set in the same city!)  Another problem is that Shyamalan's knack for dramatic realism is undermined by the fact that this is basically a Superman movie.But the real problem is that, after including a whopper of an ending in ""Sixth Sense,"" we, the viewers can't help but try to figure out what the surprise ending will be.  (We know there will be one, because  everyone expects it and will be disappointed if there isn't one.)  That instinct is very distracting, making it hard to feel for the characters because we're trying to decide what lies beneath the plot.And the absolute worst part of the film is that the payoff for all our conjecture is simply not worth it.  Yes, it is surprising, but it is not a chilling, jaw-dropping revelation that completely changes the movie.  At best, you may find yourself saying, ""Wow, I didn't that coming!""  At the end of ""The Sixth Sense,"" I saw many movie-goers who were absolutely speechless. The ones that could talk were trying to figure out how they'd missed it. ""Unbreakable"" elicited none of these reactions when I saw it.  My suggestion for Shyamalan is to make a completely different movie (different style, feel, maybe even genre) next time to suppress the inevitable comparisons and try to regain the creative freedom he exercised so well in his first film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A pleasant work of fiction.,"In my humble opinion ""Unbreakable"" is an even greater achievement than ""The Sixth Sense"".  While some can argue the similarities in tone and mood, I feel that this film goes even deeper, into the question we all ask ourselves; ""Why are we here?""I've heard many people comment on films based on comic books set in realistic surroundings and this may be the first film I've seen that approached this idea in the reverse.  What seems like madness at first slowly evolves into a sense of purpose.  People who questioned the ""Whats"" and ""Whys"" come to realizations through greatly differing means.If I'm being elusive in my descriptions, it is just because I don't want to spoil the marvelous twist at the end for those who haven't seen the film yet.  Surprises like that should best be enjoyed by staying that way, as surprises.All in all, I feel that while some may find ""Unbreakable"" unbelievable, I have to ask why some are frightened by ideas and images which question their reality.  Which is exactly what the characters in this film are made to do. Be it as mundane as day to day family life, or the remarkable idea that you just may be something special.My gratitude goes out to Mr. Shyamalan for going against the norm.  May more like him come to the fore.PS.  Just wondering if anyone else put together the connection between the end revelation and Samuel L. Jackson's wardrobe.  Pretty sly of Mr. Shyamalan, no?",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good film,"Good film. David's first adventure as a superhero was magnificently done. He walks into a train station, bustling with people, and lets his instincts take over. Just by touching people, he can see what terrible things they've done (kind of like John Smith on USA's ""The Dead Zone"", but not as extreme), for example, shoplifting, race violence, and date rape. But when he brushes up against a man who had committed cold-blooded murder, David leaps into action. He follows the man to a house he has taken over - both parents are dead, but the two children are still alive. The confrontation is also very well done. No words are spoken; there is no flurry of blows or martial arts moves; simply one man taking another man down in a way that any of us might do in similar circumstances.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Not another Sixth Sense.,"This is probably the best movie to come out this year. Yes I know that's not saying alot, since this has been one of the worst years in movies since the 80's, but Unbreakable is a really top notch movie.  I just want to warn all of you that do goto see this movie, DO NOT GO IN EXPECTING TO SEE A REPEAT OF THE SIXTH SENSE! Yes this is a real thinking movie, yes it's got one hell of a twist for and ending, but this movie has nothing to do with dead people.  This is a movie that goes into a much more surreal environment, the world of comics, but the way M. Night Shyamalan does it, is incredible, not once did I feel like I was watching some cheesy flick and expect people to have bullets bounce off their chest or fly thru the air and to make you feel better, it doesn't happen.  I really spent the whole time just watching and waiting to see how it unfolds.I will not deny, sixth sense didn't take much to figure out what was going on, I knew the answer half way thru the movie, but Unbreakable, doesn't end with an answer in that way, it ends with probably the most incredible eye popper I've ever seen in a movie.See the movie! I can't wait to get the DVD, this is one of those movies, like, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and Usual Suspects, The (1995) where I can watch over and over and I know I'll just keep picking up those little visuals and pieces of dialouge that I didn't notice before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A fascinating homage,"Unbreakable is refreshingly different.  I think I have an advantage in the fact that I've seen it, but not The Sixth Sense, so I am able to judge it on its own merits without comparing it to the director's previous endeavor.I could tell from the audience's reaction that it went over their heads. The slightly surreal lighting has been criticized by some as making everything too ""washed out."" Sigh.  These people do not get it.  It's *supposed* to be that way, to emphasize and mythicize the ordinariness of the main character's life to comic book proportions.  It's part of the homage, people!Jackson's performance is especially subtle and compelling. His character is an excellent device that attempts to explain to the audience, many of whom aren't getting it anyway, what's going on in a way that doesn't dumb the information down or condescend too much to the peanut gallery. (It's done a bit here and there, particularly with one of the last lines of Price's mother's character, but not too often.) Instead, it generally fits in perfectly with the building of his character.The movie is not without flaws. The crash flashback, I thought, could have been edited down a bit -- a bit slow in parts.  But the slow pace also works to the film's advantage.  It gradually unfolds in such a way that it makes you wonder what direction the plot will move in next.  This is not the film I expected from the trailers, and I'm delighted to say it's far more interesting.  I rather wonder what it might have been like had Terry Gilliam directed it -- probably even better.  If I had to reduce it to a ""star"" rating, I'd probably give it 3.25 - 3.50 out of 4.I plan to see it again, and that's a rare thing for me to do. If you like comic books, you'll like Unbreakable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Unbreakable! What a classic,"Unbreakable! What a classic. M. Night Shyamalan really took the superhero genre and flipped it on its head with this one. It's such a slow-burn, introspective take on the idea of ""What if superheroes were real, but grounded in reality?""Bruce Willis as David Dunn is so understated but powerful in his performance. He just exudes this quiet strength, and his journey of self-discovery is handled so well. That scene where he's lifting weights in the basement? Iconic. It's such a simple moment, but it's brimming with meaning, like he's finally starting to believe he might be more than just an ordinary man.And then there's Samuel L. Jackson as Elijah Price, or ""Mr. Glass."" Talk about a perfectly cast role. He brings this eerie, almost tragic depth to a character who's obsessed with finding his opposite. The way Shyamalan builds up their dynamic, leading to that twist ending... I mean, come on, it's such a Shyamalan twist, but it works so perfectly here.The relationship between David Dunn and his son is one of the most heartfelt aspects of Unbreakable. It's a quiet exploration of faith and trust between a father and son, with Joseph's unwavering belief in his dad adding emotional weight to David's journey. Their bond reflects the film's deeper themes of self-discovery and the quiet strength found in family, making the story not just about extraordinary abilities, but also about the human connections that ground us. It's these tender moments that give the film its emotional core, balancing the suspense with genuine heart.What I love most about Unbreakable is how it plays with the idea of comic book tropes without ever feeling like a comic book movie.

"Great, even with a few slow parts","I didn't go into this movie expecting much of anything, except that I figured it would be good based on his previous film.  Well, I wasn't disappointed, but it was a much different film from what I had expected. I really loved the cinematograpy.  This is one of the most visually interesting films I have ever seen.  The acting was great all around, especially Jackson. I loved it, but it's a film you'll have to see for yourself and form your own opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A very good movie, but maybe not for everyone.","I can't get over how other people keep comparing this movie with The Sixth Sense.  I thought The Sixth Sense was excellent.  But, despite the fact that the two movies were fairly similar, they still can't be compared.  And in my opinion, they shouldn't be compared.  This movie was fascinating to me in the way the main character (David Dunn) comes to realize that he is capable of incredible potential.  He goes through a sort of ""midlife crisis"" -- a self-realization.  Also, the story and plot isn't dumbed down like in most comic book movies, which is a huge relief.  And the fact that the movie takes place in the REAL WORLD enhances the overall effect.  Our hero isn't placed in a ""Gotham City"" or some other alternate universe, but instead is thrown into the mix with our everyday society -- in real situations.Even though I loved this movie, I still would be cautious in recommending it to others.  It isn't a movie for everyone.  Some will be disappointed, no doubt.  While I thought the character development was paced just about right, some will think it really drags out.  But for all you comic book freaks out there, and those of you who still hold onto the childhood fantasy of a world with super-heros and super-villains, you could be in for a surprise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not captivating enough!,"According to tom.kat@talk21.com of Northampton, England if anyone doesn't understand this movie we should stick to Disney, and this was better than The Sixth Sense. I am sure you think Howard The Duck should have been put up for an Oscar too. Well buddy, this movie was about as easy to understand as a Disney movie so I can understand how your small brain would think so.There was no ""Twist"" to this movie! There was nothing to twist to! There was nothing that would lead you to believe what the ""stunning outcome"" would have been like in The Sixth Sense. In that movie there were small clues left all over the film to make you realize before the movie was over.I am not going to try and compare the scripts of The Sixth Sense, to this movie because it's like comparing an apple to an orange, two separate movies.Bruce Willis's acting in the film was less than par as well. I am am fond of his acting but it seems that the whole movie he had no emotion,  and was boring. He didn't have anything there to make me sit and want to watch the whole movie uninterrupted. He is a much better actor than what he did in this film and probably knows it too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbearable,"Sitting through this tripe was a painful experience. The childish, simplistic and frankly idiotic attempt at creating duality between a ""breakable"" man and an ""unbreakable"" one makes me want to puke. Honestly, my puke would have more interesting to watch than this puerile nonsense. Comic books do not translate well into movies and this is a prime example of why directors should stop trying. I have rarely been so conscious that I was in a movie theater watching a really bad film other than maybe squirming through the awful Sin City (another comic book conversion disaster). When my friends and I left the theater after seeing Unbreakable, we were all speechless until a good friend (and fellow critic) turned to me and uttered ""unbearable"". This is the perfect catchphrase for this smelly turd of a film. Unbearable.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Yes, it is clever, but so what...","There have been many different reviews on Unbreakable, but people seem to mainly think it's either too slow, or very good and sharp.Here is my interpretation : It is slow, but that is needed to create the feel the director aimed for. It is also clever, not actually being about what most people think it is. But the main problem is, SO WHAT!M Night is trying to be TOO clever, using a many varying great effects and skills to create the feel he aimed for. Problem is, the movie's entire basis, it's entire existence for being, is just not strong enough!!!The slowness would have worked if it gave rise to an appropriate ending. The twist isn't strong enough, it doesn't warrant the entire movie sacrificing itself for the ending. It's not worth it!M Night has simply made it too refined...it doesn't work on the level of entertainment. Remember, however clever and skilled a movie might be, if doesn't entertain, it doesn't work. That's why the Sixth Sense work so well. Many levels of entertainment: The art of the atmosphere and quality of the work for the educated movie-buff, or the big twist at the end and the amazing acting boy for the average-joe movie watcher.Unbreakable doesn't achieve this. By trying to be amazing, it becomes too wrapped up with itself...trying to make each frame a masterpiece, and thus losing the true aim of any great movie...to be entertaining...on every level.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Fable about Self-Realization,"Unbreakable is quiet and moody. The style is very still and almost claustrophobic, as though the world the characters live in is very small. I liked this, but more than that I loved the story, which is about discovery... self-realization. It was something I could relate to my own life and experience. The director picked a risky subject for a big-budget film. I like the way he depicts husbands and wives; the relationship between David (Willis) and Audrey (Wright Penn) is very beautiful. I could feel their awkwardness, their sorrows, their hopes. The director is very special in that he has the ability to create a plot so grand that it bears hard on the imagination, yet he keeps his characters subtle and ordinary. This is a good balance. The result is drama, not melodrama. Due to its pacing (compare a vinyl record to a compact disc), lack of special effects, and melancholy tone (without horror or gore as a ""reason""), this film will not appeal to a lot of people. Personally, it was one of my top five films of 2000.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Better than the 6th Sense,"I may offend thousands of thriller fans who completely loved the 6th Sense, but I feel that Unbreakable topped it.With the 6th Sense, other than the twist at the end (which everyone seemed to eat up) there wasn't really much there. I saw everything in the previews for that Oscar nominee that I cared to or needed to see save the big surprise ending. I give the creators of that film kudos for the twist but feel that it takes more than a big surprise ending to make a film. Unbreakable had what it takes...a developing story along with a twist at the end.Granted the ending of this film wasn't as great a shocker but still gave me a great deal to think about. The camera work in this film was outstanding. We watched scenes take place through the chairs on a train, in the reflection of a TV screen, and through curtains blowing in the wind. The lighting in the film was also beautifully done. I loved the dark, sinister feel the movie had which coincided with Willis' inner turmoil. And the acting was very well done. I became very attached to each character...and Willis' son was a much more convincing and less pitiful character than Haley Joel Osmont's ""I see dead people..."" motif.I liked this movie...I liked almost everything about this movie. I even appreciated the bit of romance that it contained near the end. It was so precise and completely ""un-sappy.""See this movie...it's worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An almost great movie that needed more work on the ending.,"This movie was almost great.  It was very good, but when compared to Shyamalan's other big hit, ""The Sixth Sense"", I get the impression it could have been better.  Just like in the other movie, there is a good twist that's hard to predict.  But at the same time, it felt abruptly finished.  This movie could have been as great as ""The Sixth Sense"" if more time would have been spent writing the ending.  Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend this movie.  That is my only real negative criticism.  It was nice to see Willis in a movie that isn't filled with guns and explosions.  I hope he continues to take roles like this one and ""Sense"", movies that require serious acting.  With these two movies, he's off to a good start at becoming a serious actor",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Underrated gem,"While I certainly understand why some don't like this movie, I can't help but love it. The movie is striking both visually and emotionally.

Aside from some slow pacing this movie is a great and an original take on the superhero genre and one worth remembering.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Confusing but Watchable,"You just wanted to reach in the screen and tickle Bruce Willis!  That's how I felt about 90% of the time watching this movie because he's so sad and downtrodden.  But boy, he's a great actor.  All the quasi-preachiness that comes out of Samuel L. Jackson gets a little dull and confusing, but there's one hell of a twist (of course) at the end.  Spencer Treat Clark (who was one of the great kid actors of soaps) is also very believable as his loving and supportive son.  Watch for the really corny symbolism in the climactic fight scene.  It's worth going to see, especially for Bruce Willis fans. It's HIS movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Shyamalan is an original,"No matter what you think about the film itself , some might like it and some might hate it, but there is no denying the fact that M. Night Shyamalan is an original. In an industry where  studio's spend millions of dollars buying rights for remakes, sequels, adaptations  etc etc there is a filmmaker that comes up with something new which in all fairness is not a very easy thing to do.That was one of the first things that struck me while I was watching UNBREAKABLE.Even though its plot is not as riveting as THE SIXTH SENSE , I think people would appreciate it better if they would just see it as another film and not as some kind of a sequel to SENSE.There has been a lot of discussion about the ending of the film being abrupt and not satisfying enough. Without spoiling it for anyone who has yet to see the film I would only say that the ending would work for you based on how you see the film.I think whats happening is people are going into this movie expecting to be blown away by the ending like in SENSE, and its these people who are going to be disappointed.Technically the film is sound, the cinematography by Eduardo Serra is instrumental in setting the mood for the film. The one camera shot technique used by Shyamalan there gives a very observer's perspective to the film. The score by James Newton Howard is subtle throughout and is noticeable only towards the end of the film.Performances by Willis and Jackson are quite good.Willis has certainly come a long way since his DIE HARD and HARDER days. However Spencer Treat and my fav Robin Wright Penn's characters are not well defined enough for them to have any impact.Overall I would not hesitate in recommending this film to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Hunt of evil for good,"Unbreakable- end twist breaks us..
Watch in for a tea break one..if u r willing for an pleasant tea time ..
The evil insearch of good.the villain in search of hero..there comes the thrill and ecstasy of the story..
An underrated super hero like movie and made such a way to prove hero is never made..but born ..i wonder y Samuel Jackson has been playing for avengersad they might b inspired from this movie i think so very few characters ..small simple story line evoking the heroic character within Bruce Willis..he had nailed it and raised a loud applaud in his role..as the movie starts it starts with Shyamalans way of screenplay like the sixth sense but later on it moved way entirley different..
Screenplay- the main section where v come to admire the entire director's play..yet it may disappoint some audience as it was a normal one yet a good movie for a basic super hero subject..and may b disappointed as his last movie was an epic (sixth sense)
And last its an underrrated movie yet with some lagging story and slow running..with plot holes",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
what makes a classic villain so great,"Unbreakable is a film that is more of a throwback to old cereals, comic books, and old movies starring a single hero. This movie gives viewers of all ages a chance to see a hero that doesn't need a gun, who relies on instinct. The villain is what truly captures the story lets a person see that the mind has and always will be more powerful then any fist,or gun. Unbreakable gives you the opportunity to escape and believe again in super heroes.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Moody and interesting,"Not surprisingly, the movie has a similar melancholy feel to sixth sense (excuse me for being monotonous).  I'm no expert, but I suspect that this is a trademark of the particular director.  Don't get me wrong; ""Unbreakable"" is a good flick.  I was kept wondering what was going to happen next.  It turns out that the story has pretty much been done before, but the moody aspect and the excellent acting makes it different enough to be interesting.It has been commented that Bruce Willis's performance was wooden.  Well duh. He was supposed to be a sad and dispirited man.  The viewer is even directed clearly to this observation via Mr Willis within the dialogue!  How else was he supposed to portray the character?  Perhaps with a song or two? I thought he did it just right, once again proving that he is an extremely versatile actor.If your criteria for a good movie are limited to action and special effects, or slightly brain-damaged, but nice looking teenagers, then I suggest that you give this one a miss.  On the other hand, if you are like me and like a movie to be original and done with art and skill, regardless of the genre, then I recommend this movie to you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Read only if you want to know what it's about,"Finally a movie that the preview and commercials do not give away the whole thing. In fact, this movie didn't give anything away in the trailer. I loved it, but I can see why some people will hate it. First off, when someone goes into a super hero movie such as Batman or X-Men they know that they are walking into a comic book movie. But with Unbreakable, people are tricked into seeing a comic book movie which I personally think is awesome, but most people will just feel like a comic book nerd. I don't read comics, but I am interested in heroes. This was the greatest development of a superhero without the use of a flashback. Samuel L. Jackson is the perfect super villain, but what makes him so perfect is that he is real. He has a real reason to hate, not only because he was born the way he is and was called Mr. Glass his entire life, but because he is so obsessed with comics that he wants his own life to become one. He truly is crazy. Shymalyan did an amazing job with this film and he truly surprised me, not so much with the ending, but with the entire thing. Maybe this movie will only get respected by a larger audience when there is a sequel made because society doesn't care about background stories, they just want to see people with super human powers save the world such as in X-Men. All are great movies, but Unbreakable is by far my favourite ""super-hero"" movie to date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Different kind of superhero drama,"This movie is great back to back hit for M. Night Shyamalan after The Sixth Sense. This movie showed us different kind of superhero drama.After the introduction of Mr. Glass, you can tell that something isn't right but the suspense keeps on building and you can't tell what is happening until it is revealed. The most surprising thing about this film is how naturally suspense, drama and horror are blended together. Nothing really felt forced or unnatural in acting, pace, or action.The only thing which I didn't like in this movie was that the ending revealing scene was little bit rushed. Everything happened in maximum 5minutes. It looks rushed. They could have made that scene atleast 10 minutes long.Overall, this movie should be given a try. This may prove good experience for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A story of a man finally living up to his own potential,"You know you have seen a great movie if you can interpret the story on more than one level (regardless of whether or not the writer/director intended to include a sub-text).You can see David Dunn as a man who gives up on his dream as a young man because it will require risk taking and this scares him.  The ""safe route"", however, causes more damage to his life.  The story finds him deeply depressed, withdrawn, and in danger of losing the two most important people in his life as a result.  His wife complains that he is not the man she fell in love with; and he even shrinks from his son's natural admiration, ashamed because he knows he is unworthy.Having reached the bottom of the barrel and shaken by a brush with death, he is forced to re-examine his life, find and finally embrace his unique gift. As with the rest of us, he realizes that he had several opportunities in the past to follow his unique destiny, but was too afraid or lazy to actualize his potential.We truly live in a ""time without heroes"", as observed by Elijah.  Most of us choose to sit in front of the TV, keep our boring ""soul sucking"" jobs, keep our loved ones at a distance and try to fill the holes in our lives by buying stuff we don't need.When we have moments of inspiration, we quickly stick a pin in them, and convince ourselves that we would likely fail. Mostly we are scared of how others would judge us.We choose the inertia of the ordinary rather than take risks to discover the extra-ordinary potential we all possess.Unbreakable, one one level, is about this fundamental truth about human nature and the modern age.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Pleasantly surprised,"I rented this movie mainly because there was nothing else I wanted to rent, but I must say that the movie was better than expected.Personally, I liked the comic book references and comparisons.  I was once a comic book collector back in the 90's, and so my interest in the movie peaked at the notion of someone being a superhero (or rather a superhuman, since Bruce Willis seemed to be ""unbreakable"" and since he possessed a (forgive the pun) sixth sense for discovering unethical people).Watching the commercials back several months ago, I did not realize then that the comic book industry or views were so entangled with the plot of the movie.  Had I known this, I might have watched the movie either in the theatres or as soon as it was released.Obviously, if the viewing public were told that this movie was about comic books (or rather they helped develop the plot), the movie would have likely been less successful and lost integrity.

Genius film maker! Simply amazing...,"(A+) M Night Shyamalan has just made my top 5 directors list. This was simply an amazing film and, like its predecessor, it has affected me greatly once again. And who ever said that Bruce Willis' acting is not satisfactory in this movie is sadly mistaken. Once again, he was really good.When I exited the theater, all I could think of was how talented the creator of this movie is. I was really worried that he's nothing but a one-hit-wonder -- but he's not! ""He did it again!"" as some of the previous reviewer's have said.The movie contains many great shots and many symbolic scenes (if you watch closely). Everyone involved in this movie did a tremendously good job. And if this movie won't get nominated for an Oscar I'm gonna get really p***ed.Samuel L Jackson was also fantastic as Elijah Price - the total opposite of David Dunne (Bruce Willis). Both characters were VERY believable.And even though the idea for this movie is really quite uncanny, you can almost believe that something like that could really happen.One piece of advice to those who haven't seen the movie yet but enjoyed Sixth Sense. Don't compare the movie to Sixth Sense, and forget what you heard about this movie. Just go to the theater with a fresh mind and expect so see a great film.Just like Sixth Sense, it was a beautiful supernatural drama.

"Comics are cool, not!",'Unbreakable' has a a unique and original storyline and it is a worthwhile successor to 'The Sixth Sense'. The movie has a secret undertone to make comics look 'cool'. (Maybe the directors personal view on comics??).The acting combined with the camerawork is excellent and has a distinctive Shyamalan trademark. Bruce Willis is on top form as a paranoid security guard with mixed feelings towards his new powers.The movie moves along brilliantly.. until the ending. Some viewers will walk away at the end with mixed feelings.I don't know what was going through the directors head but I feel a better conclusion would have made this a great movie.However I would still recommend this movie simply because it will make you think about life and the scary things going on around you.,6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Absorbing,"Director M. Night Shyamalan has a way with depth and emotion in his latest movie, ""Unbreakable"". After watching the extended footage and interviews with Shyamalan from ""The Sixth Sense"" DVD, I was quite confident that I would be able to spoil any surprise ending he could throw my way. It is clear that Shyamalan is incredibly gifted in the art of misdirection. I honestly had no clue how the movie would end, and it was very rewarding in a way that ""The Sixth Sense"" was not.""Unbreakable"" isn't a tearjerker.. This isn't a movie aimed at your heart nearly as much as it's aimed at your mind. ""The Sixth Sense"" was, in my opinion, much more of a warm and fuzzy movie than ""Unbreakable"" is. A lot has been said about how Shyamalan movies end. Without giving anything away, I'll just say that this one is much more open to conversation than ""The Sixth Sense"" was. After we left the theater, it was very rewarding to talk about the ""clues and hints"" that were placed in the movie along the way.. and of COURSE we were left with the feeling that in no way has Shyamalan cheated the viewers, or created something that isn't coherent.Bruce Willis has come a LONG way in his acting abilities. I never would have guessed that his career would have taken this path. I sort of mentally typecast him in ""Die Hard"" and ""Armageddon"" type movies for the rest of his life. Its clear that he is a capable actor with a broad range of facial reactions and emotion. Half of the fun of ""Unbreakable"" is watching Bruce Willis react to his enviroment as we slowly begin to understand whats going on.I can only hope that M. Night Shyamaln's career is just starting, and that many more movies are to come like this one. They just keep getting better and better. I'm still frustrated at myself for not figuring out the ending however ;) I guess that is the way Shyamalan likes it. Fine by me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

And Yes....It's That Good,"Last night, I had the privelage of going to see the film ""Unbreakable."" After seeing ""The Sixth Sense,""  I was hoping to find a movie that was as good, if not better, than that.  I was not dissappointed.The story is based around David Dunne (Bruce Willis) who is the sole survivor of a devestating train accident.  He is later contacted by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) who believes he is, well, unbreakable.  The first part of the movie deals with Elijah tring to convince David of his gift, which leads to the second part of the movie.The last 45 minutes of this film was intense.  Some of the most intelligent film work was done here.  There is one camera angle with billowing curtains (when you see it, you will be amazed too) that was beautiful and stunning. Also, there are some of the scariest moments (I've ever seen) in this movie.  The entire part with the guy in the red suit had my teeth chattering.  And of course, Shyamalan had a trademark surprise ending.  This one, as in T6S, hits you like a ton of bricks.  When it is revealed, I actually gasped.Not only is the camera work excellent, the acting is also superb.  Bruce Willis is fantastic.  He should work more often with Shyamalan because it brings out the best in him.  Sam Jackson was also very good, bringing a dark and creepy edge to his character.All in all, another exellent film by the crew who gave you T6S.  They better pick their next movie carefully, because if it won't hold against these two 10's, no on would buy it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Real Life Doesn't Fit Into Little Boxes That Were Drawn For It...,"In my opinion, Unbreakable has always been underrated. Maybe it's because I bought so thoroughly into the legend of M. Night Shyamalan after The Sixth Sense. I love his filmmaking style and the tension he builds so easily through predominantly silent storytelling. He says so much with movies that have very little dialogue. He spun this to perfection with The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village and of course, Unbreakable. It was inevitable that he would fly too close to the sun and be forced back to Earth when he started worrying more about the twist than the storytelling with his later films. He managed to return to his roots with Split but by then his legacy had been too well tarnished. Even so the previously mentioned films have held up well for twenty years and are still enjoyable every time I watch them again. Bruce Willis does his best work when he doesn't have to say much so no wonder he was so successful with his Shyamalan pairings. That being said, Samuel L. Jackson is the real hero of this comic book fantasy. This was filmed when he was still in the thralls of being a good actor and hadn't yet turned into a caricature of himself. He is magnificent! I know the movie is heavily criticized for a number of reasons, but I am unabashedly a fan and will always watch it when it pops on a streaming service or a particular cable network.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Missed the mark,"I saw The Sixth Sense over ten times, so of course the minute a new M. Night Shyamalan movie came out, I saw it. I truly expected better then what I got. Every scene had a new ""trendy"" camera angle, that frankly got tiring after the fifth one. Every scene was either shot from a reflection in a mirror, or t.v screen, or through a window. It would have had more effect if it wasn't so overdone throughout the whole movie. Also, too many aspects were like The Sixth Sense. Just like in that movie when something was significant, it was the color red. In Unbreakable, everything significant was a bright color, either red, yellow, or orange. And once again, M. Night made an appearance himself, I suppose thinking he is as clever as Hitchcock. What I listed above is not as bad as the ending. Of course I can't give it away here but it ruined what could have been an ok movie. Now it is just a disappointing waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Landing flat on the thin line between being incredibly cool and incredibly silly.,"""Unbreakable"" shares many positive attributes with its predecessor, ""The Sixth Sense"", not including the creepy, Philadelphia setting.  It too, is excitingly original, deftly mixes moments of genuine humor with episodes of human tragedy, features an excellent performance by a child actor, and above all, expertly inflicts on us chilling moments that will make you jump out of your seat while at the same time avoiding the distinction of actually being a horror film.Also like ""The Sixth Sense"", Willis makes a remarkable discovery about himself.  What that discovery is lands flat on the thin line between being incredibly cool and incredibly silly.  I'll side marginally with incredibly cool since Shyamalan's concept and execution is so original, and it's hard not to like a filmmaker who's production office is in Conshohocken, PA.That said, the movie's primary flaw is its slack pace.  Bruce makes the discovery early on (there's another surprise at the end) and you'll wish his revelation had been explored more during the film's second act.  Then, when things finally get going in Act Three, we're hit with an ending that feels too abrupt -- you'll yearn for a more thorough confrontation (you'll also feel like this was all a set-up for a sequel).If ""Unbreakable"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" belong to the same family tree, then the newer branch is one that goes off in a much wilder direction.  Both films deal with the isolation of being ""different"" as viewed through the prism of an everyman.  But where the first film also deals essentially with loss, this time the focus is more on the evolution of myths and the reflective nature of reality and fantasy in a manner that pays the ultimate tribute to comic book geeks everywhere.  Wait, maybe I've said too much!...",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Solid Storytelling,"I purposely avoided all reviews of this movie before I saw it, knowing that they would let something slip and give it away.  So, I will describe the movie rather than tell the story.  It builds solidly on the expectations evoked by Sixth Sense.  If you accept the slightly fanciful premise (which I did, wholeheartedly) the movie is an intricate exploration of said premise. The layers and details make this an extremely rich film.  The acting was excellent and the directing superb.  Long live M. Night Shyamalan!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbreakable Cinematography,"The thing that stick out at me most, was the cinematography and how good it was. And the realistic portrayal of a person with power.And how the story was so down to earth and relatable, Subtle performances what helps a lot, and people with real existential problems like what am I doing with my life and Why am I not happy.It can't be understated, How good the movie looks it has a very dark contrast and the camera angles that are so long and drawn out that it forces you to be in the room with the person.Dialog was good, dynamic between the characters, just a really good movie all around and will recommended.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A smart, quiet thriller","Wow, I was really surprised to see so many negative comments for this film. [Although, I guess I understand the angry folks -- I felt the same way after ""Signs"" (loved the movie until the final five minutes, walked out completely furious at the smug silly ""twist"").]But I personally was blown away by ""Unbreakable"" -- although I'm not a huge Shamalayan fan (thought ""Sixth Sense"" was good, but that it doesn't hold up well under repeated viewings IMHO).  However this film is intelligently written, beautifully acted, and offers a lovely, melancholy glimpse at a hero's own self-recognition. The characters are all so wonderfully drawn, and feel very real.  Jackson is a revelation as always in his role, and Willis is genuinely moving as a hero who moves through the world in almost constant, quiet pain. The cinematography is beautiful, the direction quietly assured (notice that Glass is almost always viewed first through a reflection of sorts), and the score is gorgeous as well.I'd recommend it to those who love a good thriller, or who are seeking something intelligent and grown-up, off the beaten path.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Super Willy Is Keepin' The Streets Safe And Tryin' Not To Drown.,"Unbreakable is a unique take on a superhero movie. Of coarse, there have been 137,428 superhero movies released in the last 15 years or so... Part of what makes it unique is that it doesn't claim to be a superhero film. In a way, Shyamalan tricks the audience into watching a live-action comic book story. Some of the cinematography is framed like a comic book, with drastic angles and colors.I hadn't seen this movie in over a decade and it was better than I remembered. However, since the release of 'Unbreakable' (2000), technology has allowed for some really amazing comic book films that feature actual comic book characters. When compared with other films in the genre, I probably wouldn't choose to watch this again.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

"Good ideas, okay execution","But oh Lordy was the dialogue bad. I mean very, very, very bad. Bad to the point that my cousin my girlfriend and me almost walked out. Also it took quite while for anything to happen. But when it did it was kind of worth it. And being a comic book fan myself I appreciated it more than most.I think it was a good idea for pretentious director of several undeserving blockbusters.M. Night Shyamalan to film this movie in widescreen. As you probably know from my other reviews, I hate flat photography. The Sixth Sense was made this way and I found it very irritating as the story deserved some scope. Also, this film was way better than Sixth Sense and I found the twist to be more wholesome and pleasing.The kid who plays Willis' son looked uncannily like Haley Joel Osment and Samuel L. Jackson made a BIG mistake with the afro. But his performance was still good. It's good to see that actors and directors take comic books seriously as authentic literature rather than classifying them as 'geeky' things. For that I like the movie despite the abominable dialogue.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic Alternative Look at Superheroes,"Most superhero movies follow a very specific plot and M Night Shyamalan recognizes this and flips it on its head to not make fun of the traditional plot but deliver an alternate interpretation of what a superhero is and how humans have become fascinated with them.Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson are both wonderful in their respective roles as David Dunn and Mr. Glass. The supporting cast also plays off of them very well. The dialogue is good between several characters throughout.I viewed this trilogy in an unconventional way not realizing they were even related. I saw Split first and thought it was fascinating and then was a bit let down by Glass. I didn't even realize this movie existed until after seeing those two, so I will have to revisit Glass and see if that changes how I view it now.I am admittedly a huge fan of M Night Shyamalan as he has shown the ability to make successful films in a multitude of genres. He's also not afraid to take a risk. Although some of his twists don't satisfy everyone, he always keeps me on my toes. I appreciate this to most modern day filmmaking that tries to play everything safe.More films like unbreakable would be welcomed from me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I broke it,"A man who mysteriously survives a train wreck gropes for the purpose of his life after meeting a stranger who sees the fantastic in the ordinary.A superhero story that emphasises the ordinary and mundane, as the hero plods along in the acceptance that his life is failing - from a compromised marriage, awkward fatherhood, and sacrifice of ambition. The anti-hero cuts across this with the insight that cartoon drama is just an exaggeration of the truth and that wonderful things really can happen. Sounds good? I guess, but it's underdeveloped and badly written.The first forty five minutes have excellent cinematography, with the camera moving around the frame in a way that adds so much to the story: the side to side in the train carriage, the depth of perspective in the hospital treatment room, the use of the colosseum stadium etc. It's worth it just for that.But none of the relationships hold up - a physiotherapist wife who never realised her hubbie wasn't really injured in the fateful accident? None of it is true and clear, so the actors have to ham their way through daft dialogue while swelling strings cover up the weakness of the story. I like the idea of bringing hope to the complications of adult life, but the result is juvenile.They missed out one laugh - a scene where the babysitter explains her sister phoned to say she just got a perm that makes her look like ... But the script cut her off. Like Richard Simmons?Overall, the story rides its big production values until it gets swamped.",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Better than the 6th Sense,"When a director's first film makes you think he's good, and the second tops it, you know that he's another Speilberg. (Then again, lots of films top ""Jaws..."") This would be one of those films. Riding the success of the rather overrated ""Sixth Sense,"" M. Night Shymalan made a film that, rather than deal with superheroes as guys who fly around and KNOW their powers, made them look like they might not now that they have the power.Security guard Willis is on a train home one day when the train crashes. (Call it Nightmare at A Few Inches...) He is one of the two-wait, one, the other died soon later-survivors, and he is completely unharmed. Enter Elijah Price (Jackson), a man who has a disease that makes his bones as hard as paper. He was introduced to comic book heroes in his childhood, and owns an art gallery with (what else but) comic book heroes. He thinks that Bruce is a superhero, and then... well, from there on in, you have to see the film.Notably, if you thought that Sense was slower than a turtle, this goes at a speed of 10 out of 100. Some parts aren't made for those with impatience, but you have to go through those to get to the good parts.And finally, the twist in the end. I have seen this once (when I get the video, I'll see it again), so I wouldn't know if the twist is just a fast one or really makes sense. (No pun intended.) I won't ruin the ending, because to do so would be a crime.Rating: 5/6 Reasons: Slower pacing than a turtle is absent, but some scenes really could have been sped up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Top notch thriller, not as good as The Sixth Sence though.","At the very start of the movie we see that Willis' character David Dunn, does not have a very happy marriage as he flirts with an attractive young woman on a train, who later turns out to be married, and is among the 171 to die in a train wreck, which leaves Willis alive and unharmed.When he is contacted by Elija Price (Jackson) who has a serious disorder which leaves his bones so brittle they break like glass, where he gets the nickname Mr Glass as a 13 year old, Dunn realises something about himself. Has he EVER been sick?This thriller/suspence/Drama, is very well acted on all counts, especially by Jackson as always a fine fine performance.

quite a film,"Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"", from what I've seen, has people divided on their opinions.  You'll either love it or hate it.  Well, as subjectively as possible -- I recognize the major flaws that lie within the film -- but I couldn't help but be entranced by its hypnotic powers.  I loved it.  Hell, the film is a knock-off of Shyamalan's previous ""The Sixth Sense"".  And it's cold and unconvincing at its core.  It's also really slow and plodding, and perhaps too subtle and understated for most.  But it doesn't matter to me. I loved its subtleties, its slow pace.  It really lingers in your head for days after you see it.  There are some seriously classic scenes within that were soooo well done and soooo effective.  The end may seem like a quick shock, a cheap trick to some -- I loved it.  I hope they don't make sequels to it like I've heard -- it ended on a perfect note.  I could go on and on...but bottom line, I really loved it's subtle power and tone.I gave it an 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
What an idea for a movie,"M. Night Shyamalan does it again. An idea that works really well on film. Sometimes he don't get it just right, but most of the time he do.Unbreakable is one of those movies that are really well-made, both the idea and execution. The actors are all-time favorites of mine, and I like the fact there aren't really many characters. It makes it easier to follow, and it keeps the movie down to earth, considering the theme of the movie.The symbolism throughout the movie is something you need a couple of re-watches to get, this is the second time I'm watching it, but they're really good.PS: If I'm not mistaken, the cameo of M.

Follow us on Instagram: @flixxflyy,"This story took a big leap that didn't suit the stereotype the industry was surrounded with at the time. Logically on the shade, this plot goes around David (Bruce Wills) facing an extraordinary fate in an incident that made him come into the light. Elijah, (Samuel L.

Supernatural leading films were coming into existence but this one took the biggest leap one could have imagined and changed the standards of the 'mystery genre'. I couldn't help but notice that pace of the movie which is dull and sluggish. You would get dreary not by the plot but the speed at which the movie is going.

Perhaps the absolute worst movie I have seen in years!,"This movie definitely did not live up to its predecessor, The Sixth Sense. The plot was too far fetched to even enjoy, the acting was week, the characters were not ones which you find your self becoming empathetic for. Samuel L. Jackson, who is an extremely talented actor and usually plays the eccentric role perfectly, had his talented wasted in this movie, playing a character who was just downright weird.  The scene changes were too abrupt and the development of the characters and storyline(s) were minimal.I had been looking forward to this movie since the first time that I had seen the previews for it, but it was nothing like what I had expected. Nor was the major plot of the movie even hinted towards in the trailers. There were no big surprises or hidden nuances in this film.  Overall it felt like a money grab.At the end of the film, which I had difficulty waiting for, I felt as though I should have been reimbursed not only for my tickets and popcorn, but also for the time that I lost watching it.My advice: wait for it on your local satelite provider....I'm not even sure you could justify the cost of a video rental.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Do NOT expect Sixth Sense, it's nothing like it, but it *is* a good flick to make you think","I simply have to put in my 2¢ after seeing all the commentary about this film's ""resemblance"" to Sixth Sense.

This film isn't in the same universe as Sixth Sense.Now that that's out of the way...I thought it was a very interesting movie. Then again, I did collect comics at one time. The movie struck me as a comic book on screen. *I* don't think that's a bad thing. There *are* comic books out there that want you to think as well as be entertained, and this is the best graphic novel I've seen. If there are to be sequels, I look forward to them. (Yay!

"Good Movie, but not quite up to Sixth Sense or Signs","I must admit, I am quickly becoming a ""Night"" fan.  After having seen ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"", I had to rent this flick.  While it is certainly at a higher level of story quality than your average hollywood thriller, what ""Unbreakable"" lacks is the realism and viewer absortion of the other two movies.Willis literally plods through the first half of this film.  He seems to be constantly depressed and detached, without knowing why.  Problem is, I lost track and interest, as he detached my interest as well.Once it picks up, and Samuel L. Jackson sort of pulls us back into the film by explaining it's premise, and while I like the overall concept, the die had already been cast.  I think this is probably the reason this movie did not get the good reviews and word of mouth that the other two flicks did. I also think that the comic-book theme of this movie, while quite interesting to those who know of this field and subculture, will certainly cause the average movie-goer, and even reviewer, to lose interest.

Good Film,A good all around film with solid acting. Don't come in expecting The Sixth Sense 2 or trying to compare it to the previous film because it's not trying to be that.

As an avid comic book reader, I was quite open to the basic idea of the movie, but by giving the film a very realistic approach, the director lost the opportunity to use the comic genre as he could have. Some of the actions and dialogues of the Willis and Jackson characters therefore simply seem silly instead of fitting into the flow of the story.So all in all though this was an interesting movie, it was way too long and too slow to reach the great quality of its predecessor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Not knowing makes ""Unbreakable"" even better that its perfection","By JORGE MONTES Arts EditorLet's make it clear from the very beginning.  `Unbreakable' earns a five out of five in my book.  As far as everything goes, story, acting, directing, etc., this film was top-notch.  It deserves superlative awards all around for being just that great.However, `Unbreakable' provides an awful dilemma for me.  As a critic, I am supposed to tell you what the movie is about and if it's any good.  It's my job and I enjoy doing it well.  But I am a film critic for one reason alone; I love movies.  I'm a true movie and I love everything about the process of creating these stories through pictures and sound.  The concept is just so extraordinary for me; I want to make it a part of my life.This is the part of me that's making it so hard to review this film.It's a big of a God complex being a critic.  We go around hoping that our opinions actually mean something.  We go around hoping that somewhere out there, a person has read a review that we wrote and based on our review, decided whether or not to see a particular film.  But most of all, we go around hoping we're right.Now, for those of you who truly want to enjoy this film as much as I did, I'm going to ask you to do something drastic: stop reading my story.  Go on. Stop.  Read another review.  Try Buzz (I take just as much care with that as I do an article).  Just whatever you do, do not continue reading this article.Part of the thrill of this movie is learning what's going to happen from the film itself.  If you find yourself going out of your way to learn more about a movie than you should know, I come to tell you that as a compatriot, you're just ruining the experience of motion pictures.  `Unbreakable' has proven that for me. If you're still reading, this is your last warning because starting the next sentence, I'm talking in specifics.David Dunne (Bruce Willis) is a security guard at a college football stadium who ends up being the only surviving victim of a train wreck.  Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) is a man whom since birth has had the rare disorder called `osteogenesis imperfecta,' which means he has extremely brittle bones that shatter very easily.  Elijah has some interesting theories about why David survived.That's it.  Honest to goodness, that's the plot.  A lot of people were actually bugged when they found out the trailer told them nothing about what the movie was about.  Well guess what?  That's all you need to know.  The rest of the film is a slow-moving evolution of these simple ideas that gradually get more complex.People who were fans of `The Sixth Sense' and expecting the same kind of thing will not be disappointed, but the two films are very different in their construction.  Where `The Sixth Sense' builds with an intensity and dramatic fervor, finishing on a hidden, yet always visible ending, `Unbreakable' is much slower, lingering on characters every breath and reaction, floating like a feather to finally landing on a hidden, yet always visible ending.The greatest accomplishment in the film is that of writer and director M. Night Shyamalan.  Since his huge success with `The Sixth Sense,' Shyamalan has matured as a writer, and particularly as a director.  The story never looses its dream-like edge, feeding of the characters' personalities.  The film never needs to go too much into establishing the characters (although it does anyway) because from the very first moment on screen, it's clear who they are.Each shot is perfectly framed, often using balance to create an almost excessively perfect photo-realistic painting feel to each shot.  The symmetry is visually wonderful, yet never totally distracting and leave the audience caught in a world that they know isn't real, but they still feel a part of it.I feel I need to note the affinity Shyamalan has for comic books and how much that plays into the movie.  Now hear me out, I'm not saying `Unbreakable' is only for geeks who love `X-Men' and know the subtle nuances of the art (although it doesn't hurt).  Shyamalan has attempted to recreate the soft, shadowy feel of many modern graphic novellas while never going dark, gothic or Tim Burton on the viewer.  Many of the frames could be cut out of the reel and with the addition of thought bubbles, be turned into a comic.  The effect is that good.Ultimately though, `Unbreakable' is about more than just a great movie; it's about an audience willing to let the filmmaker take them on an unexpected ride.  Shyamalan deserves that opportunity to whisk us away and he doesn't disappoint.  It's a tad distressed to read that `Unbreakable' will be made into a trilogy because, despite an ending that you tug at for more, some things are just better left unsaid.With the holiday season finally starting, imagine `Unbreakable' as that present you got as a kid that was in an odd shape and you thought you knew what was inside but you wanted to wait until just the right moment to find out what was inside because you were honestly pretty much stumped.  As you watch the movie, let the ribbons come off and be glad you didn't tear away at any corners to take a peek.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
What if superheroes are based on reality?,"Released in 2000, ""Unbreakable"" was M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up to his most successful movie, 1999's ""The Sixth Sense."" The plot revolves around a man (Bruce Willis) who becomes increasingly aware that he possesses superhuman abilities, including invulnerability. This attracts a man on the opposite end of the spectrum who can barely go a week without injuring himself (Samuel L. Jackson). The latter is seriously into superhero-type comics and begins to see the truth about the former. Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark play the wife & son of the protagonist while Leslie Stefanson has a glorified cameo.The movie scores high points for originality as the idea that superheroes are based on real-life people adorned with extraordinary powers is intriguing. The tone of the movie is akin to the slow drama with spiritual undertones of Shyamalan's other films, like 2002's ""Signs."" Unfortunately, the ending feels arbitrarily tacked-on and leaves a sour taste. Then again, it might enhance repeat viewings.The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in Philadelphia.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
IT'S NOT THE SIXTH SENSE DAMNIT!,"I think I left out a few things in my other review of this film.  First of all, this ain't the Sixth Sense, okay?  Can you deal with that.  Don't expect the same movie.  A lot of the other reviews say, ""The ending wasn't as satisfying as The 6th Sense"".  Well, this isn't the Sixth Sense.  Did you people even notice that the plot was completely different from the first film?  I mean, just because Ridley Scott directed Gladiator that doesn't mean Hanniabl is going to have Gladiators in it.Well, enough complaining.  I will admit that the film is too slow.  I don't want action.  This is no action movie.  But some peppy music every now and then would be nice.  This is not for people with short attention spans. This movie was made for people who want to sit down, relax, and sit through an intriguing little movie.And Honestly, I DIDN'T THINK THE SIXTH SENSE WAS THAT GREAT ANYWAY! I mean, the only good part was the ending, the rest of the film was just ""okay"". You can't enjoy the Sixth Sense a second time.  The fun of that movie is all in the ending.  Unbreakable is meant to be enjoyable all the way through, instead of relieing on a twighlight zone ending.I have considered giving Unbreakable a 7 out of 10, but I loved it so much. So I give it a 7 and a 1/2.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"Like so many others, I just loved The Sixth Sense. I saw it shortly after it opened in theatres, and enthusiastically waited for the DVD to be released. Watching The Sixth Sense the second time around was just as rewarding a cinema experience as the first. Perhaps even more so. Subsequent viewings have given me even more insight into this marvelous film.So when I learned that M. Night Shyamalan was going to write and direct a new movie with Bruce Willis, I anxiously anticipated its release. I couldn't wait to see Unbreakable.I was very careful to avoid the natural desire to compare Unbreakable with The Sixth Sense. I went out of my way to try to enjoy and evaluate it on its own merits. Furthermore, I admire M. Night Shyamalan and wanted Unbreakable to be a good movie. Alas, it just didn't happen.Despite my enthusiasm, at one point I found myself nodding off. M. Night Shyamalan is a fine screen writer and director, but Unbreakable simply misses the mark. While Unbreakable is not a terrible film it is terribly disappointing. It simply lacks the depth and sophistication of Shyamalan's earlier effort. When it was all over I said to myself, ""So what!""I rate it 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Fascinating, intriguing comic book fantasy","No, this isn't a comic book fantasy like the ""Batman"" films.  This is more on the quiet side, but it's also more on the intelligent side.  M. Night Shyamalan directed this film in a way that you're intrigued the minute the images appear on screen.  Sure, those with a low attention span might not have enough patience to deal with the character development (though a few scenes were redundant and slowed things down a little) and subtle insights into the essence of comic book folklore.  Bruce Willis plays an average Joe. He delivers a very effective, yet restrained performance that should (if it hasn't yet) prove his quality as an actor, rather than a performer.  Willis' character David Dunn is a security guard at a football stadium in Philadelphia.  He has a wife and kid.  And suddenly, because of one fatal train ride, his life has taken a turn for the worst--or better.  Who knows? Everyone finds it strange and a little bothersome that Dunn was the only one to rise from the violent crash, not only alive but without a scratch.  Some find it disturbing because their loved ones died, while he--for no apparent reason--came out in one piece.  There's a great deleted scene--if you check out the DVD--where he's sorting out his problems with a local priest.  Even the priest doesn't approve of the fact that a member of his family got killed while he lived, because supposedly he's the ""Chosen One.""  Even Dunn himself doesn't know why he's the ""Chosen One"" and why he's given these powers to make him indestructable.  So that sends him out on an investigation, leading him to comic book collector Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson).  Jackson's performance is brilliant, as always.  He has even more rage towards Dunn because he's the opposite:  his disease causes his bones to be very brittle.  Dunn is like the hero in this comic book adventure and Elijah is the arch nemesis.  Like the filmmakers explained in the extra features section, there's no good unless there's evil and there's no evil unless there's good.  And the whole reason for Elijah's search for this ""unbreakable"" hero was so he can have someone to duel against.  That's an example of evil craving good.  I love the climax, where the whole story magnificently comes together and all the secrets are revealed.The cinematography is excellent.  It perfectly brings you into the film. And it's nice the way they chose different color patterns to convey the different moods in each scene, and of each character.  That's another element that was nicely explained the extra features.""Unbreakable"" is a dark, quietly fascinating thriller that kept me intrigued from start to finish.  If you're looking for loud, superficial thrills--this is not the movie for you.

Pretty Good Film,"I've been seeing people bashing this film, and some that liked it, so I thought I'd throw my two cents in. I enjoyed this film. It made you think about what might happen next. It was a ""think"" film that I had no problem following. I was with someone that I did have to explain things to, but that person wasn't paying a whole lot of attention to the film, and once I explained, they were able to understand. Thought the ending was shocking and a little reminiscent of ""The Usual Suspects"" end. This wasn't the greatest movie I ever seen, but it definitely wasn't the worst either.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good movie,"""Unbreakable"" is writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up to his surprise box office smash from last year ""The Sixth Sense"". It's not quite as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", but ""Unbreakable"" is an intriguing thriller nevertheless. Bruce Willis once again teamed up with Shyamalan and Samuel L. Jackson (who co-starred with Willis in ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"") to tell the tale of a man who's the sole survivor of a deadly train wreck which leaves him completely injury free. During the course of the film he tries to find out why he walked away from that train crash without a scratch or a broken bone in his body (hence the title). Shyamalan provides another surprise ending for this film just like in ""The Sixth Sense"". However in my opinion there's a big difference. The ending of Shyamalan's Oscar-nominated blockbuster was very effective and shocking. But I thought the ending for ""Unbreakable"" was kind of silly. Still, it's a good thriller.*** (out of four)",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A great movie!,"I think that Unbreakable was a great movie. It may not be one of my favorite movies of all time but it was pretty damn good. Most people seem not to like this movie and I am convinced it is because there are too many stupid people in this country that don't like to think. Everyone thinks they are a film critic in this country and they have not a clue what they are talking about. Ok, maybe it didn't have the shocking twist that The Sixth Sense had but it was definitely a good twist. There were many clues during the film too that indicate Samuel L. Jackson's intentions, but I won't give that away. The film also had some awesome camera shots as well as long, uninterrupted takes. Not many people seem to appreciate that though. If you're going to bash this film, come up with a good reason. I recommend it to anyone interested in film and for the people not interested in film just stick to Charlie's Angels!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"the whole, the parts","The movie has great ending, although only foreshadowed a tiny a bit. It's not really fair to set the viewers like that with out some fair waring, IMHO. The camera angles were great, but over done. It's very obvious that the director is trying to impress you with the inventive camera angles, but they don't really seem to further the story line. Those were the great parts of the movie.My big negative on this movie were the characters. The stated reasons that the character were acting the way they did, and the relationships between them all seemd like B.S. There was also a depressing lack of humor or action in between the interesting parts. The suspense was there and enough to keep me watching, but just barely.I think this was simply a self indulgent film that Shyamalan allowed himself to make in order celebrate the success of the 6th sense.

"Quite A Disappointment, But Not Completely Awful.","M. Night Shyamalan's first film, The Sixth Sense, was one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen in my life. But, however, his second feature, Unbreakable, does definitely not meet these standards.Security Guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) miraculously survives a catastrophic train crash outside Philadelphia. Not only is he the sole survivor out of 132 passengers, he also is completely unharmed. A little later, comic book specialist Elijah Price contacts him to confront David with an incredible theory: Elijah, who has been nicknamed ""Mr. Glass"" due to his more than fragile bones, thinks that David has got all which he himself lacks. The two of them ""seem to be linked by a curve, but sitting on opposite ends"". First, David does not believe the strange man, but every single thing he had said proves to be true: David has never ever been hurt or sick in his life, his physical strength is larger than normal and he has a skill which others don't. Slowly, David begins to discover the shocking truth behind Mr. Price's assumptions. But after all, David's fate is not only to find his real place in the world. It also is about proving Elijah's theory of his own existence.There are lots of good things about Unbreakable. But, unfortunately there are many bad things. The writing is somewhat rushed, while the characters are hardly developed before the action part of the film begins, and sometimes Unbreakable is just too slow and too boring for its own good. But, some of these bad things are saved by some good performances (including a blaster from Spencer Treat Clark), M. Night Shyamalan's magical directing touch and rare thrilling action sequences.Not memorable, or brilliant, but it should keep you interested for a couple of hours.I rate Unbreakable 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Thought-provoking,"First of all, I think people should resist comparing this to Sixth Sense. Certain elements may be similar, but the plots as a whole are not: they certainly do not try to tell the same story.  Thankfully, both are far from being run-of-the-mill: they present thought-provoking (if fanciful) scenarios that reward those willing to suspend disbelief based on a small set of assumptions.It's really difficult to discuss the merits of the film without giving much away--perhaps IMDB should create a section for people who have watched the film to discuss it without spoiling it for those who haven't.  Let me just say that I did not find the film boring; on the contrary, I was fascinated and found the pace to be just right.You will enjoy this film if you:enjoy indulging your imagination and asking ""What if...?""enjoyed Sixth Sense,like films that can be discussed and dissected long after leaving the theater, andare not just looking for mindless fare like Charlie's Angels.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Purple Rain,"In preparation for the upcoming ""Glass"" I decided to rewatch ""Unbreakable"" to remind me of the early adventures of David Dunn.Dunn, played by Bruce Willis, is lone survivor of a train derailment who inexplicably doesn't have a scratch on him. The reporting of the event brings him to the attention of Elijah Price (Sam Jackson) a man with hyper brittle bones caused by Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Inspired by seeing the opposite of his fragile body, and by a life of reading comic books, Elijah attempts to investigate and then convince Dunn that he is a hero and should be using his gifts.Firstly, I was stuck on how much of ""Unbreakable"" I remembered, despite it being a few years since I last saw it. Back when M Night Shyamalan could do no wrong, his trademark twist in this one seems obvious, even overplayed, once you know it. Though I do remember, whilst not on a ""Sixth Sense"" level, this was a pretty solid twist the first time I saw it. Though Shyamalan's twists became his ""trademark"", eventually to his detriment, there are a lot of other key traits of his in ""Unbreakable"" that remain there to be admired. Shot framing and particularly camera movement are excellent. The longs takes and limited cutting also are striking, with occasionally deciding to keep the character on one person in a conversation, and look at their reactions, rather than drifting backwards and forwards. The colour palette usage is also nicely done.""Unbreakable"" feels very much like what it was apparently originally envisioned to be. It's the first third of a superhero film (the character establishing section) stretch out to a full length feature. As a result it does feel a bit of an unusual film. There isn't many of the beats you would expect, it's mostly Dunn putting his family back together and coming to accept who he is (or who he might be). The films climax comes from catching a murderer who is not mentioned prior to the previous scene this occurs in. A more traditional film might have built that character more across the runtime, before having Dunn oppose him, but ""Unbreakable"" is more interested in the relationship between Dunn and Price.I'm not sure that the pacing would allow the film to stand up to too many repeated viewings, but as a film seen once every so often it very much stands up - and I'm looking forward to a proper return for Dunn and Price in ""Glass"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

gripped by storyline,"As the film evolved I was gripped by the storyline, and although the film was quite slow moving with another restrained performance by Willis, I enjoyed the directors development of the characters and plot. As I have seen Sixth Sense, I should have been ready for the twist at the end, but I was so involved in the film it came as a pleasant surprise, although more could have been made of revelation therein. I've talked to close friends about it, and opinions about it differed markedly they either enjoyed it or found it boring and unsatisfying.

"Eerie, complex, and original.","The director of the Sixth Sense once again brings us a story of invisible powers furthering one man's understanding of himself.Unbreakable is the slower, more uneven descendant of the former movie, however it definitely has more atmosphere than most thrillers produced today. The frights are somewhat manipulated, however occur at times when the audience least expect it, heightening the originality of the storyline.The story itself could have been developed and polished a little further I feel, but on the whole Unbreakable is reasonably rewarding.  Bruce Willis is excellent, as is Robin Wright Penn. Samuel L Jackson's performance is a little too affected and self-indulgent, but maybe this is what the director intended given the them of comic-book good versus evil.Overall, more original than most of the dross Hollywood feeds us, and well worth a view. We can watch M. Night Shymalan's career with interest.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Weak plot, Fine directing","After having carefully watched the movie twice, the first time on the big screen of course and the second on DVD, I came to a conclusion that is perhaps shared with the majority of people who watched this motion picture: the plot, despite the more or less unpredictable ending whose surprise factor cannot even be compared with the Sixth Sense's, remains fairly weak and generally not interesting. Personally I believe that the entire idea of superheros and superpower has been adapted to screen countless number of times and has therefore lost its impact and interest on a modern audience. On the other hand, I must say that Shyamalan's directing is impeccable and is characterized, throughout the entire movie, by a considerable amount of style and class. Under a technical point of view everything seems to be perfect, from the photography to the continuous slow movements of the camera which match perfectly the captivating rythm of the film itself. Furthermore, the director's choice of depicting the characters from far, unusual points of view seems to compensate rather well for Bruce Willis's notorious lack of acting skills. In addition, James Newton Howard's score represents ,despite the criticism, the completion of Unbreakable's technical perfection. Hence, Shyamalan can undoubtedly be considered one of the most talented of the new generation directors along with David Fincher and a few others.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie - Pity about the Last 10 seconds!,"Wow - what a great movie! The plot of this movie, which is based around the hypothesis that comic strip is a form of history telling, and that it's characters have some sort of basis in reality - i.e. people with great strength, or special powers - is pretty far-fetched, as serious movies go.However in the hands of M. Night Shyamalan, the pace of the movie rarely falters. His skill as a film maker is evident throughout, with exceptional camera work and direction - he has really brought excellent performances out of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, actors who when left to their own devices have shown tendencies to merely 'be themselves'. Also noteworthy is the performance by Spencer Treat Clark as the son of Bruce Willis' character, which is moving yet restrained, which must have been difficult after the pressure of following Osment's turn in the 6th Sense.I liked the ending, apart from the last 10 seconds which were dreadful and I cannot believe the director insisted on the 'text epilogue' which is given. In movies which are clearly not based on real life events, it is utter stupidity to have a text epilogue which suggests what happened to the characters, it would have been much better simply ending - why spoil a mesmerizing, thoughtful film by asking us to walk out of the cinema with that thought in mind? Similarly this occurred in a much less good film, Rules of Engagement, but with similar results.I did however like the general end of the movie, and would recommend it to everybody. Many people are unfairly bashing this movie and comparing it to the Sixth Sense, but in my opinion, it is a very well made, intriguing film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Good vs. Evil, but you couldn't tell.","Samuel L. Jackson has done a lot of movies and in them he has been at least fair to fairly good.

He plays this guy in ""Unbreakable"" like a fine magician and at the end of the trick you slap your head and wonder how he he did it. He deserves an Oscar!Bruce Willis does his usual, working hard to convey his character's personality and is quite good. It could be due to David Dunn's lack of personality or for that matter wisdom that people mistake for Bruce Willis poor acting.The story is much different from ""Sixth Sense"", but done brilliantly as well. Don't get into the traps of thinking this is another ""Sixth Sense"" or that we are dealing with just comic book characters.

Thoughtful and Suspensing,"Unbreakable is an early 2000 film from the director M. Night Shyamalan. Starring Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a security guard distanced from his wife (Robin Wright Penn) to the distress of their son (Spencer Treat Clark). Returning from a job interview in New York he emerges unscathed from a train wreck which kills everyone else aboard. Willis' escape catches the eye of Elijah Price, a wealthy dealer in comic-book art (Samuel L Jackson) who is a victim of a rare bone disease that causes his limbs to fracture at the slightest jolt. Elijah has an unsettling theory about David's miraculous escape from the train wreck, and a curious friendship develops.Back into his early career, Shyamalan has shown himself to be an outstanding master of atmosphere and a riveting storyteller. Unbreakable holds the attention from its first moments, an opening sequence with Bruce Willis on the train, the restlessness of the camera implying a sense of foreboding. However, the ending is less than great which is what brings the film as a whole to be less greater than what it should have been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
It simply isn't a thriller. It's better.,"Those expecting to see grueling segments of gore, and shocks to knock your pants off, listen up. This film is an utter success inandof the fact that M. Night Shyamalan has used his current celebrity to launch a film with a viable artistic intent into the public eye. The movie, based on the comic book form, takes an interesting stance on hypertextuality and the connection between film and comic book. A superhero story, Shyamalan abolishes the archetypal action and pacing of such in much the same way as he breaks free from the square frames on a comic's page. His visuals bringing Bruce Willis' superpower to the screen make it clear that he has a definitive purpose in the hypermediation of his film. Dialogue, details, and characters are beautifully engineered and performed with perfect understanding and symbolism from Shyamalan's artistic focal point. It is truly a beauty to behold. Those who criticise its slow sequences, take a step back and involve yourself with the comic-book-page coloration, slow pans in the stead of the white bars between pans, and incredible acting of the entire cast. Yes, it's better than the Sixth Sense. But don't expect a thriller. Shyamalan has broken free of the Hollywood standard of directing movies. It might be offensive to some critics that some sequences are slower, but the more slowly they pass, the more rich with Shymalan's directorial art they are. We can only hope that the critical ignorance of this film will not sway Shaymalan's motives in the future, and he will continue bringing his wonderful, viable artistic motives to his wide audience. It's beautiful. And yes, it has a twist ending.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Great Movie,"Unbreakable is a film that some of its predecessors like Pulp Fiction, and the 6th Sense, builds its plot mostly around dialog. If you are wanting to see a film full of action this isn't the film for you. But if you like a movie that spends a lot of the film in character development, subtle suspense, and thought provoking then this film is a great.Is the world that we live in balanced? If you have the color white then it is balanced by black. A male balanced by female, day by night. This is one of the themes of the movie. If a person is born with a disease of very fragile bones, so fragile that the slightest tough will break them, then does his opposite exist as well. Based on the patterns of nature then it must.Another aspect that makes this film great is the filming. The movie is based on the premise of comic books, and each scenes looks as if it is captured in frames. Its like your looking at a comic but instead of it being frozen frames, there is movement. Other aspects from comics can be associated with the film as well. In most comics the super hero has a first and last name that starts with the same letter or sound. Superman was Clark Kent, Spiderman is Peter Parker, Here the heroes name is David Dunn. Comics also use color to represent main characters within the story, Mr. Glass always has the color purple, David Dunn green, and many others in the movie have a particular color scheme.This is one of my favorite films and would recommend it to any person who claims to be a movie fan. It takes you on a ride that keeps you on your seat guessing what is really true. It puts you in the world of a comic book, but seems like an everyday occurrence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Very well done film about self-discovery and remarkably; works as a superhero film as well.,"About three quarters of the way into Unbreakable, I was thinking of some very high praise indeed of director M Night Shyamalan; I was thinking that this film that he has made here is probably what 2000s X-Men would've looked like had Stanley Kubrick still been alive and had he been obscure enough to take on such a project. High praise, indeed. Oddly enough, X-Men came out in the same calendar year as Unbreakable but sadly, that is where the similarities end.So if Unbreakable is Kubrick crossed with X-Men, it should be an up in the air, some good-some bad, topsy-turvy picture about characters who have problems whilst at the same, maintaining a strong visual and aesthetical sense when dealing with themes and notions  erm; well Unbreakable does have an impressive cast and it does slowly, in an eerie and mythical sort of a way, build up to a point where it explodes in a bout of emotion as a certain character suffers an epiphany that lasts a few scenes; but apart from those things, Unbreakable is a steady if not unspectacular ride through the actual psyche of a superhero. Unbreakable was made at a time when super hero films were not really of a common nature: Batman had been and then been respectively killed off; Superman had enjoyed some success but had died a death following a lacklustre 80s sequel or two and most other superheroes like Flash Gordon or Supergirl were given nothing more than camp live action cartoons for films.But then you have Unbreakable, a film that has its idea as: What if you were a superhero, you just didn't know it yet? David Dunn (Willis) plays everyday man-come-superhero who is stronger and more aware than he thinks; using telekinetic powers and the ability to predict things before they have a realistic chance of happening. Then you have Elijah Price (Jackson), the fittingly named Mr. Glass as his bones are so weak, he so much as even sneezes violently, he could do himself some serious damage. There are two things that play on the audience's minds from this: the first is Dunn's moody and depressed attitude he has but also his mysteriousness that he carries, especially after surviving a train wreck in the first scene. The second is the vulnerability to Price; a man who would be willing to chase a man down a flight of subway stairs if it meant putting himself at great risk, but proving to himself at least, that he was correct in assuming something. This is where we wince and cringe as Price puts himself at risk for various items of information; an impressive thing to be able to do in a film.Close attention has also been paid to the way the film looks and the way it has been shot; I think Shyamalan has, in all of his films regardless of overall quality, shot and produced wonderful cinematography to capture the mood and feel of the film; be it of the depressing, dreamlike or fairytale variety. Here, the long takes and bleak cinematography compliment the camera work which is vast in its moving around and tracking as it focuses on its subjects. The camera-work retains a certain point of view feeling; there the very first scene to talk about in which we see Dunn and a random woman talk on the train; we see it from through the gap in the seats in front, retaining a child-like quality for the composition since I feel it's the sort of thing a child may do when fed up and sitting on a train; this echo's Shyamalan's later film Lady in the Water which itself was a child-like fable. But, there is also sweeping camera over the roof of Dunn's car as he finds the note from Price; again, this was a sort of point of view composition as the director utilises reflections and patterns on screen.I think Unbreakable is a fascinating film for other reasons, though. I think it's quite funny how, nearer the beginning, Price tries to talk to Willis' character about how he could well be this hard-bodied superhero and Willis plays him down. This is, of course, Willis going against what he had been doing practically his whole career up to this point: playing the hard-bodied action guy but now he is denying that he has any kind of those characteristics; interesting to read further into it, is that Willis played a clam and more sedate character in Shyamalan's previous film The Sixth Sense. However, while the look of the film is impressive and the camera work long, slow and deliberate; Price seems to be convinced a little too easily that Dunn is his man since there are more disasters that happen in the world that Price would lead us onto believe; does the man Price is looking for have to be American? There is also the segment that focuses on Dunn trying to re-fall in love with his estranged wife that seems a little out of place in a film all about finding ones identity within.But while the climax and the denouement would have Dunn rather obviously facing his fears whilst systematically coming to terms with whom or what he is, some may complain it is too short and sudden to be entertaining and too incidental to feel original. While these are small complaints, Unbreakable remains a strong and teasing picture about self-discovery; about what it's like to find yourself and about what it's like to help people; to stand up and be responsible when you discover you are able to be. Shyamalan may not have made a masterpiece but he has made a film that is interesting and unpredictable for the best part while making us want more after it has finished.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Mediocre people will think this is mediocre,"The last time I walked out of a screening almost in tears was about four or five years ago. Back in a film theory class. The film? ""Searching For Bobby Fischer."" A tale about a seemingly ordinary kid who realizes that -- though the help of a mentor -- he might be blessed with some sort of hidden talent.Sort of along the same lines, this film is kinda what you'd get if you crossed ""Fearless"" with an ""X-Files"" episode and ""Searching ..."". A guy survives a train wreck and slowly --with the help of a ""mentor"" (quotes deliberate) -- suspects that he might have a ""gift"" that allowed him to walk away unscathed. (I say no more).This is a beautiful, slowly unraveling gem of a film about the true potential each and everyone has -- but usually squanders by becoming part of mainstream society. As one character says: ""These are mediocre times,"" so maybe there's a socio-economic reason behind why this film is being coolly received by some. Mediocre people will not like this film. (And there's a lot of you out there.)There are some interesting similarities between this and the director's previous film, ""The Sixth Sense"": Bruce Willis, the twist ending, the symbolism of glass (broken or not), the emotionally frigid wife, the messed-up kid, and so on.Comparisons end there. In actual fact, I think this is a better movie than ""The Sixth Sense"" as the tone of this movie is a little bit more consistent. (It's also darker, but without quite as much bloodletting.)So, were there any problems with ""Unbreakable""? Three, to my tastes:1) There shouldn't have been credits over the *brilliant* opening scene -- not counting the prologue. The identity of the camera's point-of-view during that long, back-and-forth shot between David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and the woman on the train is a subtle touch2) There's a scene half-way through the movie involving Dunn's son that's a little over-the-top and perhaps out of place, character-wise. Actually, the scene (along with a trim to one just after it) could have been taken out and it wouldn't really affect the plot. I think if people are getting lost -- this scene in question is the one that's causing people to scratch their heads a bit.3) The ""twist"" comic-book-like ending. Really unnecessary and it feels like a gimmick than something which adds to the story. And, upon thinking about it, it rather cheapens the entire movie.Two or three minor trims (that would taken maybe five to seven minutes out of the film) and this would have been a master-stroke. But what remains is still an intensely beautiful movie. Don't believe the negative criticisms -- this is a great film, and it's probably better than 95 per cent of the stuff unspooling in cinemas at the moment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Highly underrated and misunderstood movie,"Movie
I love this film. I'm the only person I know who doesn't hate it, but I cannot fathom why it gets such a bad rap from everybody. It seems that Shyamalan's films have this a running theme - with the notable exception of the Sixth Sense, which pretty much everyone seems to get. He makes movies that are very subtle, and which seem to need you to focus on them just right to fully grasp what he was trying to do. I've enjoyed all his movies, but for me the alien part of Signs takes a lot away from what I believe to be the central storyline and as such the whole movie suffers a little. Yet I know other people who think Signs is his best, specifically because of the way the alien plot line accentuates the central one.Unbreakable is a beautifully simple film, but I think it has to hit you just right for you to completely get it. All the actors nail their parts, particularly Bruce Willis and his kid. Shyamalan takes an interesting (if slightly fringe) theory and puts it in a real world context, with a real family. Somehow he manages to never go overboard with it and - for me at least - it gripped me from the first moment to the last. Samuel L Jackson's character history is really nicely crafted in the middle of the other plot lines and you get genuinely involved in the people Shyamalan has created.Don't get caught up in all the talk of the twist ending. The ending is good, but if you spend the whole movie waiting for this tumultuous twist you'll inevitably be disappointed, and the movie stands alone without it.Don't go into this movie expecting another Sixth Sense or Signs.

So below,"Sometimes a film comes along that makes a point so poignantly that irrespective of the success of the performance, scoring, storytelling and cinematic vision of those involved, the underlying truth of that point cuts through the darkness, like a searchlight to the lost. The point is, why do we all love superheroes? Because we beg to believe there is more to humanity than the scientifically and medically prescribed. Unbreakable is a superhero's superhero movie, it dares to suggest there may be more to our mundane existence than the immediately provable. If we didn't believe that, then we would never suspend our disbelief. Why is this movie brilliant? Because it attempts to fundamentally challenge our belief in superheroes, relying purely on what you see, perceive and experience.Are you experienced?",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An Underrated Modern Classic,"I'm shocked to see that right now, 17 years after the release of this movie, only 300.000 people had rated it, and has a 7.3 total average. This movie deserves so much more. 
 I'm gonna get technical first, and then I'll analyze it's simbolism and meaning more deeply.
 The plot is a thrilling story, extremely careful assuring it hasn't plot holes or conveniences. The story develops differently in each scene, and gets progressively more unrealistic. Right from the start we get to know the characters (David Dunn and Elijah Price), both in very good sequences, filmed, almost entirely, in only one take. The whole movie is filmed with great sequences and shots, resembling to the comic books panels, with low camera movement and very simmetric shots. It make me think on Alan Moore's 'Watchmen' because of how the perspective changes slightly on panel to panel. Attached to this is the color palette, each character wearing a distinctive color, in a sometimes contrasting or matching environment. 
 Enough with the technical. Let's dive deeper. The way the movie loses it's realism throughout the scenes is a very realistic iteration of how would be the life if superheroes were real, and how this gifted beings would discover and develop their powers, and weaknesses, slowly and with baby steps before jumping to the sky and start punching bad guys, figuratively speaking. The figure of the villain is also well portrayed here, showing how a comic book villain reacts to the world surrounding him, he's motives and how he feels about the hero. 
 If you are expecting a Marvel or DC like superhero movie, this is not your type of movie. This can't be fully considered a superhero movie, though. It's much more than that, just as 'The Dark Knight'.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
oh so close to great,"I thought that the 6th Sense was the best movie I had seen in a long time, so I made a point of seeing Unbreakable on opening night.  While the two movies had some similarities, Unbreakable is a different type of movie from its predecessor, and perhaps suffered from my expectations being so high.99% of the movie I would rate as being good to outstanding, however the last minute of the movie killed it for me.  After revealing the surprise ending, which was almost as satisfying as that of the 6th Sense, the movie closed with two sentences shown as titles on the screen telling us what happened next.First of all, I think this technique is more effective in comedy, such as the end of Animal House (although sometimes even these fall flat), or in movies based on a true story, Music of the Heart being a recent example.Secondly, and more importantly, the explanation these titles gave for Unbreakable were unbelievably trite and anti-climatic compared to how strong the story for the rest of the movie was.If Shamalayan could have come up with a better way to close the movie, I would have given it a 9 or 10 rating.  As it is, I think I am being generous to give it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"""Unbreakable"" is annoyingly slow but I like it!","A few months before ""Glass"" was premiered, I discovered ""Unbreakable"" in Netflix. The plot was so good that I decided to give it a try.The movie is an interesting take in what I called ""Comic-book genre"" because it has superheroes and villains in them. In this movie, David Dunn (Bruce Willis) starts wondering if he has super abilities after he is the only person to survive a train accident.Elijah Prince (Samuel L. Jackson) will try to convince him he probably is a superhero.The story is actually magnificent. We follow David Dunn in his journey of self-discovering and trying to understand what's happening with her. Simultaneously, we see the problems that he encounters with his family because this is also a family drama.There's a lot to praise about this movie because what it achieves is extraordinary. Except for one slight thing, the pacing is slow as F*. This movie feels too long because it remains 106 minutes but almost 90% of the movie is the self-discovering process and the questioning everything about his life and just like 10% of the comic book action.

"Decent film, but too much like Shaymalan's last movie","I disagree with everyone who says that M. Knight Shaymalan has succeeded again. The fact is that he is trying to do the same thing twice. The movie is the same as The Sixth Sense. Throw a little boy in, have what seems to be a regular guy turn into the ""hero"" and then throw in a twist at the end to make it all work. Problem here is that the script fails to change anything from his first movie.

UNBREAKABLE - A Lay man's perspective,"Well if you ask me whether I like the movie or not. I don't know!! but believe me many would say the same words. Of course Like all manoj night shyamalan movies there is Philadelphia, a snail paced script and some twist in the end. But then when you want to see a thriller it should be a roller coaster ride. Unlike Hitchcock or Spielberg this story spends time (more) time with its characters.Nothing spine chilling but no crap too. If you are looking for some jaw breaking thriller movie sorry you are in the wrong place. However, this movie delivers few good scenes which are shyamalan trademark. you may say I am tasteless freak but excuse me there is no two way to script thrillers. if its engaging then its good If not then its not. This movie scales in between these extremities.This could have been better in all terms Including camera, script, lighting, etc. But direction was commendable and characters looked real. One last request to few people who criticized the reviews for under rating it. Excuse mates if 90% don't go with a movie it's bad movie there's nothing to brag about your MQ MOVIE quotient claiming your far superior understanding of the movie.One said camera was good!, the other said script was OK and the other said music. but good movies come as a wholesome package there's no going back in that.I disappointed and i don't hate this movie but don't love it too. sorry if i am wrong.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Nearly perfect comic book movie,"Ignore the negative one star hater reviews- they are from morons who thought Matrix Revolutions and Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back are worth 9/10 stars.Yes, there is a fatal flaw in the movie with the protagonist wondering if he is indeed unbreakable. If you can accept that Bruce Willis plays a man of below average intelligence struggling to figure out his life, the rest of the pieces fall perfectly into place.Top notch acting from all involved, especially Samuel L as the rare comic collector. Intelligent comic fans will appreciate the cinematography and the philosophical discussions of their genre.This is not a Michael Bay movie, but more on par with a Christopher Nolan epic. As an origin story, it is nuanced and multi-layered.

huh??,"It's not as if ""Unbreakable"" is a terrible movie - far from it.  The main problem I have with it is it makes absolutely no sense.  Some of the performances, especially Samuel L. Jackson's, are great.  However, Bruce Willis' attempt at a performance makes you long for his roles in the ""Die Hard"" movies or his role in ""The Sixth Sense"".  It's a truly stiff, wooden performance.  It reminds you just how much Willis is and should be an action film star only.  And what did comic books have to do with anything that was happening to Willis?  Is it to be implied that he is a modern-day Superman or something?  I don't believe I understood the connection there.  Call me stupid, but ""Unbreakable"" suffers big time.

"Its clever but not groundbreaking. After The Sixth Sense, keep your hopes low.","Unbreakable is a fresh take on superhero films, long before Christopher Nolan produced the best and most grounded traditional superhero film to date. It never strays beyond the realms of believability, and is an altogether well constructed film.Samuel L. Jackson is incredible as Elijah Pryce, a man with brittle bones who struggles to find his purpose in life. Through only two or three scenes, Shyamalan and Jackson create a character we can know intimately. It becomes very clear that certain moments in Elijah's life have drastically altered his personality. For a man with one of the most commanding presences in Hollywood history, Jackson plays Elijah with shades of hysteria, patheticness and crushed self-esteem.The same can't be said for Willis, who really sleepwalks throughout the movie. Only in two scenes does Willis actually mine his talent pool to produce anything special. It really sets the movie back when watching Jackson and Robin Wright (also excellent) act their hearts out only for Willis to soberly nod in reply. Spencer Treat Clark was adequate, but after Haley Joel Osment's career-making turn in the previous Shyamafilm, Clark couldn't fill those shoes.Shyamalan's direction is the film's greatest asset. Long takes, highlights on colour, and some incredible cinematography in the film's climactic scene are just some highlights. During one of the opening scenes, while Dunn is in the hospital and a doctor checks him over, a bleeding on the nearby patient oozes slowly and then quickly throughout to highlight the drama of the scene. In addition to some thrilling scenes, there's at least one dramatic scene involving a showdown in the Dunn family kitchen that was superbly written, directed and constructed.The twist ending was a bit disappointing to me. I felt it was far less subtle than its predecessor and it doesn't change the whole film experience but at the same time I found it believable and very much in keeping with the foreshadowing and superhero theme. The reveal then cuts to white text explanation, which was probably the worst part, as the film ends not with a bang but a whimper.Samuel L. Jackson's powerful performance and M. Night Shyamalan's skilled direction are Unbreakable's greatest assets, but it slips into the very downfalls of the genre it is trying to honour.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
M Night Shyamalan - Absolute Genius!,"Before watching Unbreakable, I've seen almost every single Night film, and was amazed how a simple mind could compose such brilliance. I was the ultimate fan of The Sixth Sense, and a quite supporter of The Village, however these films didn't stay with me and excite me as much as other classics, but then Night created Unbreakable. It took me a long time to get round to watch this film, but the wait just made it even more special. this film is unlike any other superhero film. It demonstrates the superhero concept in such a unique, quite and intelligent way that you will be left thinking and amazed by the twist and storyline. once again a superb performance from one of the best in the business - Bruce Willis. His performance perfectly demonstrated the shock and scepticism that would initially hit any normal being in such a scenario; and this was aided by the brilliant direction of Night for all the cast, but Bruce's performance was truly stunning and compelling. Samuel L. Jackson also had a stunning performance as Elijah Price, a comic book enthuasist who initially discovers David Dunn's amazing and unique quality. Also new kid on the block Spencer Treat Clark acted superbly as the son of David, Joseph. Such good acting from a young lad, and is definitely one to look out for in the future. Typical of a Night film, suspense is gradually built up throughout the movie, and this increases the impact at the unbelievable ending of the film. Night made a superb decision by recruiting James Newton Howard as the composer. James created a totally new, unique and simply epic soundtrack for the film, exactly what Night wanted. The soundtrack really helps Night portray the point of the film, and really deepens the impact on the viewer at the end of the movie. Unbreakable is a brilliantly unique film, mainly due to the way that the superhero is portrayed. But the aspect of the film that makes it truly unique and shocking is the typical twisted ending. This ending will literally leave you breathless, due to the unexpected story twist, the excellent acting from Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis, and the superb soundtrack from James Newton Howard. This film will leave you breathless, and will stay with you for a long time after you watch it. Unforgettable! But watching this film will leave you feeling very hollow and a sense of sadness for two simple reasons: Night will never make a film with such an impact like this again, and you will never see a film with the superhero concept portrayed like this again. Quite frankly, 7.3 doesn't do this film justice. Decide for yourself, if you can appreciate a good film, you will most certainly agree with me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Mister glass and broken story,"This is quite late as a review but still I thought I'd write it anyways. Unbreakable is a film by M. Night Shyamalan and comes with all the things you'd expect with his earlier work. A slow burner drama, dark and brooding atmosphere, and a great story concept. The only real issue with this film is how stunted everything feels. The characters, the dialogue, amf the plot have no real sense of urgency that's needed to keep a slow burner drama alive and I feel that mostly hinges or the poor delivery from our main cast (excepting Samuel Jackson who has a stellar preformance). David (portrayed by Bruce Willis) doesn't care much for anything and based on the preformance he gives, it seems he didn't care to much about the film either. He almost always has a very non-feeling look and act to himself that makes him seem one demensional to the point that I was far more interested in the actor who played younger David than I was of David himself. Top that off with what seems like a borderline mentally abusive relationship he has with his son, and it spells disatster for a character were supposed to care about. The depression he had comes off less like he feels little to no importance or place in this world, and more like he's just a bit of an a**hole. Some scenes seemed to have no real internal logic within them and the child actor seemed to be afflicted with the same single emotion complex that Willis had throughout the film. While I enjoyed the movie, thanks in no small part to the eccentric preformance by Samuel L Jackson's, Mr. Glass, I was let down by a majority of the movie in the way it handled many scenes. It had such a tense atmosphere and great story hook but did very little with it to play on the actual drama of the film and a lot of investigative scenes in the film are handled very heavy handedly with Shyamalan treating us like we're children. With all that said, I still believe this is a must see if you enjoy Shyamalan, superheros, or slow burn dramas, so long as you go in with an open mind and focus on the storyline rather than the dialogue.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"One of the slowest, worthless, most boring movies of all time.","Unbreakable (should have been titled Unbearable)is the brain fart of director, M. Night Shyamalan, who got away with his spiritual, ghosty script in The Sixth Sense. That was creative and intriguing with an original surprise ending. But this whole movie is a set-up for an ending that never arrives. In fact, at least half a dozen times throughout the movie, I thought maybe here is where this film will come alive. But it never materializes! Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are together for the first time since Pulp Fiction. Bad Kharma! Jackson still has his Pulp Fiction hairdo and Shaft overcoat and he attempts to create a lovably, crippled character who is in actuality a serial murderer. In fact, Jackson doesn't do much besides the delivery of his lines. He seems terribly bored throughout. And Willis, although he seems to be trying, is playing a character who has never been sick a day in his life and yet has never come to that realization. He should have had this script burned. Suspension of disbelief never occurs and I felt thoroughly ripped-off. Don't waste your time going to see this abomination.

Unwatchable,"Why are some people so enthralled by this perfect example of a sophomore slump? UNBREAKABLE was a mess. I liken it to PT Anderson's debacle MAGNOLIA after such a promising start with HARD 8 and BOOGIE NIGHTS. Shyamalan clearly believes his own hype (not that the doc. on SIXTH SENSE didn't already prove that). What was this movie?? This from the man who made THE SIXTH SENSE??? No way...I thought the way MNS would handle the subject matter would be much better, much more profound and beautifully. It wasn't. Instead, it was self- indulgent and extremely self aware. It reminded me of a student thesis film, long languid shots, scattered and jarring style, the kind of movie where you can practically hear the directors arm breaking while he/she is furiously patting themselves on the back. The character of David isn't the flawed hero we want to love; he is robotic, and this doesn't change throughout the movie. Are we supposed to like a guy who we first meet while he is attempting to cheat on his wife?Sam Jackson played the same character he plays in EVERY role, a variation on his PULP FICTION character. And the ending was much less the ""shock"" it was touted as. Freeze framing with a supered text? C'mon! Were they necessary? If so, why not over a black card?? I felt like I was watching a mastercard commercial.This movie needed to be stripped down. Perhaps it would have been more endearing if the character actually had to prove something to the son and wife he had been neglecting. Making Jackson the wise mentor rather than the shapeshifting character he was would have helped.For his next movie, Shyamalan needs to be more concerned with making his stories human rather than his super ""shocking"" endings.

Shymalan impresses again....,"Over the past few years, a new name has entered the forefont of science fiction: M. Night Shymalan. His powerhouse ghost drama The Sixth Sense, with it's now-legendary twist ending, was an impressive thriller that made me nervous right from the opening credits. Now we have Unbreakable, a slow and deliberately paced mystery that manages to be one of the best ""superhero"" films I've ever seen.The thing with this movie is that it understands comic books. It understands the fans and their obsessions, and it understands the mythology behind superheroes. Bruce Willis is once again the everyman, and he shows he is not just an action actor. There's real drama here, and Willis plays it really well. Even more impressive is Samuel L. Jackson, who, over the years, has gained a reputation as the ""big and bad black dude"". Here, he's restrained. He's quiet, he doesn't raise his voice, and he doesn't curse much. It's a remarkable performance from this normally fiery actor. Robin Wright Penn combines the right mix of love and exasperation as Bruce Willis's wife, and Spencer Treat Clark, as their son, is another kid actor that Hollywood needs to look out for.Many people don't like the ending to this movie, but you know what?

Is crash survivor David Dunn really a superhero?,"When a train travelling between New York and Philadelphia crashes there is only one survivor; David Dunn... and he isn't even scratched. Shortly afterwards he is contacted by Elijah Price; a man who suffers from a condition that means the slightest accident causes his bones to break... leaking to him being nicknamed 'Mr Glass' as a child. Elijah grew up reading comics and now believes that David survived because he has superhero like powers. David is understandable sceptical but when he thinks back he can only recall one time he got injured. Does he really have superpowers or is he just very lucky?This is an enjoyable film that almost defies genre. As it starts it looks as though it is going to be a disaster movie but we see nothing of the train crash or its aftermath; just our protagonist talking on the train then waking up in hospital. Then when he survives and is approached by Elijah the viewer is encouraged to wonder whether Dunn really has powers; something he denies while his young son is keen to believe in. The story plays out like a superhero origins story where we don't know whether the protagonist has powers until it is almost over. Since this was written and directed by M Night Shyamalan a big twist is inevitable and while key aspects weren't a total surprise many key details were. Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson are on great form as Dunn and Price respectively. Similarly Shyamalan does a fine job bringing his story to the screen; eschewing the look of a typical superhero film for a deliberately drab look. The story provides plenty of tense moments; the best being when Dunn's son tries to prove his father has superpowers in just about the most dangerous way possible. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of Shyamalan's other films, fans of Willis and Jackson as well as people who enjoy superhero origins stories.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A slow build up, but interesting premise","Unbreakable truly tests your attention span as a viewer. Even though it's plot is interesting and unpredictable towards the end, the build-up towards that twist is very slow. All of the actors do a phenomenal jobs as their characters; Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson both play their roles perfectly. The characters are odd, yet believable. The only actors who fell short was Bruce's wife. She isn't in the movie for too long, but even when she is on screen, she comes across as kind of lifeless and boring. Acting aside, the plot itself is very interesting. Essentially, the story is about a man who survives a horrific tragedy and slowly comes to realize what amazing power he's been granted. Even though this premise is in no way fresh, the presentation is what sells it for me. Bruce's character truly comes across as someone who doesn't understand what is happening to them, which is realistic since that's how almost all of us would react if we found our we had powers.

Unbreakable review,"Strength is one of the resounding themes of superheroes; they protect the innocent lives around them because they are weaker, and it's their responsibility to use their superior strength for the greater good. Superman, Spiderman, Captain America...they've all learned to use their powers for the good of humanity through various experiences.Unbreakable is a unique movie that does this very same thing, only without superheroes per se. It still draws strong parallels between the world of comic books and reality, building on the idea that everybody has varying levels of strength and weaknesses. Most of this movie is about the main character discovering his strengths, and then figuring out what to do with it. There's no real action to this, but the film maintains interest because it's laid out as a series of mysteries (first, the mystery of the protagonist's strengths, then the mystery of surrounding events). The last act provides the most suspenseful and thrilling moments, but the film overall has a dark and emotional tone that makes it compelling throughout. I almost can't help but to relate to these characters, thanks to all these aspects, and thanks to the quality acting and writing.The story for this is what's most incredible though. Even though it takes its time to get anywhere, it's layered on quite cleverly, slowly revealing the ideas and aspects until the fundamental core is exposed. There is a big reveal at the film's end (customary to M. Night Shyamalan's earlier work, of course), which brilliantly puts the story and characters into a refreshing and smart context. This is also a story that feels very creditable and realistic, thanks to its delivery. Above all, the characters are very delicately and thoroughly well-developed.This film uses very good photography and editing. Acting is strong: Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson both deliver very somber and understated performances, which accentuate the mood of the whole film. Writing is good; M. Night Shyamalan's scripts aren't always gold, but with this film, he manages to find the perfect balance between exposition, characterization, plot-building, and everything else. This production uses fairly spartan sets, props, and costumes. The music score is really cool too.Unbreakable is a smart, moody, powerful thriller.

VISUAL!!,"The greatest thing about this movie was its visuals. The colors in this movie really dazzle the mind. The main characters have their own colors and the scenes they are in usually contain repetition of these colors. It adds continuity to the film and gives it more of a comic book feel without dumbing it down to the level of a comic book. Aside from the use of color, the lack of color in some scenes contributes most to the mood of the main character. The greys portray the security guard's feelings. the shots of just willis's face and the dreary colors make this film stunning. I only saw it in the theatre, on the big screen. I imagine seeing it on my box at home will take away a lot of the mood.the acting plain sucked though. jackson acted way too much for the movie and willis's wife just plain bit it. HA! anyhow, see this movie for its COLOR.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Perfect when you're tired of magic, but want a super hero","Damn, this film is the perfect blend of realistic drama & fantasy adventure. The actors are so well fitted in their roles that it is so seemingly real and fun. The story not super out of the game, but has simple surprises that made me reflect after the credits revealing more layers. The part comapring mythology and comics I felt was a bit ideological tho. Might be the greatest super hero film and reminds me of the convergent of metaphors and physical reality as with the resurrection of Christ.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
UNBREAKABLE (DIDIER BECU),"Giving 6 points to Bruce Willis is damn hard for me as he is one of my fave actors (in case you wanna know De Niro is the best) but what could I do??? The story was rather flat, it was all a bit too much like The Sixth Sense, the plot was an anticlimax (just like they had to have a different plot for the sake of it) and some scenes are really not in their places. Why did I gave it a 6 then??? Simply as I was enjoyed by both Willis and Jackson, but the story...come on guys, even The X-Files are more original than that!!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Eastrail177: Unbreakable,"Unbreakable, directed, produced & written by Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan, aka M. Night, is one of the most underrated, unorthodox, super hero origin stories out today. Coming off his best movie (at that time) in The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan decided to embrace the up and coming comic book movie genre, by creating his own take on it. Shyamalan did a great job directing this piece, utilizing a lot of great one shot-long takes, while adding everything he thought was necessary. He told such a brilliantly focused story, peeling back the layers one at a time, backed up with tremendous detail, that got me invested into everything and everyone. I just watched this movie on Monday, but I watched it again today (Thursday) just because it has such tremendous rewatch value, that only makes you appreciate it more and more, everytime you watch it!I'm particularly not the biggest Bruce Willis fan, but I thought he did a very good job here. For once, he's very subtle, but the confusion & pain aspect he brings in, makes his character so genuine, and easy to care about. His character development was just the icing on the cake, making it extremely easy to root for him, after discovering everything we need to know about him. Samuel L. Jackson in this subtle, reserved role, worked out just as well. You just care for the guy so much, and you whole heartily felt the pain he goes through. He wasn't always present in the film, but everything was facilitated through him. Robin Wright Penn was just okay. I really didn't care for her performance all that much, being nothing more than a plot device. Spenser Treat Clark was the real compliment to the family. Clark put on a very good performance at such a young age, displaying great emotions.The script was very powerful all in it's own. With the few long take scenes, that's when Shyamalan took the advantage of utilizing his witty dialogue, making it pop. Surprisingly, Shyamalan added a few solid laughs here and there, that kept the film from being too serious.James Newton Howard is a genius with the score. Throughout the whole film, and mainly the last act, he really drags you in, with this deep, somber & suspenseful score.Overall, this was my first M. Night Shyamalan film, and I was blown away by his style! I will be sure to review as much work of his as possible.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This one was atleast good,"I think The Sixth Sense sucked big time. But this one didn´t suck at all. It was actually very good. The director took a stop forth and went in to the unknown with this one. It´s a bit more interesting. Sixth Sense was kinda uninspired and boring, and I didn´t really care much about it.

"Terrible, terrible movie....","I was looking forward to this movie, from the plot review, to production news, and then to the previews and trailers, I was looking forward to this movie until I sat down in the theater this weekend and watched it...What a disappointment.....The entire audience of the theatre my wife and I watched in came out shaking there heads and asked each other if there was any point to the movie? An older woman asked me if she had just missed something because of the age gap, I reassured her that she had seen it for what it was.... a bad movie.I'm suprised that two decent actors, Willis and Jackson, would do this movie. I wonder if they were just bored and decided to spend the weekend together with Mr. Shyamalan (the director) and his handy camcorder....yes it was that bad.From the beginning of the movie it was very clear how this movie was going to proceed, very predictable.The comic book inference was a joke, Mr. Glass.If it was not for a few decent comic book sketches then there would have been nothing worth looking at on screen.This movie should have gone straight to TV. Since it actually had a theatrical release it wont belong (days???) before its on the buy one get one free movie rack at Wal-Mart.I had to know how much it cost to make this movie, IMDB.com reports that it cost 75 million. Man those were obviously some expensive donuts on the set because it did not appear that the bulk of that money went into the movie....well I guess it did they did show the actors stomachs.From me to you friends, I wouldn't give this movie as a gift to my mother-in-law",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Very surprised how good it was,"Ok, first off - i HATED the Sixth Sense.  Saw it twice to make sure I wasn't missing anything the first time around, and I still hate it.  So, going to see this wasn't my first choice, but a friend had passes so I figure I'll give M. Night a 2nd chance.I'm so glad I did.  While M. Night's camera styles can be a tad overbearing (i.e.  the back and forth between the seats on the train or the reflection shots) - this movie really impressed me.The only thing I didn't like were the epilogues, it would have done better without a synopsis.  You can't just expect to sum everything up in a few sentences. That kinda left a bad taste, but the movie overall?  Very cool. Try it on for yourself.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A suspenseful thought provoking movie!!,"It is full of suspense movie with beautifully written story and screenplay.This is a pretty low-key movie with the other star, Bruce Willis, playing an extremely subdued role for him, almost too subdued. There are times in here when you keep waiting for him to say something, and he says nothing. Half the time he's barely audible.But he and Jackson play off each other well, and this is very suspenseful film, even if a lot doesn't happen.

Meaningless and inconclusive,"The shoemaker mustn't go beyond the slipper (old Portuguese proverb)and M. Night Shyamalan seems to be totally incapable of making a valid movie based on the top ideas behind this one. It would require the talent and genius of a Carpenter or a Kubrick. Moreover a thriller is supposed to thrill and this story of a man who cannot be physically hurt or wounded due to a supernatural power while another man in the opposite extreme of the human life spectrum is called Mr. Glass because his bones are so weak that they get broken by the least blow, is told in a dull and monotonous way of mostly inconclusive and almost meaningless images, scenes and sequences which aren't fit to thrill anyone. Near the end the movie seems to stir a little more but it ends inconclusively and meaninglessly once more. The attempt of connecting the story to the universe of comics is not convincing or understandable. In short, this movie is a failure though maybe original in terms of ideas which are not bad in terms of fiction and could be better developed by another director with the capacity and skill to feel their depth and put it out in convincing images and scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Disappointing, muddy follow-up","Those folks who really liked M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (a preposterous, but well-written, bit of Hollywood claptrap) should've been prepared for the inevitable letdown that any follow-up would produce. However, I was surprised at just how bad this movie would be. Let's face it, nobody grows to late middle age (the shaved head isn't fooling anybody, Bruce Willis!) without noticing that they never, ever get hurt, or sick, and they have super strength!! Granted, his character, David Dunn, isn't exactly the brightest bulb on the string, but even a former football player would get a clue eventually. Of course, that's why he gravitated toward security guard work, right? God knows, maybe EVERY lardassed rent-a-cop is blessed with superpowers (one of which, apparently, is total lack of ambition). And what's the deal with Samuel L. Jackson's character? Was it really necessary to dress him in purple metallic Nehru jackets and the most Godawful stupid hairstyle since Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber to sell him as a supervillain?    Dark, disappointing, and blessed with a dumb and tacked-on ""surprise"" ending; let's hope that Shyamalan's sophomore slump has passed, and he can salvage a promising career.

The acting was strong, (Robin Wright-Penn underused), the idea as mentioned before was great, but the pace i felt slowed everyone down to almost a dull yawn at times.  i admit i twiddled my thumbs more than once.  My suggestion is if you are a true comic collector and fan, you will like this movie and if you don't you will want to see it again to find out why.

Life: a double edge sword,"As ""die hard"" fan of both Bruce Willis and Samuel L.Jackson fan i was greatly excited to see this piece, since the last time i've seen them side by side was in Die Hard 3.In a way i was disappointed by the progression of the film, since i was expecting a thriller revolving around more action ; however i forgot this was a M.Night Shyamalan movie.Having said that, this movie has a slow pace, focused on the dialogs and the background of the main characters, recalling the events of the past which made who they are.The story follows David Dunn, an average Joe in society. Be that as it may, he's not an ordinary man: and with the help of Elijah (Samuel), he unfolds the truth about himself, eventually discovering his purpose.There's no doubt about the quality of the actors ; the plot is interesting but the screenplay could be more attractive, or at least less tedious.It's undoubtedly a good movie , not a emmy winner, but still entertaining . The feeling i have is, though the story is M.Night's, the directing could have had other direction, mainly more unpredictable and more vivid. I'd say that producing a part II could also be amusing, should it be made differently.In the end, one of them meets his fate and the other fulfills his destiny.6.4/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbreakable was almost unbearable,"I went into this movie expecting something on the par of ""The Sixth Sense"", which I thought was a terrific movie.  I walked out with three other people all asking the same question I was, ""What did we just waste  two hours for???""  I spent a little more than half the movie trying to figure out the plot.  Then I suddenly realized, there was no plot.Only the last few minutes were anything of note.  But even those could not make up for the previous hour and a half of lackluster events.  It tired to make that sudden twist at the end like in ""The Sixth Sense"", but this time it failed.  Although, it did do a good job at failing.  In ""The Sixth Sense"", the twist at the end was so emotional, gut wrenching, and thought provoking because during the whole movie you were being drawn into the story.  Here, you weren't drawn in (I was slowly being repelled during the whole movie because of the lack of a story).  Everything that the little twist refers back to is stuff that you had heard about, and the movie only alluded to.  It didn't give you a chance to get interested.I would liken this viewing experience to my one and only time attending a NASCAR event.  There was a little excitement at the beginning, a little excitement scattered throughout (crashes), and a little excitement at the end.  But all in all, each lap is pretty much like the one before (they are driving around an ellipse, not a whole lot of room for change there). And at the end I walked away wondering why I went through all that trouble to waste several hours of my life for a mild case of sunburn and a sore butt.  I am just glad I didn't have to pay for this event...I wish I could say the same about this movie.At least in this case, the movie theater was climate controlled.  The only reason this isn't going to occupy my Number 1 Bad Movie is because that spot is already claimed by that abomination known as ""The Blair Witch Project"", so ""Unbearable"", ooops, I mean ""Unbreakable"" is going to have to settle for Number 2 on the Bad Movie List.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not too flattering.,I felt that this movie idea was childish and stupid. The script was not too good and the director tried to make it a better movie than it could have been. I found that the director over-exaggerated many camera styles(such as framing and steady-cam). I also thought that Bruce Willis set him self up for a blow in starring in Sixth Sense. That movie was so good at showing his acting skills that his performance in Unbreakable was to say the least a horrible depiction of his skill.,,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Defining the genre before it really existed; a surprisingly powerful picture.,"'Unbreakable (2000)' feels especially apt and refreshing now that the superhero genre has been so over-saturated and has been accused by many as having started to 'run out of steam', but this feature actually arrived at a time when comic-book films were still finding their footing and so the fact that it cleverly subverted and provided a commentary on their tropes and themes is almost genius. The feature is a remarkably entertaining and wonderfully enigmatic one, a thriller that maintains an assured pace and builds a genuine emotional connection to all of its incredibly realistic characters so that we genuinely care about each and every one of them, which means that you're never quite sure exactly where it is going to go. Each movement of the plot feels incredibly natural, though, bolstered by phenomenal performances and an incredible script. The movie's overall effect is an incredibly powerful one. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Patient And Thoughtful,"I saw this film on cinema release in 2000; since at the latest that year, I've been in chronic pain every day. That was the year I was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis. I remember enjoying and connecting with it at the time; revisiting it 22 years on, Jackson's character feels all the more relatable to me. I found the scene where he falls down stairs almost unwatchably visceral.That's not a theme the film fully develops, but it does remain physical, at times tangibly so. Also tangibly real is the father-son relationship at the film's heart, and Willis is very good. Unlike many in the current plethora of superhero origin films it's patiently constructed and never less than involving. We could do with more films learning from its template now. Dressing Willis in something resembling a cape when he works is a neat touch; the final twist may be a Shyamalan trademark but it's probably not necessary for the film's impact - but neither does it superfluously soften it. It's almost incidental critique of (American) football has aged almost prophetically well, and it ultimately ends up as an insightful portrayal of how we can idolise our parents, how we find our purpose and something to do with the bodies we inhabit.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

It immediately follows the darkest part of the movie which already ends with a form of resolution for all characters concerned.For me personally, the need to go 'Sixth Sensy' with a twist-at-the-end managed to break 'Unbreakable', right at the very end.

The trailers, which showed the audience virtually nothing, had me eagerly anticipating something dark and mysterious, but what I got instead was slightly less than adequate schlock. I am not saying that Unbreakable was horrible; in fact, it was far from it and I would see it again. It's clearly a movie for comic book lovers, which I am, BTW, but that doesn't negate basic film analysis. It just wasn't invigorating when it clearly needed to be, had a lack of basic momentum, was too concerned with odd camera angles, wasn't very thought-provoking, and concluded with yet another cheap, gimmicky ending a la The Sixth Sense that doesn't work.

Unbreakable,"The movie is progressing very slowly. You may be bored, but it is normal to progress slowly as it was withdrawn in the 2000s. When you look at these dated films, you can see the same heavy progress in most of them. The end of the movie was not bad, I think it was better than the other parts.If you like Night Shamalan movies, you will also watch this movie. Otherwise, it may sound slow. It may be the only movie that Samuel L. Jackson never cursed. And he played very well. Bruce Willis repeats his performance in the 6th His movie.I decided to watch it because it was in the same universe after Split and they would be together at Mr.Glass.
Acting is good enough. Samuel L. Jackson literally reflected the character's feelings. The fact that the subject is strange and the script is narrow (the story takes place in a certain period of time, but David's life was important in this scenario. But very little was mentioned to him) made the film a little worse, but the script was not too bad. They made a final with a good ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The best Shyamalan Film.,"Woah, I was genuinely surprised with this film. The movie follows David Dunn (Bruce Willis) after a deadly train accident where he was the sole survivor, and was left with no scratches. Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) who's nicknamed Mr. Glass for his condition which makes his bones extremely fragile, believes that David has abilities, that could make him a super hero. I think the premise is pretty simple, the movie is surprisingly short despite the slow pace. There's barely any action till the end, but I never felt bored. I was just too invested with the characters.Bruce Willis isn't that great of an actor, but he gives one of his strongest performances in this film. Samuel L. Jackson absolutely kills it in this role. I don't want to give too much away from this character, but he's absolutely brilliant, I seriously loved him. All the performances are just solid, even David's son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) does a good job.All the superficial aspects of the movie are good or amazing. James Newton Howard's score is beautiful, and I love the main theme. The cinematography is amazing. All the scenes have long shots, with barely any cuts. You just really get sucked in looking at these characters with no cuts. They did some really creative things with lighting and color grading which I really liked. I mean there really isn't anything to complain about the technical aspects.What really made the movie so amazing for me was just how good David Dunn and Elijah Price were, and the storyline. M. Night Shyamalan does a fantastic job of building tension in the story with seemingly simple stuff. I mean he made walking down stairs intense. These characters are just really well developed. We see David Dunn struggling with his marriage, and he's just missing something in his life. Elijah Price's backstory is set up very well, and I was just very intrigued by his character.This movie really deconstructs the superheroes stories. It isn't a traditional super hero film. Like I mentioned before there's barely any action, it's really grounded. Elijah mentions comic books multiple times, and explains these stories. He believes in them, and I think the way they set up the story was very well. There are little hints, and an excellent set up for the finale, and final twist of the film. Once the twist came, WOAH, I mean it makes complete sense.I don't really have too much to discuss about this movie because I don't want to spoil it. If you're not a fan of slowly paced movies, more of a psychological thriller, you probably won't enjoy this movie. If you really enjoy these slower movies, with well developed characters, and interesting themes like presented in this movie, you'll really enjoy this movie.My only complaints with the movie are the finale, and some plot convenience. While I didn't find the finale as disappointing, or underwhelming as other people did, and I was fairly satisfied, it just kind of ends. I mean I felt like there could've been a little bit more in the ending. David Dunn's arc is complete, and the story is pretty much finished, it's not really left incomplete. I just felt like it needed another scene to really finish wrapping things up. Also my other little problem with the film was some of the things feeling a bit too convenient, but it isn't done nearly enough for it to be anything more than a minor problem. Another thing I'd like to add are some things being left unexplained, but I never found it to be a real issue.Overall I honestly love this movie. I think it's extremely well directed, especially with the cinematography. The themes and story are engaging. All the characters are well realized and developed. It has an amazing twist. And despite its simplicity, it really has some deeper and mature moments, and it really breaks down superheroes.9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Film Noir Extravaganza,"I liked this film, a lot. Shyamalan is an expert in  low-key suspense-building. Just to mention one example, the train crash. Totally not there, message of disaster sent, understated through a quick glimpse at a TV, broadcasting a news show.The camerawork is nice as is the tone of the film. I personally has Samuel L. Jackson on my favourite-actor list and Bruce Willis is working his way to this list in a hurry also.Nice intro, excellent ending.See this one!",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbreakable - Unbelievably Underrated,"Lets hear out the bests first.....One of the finest Cinematography in ages, by Eduardo Serra....Oscar deserving Musical Score by James Newton Howard.....Carefully Crafted and yet Subtle direction by M. Night Shyamalan....Star-Studded Cast with Brilliant performances from Bruce Willis as David Dunn & Samuel L. Jackson as Elijah Price/
Mr. Glass....Robin Wright, Spencer Treat Clark and Charlayne Woodard also did their parts beautifully...Hugely Underrated Superhero-Thriller movie IMO....Just Watched Split.....can't wait to watch the epic conclusion of the ""Eastrail 177 Trilogy""...trailer of Glass is terrific.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Before It's Time,"Perhaps seeing this after 2017's Split removed some of the intended impact of that films surprise ending, but I'll always contend that Split wasn't a good film before that twist anyway.But in terms of Unbreakable, it turned out to be a decent film after all. If you remove the obviously pretentious (and frustratingly unnecessary) camera movements, then you have a fascinating and original character study that just so happens to feel like a comic book film. It's slow building and dated in some areas but the concepts that M. Night proposes are interesting, especially in the eyes of a 2000 era filmmaker. You know, before the golden age of superhero films.I liked it more than I thought, it's just too bad the other two films in the series didn't hit the highs that Unbreakable did.7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unwatchable,"A terrible film in almost every respect, Shyamalan has crafted an utterly unwatchable movie.  With great packaging and an intriguing premise, this stinker lured unsuspecting audiences into theatres in 2000.  However, within the first fifteen minutes, audible groans echoed throughout the theater. Half the audience remained at the final reel. This picture really sucks. Bruce Willis' lethargic performance is boring to watch, and the supporting cast, including Samuel Jackson, struggle through the meandering, directionless script.  The film moves at a sluggish pace, which is fine within Shyamalan's noirish mise en'scene, but the script is downright awful, therefore it's pacing is unjustifed.  An example- when Willis' kid tests his father's invincibility by pointing a weapon at him.  This scene is ridiculously awful and carelessly directed.  It was totally unconvincing and over-the-top.  I've seen more fully realized scenes in student films.  Or how about the ""shocking climax?"" I can't believe it took two hours of such utter nonsense to build up to this weak, uneven revelation.  It was particularly sad because Shyamalan obviously set everything up for a sequel, but when audiences saw this turd, plans were scrapped by the studio. Yes, I don't think ""Unbreakable II"" will ever see the light of day, thank God. So if you feel like wasting two hours of your time on a Sunday afternoon..... still avoid this movie; watch something more appetizing, like ""Signs"" or ""Die Hard.""",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Gets better and better every time you see it,"I didn't like this film much when I saw it the first time, but I have started to like it more and more after every viewing. It's not perhaps a very fast-moving movie, it gives you more time to think more about things. Another thing that makes this film so good is that the the colour and the lighting in different scenes...and of course Willis and Jackson really succeed in doing believable acting. An underrated movie!",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
a smart but slow movie,"Unbreakable tries to use the same way of storytelling as the Sixth Sense, but fails. This is because the 'secret' of the movie is more guessable so less hints are given throughout the movie. To get the movie to still last long enough, the director made every scene very long, with silent and staring people thinking about when they have last been sick.The acting is great, the plot itself too, but it's just TOO LONG.......maybe M.Night just watched a few Jarmusch or Kitano films or something ?Bennie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Better than the Sixth Sense...but then most anything is,"Being very unimpressed by The Sixth Sense, which telegraphed the ending from the very beginning of the movie, I didn't hold out much hope for the next Willis/Shyalaman film...but Unbreakable did surprise me a bit.  At least this time, I didn't see the ending coming. Of course, a ""superhero"" whose main ability is to let criminals exhaust themselves by beating him into a wall, and who's kryptonite is water probably won't have much of a career...and hopefully no sequels.Samuel L. Jackson was, as always, excellent.  He made Elijah an interesting character that you cared about, even if none of the other characters could hold your interest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The BEST Comic-book Film Ever,I am personally reading comics since age 4 and i have watched many movies on comics characters But Shyamalan's Unbreakable is THE FIRST film to explore the love and passion of comics and superheroes . This is kind of an in-depth study on comics and superheroes and their effect on human psychologyThe movie focuses on the love and admiration of a disabled child to his only friend in life COMICS .

My views on this film,"This film is very interesting.  Although not the fastest pacing plot, the mood, music and camerawork of this film are excellent.  It is a very gritty and dark film and you never know what direction the film will take.  Bruce Willis plays his part top class whereas Samuel L Jackson (in my opinion) gives quite a mediocre performance (well, below his usual standard). Another aspect of this film which I thoroughly enjoyed was the actual idea. He managed to make a film which crossed the normal conventions of films from this genre.  However, even though it sounds like I am praising this film I did only give it a 6.  Within the space of 2 minutes I went to loving the film (I would of giving it an 8) and wanting to buy it to thinking 'it was ok'.  It was the end which did this.  Obviously I won't tell you what it is but it is very disappointing, quite weak, as though he couldn't be bothered to think it through properly.  Saying this, the girls in my 'film group' seemed to think the ending made it better, whereas the guys thought otherwise.  He made it more realistic with the ending but it could have been done much better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Way Below Expectation,"After seeing ""The Sixth Sense"", I thought this new piece by M. Night Shyamalan would achieve the same standard or even surpass it. But I was really disappointed by ""Unbreakable"". The trailer is much better done than the movie itself.The director tried to mix thriller and comedy, but it just didn't work. The conversation scene between Bruce Willis and Robin Wright Penn was pointless. The weight-lifting scene was too long. The rescue scene was unbelievable. But the worst thing in this movie was the music! What kind of score was that? It sounded like those TV superhero series and it was so cheesy!The idea for the movie was good, but somehow along the way, the story went downhill, and so did the directing. The only good scene was the kitchen scene.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Not very good,"Just rewatched UNBREAKABLE. My opinion hasn't changed -- this is a bizarre and ultimately unsatisfying tale inspired by comic books -- but it is interesting to watch Bruce Willis turn into a super hero of sorts. It also is interesting to watch his developing relationship with his son, who almost shoots him at one point. But the film is just too off the wall, and its appeal will lie with art-house crowd at best. Sam Jackson plays a comic book-obsessed cripple who sets up a series of terrible accidents in order to ferret out a super hero. M. Nighgt hasn't made a satisfying film since SIXTH SENSE, which is truly sad. He builds his odd little movies around themes -- ghosts, space aliens, mermaids, etc. -- but doesn't seem to know where to go with them (other than SIXTH SENSE).

A good movie...,"I've read most of the reviews people have posted for this movie. Some of the negative ones have been... well... negative. There also seemed to be a sense of misunderstanding there as well. This is a remarkable movie. The technical aspect of this film is staggering. Somebody said it was like you were eavesdropping on these people's lives, and I agree. People complain about the abrupt ending. I was upset at first though after a while... I realized... a lot of comic books end this way (With the text explaining what happens). I was also pleased to hear that this is just the first film in a trilogy. This makes the sort of slow pace of the first film (Even though I didn't mind it at all) make sense. It was to introduce these characters, and their lives.People say the story makes no sense. Well... Did these people even stop and think about it? It's actually very straight forward. There are certain things that aren't explained, but this is a device few directors tend to use nowadays. This technique is to let people USE THEIR IMAGINATIONS!!! Why do people need everything force fed to them anymore? A friend of mind were discussing the true identity of who or what Bruce Willis' character was exactly. She smiled and said, ""I think it all depends on what kind of adventure you want it to be."" I agree totally. If you want a super hero movie, it's a super hero movie. If you want a dramatic film, it's a dramatic film. People who call this film crap and demand their money back should probably go waste their money on films like ""The Haunting"" or ""The Beverly Hillbillies.""But I don't want to be fully negative with my review. I think people's opinion's are exactly that. This is my opinion. And in my opinion, I hope the rumors I heard about this being the start of a trilogy were true, because I want to see the continuing story of David Dunn.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"A Superhero Movie for People that Never Watch Superhero Movies,","Unbreakable is an outstanding movie with a very well developed storyline,a really talented cast and very impressive character development.People have given M. Night Shayamalan guilt in the past for being a terrible movie maker,but you must give credit where credit is due,because when he makes a good movie it's a very good movie.Bruce Willis's performance is fantastic,certainly nothing like any character he's played before,but Samuel L. Jackson's performance is certainly the best,it's an extremely unique character that once again is nothing like any character Jackson has ever played,his characters are always usually loud and curse an awful lot,he is best known for those characters and I love him for it,but in this movie he showed that he can be so much more than does characters when he wants,this character was so interesting and strange and Jackson suited him perfectly.Similar to the Sixth Sense,the movie has several very unexpected twists that will mess with your head when you find out but will also make you wonder why you didn't realise this earlier.Unbreakable is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great drama or mystery.After a disastrous train crash leaving almost every passenger dead,the one survivor discovers that nothing can hurt him,he seeks help from a comic book collector to find out if he is truly a real life superhero.Best Performance: Samuel L.

Super Hero in A Rain Poncho,"Having a style can be something of a mixed blessing. It can trap you so that if you try anything new your audience will reject you. or it can liberate you from the concerns of attracting a new audience and concentrate on making the movies that you are best at making. Many directors use lighting, dialogue and actors so repeatedly that their films become inseparable from each other. Woody Allen comes easily to mind. The audience comes to recognise these qualities and often go to a movie looking for that that they know will be there.On the other hand, some audiences like innovation. They like things to be new, beyond formula and exciting. Truth is some of us go to see films by certain directors or with favourite actors simply because we want to see them in their natural habitat and we feel comfortable.For a new director developing a style can pose a tricky proposition. Several new filmmakers of the last 10 years have chosen disparate paths - Quentin Tarantino so redefined the gangster genre that his films are instantly recognisable.  His impact has been so rich that even bad versions of his film style still feel exactly like his films. Steven Speilberg has chosen a more electric path - with his choice of picture ranging the full gamut of genres thereby avoiding any sense of definitive style.Last year M. Night Shyamalan debuted on the big screen with `The Sixth Sense' A small movie that due to a blindingly quick revelation of a plot twist became a massive $200 million hit. It propelled the unknown director into the highest heights of Hollywood, garnered an Academy Award nomination for its child-star (Haley Joel Osment) and reconfirmed Bruce Willis as the box-office-breaking star that he is.Shyamalan latest film `Unbreakable' reunites the director and his very bankable star and this time adds Samuel L. Jackson - a man Willis has co starred with several times before.Immediately there are elements of the sophomoric film that remind the viewer of that massive hit - the slow pacing, the green/gray lighting, and the subtle soft-spoken lead. Willis character - a security guard named David Dunne with a young son and a crumbling marriage - is so like his `Sixth Sense' character that for a while it feels like he has actually been reincarnated again and transported to this film. For a while these obvious similarities get in the way of enjoying this film.Through a series of moody flashbacks we learn that Willis' Dunne is a former college football star who faked a career ending injury for the love of a woman. When we first meet Willis he is on a train back from New York to his hometown of Philadelphia. (Philadelphia was also the setting for Sixth Sense). The camera playfully slips back and forth from behind a seat as he flirts with a tattooed your sports agent who sits beside him. Minutes afte r overstepping the line with the married young woman the train they are on derails. Willis miraculously is the sole survivor of the devastating train wreck.When your first movie costs less than $20 million and grosses 10 times that its pretty much a given in Hollywood that you can do whatever you like for a next project. M. Night Shyamalan chose not to let it go too much to his head as this subtle smart - and though morbidly paced - stylish film shows. Though only his second film, already clear patterns are developing. Shyamalan wrote produced and directed this effort and his mark is well on its way to becoming defined.Samuel Jackson plays Elijah a man who suffers from a rare bone disease that makes his bones shatter on little impact. As a child Elijah was called Mr. Glass because his limbs were so feeble.At their initial confrontation it seems as though he is the prophet his biblical name suggests. Elijah carried a cane and though dressed like a post-modern pimp the purple lining of his cloak is more reminiscent of the vespers of a priest.Willis' character represents the opposite of who he is. He survives a train wreck without as much as a scratch - hence the `unbreakable' of the title. Elijah persists on meeting calling and prompting Willis into thinking because of his resistance to breaking he must be some kind of latter day folk hero. Elijah is a collector and believer in comic books. Try as Willis and his family may Willis eventually comes to believe in Elijah's revelations.This leads to a climactic scene amidst impossibly heavy rain where Willis confronts a deranged killer. In his fight with the orange clothed villain Willis is thrown from a balcony into a tarpaulin covered pool. Slowly he begins to sink into the water, which we previously learned is this hero's Achilles heel. As he emerges from the water that nearly kills him Shyamalan shows off his true subtly as a director. Willis, cloaked in a navy blue hooded rain poncho, rises with the camera and stands stock still for a moment before going on. It's the perfect coming together of this new talents vision. Rain, dank lighting and Bruce Willis. Its so indelible that's its hard to imagine any other actor playing the lead in this directors next film.Of course we've seen this all before - new hot shot directors who burst onto the scene with a great movie, a decent second movie even sometimes, only to eventually loose their way. Think John Singleton. Though Shyamalan certainly is onto something here, for style to really be lasting it must breach genres. It's early days yet but 5 years from now it will be interesting to see what Shyamalan is up to.The element of this film that most defines this director's style and most clearly harks back to `Sixth Sense' is the end. After almost two hours of methodically dragging us in one direction, Shyamalan deftly, quickly and profoundly pulls all his little tricks flashily together with all the softness of a sledgehammer. Stay closely by because if you blink you'll miss the whole thing.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An intriguing Good vs. Evil story that struggles to deliver it's main character's payoff.,"Before seeing this film, several friends had told me how terrible it was. Needless to say, I went into the theater not expecting to be impressed. As the film began I found myself becoming completely engrossed in the subtle performances and M. Night's distinct directing style.  Quiet scenes delicately pulled me into the story as I began rooting for David Dunn (Bruce Willis), a man who survives a catastrophic train wreck and is left asking the question ""What if I am unbreakable?""  Samuel L. Jackson plays a character who is very much breakable, a man who has spent his entire life getting injured due to a protein deficiency.Halfway through the film I had discarded my friends opinion of this movie.  I was so fascinated with the concept of the story that I couldn't wait for the inevitable payoff... Unfortunately, it never came.  In all fairness, I should state that there was in fact a little bit of a payoff.  However, the payoff is more of a fizzle than a bang.  Also, I knew what the surprise ending was going to be ten minutes before we got the big clue.  Perhaps it is because my observation of this film was too keen that I wasn't blindsided by the outcome of the characters.  Either way, I was left with the same feeling I had after the Sixth Sense (another film in which I had guessed the ending), that Mr. Shyamalan is a wonderfully creative and visionary writer, a sensitive director, and a great conductor of our emotions.  It is too bad that he never allows his characters to fully realize their potential. Rather, the characters in his films seem more like small elements of a broader picture, never really getting to transcend the story that they are trapped in.  Perhaps when this new director's career matures, we will be able to view all his works and see what that bigger picture is.  In the mean time, I sit anxious for the next film from this new voice in American Cinema...",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbreakable is UNBREAKABLE!,"This is one unique film - who could have thought you could mix drama and a superhero premise into a potent film?I've been following this film's development ever since it was announced as ""Untitled M.

My verdict, pretend that you've never watched the Sixth Sense and you'll be stunned at the twist.In any case, check this film out.

Good movie - Sort of a disappointment,"Okay, let me first start off by saying that my review of this movie is somewhat skewed because we got to the theatre late and were stuck in the front row.  In a movie like this, you really need the ability to see the entire frame so you can take it all in.Having said that, I absolutely love the Sixth Sense, and was expecting this movie to be very similar.  The camera work is fantastic in this film, the long shots ... the unusual angles ... it all works very well.  What turned me off, however, was the general 'theme' of this movie.  I wasn't expecting comic books to play such a major role.Over all, good movie.  Just a bit unexpected.  The plot was a bit more predictable then the Sixth Sense, but that's to be expected.  The only ending, in my mind, that challenges The Sixth Sense was The Usual Suspects.Go see the movie, you'll enjoy it.

Broken Glass,"M. Night Shyamalan is very talented writer and director, especially with the creativity of SIXTH SENSE.  People complained the first time that they went to see his first movie.

I could have seen a variety of forms of this movie.  If the movie discussed comics, they could have changed the scenes with drawings of the cast in a comic book form.

What a terrific let down!,"I loved the Sixth Sense, and was tremendously excited to see Unbreakable. Boy was I disappointed.  Can I just say that this ending was one of the worst in the history of film?  The story was great, the characters were great, the acting was awesome, the plot and script were wonderful.  But why, oh why, would you end a movie, that isn't that long in the first place, this way?  So much more could have been done after the final plot twist instead of throwing up a few laughable sentences on the screen to tell us what happened.  Did the movie run out of money?  Did M. Night run out of script ideas?  An extra hour of movie could have been added to really make this a winner.

Get Ready For Strangeness.....,"Okay I caught a screening of this last night and I left the theater a little disappointed and feeling a little strange.  It's not a bad film really, it's just that the story starts out really good and then diverts off to some very strange place.  What's nice is that everything you've seen in the trailer happens in the first five minutes of the film and the story just keeps going.  As for the acting, well, it's pretty good all things considered. Sammy, who got top billing, turns in another fine performance as his usual prophetic self, but this character has some neat distinctions which makes him fun to watch yet again.  My problem with Willis is the character itself. We all like to see Bruce do his stuff, but the written character is mainly low key and mopey the entire film.  And once you see it you'll agree....this film could use more spice, a litle more action, just something more wowing! It lacked zest.  That's the best way I can put it without ruining anything. I recommend you see it, but don't expect greatness.  Also, look for a well placed Hitchcockian cameo from Shyamalin somewhere about halfway through. Nice touch.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Not for those with short attention spans,"I enjoyed this movie, and realized even more so now that I have had some time to mull it over.  The first 3 quarters of the movie are kind of plodding and for those of you with short attention spans, it can be a downright turn off.  But Night delivers the goods by the end.  The inner child in me thoroughly enjoyed the comic book aspect of the movie.  The idea and concept are highly original as is much of the cinematography.  I especially like the idea of using a color to personify personalities in the movie, ie purple for Samuel L Jackson..the inside of his coat, his walls in his apartment.  In an era of movies that entertain sense much  more than they inspire thought, it is quite a breath of fresh air to have a mainstream moviemaker that titillates the mind's palate.

Shyamalan has done it again !!!,"I went to the Cinema with an uneasy feeling that after Sixth sense, the writer, producer & director M. NIght Shyamalan would find it difficult to be original and just as astounding in this new movie. I was wrong and should not have worried. Everything about this movie is superb. The entire brooding feel, coupled with supreme performances from the cast are just part of the enjoyment.

Honestly I believe that Bruce Willis is good in some movies.  Some movies I just think he's wooden, and I thought he was WOODEN in this one.  They wasted Robin Wright Penn's part because she is such an excellent actress I expected more like Toni Collete's wonderful performance in Sixth Sense.  And Samuel L. Jackson, his part was so poorly written...and the way the movie ended was just horrible. If i was a critic i would give the movie maybe a half a star on a good day. It just didn't have a good plot.  There were really good opportunities for it but it just failed to me.  See the Grinch and 102 Dalmations...Glenn Close was amazing as everything else she does.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Good Movie, Terrible Ending(spolier)","This movie was great, not one of those movies that was hard to believe. There was the perfect balance of realism and fiction. I found this movie very interesting and easy to watch. Both Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson play their characters perfectly like the script was specifically written for each of them, and both did a teriffic job of acting.With all of this going for a movie you'd think it would be awesome but it isn't. The whole movie is ruined in the last 2 minutes. Throughout the whole movie everything leads up to the question If Bruce Willis(David Dunn) is a superhero then whats up with Samuel L. Jackson(Elijah Price).Well in the last 2 minutes that question is answered in a very disappointing way, and leaves you wanting more then what is given. One would think that with all the time spent to develop characters and plot that there would blow you away and amaze you. Granted the ending did blow me away but hardly amazed me. It seems like the studio that produced the film ran out of money at the very end so they finished the movie as cheaply as possible. I'm junior in high school and i could have written a better ending. The ending could possibly be THE WORST ENDING EVER!If you want to see this movie then go ahead its a good movie but the ending is beyond terrible. You have been warned.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Rather equal,"An interesting question: If M. Night Shyamalan had made `Unbreakable' before `The Sixth Sense', what would have happened? I think, the world would have praised `Unbreakable', nominated it for some Academy Awards and then said about the second movie: Well, it's almost as good as the first one.In fact, I think these two Shyamalan movies are rather equal. The quality of cinematography, music and acting is the same in both pictures, the story is mysterious enough to hold one's breath for 100 minutes and the ending presents us with a more or less unexpected surprise. Only the fact that in `Unbreakable' there is no fascinating kid, and that after the unbelievable `6th Sense'-ending a more brilliant twist is impossible, gave `Unbreakable' small chance to succeed equally.I admit, the ending of this movie went completely wrong. I don't mean the plot twist, I mean the screenplay and the directing. After I knew the truth, I had the impression, Shyamalan was in a hurry to finish the movie. Suddenly it was over. And showing texts which tell us what happened to the protagonists later like in a true story drama, is a really stupid idea in a mystery thriller like this.But apart from that, I enjoyed Unbreakable`, although I was already familiar with this new` kind of mystery-thriller-drama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Super natural directing,"Generally, I am no great fan of movies involving the occult or the supernatural, unless they are highly stylised like Nosferatu or the Indiana Jones films; so even classics like Rosemary's Baby or the Exorcist tend to leave me cold (with scepticism, not horror). But I've found myself totally gripped by both The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, even though for the most part M Night Shyamalan avoids stylisation, and both movies are set firmly in the real world.For me, the key to Shyamalan's achievement in turning what might have been simply cult films into generally acclaimed successes has little to do with his handling of the supernatural or (in Unbreakable) comic book elements in his screenplays and directing, and has everything to do with his treatment of the characters and of the actors who play them. He successfully performs what should be a basic task of film-makers, but is so often disregarded - he makes us care about the characters. In other words, unlike most fantasy movies, his films are driven by character, not plot.In Unbreakable, by giving David Dunn (Bruce Willis) a down-to-earth job as a security guard, Shyamalan not only exploits Willis's total authenticity in such a role, he makes it easier for us sympathise with Dunn, as an ordinary working stiff whose marriage is on the rocks. At the same time, though he, by contrast, is rich and successful, we also sympathise with Elijah Price (Samuel Jackson), not only because of his physical handicap, but because of his poor background, that the director has taken the trouble to show us. He uses the camera, too, to linger on the characters, allowing us time to listen to them, wonder about them, identify with them.But this care with the characters does not mean that the plot of Unbreakable is neglected; on the contrary, it has one of the most original and ingenious plots of recent years. And unlike, for example, Being John Malkovich, the plot maintains its internal logic all the way through. I believe fans of the occult genre would be wrong to regard the movie's final twist as a cop-out. The ending in no way contradicts or erodes the supernatural element, but simply sets it more firmly in a real-world context.There has been talk of a sequel to Unbreakable, and this might be interesting; but personally I would like to see Shyamalan tackle a non-occult screenplay and movie, using to the full his ability with characters and human interest.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not broken too badly...,"I'm not much of a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's films or directorial style. Although I ""sort of"" enjoyed The Sixth Sense in the theater, I made the mistake of buying it on DVD for some unknown reason -- it's impossible to enjoy that film more than once, because the ""twist"" at the end is really the entire worth of the film, IMO.  Once that twist is known, the movie becomes a real bore, and is really not watchable more than one time.""Unbreakable"" fared somewhat better in my eyes, but still lacks far too much.  Like others have commented, the ending is too abrupt.  Although I didn't see it coming, it just doesn't grant the viewer the ""payoff"" they deserve.That said, I believe Unbreakable is actually the better film by far.  I could easily watch it again, knowing the ""surprise ending.""  The pacing of the movie was good most of the way through (I wasn't squirming in my seat like I was during ""A.I.""), the acting was reasonably good, and I didn't notice those funny camera angles like some of the other reviewers here.  To me, the ""problem"" with Unbreakable lies mostly with the ending -- definitely anticlimactic and abrupt (and the text-over ""explanations"" definitely detracted, in my opinion).  The surprise twist is delightful for approximately 10 seconds, at which point it fades.Also, I have to admit that I don't much appreciate the ""light-core horror/supernaturalism"" genre.  Give me The Exorcist, Jacob's Ladder, Serpent and the Rainbow, Fallen or even Ghost over M. Night Shyamalan's watered-down, empty and un-moving brand of ""horror/supernatural"" any day. Anyhow, I give Unbreakable a rating of 7/10 -- and mostly thanks to Samuel L. Jackson's great performance.P.S... I have an almost unused copy of ""The Sixth Sense"" sitting here on DVD that I watched only 1/8 of the way through before falling asleep... anyone wanna buy it? (just kidding, no Emails please -- I'll dump it off on Ebay or something eventually).",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbreakable Is UNBEARABLE,"I haven't been in a movie theatre in 16 years,(rent them at home) and I may not return for another 16 years.  It was all I could do to stay awake during this film.  I only stayed awake because I was afraid my sister (who paid admission) would slap me.  What a horrible experience.  Please save your money and go see something else unless you need to sleep or get depressed because of the dark and gloomy scenes.  If I lived where David Dunn lived I would commit suicide.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"overrated, yet recommendable","A movie I have mixed feelings about. First of all, it might be a bit overrated. Yet I cannot say that I disliked it. Shyamalan proves his skills for sure.Lets take the train ride at the beginning for example: the camera - camera perspectives in general were mostly impressive - moving to get a glance at the characters though the gap between the seats. And as more bridges the train passes as more threatening they get; until a point is reached were everybody is aware that something is about to happen.As I am not keen on comics the story itself didn't appeal to me, but I like the way it is told. The characters are not flat and the casting is well done. The atmosphere is just right and the film is rather calm.Probably some will be disappointed by the lack of action, as violence is not directly shown.I usually don't like surprise endings, but it would have lost its effect if the audience had known it in the first place. It could be worth seeing it a second.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Being unfairly judged....,"The only reason I am writing this review is because I think people are judging it a little harsh.  If they only wanted to see The Sixth Sense again, then they should buy the DVD. If they wanted to see a new film by M. Night Shyamalan, then they should accept it as a different piece of work.  I, personally, was glad that the film was not identical to The Sixth Sense (as the trailer portrayed it).  I enjoyed the two different films as two different pieces of work.  I will not give you my personal opinions on the film other than this...it is worth seeing.  Check it out.  If you are not sure about it, then see the matinee.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbreakable ? Unbearable!,Yuck!  That's all I can say.  The movie gives us a slow tedious buildup to a `surprise' ending.  The only surprise I felt at the end was that I had sit through the whole thing for this ending.  I expected so much more from the Writer/Director/Actors.  I was not looking for the Sixth Sense II.  I was hoping for that same genius to apply it's magic to another story.  It seems that inconsistency is all we can expect from geniuses of this caliber.,,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Watch for the Cinematography,"The story unfolds at a slightly slow pace, but it keeps your interest. The ending falls a little flat and the climactic scene also feels uneventful. The cinematography is the best reason to watch this film, I really loved the camera angles. I'm glad I saw it, but don't think I'll rewatch it. It's just fairly uneventful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
a missed opportunity for a great movie,"Let me start of by saying that i love the movie and am very disappointed with it! the basic idea as in a lot of Shyamalan movies is outstanding and very philosophical but it misses out so much in the ability to translate that message. trying to portrait the human need to find purpose in life through a subtle, complex and vulnerable ""super hero story"" is a great contrast at first sight. but originally thats what comic books were about. dealing with important political and philosophical questions in a context the common cowed could understand and empathizes with. and in a century were comic book movies mostly became nothing but pure stupid ""popcorn cinema"" i admire the effort to remind people that comic books and movies can very well have true and meaningful content. However, while the concept of ""Unbreakable"" is ambitious and set for greatness, i feel it severely lacks love for detail. there is hardly any story that give the message of the movie any body. the movie is not able to attach the viewer to any of the characters really. and while at first there is a certain tension to what is the secret about these two characters, the initiate tension doesn't build up any further. on the contrary, i feel the longer the movie goes on the more it loses its original tension, to the point were the viewer almost loses interest. and then the big ""plot twist"" the main thing about the movie doesn't contribute to any excitement either, its not really part of the arc of tension either its just dished out at the end leaving the viewer with this great but almost not utilized message about a basic human desire.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
You got good news Bruce - so lighten up a little,"I have never considered myself a huge Bruce Willis fan, although I have to say that whenever I have watched one of his films I've always found them entertaining or at least interesting. Sadly, this one gets no further than the interesting category.It's a real oddity, owing a huge debt to 'Sixth Sense' in terms of its slow rhythmic pacing and general look. After a while though, the toned down colour and the melancholic mood begin to grate - even bore. The plot doesn't really unfold as it is obvious what will happen from the first fifteen minutes - strangely though (and somewhat unbelievably) it takes Bruce Willis' character much longer to work out what he is, despite the fact that you'd have thought he'd have noticed his apparent indestructibility before reaching the age he is.Nevertheless, the most frustrating thing about it is that it should be a feelgood type of film. Let's face it, it's a fantasy where the hero has discovered great gifts - so why must it be so downbeat. Lighten up a little Bruce!And yet . . . despite all these reservations, it IS interesting - and many would even say enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Had potential but didn't deliver,"I went to this film with great expectations, especially after seeing Sixth Sense twice and loving the emotion and plot and of course the all talked about twist at the end! Unfortunately Shymalan's ""Unbreakable"" fell short of the mark, I feel people like myself went to see the film, for two reasons 1)clever plot with deep emotion 2) wonderful payoff and this film simply didn't deliver either! Granted there was some emotion in the acting but it was misguided the viewer didn't really know what he was getting so emotional about, for some reason the writer/director didn't want to repeat an already successful formula, but movies still need some kind of pay-off otherwise the viewer feels short changed, especially when  the film is so painfully slow and hinting at this awe inspiring revelation (as with Sixth Sense) that just doesn't happen, very frustrating indeed. On a brighter note the cinematography was very well directed, Jackson put in his usual enigmatic performance, and Penn showed promise, and Willis once again showed us his sensitive side (A little too whimpy for this reviewer's liking) but he had no real chance with such a weak story, to fully explore his character's full potential. Overall this film had the potential to be very hot and because of average scripting and no closure it has ended up being luke warm.  The plot and writing are crucial in films like this, I hate to say it but Sixth Sense will be Shyamalan's one hit wonder unless he improves his writing or maybe explores the possibilities of employing some outside talent in the writing department and thus allowing him to utilize  his strongest attribute ""Directing"".",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing for me,"Shall I begin by telling you how many times I nodded off?  I went in expecting great things (but not the same things) from Bruce, Shyamalan and Samuel L., and while the acting was terrific, I just couldn't get into the story.  Prime example, when your premise is a guy who survives a train wreck, the least you could do is SHOW the train wreck!  I'd have settled for a Fugitive insert at that point!  Sorry, I just cannot recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Solid, but by no means Unbreakable","As it was for his first film, M. Night neither impressed me nor disappointed me. This film is definitely nothing special, and The Sixth Sense was even more so incredibly overrated.First order of business: Bruce Willis was pretty darn good in comparison to other films he's appeared in, such as Armageddon, but remained nothing extraordinary. I could just as well say the same for Samuel L. Jackson, though he has had a more impressive track record than Willis (as far as performances). Robin Wright Penn also had a sold performance, though I am not one to criticize acting with much strength. The atmosphere was almost a mirror image to the atmosphere of Sixth Sense, though it was a bit warmer. Many of the cinematography techniques were original, but I think many would agree with my complaint of overuse of original ideas, which really ran this film into the ground. Creativity is great, but overuse can kill. The framing of the train scene is beautiful, but monotonous. The spiraling over the comic book was extremely predictable and in this particular case, not creative. The overuse of hand held camera was useless, because it provoked the wrong emotion in a few instances. The theme was steady, but as his last film M. Night only gives us a few minutes to ponder its existence in the last few seconds of the film. Not to say that surprise endings are bad, but if one is attempting to get across an intelligent message, one should let the audience ponder in it a bit longer, along with the characters. I'd have to say it is an intelligent marketing technique though. Perhaps the reasoning for a quick, spontaneous ending was to surpass the lack of depth in the theme: ""Without evil, there would be no good"" to impress with the entertaining and surfaced story. It seems the film builds up to a stark nothing that instills a feeling of emptiness, which pointlessly juxtaposes the redemption in Willis' character. The captions were utterly pointless at the end, probably the most disappointing conclusion I've witnessed in some while.In other words, if you like The Sixth Sense, you will most likely enjoy this. If you though the Sixth Sense was somewhat pretentious, surfaced, and extremely overrated, I am almost sure you will obtain that similar feeling though this film.**1/2 of ****",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Fairly Fair,"This could have been so much better.  I was basically disappointed.  Just when I thought the film was going to break loose and move forward is slipped again into the some somber mood Bruce seemed to be stuck in.

""" Everyone in the world should have a purpose,  . . . . including me ""","If you are ever looking for a afternoon film which contains enough drama to keep you mesmerized, you have got to see this film. The premise of this movie is that people everywhere in the world are going about their busy little lives, trying to fit in. Yet from a more myopic perspective, there are some who believe they are being shunned, decide to prove they do have a purpose. Such is the task of this great director M. Night Shyamalan. He takes an ordinary man, named David Dunn, (Bruce Willis) who believes he is anything but and in events not of his doing begins to reexamine his mysterious existence. The impetus is not his but is initiated by a man called Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson). Dunn is contacted by Price and told he is so important he must have a 'special' purpose, one which his wife has denied but seemingly is so extraordinary, he might be able to stop a bullet. A theory his son, Joseph Dunn (Spencer Treat Clark, superb acting) wants to put to the test. The story becomes intense and like a beautifully crafted comic, creates tension and drama to to point the viewer cannot dare to look away. When the picture continues to it's inevitable climax, adrenaline levels rise to it's peak and one cannot wait to learn the fate of all concern. A sequel is suspected for this fine, soon to become a classic film. ****.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A superhero movie that makes you think,"I thought it was a ""thinking"" superhero movie. It didn't have all of the action of other hero movies, but it did keep me thinking for days about it.The acting was great on both leads parts. Willis was great as the ""reluctant hero"", and Jackson was good as his mentor.The only thing I didn't care for was the ending ""update"" that appeared at the end. There was no need for it, and was totally out of place, as it is not a true movie.The movie is also what you could call a realistic hero movie. No spandex, lasers or claws in this hero movie. But, it doesn't stop it from being very well done.By the way, I think I'm in the minority who didn't like Sixth Sense. It thought it had the pace of a crippled turtle, and without the last 2 minutes of the movie, it would have been a complete waste of time, instead of just a reason to catch up on my sleep.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Unbreakable? Unbelievable!,"I was deeply disappointed by this film. After the wonderful ""The Sixth Sense,"" I expected great things from Shyamalan's second effort. Yes, the cinematography, atmosphere, and acting were exceptional, but the story and the film hardly deserved the effort. Shyamalan takes all that was successful from ""The Sixth Sense"" and repeats the formula: Bruce Willis, Philadelphia, a talented young child actor, a wife with little to do, lots of supernatural atmosphere, and a ""surprise"" ending. But this time the formula failed and nothing surprised me. I kept waiting for something to happen on screen that deserved the mood and the build-up, but I waited in vain. Admittedly, there were some very interesting moments, but overall I felt like the movie was simply a self-important piece of fluff, that left me at the end saying, ""huh??""",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Respectable but not on the same level as The Sixth Sense,"The Sixth Sense was a masterpiece for many reasons, not the least of which was the fact that all movie goers, from the young and uninitiated to the action flick fan to the sophisticated fan of art films, could enjoy the movie.  It crossed all boundaries.  Unbrakable is nowhere near that type of film, and was actually quite slow to develop, almost excruciatingly slow. The last half hour except for the abrupt and unfulfilling ending was much better.  Lots of skill but it didn't come together the was The Sixth Sense did.  Of course, a director/writer could go an entire career and not even have one The Sixth Sense.  It is probably too much to expect a repeat.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A surprisingly good film,"This movie, in my opinion was good. Not one of the best or anything, but definately well written and performed.

After seeing this movie I plan to see, ""The sixth sense,"" because M. Night Shylaman( is that the right spelling? I've never spelled that word before)also made that movie as well as Unbreakable. This movie really has a surprising, kind of sad ending. I won't give it away, but I do recommend seeing this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy their evening with a good movie. I think they could even possibly make a sequel to this, I think in a way that would be good. They could expand more on Willis and his amazing powers.

"Smart, well-made, fantasy","M. Night Shyamalan's clever story postulates that superheroes (both of legend and in current culture) are exaggerated representations of individuals who actually exhibit extraordinary abilities, albeit to a lesser degree than the legendary characters. Comic book aficionado Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) believes that he has found one such person in David Dunn (Bruce Willis), the miraculous sole survivor of a horrendous train crash. The film plays with a number of 'superhero' tropes and hints are dropped along the way as it moves toward an effective 'twist' ending. Willis and Jackson are great in their respective roles, as is the script and cinematography.

M. Night Shyamalan does it again,"What can you say about this true visionary on the art of film but he has done it once again.  Unbreakable is a heart felt and compelling work of the old adage of good versus evil.  Our hero and arch-enemy are both acted with grace, style and believability.  Not only do you see and hear the characters but you can also feel the emotion as it pours through in every word and action.The storyline of the movie is a bit weak and even somewhat slow at times. However, what this movie lacks in story, it more than makes up for in feeling.  The camerawork is exceptional, at times you are as much a part of the movie as you are a viewer.  For example, at the beginning of the movie when we see our hero on the train, we feel like we are in the seat in front of him eavesdropping on his conversation.  The sound and editing only enhance the feeling that you are part of the movie.The symbolism in the movie is much more prevalent than in The Sixth Sense. In my first viewing of the movie, I found myself only wanting to know what will happen next.  But the second time around, I was watching for the symbolism and I was not disappointed.  Mr. Shyamalan even makes a brief appearance in the movie himself.  It was nice to see him in front of the camera instead of behind it.I am on the edge of my seat awaiting his next film.

I wasn't familiar with the comic book premise that the film was built on and I wasn't really a major comic fan, however I was enthralled by this one.Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson are together in a not so nice role between the two. Willis' character is a slow moving, but constant and committed man. Almost passionless in his marriage, he is only living, (seemingly) for his son and his job. Samuel L Jackson's character is a wheel chair bound man that seems a bit vengeful at circumstances and the hand he has been dealt in life and (feeling 'owed') by the world around him.The journey starts and gains momentum as Bruce's security man starts to see and feel strange occurrences. Building up and up he starts to sense not everything inside him is what it seems to be. The performances by all were just as they should have been and the story is rounded out nice with a fantastic twist at the end, bringing it to an open ended close. there could be another installment to this darkly defined story, but it should be done right, or not at all.
