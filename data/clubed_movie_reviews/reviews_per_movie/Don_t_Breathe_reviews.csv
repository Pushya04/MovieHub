"Edge of your Seat Suspense,","Don't Breath is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is an absolute thrill ride, from the moment we enter this man's house there is a tension that does not go away, it never becomes tiring. It had me at the edge of my seat from start to finish, as we quickly gain support for these thieves as they get caught up in a bad situation.It did, on the other hand, make some clich√© plot developments. There are some moments that were so typical they took me away from a movie that was clearly trying to stand out, but was clearly forced by the studio to have some predictable plot points.The cast is phenomenal and their chemistry with one another added to the suspense. Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette were very believable as down on their luck teenagers. The star of the show, however, is without a doubt Stephen Lang, a completely engrossing performance of a ruthless man with no soul, I believe it will go down as the highlight of his career.The intimacy of the film is the main thing that makes it so fresh and interesting as a thriller, if it was taking place around a city or in a town it would not be half as suspenseful as having it all take place in a house. An intense adventure, Don't Breathe is a refreshing movie that certainly stands out from the crowd, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good thriller.A group of teenagers break in to a blind man's home in order to rob his possessions, however, they soon realise he is far smarter than they thought.Best Performance: Stephen Lang",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A brilliant directed, riveting thriller !!!","The central theme lying at the heart of 'Don't Breathe' is the sense of claustrophobia, a sense of being trapped/imprisoned. The director shows us a number of appropriate images like window bars, bars outside gates, prison like shadows being cast by Venetian blinds,etc. to drive home the theme. This theme resonates both in a literal sense with the kids being imprisoned in the house that they had planned to rob in the first place, as well as on a broader symbolic level because it is made clear that these youngsters aspire to break out of the 'prison' of life in a financially ailing Detroit and head for California.This film at the heart of it is an exploitation film and certain details get revealed with the passage of time that in keeping with the genre of exploitation cinema, flirt with lack of realism and force you to suspend disbelief a bit. But what made it very easy for me to suspend disbelief and go along with the ride was Fede Alvarez's direction. Without his masterful directorial skills and storytelling, this film will not work, full stop. He elevates the film. The Giallo inspired visual texture that he uses with the red and green neon lights not just makes the film look vibrant, but also serves a thematic purpose. His camera is extremely active and he makes use of space in the interiors of the house skilfully. He uses extended long takes to raise the tension and his use of ambient noises and music is subtle and brilliant. The very first shot of the film itself is masterful in the way the camera moves from an overhead position gradually to a ground level one to reveal what's happening along with a gradual rise in the volume of the music.Stephen Lang has to be admired for his performance. He brings a very raw, masculine physicality to his demeanour that truly makes him terrifying at times.I think this is one of the best directed horror/thriller films I have seen for some time. It doesn't spend too much time in developing its characters. Both the sides in the conflict are not worth unconditional sympathy. The youngsters are low time criminals and the blind man is not someone worth sympathy either once certain details about his life and mental condition get revealed. I guess it was intentional on the director's part to stage the film with a degree of moral ambiguity where the viewer doesn't fully care for either of the two parties and in the end it works within the exploitation film framework.To end, I'll say 'Don't Breathe' is a film that I would recommend more for the direction than for the script itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Stephen Lang is perfect, the movie very suspenseful.","Three burglars find out about a blind army vet, living in an abandoned street, sitting on a huge amount of cash. The three burglars break their rule of not stealing cash and decide to rob the place, thinking it would be a piece of cake. And of course it isn't. The blind army vet isn't as helpless as they had hoped for.Don't Breathe is directed by Fede Alvarez, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Rodo Sayagues. They obviously felt inspired by David Fincher's Panic Room (2002), and did come up with a great, suspenseful movie. The three burglars are played by Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto, who all do a great job. Stephen Lang however outshines everyone in this movie as the old blind man. He doesn't say a lot but his gestures and mimics were enough to be uncomfortably creepy. Even though he played a blind guy, he still made his character seem anything but helpless, on the contrary, his character was more menacing than any ghost, monster or murderer from your average horror movie. On the other hand however, you feel sorry for the blind man. He's simply a man trying to protect his house from burglars. Or is there more behind this man? The movie does a good job making you wonder about whether the blind man has something to hide or not. The movie does a poorer job however with Daniel Zovatto's character, he's the typical character every horror movie has: the asshole that talks too much and doesn't care about anything or anyone.Besides one or two cheap jump scares, the movie succeeded at maintaining a lingering suspense throughout the entire movie. Once the three burglars are inside the house, there won't be a moment that you'll feel at ease. This is an edge-of-your-seat kind of movie. The movie opens with a scene that obviously takes place later in the movie, which alerts you that until that scene, the burglars will never be safe, and heightens the suspense even more.As the movie progresses, the twists and turns in the story start to accumulate. Twists and turns in a story are great but not if there are too many, and not if these twist and turns are the ones you might expect from a horror movie. Throughout its course, the movie becomes more and more predictable. And this is where the suspense, although still being present, lessens.'Don't Breathe' is a great horror movie, accessible for people who don't usually enjoy the genre. It has a great premise and is very suspenseful but becomes a bit too predictable over time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An incredibly intense thriller,"Fede Alvarez just gave Green Room a run for its money with Don't Breathe, an incredibly intense film and glorious exercise in suspense. It's one of the best studio-produced thrillers I've seen in years. The premise is simple: A group of teens plans to break into a blind man's house to steal his money. Only thing, the old man is more adept than they realize. While the setup is a little too pedestrian, albeit economical, once the story gets rolling, the film doesn't let up, running at a lean 88 minutes. Other than that, Don't Breathe is best viewed going in knowing as little as possible.This is Alvarez's first film in three years since his violent and solid remake of Evil Dead, and it is with this sophomoric debut that solidifies the genre filmmaker as someone with obvious talent. Inspirations are drawn from the best - Hitchcock, Fincher, and Wait Until Dark are a few - but Alvarez provides his own unique vision that truly makes the film his own. Like the masters before him, Don't Breathe is purely cinematic, relying less on dialogue and more on visual storytelling and sound to drive the film. The cinematography is amazing as well as the creative sound design, so much so they are characters within the film themselves.The cast, while small, is great too, including Jane Levy, who can pretty much be titled this generation's scream queen after this and Evil Dead. Dylan Minnette is good in his role as well, providing enough sympathy for his character. Both young actors are put through hell, and their physical performances sell their tumultuous ordeal convincingly. However, it is Stephen Lang who is the film's shining beacon. As the antagonist, Lang is instantly memorable and frightening, an intimidating force that permeates throughout the film even in scenes without his presence.If there's one gripe about the film, there's a plot twist that doesn't quite work, but that itself is a minor complaint compared to the many things the film gets right and does so well. I won't say more. Don't Breathe is a technical achievement, the rare studio film that actually pushes what film can do as a medium. However, like with Green Room, try not to get caught up in the hype, even with my glowing review. Set your expectations appropriately, and remember to avoid watching the trailer.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great thriller with constant tension throughout,"When a group of teenagers decide to rob the house of a blind man, they get more than they bargained for when they realise this won't be like taking candy from a baby. This film was made on a relatively small budget and for that it deserves to be applauded. The central idea about the blind man and the way he uses his environment compared to the thieves is a good concept. In theory, with light they have the advantage, but without it the advantage switches. And the way this theme was developed wasn't bad. However, it's not as engaging as it could have been as I felt a certain disinterest in the outcome of the thieves. I think it's because of a lack of character development. We see Rocky and her sister living in not great conditions at the start of the movie so we know she wants the money to create a better life for her and her sister. But this section is brief. As for the boys, their back story was little to nothing. Enough time wasn't spent to let us get to know the teenagers before the action began, which meant that I didn't really care too much about what happened to them. There is also a big problem with plot holes. There were probably at least 4 or 5 times during the film where I thought ""why would the characters do this? Or how the hell is that possible?"" Another issue relates to a revealing scene later in the movie where the film loses its conviction in its own idea and goes more mainstream. The funny thing is, that was when the film was at its most interesting. But it was because of the shocking reveal that the viewer could finally understand something about the blind man that made him more than just what he'd been shown to be to that point. It's an extreme scene and somewhat uncomfortable to watch, but it provided some motive for what was happening up to that point.Overall the film had potential. It's only 88 mins which means there was room to extend it a little to give us more of a back story to the main characters. That said, The cinematography, score and cast performance are all terrific.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Unstoppable tension,"After Evil Dead's well-made remake, a lot of us felt that Fede Alvarez was a director to watch. With Don't Breathe, he definitely became a director I'm very excited to see future projects from.I admire his knack to generate tension. After the film kicks off, there is really no stopping. It became almost unbearable at the end, nearly reaching the point of overkill. When you have a thriller filled with so much tension throughout its running time, there's only so much you can do before you start yelling ""you gotta be kidding me"" at the screen.The cinematography was beautiful and moody and the performances were fine, except maybe Jane Levy, who I felt was too wooden, making her character a little bit unlikable.Don't Breathe was a solid effort and a great addition to the home invasion genre with a little twist.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fede Alvarez puts on a masterclass on how to craft a suspenseful film,"Let's break it down, shall we?What makes a thriller good? It's the suspense, the nail-biting, tense situations the film presents that have the audience at the edge of their seats at all times. And I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that this film delivers just that. Whenever you feel like the scene is over, and that you have some breathing room, BOOM! Fede drops the characters in a much worse predicament, with the excellent and diverse score by Roque Ba√±os pounding in the background. The score of the film elevates each scene and as the film progresses, the movie raises the bar and ups the ante with each passing moment. Once the characters enter the house, the film always has you in a vice grip and never lets go. It makes you feel what the characters are feeling; their dread, their helplessness; and that is a testament to how great a director, Fede is.Let's move on to the actors. So the main cast consists of Stephen Lang, Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette, and each of them nailed their role. Stephen Lang, sir, hats off to you. The man looks like a bad ass without even trying. That's just what Mr. Lang is, a bad ass. But his performance in this film was much more nuanced. You could see that he was a much more complex character. He showed vulnerability, sadness, anger, depression and hopelessness, all through facial expressions, as his role did not require extensive dialogue. He was the star of the film. But equally so was Jane Levy. Now if you're a huge fan of her, like me, you've probably seen Evil Dead and all three seasons of Suburgatory, and you already know that she's a very diverse actress. But in this film, she took her performance to another level. The dread in her eyes, the anguish, as well as the determination to do what she had to do in the film, all were portrayed so well through physical acting and body language, and the same could be said for Dylan Minette's performance. A+'s all around.Overall, I can confidently say, this is the best film I've experienced in the cinema, this year. Give this film all the money you can. These people deserve it. Thank you to everyone involved, for this experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Basting the turkey will never be the same again.,Not being a massive fan of horror films I'm quite selective in which ones I watch . The reviews for this were pretty good so I gave it a go and I have to say I really enjoyed it. It's the story of three friends who decide to rob the home of a blind war veteran but things go terribly wrong when they find out that there is more to this man than they first thought. What I like about this is that it doesn't have any supernatural aspect to the story so it feels more real than most horrors. There are some quite disturbing scenes so it's not for the faint hearted . One especially involving a turkey baster but you will have to see the film to find out what that's all about ! All in all it's well worth a watch but not with granny at Christmas.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Intense and Suspenseful Thriller,"Fede Alvarez does it again. The director of the renowned horror film ""Evil Dead,"" brings to you a piece of excellence that will have you hold your breath throughout this morality thriller ‚Äì ""Don't Breathe."" It is an exquisite play that plays with the audience's integrity and the will to do the right thing while conveying the story in such a way that we feel helpless and uneasy the same way that the protagonists on screen do.Alvarez made a lot of smart decisions in the making of this film and one of these decisions was choosing the right cast. He was really wise to reunite himself with the star of ""Evil Dead,"" Jane Levy, an actress who is fearless at any given situation, and he was even wiser to cast Stephen Lang, an astounding actor for decades, who brilliantly portrays quite a challenging role here. Alvarez and his team give a remarkable visual representation of the story just by the exquisite sense of geography throughout the film, keeping in mind almost the whole film is a one- setting implementation thriller.Here is a short insight of the film and what you're going to expect. The story starts off with the audience getting to know the three protagonists of the film: Rocky (Levy), her boy friend Money (Daniel Zovatto), and wanna-be boyfriend, Alex (Dylan Minnette). These three teen crooks rob houses in the wealthy suburbs in Detroit for some easy cash, however Alex's dad manages a security company that gives them the access to most of the alarm systems installed in houses they plan to rob, which means a lot less of ""breaking"" in breaking & entering. Rocky lives in a dump with her innocent sister, corrupt mother, and her mother's formidable boyfriend.Since we're discussing the insights on individual characters of the story, it would be the perfect time to point out one of the drawbacks to this film. The reason many horror films always feel incomplete is because they don't have a solid background story to build up to an intense climax; rather they're just a continuity of techniques to give a sense of fear to the audience. This is what distinguished ""Don't Breathe"" compared to the other horror films¬Ö till this point. Even though Alvarez shed a good amount of light on Rocky, and the blind man (Lang) later on, he didn't give enough insight on Alex and Money and that's to the film's disadvantage since the audience was not able to fully understand the character traits that define that specific role. You could feel Alvarez was rushing to the ""good part"" of the story however the ""good part"" could have been better if he took time to give an understanding on these two protagonists.Getting back to the gist of the film, the three teenagers are sick of quickie robberies so they hope for a better job that could possibly change their future and to their luck, Money uncovered an easy gig, which is to steal a good amount of money that sits in a safe in a blind veteran's house. With this money, Money and Rocky, along with her sister, plan to move away to California in hope for a better life. It seems like an easy job to rob a blind old man who lives alone with the access to his alarm system; what could go wrong?As mentioned before, the integrity of the audience is at question throughout the film since you wouldn't opt for teenagers to rob a helpless blind old man. But is he that helpless? The low-level criminals underestimated the blind veteran and that resulted in a not very fruitful situation for Rocky, Alex, and Money. However the moral complexity takes a back seat after a significant plot twist towards the end of the story. Trying to refrain from any spoilers, let's just say that the blind old man is a definite villain for a very disturbing situation.Overall this has been a great thriller that you will surely love to watch again and again without losing even a bit of interest every time you watch it. The battle of wills between the protagonists and the antagonists is the headline of the film and the wonderful cinematography creates a frightful atmosphere for the audience to get engaged in. The icing on the cake has to be the various plot twists here and there, which keep you wondering what would happen next and of course have you hold your breath.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Don't Breathe Is Not Only Extremely Intense, But It Also Sets An Example Of How Horror Movies Of Today Should Be Made","I'm not the hugest horror movie buff, but when it comes to horror films like The Shining or Cabin In The Woods just know it increases my liking of the horror genre. Now rarely today will I find a horror film that I will extremely like or even like at all. It's almost now a 1/3 ratio were I'll actually go into a horror movie and find it to be a decent film. Don't Breathe not only expands a new level of intensity in horror or thriller films, but if it makes enough money it could inspire new waves of actually really good horror movies. Don't Breathe blew me away I was so immersed into this film that I almost felt like I was in the horrible situation that the characters in the film were in. There was so many times were I was on the edge of my seat and even sometimes holding in my own breath when the actors were holding their breaths. The premise of this film isn't very new it's kind of borrowed off of films like Panic Room but I think with horror films like The Conjuring, it's okay to borrow off clich√© premises if the film itself is done right. The two main characters played by Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette have great character development. When a horror movie gives characters good development and likability it just makes the film way better. Cause now that I have these two characters that I actually care about it'll make me care about what will possibly happen too them throughout the runtime of the film. Now Stephen Lang's character I thought was very menacing as this Blind man. He had a great back story and he was a threat to be reckoned with. Also the way the camera focuses or moves around from scene to scene or place to place is done so well that it brings the intensity level to a more even pace. There's even a lot of long shots in this film that kept me on the edge of my seat. Now I do have one complaint with this film and that is about, no spoilers of course, the ending. The ending I think went on for too long it could've cut off at least 15 minutes earlier and the film would've been better. The film just kept dragging on and it felt unnecessary. Also just a heads up if you haven't yet seen the trailer for this film, I recommend not seeing it cause it actually spoils part of the movie. Other than that I had such an amazing time with Don't Breathe and if your a fan of the horror genre, definitely go into it and if you are interested in having a exciting experience at the movies go and see this film. This is easily one of my favorite films this year and I'm going to give Don't Breathe a grade of an A and a IMDb score of a 9/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Editing was great,"Don't Breathe is a different kind of movie in the home invasion genre because it actually follows those who invaded in the first place getting hunted. I have yet to see a movie like that so I found the beginning very enjoyable and was almost rooting for the ""Blind Guy.""

There were many moments I went back to watch the last few seconds again because it was such a well set up scene.

Shut In,"Unemployed and unable to find legitimate work, three young adults take to thievery as a last resort, however, breaking in a blind Vietnam War veteran's house leads to some horrific twists in this home invasion thriller produced by Sam Raimi. From the premise alone, the film sounds a lot like the earlier Adam Schindler movie 'Intruders' (aka 'Shut In') with the notion of the person whose home is being invaded being less helpless than first appears. Along these lines, 'Don't Breathe' seems to up the ante by making the thieves sympathetic; Jane Levy's character in particular has extensive early scenes in which we come to understand how much she and her younger sister not only want but need to move away from home. This dynamic renders the first half of 'Don't Breathe' quite interesting as we are pulled between feeling sorry for the blind war veteran and for the thieves with various incidents causing our sympathies to swing back and forth. The film disappointingly chooses a side around halfway in though as it is revealed that the veteran has a shocking secret in his basement. Not only is the secret implausible, it places us in an awkward position where ethically we have to root for the thieves instead, which just does not sit right. The film certainly has enough in the thrills and chills department that it is entertaining until the end and the pacing is never off. There is also a lot to like in the idea of the war veteran being better equipped than the thieves even without his sight, even if this idea could have perhaps been put to better use.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Edge-of-the-seat!,"The movie is not entirely a fresh novelty, the typical home invasion movie but what we don't know is that the inmate living in that house makes the concept different. The eccentric man and apparently blind pretty much turns the tables on three thieving teens in this thriller.The movie starts off pretty slow, but it gives much space for the characters to develop their respective story. What makes this movie even greater is that Fede Alvarez, the director of the Evil Dead remake, delivers only 4 major characters on the screen if you don't count the feral dog. Overall, it has a strong plot and unique vibe to it, as it relies more on visual storytelling and sounds to drive the film rather than plenty of dialogue.Once the three amateur thieves step inside the shadowy house, that's when it is fuelled by old-school suspense. It's very realistic from the moment they break into that blind man's house, asking from the perspective of how, why and what. The discreet environment can make someone's heart beating so fast. There are times where everything goes silent and it's incredible considering how the audience freezes and no one wants to make a single sound even when you're chewing popcorns. Not everything silent though, there are a few parts when the ominous music plays in the background, people just keep watching, waiting for something to be revealed. It's incredibly intense which literally leaves you breathless. The one thing I have in similar with this director is the cinematography. The way how the director angles the motion of every picture. It's very much like how I imagine it, the style of bringing the cameras with a very smooth touch especially 5 minutes after they break into the vicinity of the house.Every movie has its black area, the thing that I feel a little over- the-top is the predictable moments, FOR SOMEONE WHO WATCHES A LOT OF MOVIE. It comes out a little too strong, but somehow it manages to capture my heart.Stephen Lang once said throughout the filming process, he couldn't really see anything as he wore scleral contact lenses. How hard is it for someone to do that? You answer it for yourself.This must be in my top 5 list movies of 2016. It is intriguing and the kind of movie you would want to stay at the edge-of-your-seat.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Here comes little Kevin, all grown up and blinded","""Don't Breathe"" had a concept that appealed to me. Three Detroit teens are systematically robbing houses of goods to pawn with the aim of getting Rocky (Jane ""Evil Dead"" Levy) out of the clutches of her deadbeat family to start a new life in California with her younger sister. Dylan Minnette plays the cautious and intellectual Alex, hiding his crush on Rocky particularly badly. Daniel Zovatto plays the fruit-loopy stoner 'Money' ‚Äì the loose cannon of the trio and Rocky's boyfriend.After a successful run, they unwisely pick on the home of a blind war veteran (""Avatar""'s Stephen Lang). He is not just 'Home Alone' but 'Neighbourhood Alone' (reflecting, probably accurately, the demise of previously affluent suburbs in some industrially declining US cities). Blind or not, the vet (and friend) are a force to be reckoned with: with startling speed the tables are turned and the kids are fighting for their lives. And there are more surprises in store within the spooky old house.As an audience member, there are certainly points at which the title becomes uncomfortably literal! On the tensionometer, there is a similarity here with last year's ""No Escape"". A scene where blindness is turned into a positive asset is particularly effective.As is common with this genre, the film suffers from a plot-line that at times makes no sense and involves indestructible participants (with an incident involving garden shears being particularly incomprehensible).A particularly unpleasant sexual-threat scene towards the end of the film is also nonsensical involving a level of -ahem ‚Äì 'preparation' that the preceding plot simply doesn't merit.Inevitably though, the film lives or dies on whether you feel empathy for the disreputable kids in peril. The start of the film tries to balance the empathy scales by giving Rocky her backstory, throwing in the 'little sister' card. It also demonstrates that ""The Blind Man"" is a 'bit of a bastard' ‚Äì or perhaps that should be a 'bit of a baste-ard' (LOL, in-joke)). Unfortunately however I hold the peculiarly unfashionable idea that if things are ""mine"" they are ""mine"" ‚Äì not anyone elses: so, on balance, I wasn't rooting for them and would be happy to let the thieving little sh*ts all get beaten to death! Jane Levy (channelling a young Emma Stone) acquits herself admirably as the heroine in peril. Also of particular note is the highly effective atonal score by Roque Ba√±os that ramps up the tension extremely effectively. Directed by ""Evil Dead"" director, Uruguayan Fede Alverez, the film does have a certain style and is an enjoyable roller-coaster ride, provided you park your brain at the (well locked) door.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review, and to subscribe for future reviews.

Horror has a new name!,"The power of a film's opening establishing shot cannot be under-estimated. If done well it will pull the viewer in and the storytelling becomes an easier job. One of my favourite opening shots hails from Highlander (1986). It has that curious gaze on a scene of mayhem that breathes with unusual counterpoints. It is hypnotising, beguiling, almost surreal, as you try to make sense of it. However I can't say the rest of the film did that clever opening scene any justice. Don't Breathe, on the other hand, has none of these issues. It opens with a scene that feels weirdly out of place but yet has a visceral and realistic quality about it. Questions whizzed through my mind as I silently prayed that the journey of discovery be a rewarding one. It is. Oh my... It fricking is.Uruguayan writer/director Fede Alvarez's debut is a remake of Evil Dead (1981) called.... ahem.... Evil Dead (2013). It is loud, deafening and pours a swimming pool of blood all over you because he thinks more is good. His sophomore effort Don't Breathe is quieter, superbly lo-fi and the scares hit a lot harder. Running at 88 minutes, this is one lean, mean, crackerjack of a movie. Nary a scene is wasted. It resembles Netflix's Hush a lot in the sense that it is a home invasion psychological horror film and the homeowner is physically impaired. In the excellent Hush, the female victim is a deaf mute, while in Don't Breathe we get a blind man. But mark this, the similarities end there. Hush is a straight up thriller and we can easily root for the victim and celebrate her clever one-ups against the psychopath. In Don't Breathe we don't get that luxury and our sympathies for each character will sway across the board. There is an air of unpredictability permeating throughout the movie and the tension slowly rams up to dizzying hair-pulling levels. There are some inventive scenes that press the ""genre refresh"" button and if you have been watching as many of these genre flicks as I have, that is something quite rare.The best character here is definitely The Blind Man played devilishly well by Stephen Lang. His dialogue is very spare but when it comes it will send a shiver down your spine. He is feral, doesn't listen to desperate cries of mercy and is a force of primal nature. Being blind means naught to him because he knows the lay of his house like the back of his massive hand. The battleground is his playground. You can go in but you can't get out. At a certain point we discover a sickening secret about him and it is such an uncomfortable eye-popping moment. But yet it is a powerful scene because I started to pity his heartbreaking desperation. Lang has brought his A game and it is a character that will haunt me for a long time.The cinematography is fluid and really brings out the claustrophobic feel of pure terror. Alvarez has delivered a thoroughly satisfying genre horror flick that is definitely not derivative. Evil Dead (2013) is forgotten. Don't Breathe is Alvarez's new first horror film. Horror has a new name. Remember his name.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intense Thriller with Great Performances,"Don't Breathe (2016)*** (out of 4)Extremely well-made and intense thriller about three small-time criminals (Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto) who make their money by breaking into homes. They decide to focus in on the home of an Iraqi vet who is blind because of a large settlement he received and they believe the cash is inside the house. It doesn't take long for them to realize they've made a major mistake.Fede Alvarez directed and co-wrote this film, which is without question one of the best thrillers that I've seen from recent years. Everything about this movie is pretty darn good, although I will admit that once it was over I was able to pick apart several logical issues. With that said, while the movie is going on there's no question that it keeps you on the edge of your seat and also manages to make you not look away from everything that is happening.I'm not going to go into many details because there are some twists and turns that shouldn't be ruined for anyone. I must admit that I thought the story worked perfectly well and I also thought that the director did a great job with the visual style of the picture and the fact that once he gets your pulse rate up he never lets go. The most impressive thing about the film is the fact that you're basically stuck inside the home and yet the director is able to get tension from every room in the house as well as every twist in the story.Levy is wonderful in the lead role as the criminal who is trying to get one last score so that she can protect and move her sister out of a bad household. I also thought Minnette and Zovatto were effective in their roles playing two totally opposite characters. Then there's Stephen Lang who is downright magnificent as the old blind man. He's certainly a very threatening character and Lang plays him to perfection. Again, I'm not going to spoil anything but lets just say Lang plays everything wonderfully well.I did have some issues with the picture including the fact that only in today's day and age could there be a story about three worthless criminals who break in on a war vet and they are the good guys. I must admit that I had a hard time cheering for these three lazy kids who went for crime instead of a real job. Some moral conflicts aside, DON'T BREATHE was a highly entertaining and very effective thriller.",,Anonymous,Horror

The story-line went absolutely smoothly, very easy to follow. There were surprises & I was constantly grabbing my husband's arm out of fear.

When a Blind Man Makes You Regret Every Life Choice,"Fede Alvarez drops us into a post-apocalyptic Detroit that looks like it was pulled straight out of a Fallout game. With crumbling houses and deserted streets, three small-time crooks are desperate to escape their misery. And what better way to cash out than robbing an old blind man? Except this old guy isn't your average retiree-he's a blend of Daredevil, Jason Bourne, and a pitbull on steroids. Welcome to the house of regret.Stephen Lang's character, Lang, is the kind of man who makes you rethink all your life goals, even while blind. Terrifying, methodical, and tougher than a final-level boss, he's the true star of the movie. If you thought a blind old man would be an easy target, prepare to be slapped by reality-and trust me, he doesn't miss, even without seeing you.The old man's house is an escape room where the only exit is death. There are no cheap Annabelle-style jumpscares, just gut-wrenching tension that squeezes you like Freddy Krueger using you as a stress ball. Hallways, basements, traps-everything is designed to make you vow never to rob a house again. The atmosphere is grimy, suffocating, and every shot reeks of death.For once, we get characters with more than two brain cells who actually use them. No stupid decisions like in your typical slasher. They act relatively logically, but against a blind man playing on Dark Souls difficulty, logic doesn't matter much. They run, they scream, they pray, but it's all futile against Lang in full-on invincible boss mode.Fede Alvarez proves he doesn't need buckets of gore to hit you hard. His direction is sharp, with striking visual ideas. The makeup work is flawless, and while the pacing occasionally dips, you're glued to the screen throughout. Special shoutout to some gut-churning scenes that'll make you regret eating beforehand.Don't Breathe is a masterclass in tension and storytelling. Stephen Lang dominates, and Alvarez reminds us that true nightmares aren't ghosts or demons-they're humans with nothing left to lose. This is a thriller that will leave you drenched in cold sweat and filled with second thoughts. A dark gem that's worth watching... but maybe with the lights on.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Feverish, brutal, and so much fun","I knew basically nothing other than hearing it was a ""home invasion"" horror film. I intentionally didn't read anything on it or watch any trailers, and thank goodness. It safely continues the trend of great horror this year. Wickedly brutal, bonkers crazy, and so, so ridiculous. That last thing is said with absolute love and glee though. Like 10 Cloverfield Lane earlier this year, it knows it's basically a B-flick in every sense of the word and Fede Alvarez runs away with it. The film never actually turns into a comedy horror film because it's never that obvious, and yet you can sense the filmmakers laughing with glee while making it. The filming and directing itself is really well done. Although it doesn't hit the the genre highs that Green Room (a film that is also similar in its frenzied and feverish pacing and narrative) hit, it still does so much justice to this genre. The acting itself is also pretty good, with Jane Levy continuing to be the MVP and continuing her talent from Evil Dead. She and Alvarez make a great team.",,Anonymous,Horror
An Intense Urban Thriller With Excellent Performances.,"Don't Breathe will become a future Cult Classic in my opinion.This is a well made suspense urban Thriller that could've or should've, come out in the 90's.Don't Breath could be put in the same urban thriller (with a dash of Horror) genre as greats from the 90's like, Trespass (1992) or Judgment Night (1993) or Unlawful Entry (1992) or The People Under The Stairs (1991) & many more.The abandoned Detroit neighbourhood that this is set in is creepy as hell, the old house that the blind man lives in is creepy too, infact the atmosphere in this movie is edge of the seat intensity, All the actors are FANTASTIC & give excellent performances especially the scary Stephen Lang as the blind man ,Dylan Minnette & Jane Levy all amazing!!! This is one hell of an exciting Thriller that feels so real & gritty & very exciting!!! It's a tough one really because the main trio are robbers/thieves/burglars so their not exactly really likeable characters but as the film goes on you start to see why they're the way they are & why they do what they do. The characters live in a Detroit that's almost apocalyptic, rundown & harsh. It's the gritty environment they survive in that triggers their actions, they want to escape their lives. I can totally underrated their actions even if their actions are wrong. I especially understand the girl (Jane Levy) as she wants to escape with her little sister out of the rough trailer trash life & move to California & I really felt for her. So yeah excellent acting from all the cast & real powerful motivations for the damaged characters. Don't Breathe is a ferocious thriller that's full of nail-biting suspense & brutal violence that hits hard. Stephen Lang is truly terrifying as the ex-army blind man who is a scary savage hunter (although i Don't believe he could do half of what he does blind in real life)
Dylan Minnette is truly excellent here & is a standout performance for me.The cinematography is outstanding & you see that in the birds eye view shots of the old decrepit run-down Detroit neighbourhood, very creepy & well shot, an urban nightmare!!!This is a dark fun Thriller made with quality even down to the good creepy atmospheric music & an atmosphere full of loneliness & dread.DON'T BREATHE really is a fun Horror house.There's also a sadness to this as the blind man listens to a home video of his young daughter to fall asleep too, it's a moment that is very heartfelt as his daughter died by getting run over.BUT:
Now as much as i enjoyed it there's some stupid stuff that made NO sense like how could a blind man raise a baby anyway? There's no way he could look after it & there's no way he could all what he does being blind, No Way!!!Also the beating the blind man takes around the head near the end, he would definitely die or have brain damage.But it makes more a fun ride it's just very unrealistic.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""There is nothing a man cannot do once he accepts the fact that there is no god""","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I'll be completely honest here, and say that when I first watched the trailer for 'Don't Breathe' I didn't think it would be all that spectacular, or anywhere near the thrilling feature film that was advertised.I'm happy to say first impressions don't tell the whole story. Don't Breathe was refreshingly intense. I didn't think this film could keep you fixated from start to finish when it looked to be set solely in the blind man's home. However, I'll happily admit that I was wrong.After reading some optimistic reviews regarding the film during its release, I knew that I would add this to my list of modern-day horror without expecting to see anything new, or be blown away by it. I was hoping that I would have some real tense moments that kept me on the edge of my seat, and I was not disappointed.'Don't Breathe' is full of suspense and intensity and while watching the story unfold with its three young delinquents (Jane Levy as Rocky and Dylan Minnette as Alex are the standouts) and their present lifestyles, you start to change your opinion and your feelings to who the true victims are.The setting is brilliant with the neighbourhood looking desolate, dark, run-down and abandoned except for seemingly one living person an old, blind, reclusive veteran portrayed exceptionally by Steven Lang. This film puts your mind into a dark place that is claustrophobic, and dramatic and makes you feel fearful and isolated.It leaves you shocked many times, and just when you think you know what's going to happen next something new and unexpected enters the fray so you are left feeling always enthralled for constant survival.This is one of the better modern-day horror/thriller films which is executed to the best of its ability. There is no cheap jump scares or over-the-top violence here just realistic terror which will make you think twice about underestimating what some people are capable of.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the better home invasion thrillers,"... In an extremely long line of them. Hey, Mia from Evil Dead is back! (Don't Breathe is from the makers of the Evil Dead reboot, literally the only reboot I've seen that does the original justice). So, this is stylishly made, has that great eerie Detroit setting, is well-acted, intense, interesting score, and has some good action. It's also got a whole bunch of implausibilities. I don't want to give away how things unfold, but there are plenty of instances of ""How is this person still alive?,"" as well as complete lapses of logic. I thought the worst offender came at the end: The Blind Man knows the code to all his safes, but not the one to his home security system?! And he was RIGHT THERE. I found this baffling, and very convenient to how things play out. In other words, lazy modern horror writing. One quote on the box says ""Best American horror film in twenty years!"" Has this guy been living in a cave? It's a ludicrous statement. Also, very telling -- Best ""American"" -- yeah, critics fawn all over the foreign stuff.Anyway, don't get me wrong, this is a strong home invasion entry, just not without its share of nagging plot holes. It was good enough that I'm watching Part 2 tonight, to see what the Blind Man is up to nowadays.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Stephen Lang show,"Stephen Lang is such an impressive, intimidating-looking guy. At his age, he can still overpower and beat up a bunch of 20-something year old kids to a pulp on screen and do so perfectly convincingly. This movie relies entirely on his performance as the scary antagonist and he does so very well. That alone is enough to recommend this movie.But that's not all that deserves praise. When this movie gets going, it's non-stop action and there's a natural flow and logic to the action too, which may seem like an unusual thing to praise, but it's more than we can say for a lot of other lazier thriller movies, where the victim characters make the dumbest possible decisions only to be picked off. I'd say this movie does a pretty good job of avoiding such clich√©s, because in this movie the characters make reasonable decisions for their own survival all along the way. If they go a certain direction, it's because it actually seems like the best way to go. If they get stuck in a dangerous spot, it's because they had no better choice. The characters in the movie actually managed to outsmart me, the viewer, at certain points. Their decisions to get out of certain perilous situations were actually pretty clever, leaving me thinking, well if that was me, I'd be dead.Anyway, this is an effective thriller movie that's actually more fun than it should be, mainly because Stephen Lang is such an impressive presence on screen, that you'll actually enjoy seeing him every time he shows up, even though you're supposed to be afraid of him.My only question is shouldn't the Blind Man's house at least have a workout room full of weights and exercise equipment?

Stephen Lang is a Menace!,"Don't Breathe is a horror film done right. Here, Fede Alvarez & Rodo Sayagues offer a satisfyingly tense, home invasion gone awry, that leaves its audience choked out from seeing Stephen Lang layeth the smack down without regard. In terms of ruthlessness & personified menace then, there is no shortage here. Apart from Lang's unrelenting brutality, Don't Breathe tightens its grip further, through the suspense demanded by its resounding horror tropes, that takes advantage of Alvarez' novel iteration of his antagonist. For instance, the effective use of jump scares is an unfamiliar success most horror films sadly misuse. Dont Breathe's sound design & set pieces that hints on Lang's extreme disposition, amplify its haunting moments & Lang's twisted sense. Also, its praise worthy use of darkness, though unfortunately underused, accounted for insane hair raising moments. Of course, these well executed concepts are weaved together by fantastic camerawork that never wastes a chance to scare through perspectives.Where Don't Breathe falters, is when chaos breaks loose and unconvincing screenplay takes place. These inconveniences, added to heighten Lang's monstrosity, works against him, as it dampens the terror needlessly and takes a turn towards exaggeration.Nevertheless, Don't Breathe remains a mostly well executed horror film, that elevates a truly exciting concept through filmmaking that guarantees a suspenseful, edge of your seat experience. I am however, wary of the announced sequel, as a blunder could render the franchise as a mere cash grab. Fingers crossed!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Better than ""Evil Dead"" remake a bad-ass home invasion horror film","Yes I enjoy this film, I wouldn't call it best horror film, but decent, cause I seen ton's of better horror films.

The Blind man is a Iraq Gulf War Veteran in which a rich girl hit and killed his daughter and did not go to prison. Rocky (Jane Levy) is deseperate to get the money for her younger sister that she is abused from her mother. She has to fight for her life.I love ""Don't Breathe"" from Fede Alvarez better than Evil Dead remake the film has similarity to The People Under the Stairs, The Collector and The Collection which are about Home Invasions horror rated-R films. Jane levy was terrific as Rocky the main heroine she did everything to stay alive and fight for her life. You have even a doberman dog in which he chases Rocky and try's to eat her.The blind men (Stephen Lang) is a sick creepy pervert who has a dark secret in a basment. I have this movie on a Blu-ray disc. Don't Breath is a good movie, I wish their would be more booby traps set in the house like were in Friday the 13th (2009) remake, The People Under the Stairs and The Collector. The blind man wears two guns Beretta 92FS and Colt Python and shots to kill his intruders.A really good creative visual scary horror film, well paced flick. It goes fast around, I enjoy it.

it's not the best thriller but it's a good ride with some social commentary,"Being set in detroit it's no coincidence. one of the cities with more economical problems in us. with industries fading, with people wanting to leave the place. with neighbourhoods that flourished and now are nothing. california might be a dream for some, but it's not hard to understand why people would do stuff like this. i think the movie does give a nice backstory with the characters that meks you more worried about them. plus being set in a city like detroit gives an extra spice for me. the rich/poor gap is actually explored, no matter what some whiny reviewers say.sometimes people want too much explanations: why this why that...and i don't understand. the movie doesn't need to explain everything. i don't even think it requires that much suspension of disbelief but that's me. it's a cool gimmick that the guy is blind because the scenes where they're silenced in the same room as the guy are pretty well made.it's a movie well shot (no shaky cam or constant jump cuts thankfully, and some travellings that actually want you to understand the house of the guy), with good characters and nice acting, that has one or two jump scares, that has extra spice to it (which for me wasn't that necessary) but above all was entertaining and delivered what was promised. you can't say otherwise in my opinion.i don't believe it's an horror classic, also because i found it more in the thriller genre. but ithas really well shot scenes and you can follow clearly th characters, knowing where they are in that period of time, creating creative boundaries for their escape. for me it's simple.: ignore the bad reviews and enjoy the movie. people sometimes want to complain about minor things without getting into the head of the charaters: this situation was completely unexpected for them.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The ruthless savagery of the killer combined with the tight quarters and oppressive silence make Don't Breathe a well-done and frightening slasher must-see.,"What starts as a typical home invasion thriller transforms into anything, but when the blind elderly man the thieves thought would be an easy mark turns out to be a vicious killer, Don't Breathe becomes something so much better. With suspense and tension similar to A Quiet Place, characters desperately fight to hold their breath and avoid making any sound so the deadly blind man can't find and kill them. Don't Breathe is visceral, brutal, and claustrophobic. In such a small, confined space, the anxiety never fades because the killer is literally in the room with his potential victims. There is one particularly disturbing scene near the end, so I recommend looking up a parents guide before you commit to watching if you aren't a frequent horror enthusiast. Don't Breathe surprises as one of the best new horror slasher films of the last decade.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you think you know, you don't.","Evil Dead remake director, Fede Alvarez gives us the jumps in his house of terror of desolate Detroit. (Not seen the 'new' Evil Dead yet, but aware it was done with Sam Raimi's blessing, being a producer of the film.) Now this is a different breed of horror and don't assume you think you know what it's all about because believe me. You don't. (Unless you've already seen it of course)What you should know, is that three would-be burglars break-in to a blind man's house in the hope of striking rich. Instead, hope is all they find as they become trapped and hunted by the blind man who is superbly played by Broadway superstar and Avatar Colonel, Stephen Lang. His looming presence and stature is terrifying, and being blind just adds to the tense atmosphere.Evil Dead star (latest one again) Jane Levy takes the lead as Rocky, wanting to get out of Detroit for good and sees this as her great opportunity to do so, lead astray by her Boyfriend Money (Daniel Zovatto) and aided by her secret admirer Alex (Dylan Minnette.) All three are brilliant, though they look permanently shocked throughout, but you can't blame them as the shocks keep on coming.There's none of this ""why you going in there?"" or ""why would someone do that?"" Like some horrors strive upon, instead this is just waiting for, or watching what happens next. You're not given much time to catch a breath, or even guess where it's is going or think of solutions. And if you do, you'll get hit by a curve ball, like a hammer to the face. It's disturbing but moves too ferociously to allow it to sink-in.Though seeming quite original, I can see some elements from other horrors, especially Cujo, and this was probably the worse part for me, but still, it really works and adds to the non-stop surprises. It's dark, twisted, sharp and brutal. Absolutely relentless and really isn't what you might imagine. Alvarez does an amazing roller-coaster of a horror ride. Amazing job on the editing, and I can only imagine the screenplay looking like an organised mess, it certainly feels a lot longer than 88mins and not in a bad way.It isn't scary like the conventional horrors or slashers but incredibly jumpy.

quality suspense and a first-watch shocker; stupid character decisions and plot holes keep it from greatness,"To review this movie without involving spoilers is tough, but here's my take: the film builds substantial tension and sustains it well before the ""surprise"" occurs, and the acting is solid all around. Stephen Lang is a favorite of mine but he really excelled here as the antagonist, and more than just being a badass. To avoid spoilers, I won't get too deep into it, but the versatility he executes was impressive. Calling this movie a horror I think is wrong, but it's a thorough suspense/thriller for sure, and fairly unique in its writing. If only the main characters weren't plagued by absolutely dumb decisions, and the whole Cujo scene felt like the pinnacle of stupidity, nevermind being gratuitous. The biggest plot hole occurs at the end, and is something we're just supposed to ignore I guess. At any rate, now there's a sequel slated for release, and one glance at that will serve as spoiler in itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Suspense overload...,"""Don't Breathe"" is a horror movie in which we watch a group of thieves trying to break into a house in which we will find a massive fortune. In this house, only a blind man with tragic past lives. He and his dog live an isolated and lonely life. After they break into his house, they start searching for that massive fortune but everything will change when the blind man will understand their presence. And as they were thinking that they will walk away easily with all the money, the blind man does not think the same way.I liked this movie because it had a very interesting plot with many twists and because of the very well-written script. I also believe that the direction which was made by Fede Alvarez was simply amazing and his beautiful work it can be easily understood in the whole duration of this film. I liked a lot the interpretation of Stephen Lang who played The Blind Man and he simply nailed his role. Other good interpretations were Jane Levy's who played Rocky and Dylan Minnette who played Alex. The best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of suspense and an interesting plot which combination of both is the key for a good movie.Finally, I believe that ""Don't Breathe"" is a good horror movie with plenty of suspense and many twists that will keep you alert for the whole duration of it. I also think that you aren't going to waste your time watching it. I recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much since it's something different from all the other horror movies that you have ever watched.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great direction, brilliant storytelling, and edge-of-the-seat sequences","I am not entirely sure if this could count in as a horror movie. It seemed more of a thriller to me. What I loved in the movie was the thrill sequences, the director's style of story telling and logically explaining a seemingly impossible plot.Story (9/10): One blind man making a nightmare out of three burglars seemingly ""piece-of-cake"" burglary - can it get any better? The story was brilliant and provided a perfect ingredient for a high-intensity thriller. While the movie was sparse on the dialogs, which essentially increased the burden on the acting department, the conceptualization of sequences was absolutely brilliant - to the extent that you feel the frustration of being trapped in a house and each door for getting out getting closed (literally as well as metaphorically) one after the other. Although there were one or two technical mistakes in the plot, but overall it's a great job done by Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues.Acting (8/10): Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette was great to watch with impeccable expressions. If at all this movie gets categorized into horror, it would be because of Jane and Dylan who projected the frustration, anger, fear and desperation amazingly well. Stephen Lang had a challenging role, playing a blind man but an army veteran, which went well with his muscular body and heavy voice. However, he plays a surprisingly brutal character. These three had a very large part of the movie. Rest of the supporting cast had very little screen time to show any acting prowess.Direction (9/10): I loved the direction of Fede Alvarez. His way of storytelling is amazing. The idea of showing certain things (kind of dropping hints) which you feel would play a key role later in the movie as the burglars enter the house was great. The movie isn't long at all (just 1.5 hours) but still it goes for a little overkill towards the end with a dragged climax when you feel that this should be the end but the director says - ""Wait wait..... there's more!!"". Pretty good camera work during one of the sequences in complete darkness. He spent a little time in explaining the entire background of the burglary - which was great. I feel his way of explaining everything in a very logical manner provided a much realistic projection of seemingly impossible story - so, no loose ends anywhere. Great job there.Overall (9/10): It's a great watch - definitely if you love thrillers or horrors. Great direction, brilliant storytelling, and edge-of-the-seat sequences.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's Vision Is Based On Movement,"After watching the most excellent Alien: Romulus I decided to go back and check out director Fede Alvarez's other works and stumbled upon this solid thriller. It stars Stephen Lang, the general from Avatar, as a blind war veteran and when some dumb and desperate teens break into his house to steal his money, things go very wrong for the teens as this blind old man isn't as helpless as he may seem. The film is also beautifully shot and some moments when the blind man is just randomly popping up throughout the house are genuinely eerie to witness. While not as scary as his Alien movie or even his Evil Dead adaptation, Don't Breathe still manages to deliver a very good tense thriller with some rather disturbing scenes towards the final act of the film. I heard that the sequel wasn't as good as the first film so I think I may be skipping it, but if anyone wants a good old fashioned short, sweet and to the point thriller, check out this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
ACT TWO IS REALLY GOOD,"I was lukewarm about Act One. The setup was OK. At least they made the characters three-dimensional.Act Two really worked for me.

Some bits were predictable and others laughable.I really liked the blind man.

"Felt like I lost over 5 pounds just from the relentless tension, twists & turns.","There's no gratuitous violence, gore and disturbing behavior even though the plot demanded it because every violent, gory and disturbing action/reaction made complete sense according to what one would expect from a home invasion of a blind Iraq War veteran with possible PTSD who also lost a loved one.And that's the worm that constantly turned in my head figuring out who to sympathize with...the invaders? or the blind veteran? That, along with the slowly increasing disturbing behavior of the blind man and strategic cat & mouse maneuvers in a small, old house, put me right in the middle of it to where I thought I was gonna' go mad.And just when I thought the good guys? bad guys? home invaders were going to get away scot-free, they're thrown right back in it with even more unexpected bizarrely life threatening results that make both antagonist? and victim? up their game and reveal what they're truly made of physically, emotionally and morally. I mean a video game inspired just from the cleverness of the escapes and captures would make for an exciting thrill ride.And finally this is a movie that sets up a believable plot twist at the end for a possible sequel that makes complete sense. A sequel I greatly look forward to.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The atmosphere is very good,"The atmosphere is very good. There aren't many surprising sections, but it's very thrilling. At the same time, I want to know what will happen next. Coupled with the contrast of the rhythm change, the case of the underground prisoner, and the bright pin and needle, all bring a fresh wind to the horror film. Of course, there are also shortcomings: the picture is too dark; the sense of terror is greatly diluted after more fighting in the later stage; although different perspectives have the effect of climax, but the cohesion between the plots is not smooth enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A breaking and entering of a house of a blind ex soldier leaves you feeling you already know where this one's going a blind Rambo type character will defend his home.No spoilers here but that is so far from where the psychological Thriller/horror takes you.An onion of a movie every time you open a layer and you think you know what is going on.

"A Nerve, But Overall Dumb movie.","'Don't Breathe' was enjoyable, but it suffers from ""Dumb Characters Doing Dumb Things At The Worse Time"" syndrome.

Don't Breathe - Don't Miss,"Don't Breathe builds its tension the hard way. Instead of relying solely on jump scares and gore, the film consistently paints itself and its characters into a corner then creatively gets them out of a bad situation while being both unexpected and completely organic. It's a hard high-wire act and one that you'd think a genre director like Fede Alvarez would stumble on. Yet Don't Breathe not only continues the Hitchcockian chamber-piece Renaissance kicked off by Disturbia (2007), it runs away with it. It artfully repackages old- fashioned thrills and kills it with a third act that's ominous but earned.Don't Breathe concerns the exploits of three white-trash miscreants named Rocky (Levy), Alex (Minnette) and Money (Zovatto). They live in post-bankruptcy Detroit, because horror producers find the scene of boarded up houses, blighted streets and deserted neighborhoods far too spooky to pass up. Plus with the average time for emergency response being 41 minutes, the pesky instinct to call the cops is left completely off the table. The trio are banking on this, in addition to Alex's family ties to a security company to rob houses with impunity. With one more score under their belts, Rocky and Money hope to move to California and escape their life of rust-belt entropy. Their target, a blind shut-in (Lang) whose recent court settlement made him a crotchety late-life millionaire. What the would-be thieves don't expect however is for their target to be so resourceful and so deadly.Anyone familiar with Stephen Lang's filmography would know that the man has a long history of playing the grizzled tough guy and Don't Breathe's unnamed Blind Man is no exception. Despite having a little over ten lines and spending a large portion of the film wondering with arms out, he dominates the frame with muted bellicose. He's scary not only because he's a brutal close-range brawler but because his disability reminds us that he's still human. A human whose life has descended into a Nietzschean perversion - ""Man can do anything, once he knows there is no God,"" he says in a moment of well-earned shock and disgust.When his humanity is questioned, in a second act reveal that steadily raises the stakes, our sympathies then ricochets back to our trio. Up until this point, were given the average wafer-thin backstories girdled with teenage neglect, alpha-male shows of dominance and unrequited love. Yet as the Blind Man becomes more invested in their demise and their routes for escape become limited, we as the audience feel for our teenage lambs; if for no other reason than we're right there with them.I won't go as far as to say, the characters have become fully formed by the time the credits roll, but I do admire their resourcefulness throughout. They deal with the claustrophobia of their plight with sharper and sharper fight or flight instincts complimented with masterful cinematography by Pedro Luque. His camera-work allows the audience to truly immerse themselves in the space, keeping us glued to not only the characters but what their seeing...and more importantly what they're not seeing.If there's a spiritual grandfather to Don't Breathe it's almost certainly Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948). Not only is the cinematography eerily similar but so are the themes which parities feeling of superiority (in this case moral not intellectual) with the banality of evil. 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) may have been this year's torchbearer for the old master's brand of suspense thus far this year but I'm going to go ahead and say its reign has been short-lived. Don't Breathe - don't miss.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tense thrills in a claustrophobic nightmare,"""Don't Breathe,"" directed by Fede Alvarez, is a heart-pounding thriller that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The film follows a group of young burglars who break into the home of a blind man, thinking it will be an easy score. However, they soon realize they've underestimated their target, as the blind man proves to be a formidable adversary with deadly secrets lurking within his home.Alvarez masterfully builds tension throughout the film, using the confined setting to create a sense of claustrophobia and impending danger. The suspense is palpable as the characters navigate the darkened corridors, with every creak and rustle sending shivers down the audience's spines.The performances are solid, particularly Stephen Lang as the menacing blind man, whose physicality and intensity bring a chilling realism to the role. While the film occasionally relies on jump scares, it excels in creating a pervasive sense of unease that lingers long after the credits roll.Overall, ""Don't Breathe"" is a gripping thriller that delivers thrills and chills in equal measure, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's very dark, at times a little grim, and I guess on occasion you'll need to suspend belief, but it's gripping, very cleverly crafted, edge of the seat viewing. The film felt very different to other horror/thrillers I've seen recently, there was a fair bit of originality to it.The first half of the film was somewhat moderate, built up tension, some moments where you watch and literally can't breathe. The second half of the film trebles the tension, at times the tension is almost unbearable, it was expertly done.The turkey baster scene had everyone squealing at the cinema, and like my title suggests, it'll be a long time before I want Turkey dinner again!!A mighty fine watch, 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Downright scary and inventive.,"Almost 50 years ago I was thrilled by Wait Until Dark, a horror film in which a usually demure Audrey Hepburn, playing a recently divorced blind woman, turns the tables on three thugs who invade her home. Today in Don't Breathe the tables are turned a different way: a blind man (Stephen Lang) gives as good as he gets while three young thieves try to rob his home. As for home invasion, Straw Dogs, with no blind motif, left me hoping for more of it all.Set in decaying Detroit, the thieves, Rocky (Jane Levy); Alex (Dylan Minnette); and Money (Daniel Zovatto) are themselves rotten robbers, hitting homes for which Rocky's dad's security business unwittingly supplies the keys. In this blighted neighborhood the blind man is the last holdout, although he's well equipped for trouble with his Vietnam experience, a vicious Rottweiler, and $300,000 to protect.Although nothing scary is outside the purview of the standard horror film, director Fede Alvarez and DP Pedreo Luque take the steadicam to new heights of ingenuity by tracking through the claustrophobic corridors and air ducts along with wounded thieves and the rabid dog. The bird's eye shots outside the house, rather than giving hope for relief, serve well to isolate the proceedings with nary a hope for relief for anyone in the house. The jump scares are standard horror, but somehow they feel new or at least unexpected.Most everyone in Don't Breathe gets a comeuppance, some more deserving than others. A sense of justice pervades the proceedings just like the appropriateness of the decay motif. However I want to spin the themes, even ones that comment obliquely about the war in Vietnam and urban blight, what is most important for the horror genre are scares.You may not breathe during the many scary set pieces, and as you consider their allegorical implications, you'll be glad you had the bejesus scared out of you because that's why you're there.",,Anonymous,Horror

Well-made but lacking emotional investment,"On a technical level, the movie is well-done. The directing is superb, and most of the acting is good. I love how the movie shows the urban decay of Detroit, making it look like a mix of suburban dream and war zone reality. At its heart, the movie is in many ways about broken dreams.However, there is one huge flaw in the movie that, for me, completely knocked it down several pegs and undermined the entire thing, and that is that I disliked and felt no sympathy for no single character in it.In order for suspense to work well, the viewer has to be invested in a character. If you don't care about anyone, you're not going to feel suspense when they are in danger. The characters in this are wholly unlikable and unsympathetic, despite rather shallow, cursory attempts at giving them sympathetic motivations.I'm all for flawed, unlikable characters and anti-heroes. In fact, I prefer such characters. But there has to be something for the viewer to latch onto, something to invest in. Otherwise it's just watching people doing things on a screen.If the movie weren't so well made on a technical level, I'd have ranked it much lower. I will definitely look for work by the director in the future. But this movie was disappointing, considering the high marks it seems to be getting from critics.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

This movie speaks for itself but the only thing is that with the limited space and all the cat and mouse aspects, it never felt suffocating or claustrophobic which is too bad. On the other hand the movie is loaded with suspense and quality production and acting. This is more thriller than horror but does have some scare qualities if you are a novice when it comes to movies. Great watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"The story of 3 robbers named Rocky, Alex and Money who set their sights and future on robbing a blind man who has over 300,000 cash in his house. It's the perfect crime, but it doesn't quite go as well as they would have hoped! Director Fede Alvarez (Evil dead Remake) gives it his very best in this home invasion movie. Instead of wasting his time with nonsense and time wasting he gets straight to the point and as the movie goes on with the fast, roller coaster pace we get introduced to the characters bit by bit. And while we start to feel sorry for the Blind Man...we then realize he's on the same page, or just as bad as the robbers are.Stephen Lang steals the show as The Blind Man. I could not have picked anyone else better to play him. This is living proof right here that not all blind men are saints. Lang gives us the most badass blind man you could have ever hoped for and he is really spooky and thrilling at playing him.This movie is a home invasion movie, just like ""The Strangers, You're Next"" and ""Funny Games"" except with a huge twist, and that twist is...the the home invaders become the hunted! So it added a new style and a great original twist to the whole Home Invasion Movies. While many people would complain this is not a Horror, and more of a Thriller, that does not make it a bad movie. It is more of a Thriller, but there are Horror Elements in there to keep Horror Fans amused. And many people complained about the final 20 minutes and just how bad it got. We actually thought it worked out quite well. It showed us just how psychotic The Blind Man really was! All in all it's an edge of your seat Thriller. Go to the movie and take your girlfriend, you wont be disappointed! One of the best Horror/Thriller Movies that has come out in a long time. Can't wait to see more of Fede Alvarez. 5/5 - JayHome invasion thrillers have often popped up once in a while, but not since Your Next has there been a movie so thrilling, suspenseful and well executed... but Don't Breathe surfaced on our screens and now adds another gem to the genre.Directed by Spanish filmmaker Fede Alvarez who had helmed the amazing Evil Dead remake/sequel, he returns in another hit that gives him the chance to helm a home invasion thriller. His eye on detail, camera work and the atmosphere reminds us that he can craft a film that can have an impact on us.What I liked and admired about this one was the fact that it feels more like a thriller than horror, it relies on its scenario and how it executes it the moment the criminals are pulling off the robbery. The villain in particular was something that felt new or hasn't surfaced in a long time, but to have at first feeling sorry for him that he was blind and was about to be robbed than turned to being scared of him is a good move to add on on the viewers. Another interesting fact was that the violence wasn't over the top or gory, just brutal and nothing else, so this is another good thing that I liked about the film (though personally I am a gore hound fan when it comes to honor but this style can be quite interesting).Stephen Lang's performance as the innocent looking but brutally strategic killer is one for the movie history books, focusing on movement and personality rather than dialogue makes him a worthy actor that should be seen more often (maybe as a hero for once as he's often a villain). The performances Jane Levy's performance is as great as her role in the Evil Dead remake, and the supporting cast makes it worthwhile.The music score is great, with the returning of music composer of Evil Dead giving the tense game of survival a suspenseful feeling, kudos to his amazing work.There's nothing negative I can say about the film, but Don't Breathe is a solid hour and a half treat that both horror and thriller fans will find great and will overtime become an example of how effective films can be.4/5 - Nick",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Will leave you breathe less!,"Don't Breathe is the second feature film from co-writer and director Fede Alvarez, who also co-wrote and directed the gory yet enjoyable reboot of Evil Dead (2013). Fans who enjoyed the unique interpretation and style of his previous film will love the similar spin to the genre that Alvarez brings to Don't Breathe.The suspense is ramped up and maintained from this point forward, really pulling the viewer from scene to scene with a good mix of excellent sound design and more conventional jump scares.These people are badly written. For instance, we have Money who will rob you, he is rude, and he does this for the rush. Then you have Alex, who should not being doing this. He has a good life and home. He is only doing this because he is so in love with Rocky.The only somewhat sympathetic one is Rocky. Rocky and Alex may have sympathetic aspects, but ultimately they are criminals. So naturally, we feel for the Blind Man, whom we empathize with because he is a decorated veteran who has suffered his own personal tragedies. That is one of my complaints with the film.One of the things the movie does well, is they make us hate the main characters, they make us like the main characters, they make us like the blind man, and they make us hate the villain. Therefore, the movie really gives us a roller-coaster of emotions. At times The Blind Man, played by Stephen Lang is creepy yet sympathetic (in a weird way). He really puts you on edge. At times, he can hear a fly fart and come at you as if he is Jason Voorhees! Levy, too is brilliant the way her emotions flit across her face is as crucial to the film's suspense as all the dark corners, closets and jump scares.From a filmmaking standpoint, this film is spectacular. They have house as the main setting. Which allows the filmmakers to use and experiment lighting in such a masterful way. Alvarez and his cinematographer, Pedro Luque, let the camera move through the Blind Man's home much like a prowler, allowing the viewer to glimpse just enough hints at certain items (like, say, a tool on a wall) that may pay off later. One of the film's strongest sequences is a basement scene where Rocky and Alex grope their way through the dark trying to not to run into the Blind Man, whose acute hearing gives him a distinct advantage.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Don't Breathe. Overall, the film contains suspense and thrills throughout. While not a traditional attempt at the genre, the horror film provides enough suspense and drama to keep the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the tight 90-minute run-time. I do think the movie could have been written a little bit better. My biggest complaint is the ending. The movie was working so well, and was original until the ending. It ends like so many other slasher films we have seen. It will probably please fans of this genre with its solid suspense, murky lighting and ""gotcha!"" scares. I believe Don't Breathe earns a7 out of 10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember don't just get down, but get Boogie.

Don't miss this!,"Who knew there was still an original exciting thriller to be made? There isn't anything deja vu about this very well paced and directed movie. The camera work is excellent showing just what you need to see to be scared but never leaving you confused. There is a skewered sympathy for the characters - the 3 protagonists are bad guys - burglar scums you can't really feel sorry for. The person who they rob is a victim of sorts blind Iraq veteran but flawed as you will find out. The story is good with unpredictable but still plausible twists. You never feel cheaply shocked or let down by an unbelievable twist. It's more exciting when you are kind of rooting for both sides at the same time.Steven Lang is well cast as the blind man.

Better Than Expected,"Fede Alvarez, the man behind the Evil Dead remake, returns to tell an original horror story about a trio of burglars breaking into an old blind mans house, only to realize he isn't as helpless as he seems. Don't Breathe stars Stephen Lang, Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette in a film that I wasn't too overly excited for. Most mainstream horror films nowadays usually aren't very good and judging by the trailer, the movie seemed to be a little corny and would be one of those dumb character movies, where the audience is left frustrated by the actions of some of the individual's in the film. However this film left me completely shocked. I did not expect to like this movie as much as I did, nor sing as high of appraisal. This is a well done horror film, that offers something new, while paying homage to the genre. Though the characters in the film feel very stock, Alvarez was able to write them in a way that didn't make them feel like complete idiots. Apart from one character, I myself was able to place myself in the shoes of the victim's and the moves they made were ones I would have. Alvarez crafted one of the most suspenseful movie of the year, each action serves a purpose and it smartly explained why the characters couldn't just easily escape their situation. Now this is all well and good until the final act where the film loses its suspense and goes for a typical slasher approach. I felt the character you were supposed to root for the most, was now making laughable decisions, and the inclusion of the never ending, invincible dog that felt funny and totally out of place. I also could have done with a bit of a darker ending, I understand the original climax ended on a sour note and the creators didn't want the audience leaving unsatisfied. However I felt like the ending they settled with felt too safe. Overall I really enjoyed my time with this film and am really looking forward to re-watching it, it was a unique horror film released to the genre public that felt fresh. Which is more than I can say for most horror films. It is a shame that the final act does suffer from weak writing, but apart from that I can't help but recommend this film, especially if you want to feel uneasy, Don't Breathe gets a 7.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than expected,"I had avoided this one for a while because i thought the plot was a bit meh. But as i needed a set of movies for this Halloween i gave it a shot.. and it was better than i had feared.
Thankfully the movie is quite short so it doesn't drag out a plot that is still pretty thin and there was a welcome little twist that i hadn't seen coming.
It is, as others have said, well directed and manages to avoid falling in too many obvious traps and keeps you interested.

Get to the point quickly...,"The good side about this movie is get to the point quickly. There is no boring moments. However there are few things that you may wonder..1. Is the Blind man really blind? Few scenes you will wonder how he gets to the spot so quickly. Even in his house, like he is not blind at all. Perhaps, visually impaired is more appropriate, meaning he is partially blind. I just found it impossible for him to fumble around stuff so quickly and move from one spot to other spot like his eyes are normal.2. The settings are too dark. Many times (because of the night time in the house) It is not easy to see .3. People only get hurt and recover so quickly. You will wonder as if they don't get hurt at all.

Also this is the only movie I ever given 10 too.I know some would want to call this horror but to me and my understanding of the horror genre that in order to be classified as horror it has have some element of the supernatural like ghosts or demons or zombies. This movie was human verses human so that is why I say thriller.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A movie that makes so much sense.,"I often find myself criticizing movies details, like ""why would this character do that and not that"" but this movie made sense all 88 minutes for me. All the decisions made by the characters were understandable which is something hard to find in most movies, sometimes they have to force an doubtful action on a character for the movie to go where the director wants it to go, but not this one. I was hooked from beginning to end.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blown Away,"Filled with originality, timely jump scares, jaw-dropping twists, and terrific performances. Don't Breathe is meticulously well-paced and directed, as Fede Alvarez gives us the best horror flick of 2016.I'm not a horror guy nor will I probably ever be. The genre never seems to stay good enough to grip me from film to film. But films like Don't Breathe do their best to turn my feelings around. Take for example the 'jump scare', something horror films tend to do provide a few too many of, is perfectly used in this film. I never felt that Alvarez was manipulating his audience into feeling scared in situations they didn't need to be. That's essentially what those 'jump scares' do, they make audiences scared because the story itself can't. It's lazy filmmaking. But when we do jump out of our seats in Don't Breathe, it feels earned.The premise consists of a few low-life young adults who make their living on robbing houses and find themselves trapped inside the house of one of their 'supposedly helpless' victims. Their target was that of a blind man and Army veteran, played by Stephen Lang, living in a mostly abandoned Detroit neighborhood. I haven't seen a ton of horror, but this just seems like the perfect idea for a horror film. Plus, anything with Stephen Lang as the antagonist is worth watching. Not only can he pull off the physically intimidating side, but he also able to make it believable that he was blind.And really, without much dialogue at all, all of the actors deserve a ton of credit. Jane Levy, who I never heard of, was a revelation. Both with what her character goes through physically and the emotional levels she was able to reach, I was greatly impressed. Even Dylan Minnette, who I wasn't a fan of in Goosebumps, did a fine job as a nice complement to Levy.The actors were of course helped by Alvarez' unique vision and style of filmmaking showcased here. Minimal and timely use of lighting were a solid choice to set the mood, while long takes and close ups were also well oriented. I also have to give a shout-out to the sound department and the composer, Roque Banos. Sound is usually half of what makes a horror film, and Don't breathe doesn't disappoint in that area. Banos hits the right notes in all of the moments and the use of 'breathing' as a sound effect was extremely effective.Without going into too much detail, I don't know how much more I can praise this film. It's truly a masterful directing job by Fede Alvarez with a star-making performance from Jane Levy and the great Stephen Lang.94/100",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A taut & tense thriller.,"Don't Breathe tells the story of Rocky(Jane Levy), Alex(Dylan Minnette) & Money(Daniel Zovatto). Rocky, Alex & Money are burglars. They break into the house of a blind man(Stephen Lang), thinking he is an easy target. Little do they know, what's in store for them inside.Don't Breathe is a sensational film. Right from the very first scene of the movie, you are hooked. The brief run-time of the film, makes sure that we don't waste too much time establishing each character. However, the wonderfully unique script written by Rodo Sayagues & Fede Alvarez & the masterful directorial ability of Alvarez, makes sure that we get just enough of each character's backstory that, we feel like we know them. The jump scares are kept to a bare minimum. Instead, there is a growing feeling of doom, as we continue watching the movie. Despite the lack of jump scares, this film will still terrify audiences. The various twists & turns, will keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. The cinematography by Pedro Luque is awe-inspiring & is the highlight of the movie. The background score by Roque Banos is unforgettable. The flawless performances, are the main reason this film works so beautifully. Stephen Lang is fantastic as The Blind Man. Jane Levy is spectacular as Rocky. Dylan Minnette is outstanding as Alex. Daniel Zovatto is great as Money. The supporting cast is amazing. Don't Breathe is one of the best thrillers of all time. It might also be my all-time favorite thriller. A must watch!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Never ending suspense,Don't BreatheFede Alvarez will soon be a household name in the horror genre (he probably already is) bc of the ultra gory and fun Evil Dead remake and also this instant gem of 2016. The storyline is pretty simple it didn't try to reinvent the wheel or anything but they executed it very well. The characters are surprisingly likable (and resourceful) despite them being anti- heroes. Fede really wanted to make a different and less bloodier flick so this one is toned down but u can still expect disturbing and highly suspenseful scenes throughout the short runtime. And lemme tell you i just LOVE the fact that they toyed with my feelings by giving a lot of false endings and it made me root for the leads so much more.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror

It is an okay creepy horror rated-R film I enjoy it,"It is an okay horror film that I enjoyed and I like it, but in my opinion I think The People Under the Stairs and The Collector are way much better horror movies. I appreciate for what director Fede √Ålvarez did. I hated Evil Dead remake I though it was poorly paced and really boring movie except the ending. Jane Levy did really fine solid job as the hero I really love the movie has happy ending and Stephen Lang as the villain was good I know him from The Fugitive TV series (2000). I already saw the horror movies before about burglars breaking in the house and find them self's been the target and locked in the house. For my opinion The Collector is just much way better movie even The People Under the Stairs are just way much better movies.I do have one problem: I wish the movie would had more booby traps, I wish the death scenes would be more gory, it is a rated-R horror film, but still it was a good film, fast paced really intense and you keep rooting for the bad guys.Their sure-fire break-and-enter scheme provides them with steady income, but delinquents Rocky, Alex and Money keep hoping for a bigger score. Their wishes are granted when Money receives a tip about an enormous sum of cash rumored to be stashed in a home in a desolate suburb of Detroit belonging to a blind, solitary Iraq War veteran. A B&E plan is hatched and quickly put into motion. What could possibly go wrong? Although it was a bit lightweight and featured ethically-challenged protagonists, this was a decent-enough suspense flick.I didn't expect for this to be as good as it was. I was expecting a cheap thriller (this only had a budget of around $1 million) that did nothing for the viewers. I was not expecting to get goosebumps. This movie is twisted you got three idiots breaking in to somebody's house that is stupid, so we are going to root for the blind man - wrong: you will root for these three guys, when you find out what the blind guy has hiding in his house type of crazy weird sh**t going on in this movie and when they find out later on the end of the movie this is twisted creepy horror and I loved it.I love Don't Breathe this movie was thought out, well written, every little things let in to something else. I like that and I like someone thought that out I like that. One is on the other location and he can't see it. Fede √Ålvarez did a good job better than Evil Dead the blind man was great and really creepy and scary the thrills are there and they work good. It is my favorite 2016 horror film and I like it, I thought it was an okay and fun movie. I liked Acting is great, the story is top notch and it gives you the edge of your seat. I would not compared this movie with Panic Room because Panic Room was also a great flick as well. It both has the same amount of way. I enjoyed this movie since Panic Room.The ending was solid I love that Rocky survived she was not only sole survivor but Jane Levy's character was decent, she was breaking in to me someone else's house only to feed her young sister, they both have a messed up family and her mom is beating her, she survives and she takes her sister away but the blind man survives anyway. It is fast paced but in my personal opinion I like The Collector much more I thought Arkin (Josh Stewart) was much smart and way better protagonist. My rating is 8/10 solid B I like the movie in three weeks I am getting this movie on Blu-ray disc.Don't Breathe is a 2016 American horror-thriller film directed by Fede √Ålvarez and written by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues.

A New Twist on Home Invasion,"Hoping to walk away with a massive fortune, a trio of thieves break into the house of a blind man (Stephen Lang) who isn't as helpless as he seems.Those who are going in to see ""Don't Breathe"" should do so with as little knowledge as possible. You can know it is a horror film in the ""home invasion"" subgenre. You can know there is a twist (the back of the box reveals as much). But you should not know what that twist is, and only know that even in a world full of movie twists, this one may be unexpected.Not knowing anything, I thought maybe this would be like a modern retelling of ""Wait Until Dark"". It is nothing like that at all. And because I knew it was a home invasion story with a twist, I immediately thought of ""Shut In"", the recent film starring Rory Culkin. It isn't really like that, either, beyond some superficial similarities.The film's biggest weakness comes in the first fifteen minutes. We are given a somewhat sympathetic view of our burglars, and one that seems off. All three leads have a presence in the modern history of horror, being in such films as ""Goosebumps"" and ""It Follows"". But here, they are most effective as burglars rather than as tragic figures. At no point was I on the side of Rocky because of her troubled childhood. Maybe other viewers will approach the film differently, but I don't see personal problems as an excuse to victimize other people.After those initial fifteen minutes, the attempt at character development stops and the film really goes into high gear. We get plenty of tense scenes, over-the-top violence, and moments that call to mind the ""Saw"" series or ""The Collector"" (though this film never goes as far as the so-called torture porn aspects of either of those other two). Whether you are rooting for our protagonists or not (I wasn't), you can't help but be strapped in for the remainder of the ride.I must address the praise from the box. Forbes says the movie has ""the best twist in years"", which I may or may not agree with, but cannot deny that there are parts that surprise even the most hardened viewer. I do, however, take issue with the quote from Jim Hemphill, calling this the ""best American horror film in twenty years"". Ignoring what defines ""American"" (the writer-director is from Uruguay and the film was made in Hungary), is this really the best horror film since 1996? Hemphill was not quoted out of context; this is really what he thinks.I can comfortably call ""Don't Breathe"" one of the best horror films of the last decade. I could even say it is possibly the best horror film of 2016, but a few others (such as ""The Unseen"" or ""The Witch"") could edge it out. But the best of all the horror films since 1996? Off the top of my head, ""It Follows"" is a better film. ""House of the Devil"" is better, as well. Some would probably argue that ""Blair Witch"" was better, or at the very least more influential. Again, I'm not trying to say ""Don't Breathe"" isn't a strong horror film (it is), but Hemphill is probably in the minority.The Blu-ray, out now from Sony, brings the film to your home looking and sounding great. There are also eight deleted scenes, five behind-the-scenes featurettes on the cast, crew, set and sound. And if you're into the stories behind the movie itself, there is a feature-length commentary with the director (Fede Alvarez), writer (Rodo Sayagues) and star Stephen Lang.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Review ‚Äì Don't Breathe (2016) ..90 minutes of cleverly crafted tension and thrills! [3.5/5],"Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez (who gained popularity through his underwhelming debut feature which happened to be the reboot of the Sam Raimi classic 'Evil Dead') returns strongly and leaves a lasting impression with the home-invasion thriller ""Don't Breathe"". It is about a group of three thieves who wanna fulfill their American dream of making big money and moving to a big city. In order for this to happen though, the trio must rob the house of a blind man (played to the hilt by Stephen Lang of 'Avatar').The proceedings that take place over the course of that one night actually take up a bulk of the film and this is precisely where the writer/director has shown immense potential in thrilling, terrifying and shocking the viewer. ""Don't Breathe"" isn't a film that relies purely on jump scares but the few ones present are placed at apt junctures and bring in the required impact. The atmosphere is spine- chilling, set mostly within the confines of a house that is located quite far away from the bustling city in a crumbling uninhabited neighborhood, so we the audience are told in advance that noise is not going to gather any public attention. But hey, the 'blind man' in the house isn't a weakling either. He's aroused quickly by even the quaintest of creaks or the sound of exhaling breath. What happens when he springs into action to defend himself and the reveal of a certain personal mystery regarding the blind dude apart from the money that the trio want to get their hands on, is played out in sixty-plus minutes of totally ruthless, claustrophobia-inducing frenzy. Stephen Lang is nothing short of tremendous, and plays the 'blind man' in near- flawless fashion. The guy's got amazing screen- presence. The trio played by Jane Levy (of the 'Evil Dead' reboot), Dylan Minnette (of 'Goosebumps') and Daniel Zovatto (of 'It Follows') are quite impressive as well with the former two occupying more screen-time (due to the nature of the screenplay!).The cinematography is solid (close-up shots in the pitch-dark portion stood out!) and although this is a film that involves a lot of physicality, and perspective-juggling, Pedro Luque handles it brilliantly (no shaky cam!). The storyline is not something that is completely original; if you simply go through the synopsis, you are bound to feel as if this film could be a clich√©-filled exercise in torture-porn ( a relentless rehash of the magnificent Jeremy Saulnier thriller 'Green Room', offering cheap thrills like in 'The Collector' and bucketfuls of gore like in 'Saw'.) but Fede Alvarez gives you a completely engaging cinematic piece that tries to bend the viewers' minds in the quirkiest ways possible. The Sound and Editorial department deserve special praise.Once the trio breaks into the house, the viewer is constantly kept on the edge of the seat largely owing to the excellent performances, a screenplay that is determined to shell out thrill after thrill after thrill (maybe a few loopholes here and there but doesn't matter), fantastic sound design and some clever direction. Honestly, I did not find Fede's 'Evil Dead' reboot impressive at all (felt that the shock value was less dependent on characters or atmosphere but on excessive gore-spill), so I did not have really high expectations about this flick. This time however, it's a completely different scenario. Along with Mike Flanagan and Dan Trachtenberg, Fede Alvarez is going to occupy a spot on my list of favorite thriller directors of 2016.The less you know about the movie, the better. Enjoy this R-rated thriller and get your adrenaline pumping to good effect!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Simple, effective, and suspenseful, its noticeable flaws are hardly worth a damn to fuss about.","Don't Breathe has a very simple premise: three burglars attempt to escape with their stolen money from a supposedly helpless victim living in a house, only to find themselves trapped and accidentally managed to uncover something dark hidden inside the house.With so many horror movies on the rise this year alone, Don't Breathe managed to score a sweet spot in one of the best. The movie successfully creates a tension that ran thick throughout the whole movie. It doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares and convoluted backstories, it relies on effective delivery of horror.The problem is, with a movie this simple, the flaws are apparent. There are no character development whatsoever, the tension might overstayed its welcome, and all of the actors delivered a subpar performance.Overall, this movie provided good entertainment and continues to break the boundaries of the usual horror movie tropes.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
its all been done before but this one nails it for steadily escalating tension and sustained terror,"Two hallmarks of the horror-slasher genre are that we always take the victim's side and that we are cool with people dying multiple times. It's a genre that uses standard fear formulas like good and bad guys trapped in dark enclosed spaces, maybe a mad dog thrown in or an evil old man with awesome strength. The genre-bending Don't Breathe (2016) carves out new space by making everyone a victim and adding enough surprises and high-tension atmospherics to keep you stuck on the edge of your seat.Three break-and-enter thugs decide to target the isolated home of a blind Army vet (Stephen Lang) to steal the big payout he received after the death of his daughter. The stereotypes are the usual mix: the gal who wants enough money to stop stealing, the guy who is scared of everything, and the psychotic one who we don't see for very long. The rest of the story is full of well-worn slasher tropes: the blind vet still has elite combat skills, the scared guy is always heading for the door, but the blond gal endures the worst. Like most horrors, males are dispatched quickly while women must endure prolonged helpless panic for the cinematic enjoyment of the male gaze. When all the doors are locked and the lights go out, it's a level playing field in the rambling old house that the blind man navigates by touch, smell and hearing. The basement is full of surprise and that darn dog has more combat tricks than you could imagine. In terms of plot, it has all been done before but this one nails it for steadily escalating tension and sustained terror.There are enough genre innovations to make this film interesting but what really stands out is the filming, soundtrack and lighting. Nervy hand-held camera-work pokes into closets and runs down hallways, always capturing eyes fully dilated. The vet is the star actor while the thugs all over-act their parts, although there is minimal dialogue as whispers or breathing reveals where you are. Like all horrors, the lighting is scary low but when it switches to infra-red everyone is as blind as the vet while the soundtrack finds notes that tingle your brain. The cast are amazingly resilient as they are slashed for most of eighty-three minutes and recycling the not-quite-dead can be wearying. Although not a great fan of the genre, this one had my attention right up to its formulaic ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Straying from the ""useless jump scare"" trend that seems to be sweeping Hollywood and now even indie horror films, ""Don't Breathe"" manages to create an extremely tense atmosphere using effective sound design and highly motivated camera-work and composition in each shot. The emotionally motivated direction of each shot allows the film to create a sense of unease, adding another layer to it's visual style and keeping viewers petrified.Although the film showcases an array of young acting talent, Sephen Lang's portrayal of ""the blind man"" is totally unique and completely silent, creating one of the most terrifying characters put on film in the last few years.

"Although it suffers from some pitfalls along the way, Don't Breathe is another example of Fede Alvarez's talent.","Don't Breathe is not an easy movie to watch, nor is it a pleasant one. These attributes do not hurt the movies quality or take away from Fede Alvarez's talent.The director first emerged with his mainstream debut, a remake of Evil Dead, which succeeded in being different than the original and still a fantastic movie. His next step was Don't Breathe a movie that centers around three teen robbers that break into an old blind man's house as one last job before they leave the run down Detroit. This all goes horribly wrong when the Old Man is more powerful then he appears to be and a deadly game of Cat and Mouse is played.Just like with Evil Dead, Fede has directed a movie that can be viewed in both ways that any Good horror movie can be viewed. An experience that scares and also encourages you to cheer on the likable characters as they dodge the deadly killer. The movie is claustrophobic and has some of the best jump scares ever seen in film. This is not a movie that relies on loud organs and screams to fright as the movie makes you feel as trapped and hurt as the main characters.Now to the last twenty minutes of the movie which is sure to be water- cooler talk for the next week. The movie has one of the most tense scenes ever in a film. It is a very provocative scene and will make some uncomfortable to the point of walking out of the theater.

What seems to never end.,"Don't Breathe; Although not supposedly the scariest film ever, is definitely one of the most tension filling horror films of 2016, and one that executes flawlessly, dragging the audience into a never- ending nightmare, and truly succeeds.We follow Rocky, Alex, and a dude named Money, they're a team that robs houses; Goal to move away. They come across news that a blind man has a large fortune, and all they have to do is break in. However, this break in isn't as easy as they'd hope for, now they must survive, and escape. First off, props to this films' atmosphere. The atmosphere throughout most of the film is eerily silent, due to the characters having to remain as silent as possible while trapped. With that silence, we're set to see multiple situations where tension is the only thing that comes to the audiences' mind. There are countless scenes where it gets intensely tension - filled, and it keeps us on the ends of our seats, and intrigued. The film also has a very eerie, dark - like setting as it progresses, only boosting to extreme heights on the tension level. Most of these occurrences are well played out by the actors, as well. The acting in this film, I'd say, in terms of what the characters were put through was perfect. They all genuinely put forth a believable, and well performance. Each character, as well had their own unique styles, and all of which were interesting enough for us to care in a sense, depending who they are. Another extremely enjoyable aspect of this film which overall was the unique, successful plot. The plot, and overall story-line of the entire film was extremely solid, and more than successful for audience tension, and thrill. It tied in unique twists, as well as guaranteed reaction elements. The pacing of this film, as well just boosts the unique plot, as this film went straight to the point, and wasted absolutely no time in getting the audiences' attention.In conclusion. Is the hype for this film real? Yes; It, by no means is the ""Scariest film"" out there, but is it unique? And does it set itself away from the typical horror movie scene? Absolutely. This, for sure is one of the best horror films of 2016. This, I'd say is worthy of the top three films, even. This film was unique, innovative - like, and it brought new, exciting elements to the horror film scene. It was well paced, well acted, and on an even more specific realm, extremely well shot with camera-work. It was thrilling, exciting, and heavily effective with it's silent, unpredictable atmosphere, and endless - like attitude. The countless, yet outstanding twists this film takes, as well was more than worth the watch. ""Don't Breathe"" was more than enjoyable, and was worth the wait, as well as the hype.

How to ruin an otherwise great storyline with plot holes and silly mistakes,"Well, first of all, I have to say that I do tend to be particularly critical when it comes to movies. It simply happens. However, that also means that I can justify my disappointment towards this particular movie. Heads up, my review will contain some spoilers and, since I am not a native speaker, some grammar mistakes.Let me start by saying that I did find some great things in Don't Breath. Cast being one of them. Stephen Lang's character is someone who could have been taken from a nightmare. His interpretation was believable as an utterly unstable man. Jane Levy shone in her part as well, making Rocky a quite relatable young woman.Now, here we start with the problems. Dylan Minnette actually did a good job in the movie, but I think that his character was actually undeveloped; why was he robbing houses without caring much about how his father could be implicated? And Daniel Zovatto...well, I don't understand why they had to include such a stereotypical character.Now, moving on to major problems. Even with the storyline being particularly inventive, specially with the twist we get at the end, I noticed way too many mistakes in the plot and...in overall logic and common sense. Here come the SPOILERS, do not read unless you want to.From the beginning, the robbers try to be silent at times but when they speak, they have no problem with practically shouting all over the place. Later on, when the blind man appears, he cannot hear that there are two other robbers in the house, even with them inches away from him. But he immediately develops an ultra sensitive hearing sense that feels more like a superpower than the ability a blind man would develop to overcompensate his sight. By the end of the movie, this man even appears to be wounded by the sound of the alarm going off. I get that he would feel disoriented and annoyed by the noise, but his reaction was unbelievable.Also unbelievable is this man's dog. For Crist's sake, he was Cujo! Not only was he utterly violent, which I understand if he was trained, but he was like a tracking machine. I mean, at the end of the movie he chased the girl to the car, without any indications whatsoever, he discovered her, waited outside the car, found an open window and tried to climb through it...and then found the trunk of the car open and got in there to then break out of the sits. It was just too much. And the fact that they used a ""violent"" breed does not justify his over the top behavior.Now, there is one mistake that I simply could not overlook and that made me almost laugh in the theater. When Rocky and Alex are trapped in the upstairs room and they are unable to escape they clearly say AND show that the windows have bars. Then how the hell does Alex passes through the window, seconds later, when the dog attacks him? Seriously? HOW could they not see that when they were editing the movie?Finally, the girl trapped in the house was actually a good twist. The idea of what he wanted to do with her. But...how come she had a newspaper article about herself down there? It was obviously to simplify the discovery when Rocky and Alex found her, but it was a very unlikely situation. And at the end of the movie....is it really possible that the police simply decided to overlook the pillow- prison at the house? And the chains, and the instruments he used for insemination? I find that very doubtful.The movie does have its merit, however. The use of camera was actually quite distinctive. When the characters first enter the house, there is a FANTASTIC sequence shot that shows the house and characters. And I really appreciated the lightning used during the ""lights out"" chasing at the basement. The green light most movies use would have ruined the suspense for me.All things considered, I would not say ""don't watch the movie"", but do not go thinking you are going to see a 7.6 quality movie because that is not the case.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Well, the blind man's got some tricks up his sleeves, turns out, he is not somebody you'd want to mess with.Personally, I was surprised by how good this film is because I was not a fan of Fede Alvarez's ""Evil Dead"" remake a few years back which was more concerned about being gory than being scary. But DON'T BREATHE will have you tense the entire time just like the characters themselves because it's filled with moments of silence and surprises. It's basically a cat-and-mouse chase game inside a locked and barricaded house. The ones getting chased don't know their way around the house, obviously, and the one doing the chasing, even though he's blind, let's just say that because of his background, he comes with a particular set of skills. And on top of that, there's a deep dark secret that adds to the layers and makes the characters' survival mode go to the extreme level. This is a very well-staged, well-crafted film that successfully banks on the audiences' not knowing what's going to happen in every single scene.-- Rama's Screen --",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If I would have known how weird this movie would be, I wouldn't have invited my mother along with me","This movie generated a lot of hype in it's early screenings, and the trailer seemed to promise a tense and violent romp. It definitely delivered lots of nerve-wrackingly tense moments that had the theater jumping without necessarily using the classic ""jump scare"" tactic. The acting was good, and all of the characters were well- written enough to have a lot of likable and unlikable moments, which was a nice break from usual horror stereotypes. I can see how people would be praising it as a horror masterpiece because it definitely was scary without being clich√©. It was a lot of fun to watch in theaters.So if I have so much positive feedback, why give it a six instead of something higher? The reason is there were at least two very obvious plot holes to me while watching that were never resolved. The beginning of the movie made me somewhat dislike the main characters, who seemed to lack any real intelligence until they're actually trying to survive in the house. The ending was about three scenes too long, and the whole ""evil guy never dies and is also able to be everywhere at once"" mechanic begins to wear a little thin by the end of the movie.Also, there is THAT one scene. Get ready for it. Do not make the same mistake I did and think that the popularity of the movie meant there would not be one extremely weird and disturbing moment that would make you regret bringing your mother along with you. I personally love the weird and slightly obscene in horror movies, but this one does nothing to prepare you for what is to come. Maybe if I had walked into the theater with a different mindset, this movie would have been more successful for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
About as good as horror films get!,"'DON'T BREATHE': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new hit horror flick, from Uruguayan filmmaker Fede Alvarez (who also helmed the hit 2013 horror remake/reboot 'EVIL DEAD'). Alvarez directed, co-produced and co-wrote the movie (with Rodo Sayagues). Horror master Sam Raimi (who of course directed the original 'EVIL DEAD' franchise) also co-produced the flick; which stars Jane Levy, Stephen Lang, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto. Alvarez, Sayagues, Raimi and Levy all performed the same duties on the 2013 'EVIL DEAD' reboot. The film was made on a budget of just $9.9 million; and it's already made almost three times that, in it's opening weekend. It's gotten almost unanimously rave reviews from critics, and it was another entry in this year's 'Fantasia International Film Festival'. I think it's a masterpiece.Rocky (Levy), Alex (Minnette) and Money (Zovatto) are three young crooks; that rob wealthy customers of Alex's dad's security company. Rocky is trying to make enough money to move her, and her little sister (Emma Bercovici), away from their abusive mom (Katia Bokor). She wants to start a new (happy) life for them, in California. Alex has strong feelings for Rocky, but she's currently dating Money (who's of course an asshole). When the three friends learn of an old Army veteran (Lang), with a $300,000 cash settlement (or more) sitting in his home, the job seems too tempting to pass up. When Alex learns that the man is blind though, and that his young daughter was recently killed in a car accident, he doesn't want to go through with the heist. His feelings for Rocky (of course) motivate him into it. It's a crime that the three criminals desperately soon regret, when the blind vet starts hunting them down, and killing them, in his own (locked-up) home.The movie is about as good as horror films get; it's a soon to be classic (on a Hitchcock level standard)! I'm a big fan of the 2013 'EVIL DEAD' (and of course the original franchise), but this film is even better. The concept of a blind old Army vet, hunting down intruders in his home, is brilliant. Usually only heroes, in films, are handicapped; making it much more inspiring, when they overcome their weaknesses (through hard work and passion, of course). So to make the villain the handicapped one, who's still just as relentless (and terrifying) as any other movie 'bad guy', is really fun to watch. Especially when the protagonists are severely morally flawed, as well. I had so much fun watching this movie, and I can't wait to see it again! Lang is also amazing in it, and I think a sequel could be a lot of fun as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/bmrjYaOGPmk",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
brutal and suspense,"Friends for life, together they earn money by breaking in at homes. So far all went good but when selling the stolen goods the money it makes isn't that big so they want to go for the money. They are given an address of a lonely man having a lot of money at home.Spying to see who and what they have a big smile, the man is blind so off they go to break in the man's house. All goes perfect until the man is waken by noise and he hunt down the burglars.It doesn't take long before this flick turns into hell. As a viewer you can't see what is coming, every time you think that they can go outside something happens. It's brutal, it does have a very strong story and suspense all over.

"Well made, intense and effective, but missed the chance to go deeper","Tense and effective thriller that, interestingly, has more of a horror movie feel, although there is nothing supernatural about the tale. In Detroit, a team of three young people burglarize rich people's houses, It's made possible by Alex, the brains, whose dad works for an alarm company, giving him access to keys and codes. Money is the muscle, a street guy who gets off on the rush of the whole thing as much as the pay-offs, and the girl at the center is Rocky, dreaming of a score big enough to escape from her trailer park existence (and crazy mother) with her toddler kid sister.The three hear about what should be an easy target. A blind gulf war veteran living alone in an abandoned part of town, who supposedly keeps a $300K cash settlement from his daughter's accidental death in his house. (Stephen Lang is very effective as the blind man). Of course, nothing IS easy, or there would be no film. The movie creates terrific suspense without having to rely to heavily on gore or easy 'cat-suddenly- jumping-out-of-closet' scares. This has echoes of John Carpenter's 'Assault on Precinct 13' and even 'Alien' in it's intelligent use of a strong, claustrophobic main location and interesting character details to produce it's fun-house ride. There are also a couple of very effective visual twists I don't remember seeing before.On the other hand, while it's a very impressive ride, it's also a limited one. The few deeper themes touched on tend to the broad and obvious. And the film doesn't linger on them much. Which is too bad, since the 'heroes' of the story are three punk kids robbing a blind veteran ‚Äì who arguably has every right to defend himself. In turn, that would seem fertile territory to raise an interesting 'who's the real villain and why' examination that never comes. Indeed, the moral issues are aggressively avoided by the script turning characters far too neatly into monsters or 'good under it all' archetypes.A well made, effective enjoyable film, that had a shot of being something even more.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Shocking, intense and terrifying","Remember that hilarious film about a kid outwitting burglars in Home Alone? Now get a load of Don't Breathe, a clever twist on the home invasion genre that will have you quivering in fear instead of laughing out loud.There's a significant twist too but before this is revealed, director and co-writer Fede Alvarez wastes no time in unleashing a truckload of terror. A quick introduction tells us that petty thieves Rocky, her boyfriend Money and Alex are down on their luck until they receive a tipoff about an old man who received a cash settlement after his daughter was killed in a car accident. To their pleasant surprise, the old man is blind and he lives alone in an abandoned neighborhood. But once they break into his house, there awaits more surprises that are not so pleasant, and as it turns out, shockingly nasty for us too.Deeply rooted in the horror-thriller genre, Don't Breathe spans at just under 90 minutes, but don't underestimate its relatively short running time or its skimpy production budget. In just his second offering since the Evil Dead reboot, Alvarez delivers with almost Hitchcockian precision by using suspense and shock like a one-two punch combo. And although these are his principal tools to induce primal fear in the audience, there's plenty more at work to have viewers peeping through their fingers. Technical aspects like deft camera-work and sound mixing amplifies the fear factor to discomforting claustrophobia, owing to which the mounting peril on screen becomes directly proportional to increasing stress levels experienced by the viewer.While the actors playing the burglars are virtually unknown, Jane Levy as Rocky and Daniel Zovatto as Money aren't new to horror, having previously starred in Evil Dead and It Follows (2015) respectively. As the script dictates, they don't have to say much yet successfully depict the outright horror of facing a superior and deadly antagonist known simply as 'The Blind Man' (Stephen Lang). If you thought Lang was a menacing villain in Avatar, nothing but nerves of steel can prepare you for his terrifying delivery in this film; and that's before his character turns off the lights.Don't Breathe isn't the kind of gimmicky horror film made for cheap thrills. And if one cares to notice, there's even subtle social commentary on the failing economy in parallel to an unstable justice system. But that's just the film at its lightest. At its best, this is a horror film that is wickedly dark and for some viewers even nerve-wrecking to the point of suffocation. But then the title is already an apt warning ‚Äì watch with bated breath.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
First half was good,"This movie definitely did not lack originality and was a fresh addition to the thriller genre.Given that it is listed as a horror movie, the first jump scare made everyone in the cinema jump simultaneously (literally) but it felt like lack of a lot more jump scares given the potential was disappointing.The viewer is ultimately left to decide whose side he is on as both the thieves and the blind man show their good and bad sides - again, very original.There were some serious factual errors with blindness in this movie, but I did not notice them until I have read an analysis later.There wasn't a moment without action in this movie which was interesting but seemed to overuse it just a bit too much.Generally, the first half of this movie was VERY interesting and thrilling. As the movie continued, one particular scene seemed completely unnecessary and forced, and the action that followed seemed pushed and repetitive to what already happened.The plot's time span seemed to make the movie slightly boring as I was expecting more.If you even slightly enjoyed 'Hush (2016)' you will enjoy this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
If you don't find this nerve-wracking then you haven't got a pulse,"A trio of thieves decide to rob the home of an ex-army Gulf war veteran whom has received $300,000 dollars in compensation which he has stashed in his home. The thieves see this guy as being easy pickings due to him ending up being blind as a result of serving in the Gulf War, but this homeowner isn't prepared to surrender his home or his money without a fight and our trio find themselves faced with a deadly adversary...Don't Breathe is a wonderful film whereby its very excellence lies with its simplicity; it's another home-invasion thriller and at no point does it try to be anything else (it can hardly be accused of re-inventing the wheel). However, from the moment the thieves enter the victim's home the film never lets up and director Fede Alvarez keeps things moving at a rapid rate. The idea that the victim is blind only helps to crank the tension up and helps to keep the viewer on edge - I found myself looking and listening out for the slightest sound which may cause the homeowner to rumble the thieves.Alvarez wisely keeps the direction tight and fluid and most of the focus lies on the thieves and their perilous journey to escape from a man that they feel that they shouldn't have tried to rob in the first place.In some ways Don't Breathe is an odd film from a viewing perspective as you find yourself unsure who exactly you should be rooting for; you can't really root for the thieves (for obvious reasons) and part of you wants to root for the victim, but some twists later in the film kind of make it hard to do this as well. So what you need to do with this film is just go with the flow and sit back and enjoy this claustrophobic, terrifying and nerve-shredding thriller that basically grips you from start to finish and try not to get bogged down with any moral ambiguities.Simply put this is a top-drawer home-invasion thriller which kept me on the edge-of-my-seat and helped me restore some faith in a genre that has produced rather mixed results over the years.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
There's more than the ... eye can see,"Pun very much intended, but let's not get carried away too much. The guy who remade the Evil Dead does Horror Thriller and he has a very stellar cast in his corner. Especially Stephen Lang is phenomenal in a different and very demanding role. His screen presence is great and you can understand certain things that are happening. Or how he and the others react to be more exact.Having said that, there are still some odd clich√©s here and there. But never mind those and enjoy the thrill ride, because this really is quite breath taking. Although the title obviously is referencing something different. Doing something bad, may not be as evil as it seems ...",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Set in Detroit, three 20-somethings get more than they bargained for.","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife skipped.I was drawn to it mainly for Jane Levy, mostly a TV actress in such series as ""Suburgatory"" starting in 2011 and more recently in ""Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist"" starting recently and now running. In ""Don't Breathe"" she was about 26 during its production.I also found out she is a former soccer player so in a scene where she is required to run full-speed out of a house and down the street her running looks quite authentic.Anyway these three Detroit 20-something friends, two guys and a girl, are petty criminals, they break into homes and steal whatever they can fence. Detroit is not what it used to be, the girl has a terrible mom and wants to get away, to California maybe, and take her little sister with her for a better life.They find out about a man who lives alone, a military veteran, he was blinded, and in a case some years back was awarded a big settlement, ""six figures."" So the three decide, without any evidence, that the man must keep his loot inside his house in a dilapidated area of the city and they will go at night to steal it all.So these three are not very good young people, plus they are not very smart. What could go wrong when the man also has a vicious Rottweiler with him at all times? So it plays out at night with some interesting scenes and an interesting development with the blind man, but overall it is just a mediocre movie. And it ends with the girl and her little sister headed to California, seemingly with no consequences for all the carnage we witness.Still I am glad I took the time, Jane Levy is cute and is a capable actress.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Totally implausible, but somehow it works","Classified as crime/horror/thriller, I consider it more like an intense action movie with many violent scenes and some scares, but not horror.Three criminals, two men (Alex and Money) and one woman (Rocky), decide to rob the home of a blind man who apparently is not as defenseless as he looks, being a former decorated war veteran.Despite the implausibility of this whole scenario (you really need to see it to believe it, believe me!!!) and the ambiguous and dubious message, the camera work and the acting are of such a great level (mainly the blind man) that it truly works against all odds, creating a constant feeling of tension and claustrophobia. All these are strong aspects that carry this movie in a good direction, as well as the fact of all the characters being antagonistic, with none of them being a hero of the moral virtues. Moreover, and even because of this, this movie divides the spectators opinions creating intense discussions, which is always a good thing :) - hence I score it a little higher than I should: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't Breathe,"In the downtrodden deserted parts of Detroit. Three young burglars, Rocky (Jane Levy), Money (Daniel Zovatto) and Alex (Dylan Minnette) think they have found easy pickings.The target is blind Iraq war veteran (Stephen Lang) who lives alone. He is loaded with cash after a personal injury settlement that resulted in the death of his daughter in a car accident.Money enters the house armed with a gun. The other two are uneasy but they failed to realise. The Blind Man can look after himself and to aid him he has a vicious dog to guard him.To compensate for his sight loss. The blind man knows how to move around the house. He has highly developed hearing and a gun handy. His army training has not deserted him.The three burglars find themselves in deep trouble as they feel they are being stalked. Worse still the house has secrets because the Blind Man still feels the loss of his daughter.This is an unnerving home invasion thriller. Lang exudes physicality that overwhelms the burglars. If the burglars somehow get one over him, the dog lies in wait.Yet all the characters are monsters, the burglars are greedy vandals and crooks. The Blind Man is a sadist.Unfortunately the film really went off the rails by the end. It was like director Fede Alvarez did not know when to end the movie. It also got too silly that the Blind Man waltzed around his house lightning fast like a daredevil.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, violent but flawed home invasion/suspense movie","Three young, tech savvy burglars break into the home of a blind veteran, who has a stash of cash. They think he should be an easy target but he is more than capable of defending himself - and he harbours a very dark secret!
Effective home invasion/horror movie. It's well acted, has great cinematography, suspenseful and is very violent. But if is far from perfect. For a start, who are we meant to root for? Who is the victim here? Thieves versus crazy psycho. This dilemma bothered me throughout, and I can't say that I was pleased with the ending (not giving it away!). As mentioned our robbery victim is blind yet he is able to carry out tasks that just simply would not possible by himself. And another thing that really annoyed me was one of the robbers, a slightly built young man, endures multiple beatings and injuries yet he appears to possess amazing recovery powers!
Flaws aside this is a good, solid movie, it has just the right running time and plenty of action. This is strong stuff which may prove too much for more sensitive viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The dark of Don't Breathe helps make this a scary but fun thriller about blindness,"2016's summer seems to be a swell year for horror and thriller genre. The Conjuring 2, Lights Out, The Witch, and The Shallows found audiences that seemed to push away from the many reboots and sequels that filled the blockbuster season. A lot of that has to do with how these stories felt original, even though these kinds of stories have been told before. With the summer dealing with sharks, haunted houses, evil spirits and magic, what else could the horror genre bring? How about home invasion in reverse?The film in question may contain some similarities to David Fincher's Panic Room, but Don't Breathe has some major differences. Rather then the main character being the homeowner fighting burglars, we now have the robbers in focus trying to get away from the homeowner. Oh, and the landlord happens to be blind as well. So this movie seems to have a bit of Wait Until Dark in it as well (If you haven't seen it before, I highly recommend it as a great thriller with Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin). What's funny is that with a lot of those film elements, Don't Breathe happens to be a thrilling adventure, all confined in this one house with the goal of getting out.In the slums of a ghost town looking Detroit, three twenty somethings, Rocky (played by Jane Levy), Alex (played by Dylan Minnette), and Money (played by Daniel Zovatto), are robbers who only take small cash and information, thanks to Alex's connection to his father's security who seems to handle most of the local houses alarm systems. Rocky has been looking to get her little sister out their broken home and make it to California to start a new life. She may finally get that chance with their latest tip about a resident who has hundreds of thousands stashed in his home.When they get a glance at the blind guy's house, they see that he lives in an abandoned neighborhood with a mean rottweiler has his seemingly only defense. On the night they attack, their break in seems to go well, putting to the dog to sleep and finding an entrance through the basement. Just as the burglars seem to find where the money is, the blind man (played by Stephen Lang) is awaken by the noise and fights back hard. While hiding, the blind guy blocks all exits, leaving the robbers in a battle to see who can get out alive.Don't Breathe is a very exciting thriller/horror that kept my theater quiet except for the occasional scream or gasp. Director Fede Alvarez (2013's Evil Dead) and producer Sam Rami have given us an interesting perspective of sympathies and earned scares. A lot of that is all on the performers, so let get into that. Stephen Lang was probably the perfect choice for a role like this, who must be the toughest blind character I've seen in recent years. I also enjoyed the chemistry of Rocky and Alex's characters as they do their best to stay alive in a true zone of darkness.While film cannot recreate blindness well, Don't Breathe pulls of a number of tactics to do so from night vision to the use of sounds that one would hear better when they keep their eyes shut. The story may have you confused over which character you want to feel for, the script does give you enough backstory for you to make the decision. I'm also glad that the movie kept it's length short. It may seem like a bummer for those that want to be in the theater longer, Don't Breathe knows when to keep giving you scares and when to stop. It all falls into sync.I'll give this nine white canes out of ten. Don't Breathe adds to 2016's list of original movies that people will come out too. Not that Hollywood needs to make more horror movies, but I hope their at least seeing that people want more original content. Close your eyes, and experience the dark and light of Don't Breathe.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ok...but,"Interesting cinematography, the photography is good all the way. However, given the vagueness of the plot, despite the fast flow thriller, the film gradually looses tension, becomes predictable with excessive plot twists towards the end, and eventually just becomes boring and tiring to watch.

Excellent suspense horror/thriller,"Honestly think this film was brilliant. Stephen Lang puts in the performance of his career as the potentially iconic blind man, Jane Levy plays possibly my favourite final girl of the past 2 decades, she has relatable motive and is played flawlessly. Dylan Minnette was another nice surprise in this film, once again his character is quite relatable and you start to feel sorry for his character once you realise he's only roped himself into what he does for a girl that will never love him back. The cinematography is possibly the thing that holds this film together though. 99% of the film takes place within the house and as a result we get some very claustrophobic and clever camera work. Overall I think this is easily one of the better horror films in recent years and has earned itself a place on my Blu-Ray shelf.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A film that does almost everything right,"This is an almost perfect movie, for what it tries to do: entertain and shock.The story has got its twists and surprises, so it's not that predictable, but stays very simple (in a good way), and uses the very cool premise to its advantage. It starts and ends at the perfect moment, and has great pacing, so it never feels long, or drags out. The movie is very grounded, so when the violence comes, you feel it, and it almost never goes to far, so you don't get taken out of the movie.It looks great, but shows dirty and disgusting things so it has a classy trash feeling, some might say.If you like horror movies or thrillers, and is are not shocked by violence and gore, it will be an easy, fun watch for you but i would not recommend it to sensitive watchers.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Unexpected but Exellent film,"I've just watched this on film 4.
I wasn't expecting much to be honest reading the Info in the tv guide, maybe anoher people under the stairs or collector movie but I didn't expect to be gripped like I was all the way through.
Really enjoyed it and totally surprised, great thriller and exellent main actor as the blind guy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Things get way out of hand in this good horror movie,"I stopped watching horror movies some time ago because I think they rely too much on jump scares or easy terrifying things nowadays, but I gave this one a shot since I saw it recommended somewhere. Take that in mind while reading my review, specially if you think as I do.Don't Breathe starts off with a trio of thieves that are basically experts into breaking into houses, getting expensive things and running away with it. They have a rule, thought: no money. Suddenly, impulse by their desires of running away from their lives, they plan on get into a n old veteran's house, who's blind but has a ridiculous amount of money. Things seem easy, but something goes away from their eyes and they end up on the most complicated night of their lives.This movie starts slow. Not too slow, but expect something like 15 minutes of character background and set up before the plot takes off and things get interesting. I think it's a good thing since not everything has to be scares in this type of movies (like, give my heart a rest before it explodes out of my chest if possible), but worth point out.I personally love when a horror movie has a strong bad character that leaves the protagonist(s) with only the option to run and hide, and this movie really has that. The blind man (his name is not revealed in the movie) is like the unbeatable final boss in a video game, and being blind isn't that much of a handicap for him since his always a step ahead. It also matches with the fact that he's a veteran, it doesn't look like he has superpowers. It's a well done and rounded character, I like him.So, without further ado, here's my recommendation: watch it, it's good.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hidden gem,"To tell you the truth i started watching it not expecting too much and that's because of the countless horror movies and thrillers i have watched and in which the trailer is basically far better than the movie.
BUT this is different,this is a movie that you will not forget(easily at least).The quality in the film is, that if you read the plot( that 3 people enter a blind man's house to steal money ) you can surely think ''Come on,how can that be a problem?''.
But that's where the film wins over you.
It all feels credible and that's thanks to a very clever direction by Fede Alvarez.
Stephen Lang who plays the blind man is very very good and so are Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette who play the robbers.
Overall a breath of fresh air in the genre,an original in my opinion.Enjoy it.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good effort but vastly overrated, stretched out horror flick","Sadly so many of these noir/horror movies are made with great effort only to be spoiled by a handful of incredibly lame, stupid and lazy plot points. If you blindly accept the lazy setup, the first 2/3 of the film are well crafted before it devolves into a prolonged effort to keep the story going for an extra 20 minutes or else you'd have just a film an hour long.The premise - 3 struggling Detroit 20 somethings rob homes by using alarm codes that are accessible to the father of one of the youths and stolen by the father's son. For some odd reason one of the youths heard that a horrible looking home is where an old army veteran lived who received a large settlement from a car accident lawsuit, which claimed the life of his daughter. Why they are sure that this man, who is supposedly blind, are so damn sure that the cash will be stored in the house and that they will somehow be able to find it and extract it is dubious at best. But let's play along with that scheme.It takes a while for the setup to take place where the trio break into the old man's home to find quite a number of surprises. The first third and the early scenes are well done. The movie moves along at a reasonably quick pace with clich√©d characters on the side but they don't really distract from the main attraction. The problems occur when the typical horror film implausibilities begin to take place. And while there is excellent suspense for a good part of the film, it takes the easy way out a number of times which lead to a realistic feeling horror/noir film becoming a bit of a self- parody, which many of them are.Without giving the film away, the typical elements of horror films are there - characters that are almost impossible to kill because they are needed to prolong screen time. Chase scenes that someone allow characters to escape and show multiple views of the same characters with the attacker stuck in the same place for several different angles so that the protagonist can get away, albeit temporarily. It's not so bad at first but when you're at the 60 minute run time, it starts to become very noticeable.And the most disappointing part has to be the ending. It's supposed to provide your typical ""woah"" ending but mine was rolling my eyes at the ceiling at this film's way too hard effort to end up in such a fashion. They forced it badly.None of these detriments will ruin at least one view of the film. It's totally forgettable derivative drivel. But the suspenseful moments are well crafted and at least for an hour it will keep you entertained and wondering what will happen next. Could and should have been better. It's a B+ -- and at least it's not another dumb Saw torture porn film. This one is more about suspense.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely stunning,"The overall plot is pretty simple and the sub plot while only are review after one-third of the movie, is still predictable. However, this absolute masterpiece is based on masterful suspension with a dark theme. It will keep you tense through the whole movie. However, the director is skillful in controlling the paced, not falling into the chasm of movies such as BvS since the story is so simple you won't have to wonder why. Moreover, viewers never know what, when and where the villain may strike thanks to the way every shot is calculated and placed at near perfection. The only thing I felt out of tune is the ending scene, while somewhat satisfying, is far too bland for a movie this dark and messed up The intensity of the film is so overwhelming that while the soundtrack does not reach the desirable bar, nobody even notices it. Every character developed their personality mostly through action rather then words ( which is rare in this movie ) and yet still make the audience feel related and make the movie darker at the same time. A thriller, yet is probably one of those few classic that crosses over to the territory of Horror genre with this kind of fast-paced tension.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Seeing is believing, and he can't.","'Don't Breathe' is a film which cleverly shows that horror comes in many forms. Three young robbers mark a blind man's house to steal his funds, but 'underestimating' is something thieves do best. However, does a premise and film such as this deliver?1. The first noticeable thing about this film is the tone. The production designers did a terrific job in setting up the creepy atmosphere as well as finding the perfect house where all the alarming events take place. Of course, the attempted theft takes place at night, so the audience follows these characters through the dark maze of the blind man's house. The cinematography is especially fantastic as the camera smoothly navigates it's way through hallways, basements and tight crawl spaces.2. The three robbers are played by Jane Levy (Rocky), Dylan Minnette (Alex) & Daniel Zovatto (Money) respectively. The real horror establishes itself when one of the three meets their untimely and gruesome death. We quickly learn just how dangerous the blind man is when things take a turn for the worst. Jane Levy has more screen- time as she is proved to be the most sympathetic character when we learn of her backstory. Dylan Minnette is more of the innocent one who just follows orders at the behest of his crush on Rocky (Jane Levy).3. Last but not least, the 'Blind Man' himself, who is terrifyingly portrayed by Stephen Lang. Normally in a situation like this, the audience should be on his side, but his tactics prove to be lethal and brutal to a degree where you end up hoping the robbers survive his entrapment. The movie nose dives when more is revealed about the blind man and things turn insanely creepy. For all the suspense accumulated during the first half, I lost all faith the moment my stomach began to churn from the disgusting ordeal presented.There are too many moments of false hope near the climax and the movie makes you feel like it just doesn't know where and how to properly end things. I do give a lot of credit to director Fede Alvarez, but things unfortunately fall out of place and sources by the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't miss it!,"I saw a review that said this is the best American Horror movie in twenty years. I can't agree with that. Obviously these people have not seen You're Next, but seriously, Don't Breathe was great!It was so scary. So so scary. Ninety minutes of Freight. It was so well crafted. Just when you think the story has to end here they kept it going and did it brilliantly.Set in Detroit, which lately with movies like It Follows and Lost River is being filmed to look like the perfect back drop for Horror, Three kids decide to rob this guy of his hard cash. They think it's an easy task because the dude is blind. How wrong they are.Stephen Lang is going to be that new Horror Icon we all need to talk about. He was amazing as the blind man. From the moment he starts his rampage he sets a good example for all blind people who wish to be psychopathic killers. It's like stinkmeaner from the Boondocks, but he's white.I like to point out how the filmmaker seemed to use a camera that made closed space look even bigger. It's important because it really made you jump when the Blind man, or his sidekick dog would just appear in the shot.Three people stuck in a house with a maniac who can't see you, but knows you are there and wants you out dead or alive.Absolutely perfect.http://cinemagardens.com",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cruel and unusual,"In some ways it is similar to Green Room in that's its technically suspense thriller, but directed like a horror movie, until it eventually becomes one.Suffers from the obvious problem of the premise: no likeable characters. At its best the movie very surprisingly transcends this limitation with relentless suspense and some truly unexpected and horrifying surprises. At its worst it feels like a tedious exercise in depraved masochism.It is even more stylish than the director's previous efforts in Evil Dead. Beautifully photographed. I'll give it a 7/10 in spite of its fundamental flaws. Glad I took the time to watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than I expected,"This is what low budget film making is all about! (Although the estimated budget wasn't relatively all that low)By the above sentence, I mean by taking just a handful of actors / actresses, placing them in just one setting and creating a suspenseful thriller. No special effects and all that jazz, just good acting and directing all around.Whilst I do critique every film and always think that the majority of them could have been made better, I do think that they did a very good job here. Although I wouldn't say that this is a film full of plot twists, I won't give too much away and suggest you watch it for yourself.I was a little sceptical beforehand as I could only find good review after good review and hundreds of them too. I thought surely these must be paid for reviews as they were consistently 7s, 8s, 9s and 10s.

Blind Revenge,"This has been done before, with the protagonists being women instead of a man; Audrey Hepburn in ""wait Until Dark"" and Mia Farrow in ""See No Evil"" were blind victims avoiding bad people.

Two men and a woman rob houses using information obtained by a guy whose father runs a home alarm company and so he has the codes to disable the alarms. The trio hear of a large amount of cash in the blind mans house and they figure it should be easy pickings. Not so fast, boys and girl, this victim is one tough son of a bitch with a vicious Rottweiler to provide an extra layer of nastiness.

"Tense thriller, let down in places","Don't Breathe comes across mostly as a clever low-budget thriller with a brilliant set-up which almost works but is ultimately let down by a flawed execution, The initial plot of a trio of house-breakers relying on one of their gang to obtain inside information, and equally importantly keys, to target properties is a good one. Even more so when the latest target is a blind army veteran sitting on a fortune. The drama of this main event starts off well, but the terrific scenes of suspense are undone by inexplicable inconsistencies such as rooms with all windows barred suddenly having a character thrown through one without resistance and the tired old device of a character who clearly should be .dead regaining consciousness at a convenient point. Add this to the veteran's transformation between wily tough guy to complete idiot and a movie that promised to be a 7 or 8 rating ends up a 6.

Requires much suspension of disbelief.,"Three young punks - Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette), and ""Money"" (Daniel Zovatto) - are experienced at home robberies. Rocky and Alex (who's in love with her) are somewhat more even keeled. ""Money"" is just a plain pile of scum. They hear about a potential huge windfall to come from invading the home of an isolated, blind Iraq war vet (Stephen Lang). Supposedly he got a nice juicy settlement from the filthy rich family of a girl who'd killed the vets' daughter in a traffic accident.Getting inside the house is not too hard. However, the blind man is much more formidable an adversary than these brainless punks realize.I can see how many viewers would take the story (concocted by Rodo Sayagues and director Fede Alvarez) to task. There's barely a believable moment in it, starting with the fact that it takes an eternity before we ever hear police sirens, despite all the gunfire throughout the movie.Provided viewers can put their own brains in neutral, there IS entertainment to be derived from ""Don't Breathe"", but that's due to the execution, not the concept. Alvarez creates some effective suspense and atmosphere within this house, and there's visceral pleasures to be had from the violence. (If you can't stand any of the characters, you might at least enjoy seeing them being put through so much hell.) The script manages at least one amusing twist - which makes no sense, but does put Langs' character into perspective for you.The acting from Levy, Minnette, and Zovatto is adequate; her more so than the others, because she at least gets a character that is fleshed out to some degree. Veteran actor Lang, who's often specialized in creepy or outright psychotic roles, steals the show as the blind man, even if he only has about 13 lines or so, most of them towards the end of the picture.Filmed in (and set in) Detroit, although the interiors of the house were actually done in a studio in Hungary.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

There is no character in this movie to really root for. Frankly I wanted the three kids who broke into the blind man's house to all die because they're all unlikable.

Don't Breathe is a brilliant scary home invasion film which thrills you and a twist which disgusts you/,"Don't Breathe (2017): Recently I have watched two home invasion films Hush (2016) and The Strangers (2007). Hush is thrilling at its best but doesn't scare us and The Strangers is one of the most scariest thrillers I had ever seen but has very slow start.Don't Breathe has both qualities of Hush and The Strangers i.e.. both scary and engaging from the start but a awful twist spoiled the feel a bit.Plot: Rocky (Jane Levy), a young woman wanting to start a better life for her and her sister, agrees to take part in the robbery of a house owned by a wealthy blind man (Stephen Lang) with her boyfriend Money (Daniel Zovatto) and their friend Alex (Dylan Minnette). But when the blind man turns out to be a more ruthless adversary than he seems, the group must find a way to escape his home before they become his newest victims.Plus Points:1)Screenplay and Direction: Don't Breathe doesn't delay and enters the setup within a few minutes.Once they enter the house the movie becomes a scary thrilling ride where even audience awaits the sudden appearance of The Blind Man from nowhere.There are lot of nail biting scenes when the intruders hide from The Blind Man and especially when he turns off the power,the scene becomes more tense. Almost every scene finds new and creative ways to make these characters fight for their lives, whether it be in the crawling in the dark, running for their lives, or simply placed into increasingly tighter and tighter spaces. There's practically a scene to capitalize on every type of phobia imaginable, and Don't Breathe is perfectly paced in its ability to deliver fantastic scares.2)Sound Design: Don't Breathe is a master class in tension, and while its script could have been written on the back of an envelope, its editing and use of sound design is a triumph for film theorists.BGM made the scene more tense and during jump scares the sound design is excellent.3)Cinematography: The Blind Man's house is a normal old rotten house but a top notch cinematography gave it a view of an inescapable maze. Particularly its use of long tracking shots to establish the geography of its single location. Painstaking effort went into the look of this movie, and it shows. There's just no denying that, even in a terrible looking location, Don't Breathe is a beautiful looking movie.4)Performances: Stephan Lang as The Blind Man has all the qualities for becoming a latest horror icon.He deserves the majority of the acting credit for his sadistic yet almost sympathetic portrayal of The Blind Man.Jane Levy's wide eyed pupils are an asset as it portrayed lot of emotions.Her fear,her desperation,her helplessness.Close Up shots of her face is brilliant.Minus Points:1)Twist: Don't Breathe could have been a flawless thriller if it would have continued the same flow but it has this awful twist which spoiled the feel of the movie.The twist is so out of sync and it is clear that director want to have a violent scene even it it is not necessary.SO,Don't Breathe is a brilliant scary home invasion film which thrills you and a twist which disgusts you/My rating 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very tense and thrilling,"I went ahead and watched "" Don't Breathe "" with my friends today at the cinemas, we were all satisfied with the outcome.This movie really excels at being thrilling, I was gripped during the whole 1h and 30 mins. I felt like the length of the movie was on point, a little longer would have either killed the intensity or maybe would have been too tense for a long period of time.The acting was very good, the set pieces were well made. What I found to be really good is that some scenes and twists were really unexpected ( I don't want to spoil it ) but if you do see the movie, which I highly recommend, you would understand.The ending also offers space for a sequel, which I hope they do not ruin ( if it happens ).Go check out the movie, I personally found it to be very good and somewhat original.

"Suspenseful and Clever, Despite a Few Plot Holes","In a year with a string of impressive horror films, Don't Breathe is yet another good entry. Directed by Fede Alvarez (Evil Dead, 2013), this film shows that he has a talent for horror, and may be a rising presence in the genre. Don't Breathe is hold-your-breath scary, and features a clever premise, despite a few small plot holes. It is worth mentioning that the title and posters seemed a little ambiguous as to the plot, but watching the film the title seems appropriate.The first thing to mention about this film is that it is full of twists and turns, but does take a relatively practical approach to it's plot. The film's story is very smartly constructed, as it is full of tension from the opening moments, right up to the end. The film's biggest strength is its simplicity, as it makes the most of a very straightforward premise. That being said, the film is constructed in a way that obstacles are consistently thrown at the main characters in creative ways.Simply put the fact that the writers and directors were able to tell a story with such a clever yet simple premise makes it easy to follow. The impressive thing about this film is within a short period of time, the characters are well established and the premise, which is quite clever, is introduced. With all of the clich√©d horror films today, putting empty characters in clich√©d situations, it's refreshing to see relatable characters put into a straightforward premise. However, as happens in all horror films, the characters find everything is not as they expected it, and quickly discover they're in over their heads.The only problem with the film, is that it does cater to a few too many horror clich√©s and has a few glaring plot holes. While the obstacles in this film are creatively thrown at the main characters, a few of them don't make sense, with a little thought. The story at times, neglects to explain how something happened, and relies on a few Deus ex Machinas. The irony is that many of the plot holes, end up helping the villain character, as he seems almost inhuman by the end of the film. In the end, Don't Breathe does a brilliant job keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, with a combination of ingenuity and simplicity. The film offers a refreshing entry in the horror genre, which has seen a nice revival this year, from the typically clich√©d horror films we get. The film isn't great, as it has a few too many plot holes, and clich√©s, but is still very entertaining. Horror buffs looking for a good film to get them into the Fall/Halloween season will likely enjoy this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intense Thriller,"At the end of the day, this movie did its job for its genre as a thriller. It was entertaining, captivating, and there were no dull moments for this film.Most movies tend to start out really slow or have a slow burning effect, but Don't Breathe held an air of suspense for the majority of its screen time. The characters were great for this film; the movie did a good job of introducing the characters and giving you snippets of some of the motives and types of people they were. Stephen Lang was an amazing choice to play the old man. I couldn't help but feel a little bad for the blind man at the beginning, but the more you see him in action and learn about him, the more dangerous and scary he appears.As with most horror and thriller movies, the storyline was not extraordinary or totally unique, but, it's an intense movie that was very gripping and kept you on the edge of your seat.The only flaw of this movie were some obvious ""smarter"" choices the characters could of made, but for the most part, there were't many times where I was bothered by their decisions - considering the situation they're stuck in.In conclusion, the story was okay, the set-up was okay. Most of the elements were just decent, but it was how they used everything and executed them for this film, creating a thrilling and gripping movie.

An intelligent nail-biter.,"Receiving rave reviews from film-festival goers and critics alike, it doesn't take long to see why this under-the-radar horror-thriller has been amassing quite the fan base. Operating squarely within genre conventions, but at an extremely proficient level, this house-invasion flick builds tension masterfully. There are jump scares to be sure, however they're pulled off in a manner that isn't cheap thanks to their strategic placement. When our three young burglars break into a blind man's house during the night, it's not at all evident which route this movie is going to take. This base level of suspense is then escalated through a set of unpredictable twists and turns, cleverly playing with the audience's expectations. The violence is sparingly utilised and all the more effective for it, filmmaker Fede Alvarez (Evil Dead remake) wisely selecting to amp up the thrills with nerve-wracking anticipation rather than blood-splattering gore or unrelenting brutality. A long, Panic Room-esque one-shot tracking sequence displays Alvarez's immense talent behind the camera and his clear love of cinema, although he's also not above including one of the grossest on-screen moments in recent memory for utter shock value. The lead trio ‚Äì Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto ‚Äì are solid and likable without being completely excellent, whilst Stephen Lang manages a fine balance between being a menacing monster and a grieving father who is all too human. A couple of minor quibbles: the obtrusive score that doesn't seem to trust the sound design or visual framing to conjure up the requisite scares, and the hackneyed tropes employed in the opening act to establish the characters. Fast-paced, intelligently constructed and suitably tense, the aptly titled Don't Breathe is a nail-biting delight.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Suspenseful thriller from the makers of the Evil Dead films,"Master horror filmmakers Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert produce this gut wrenching work of art, directed by the relatively fresh Fede Alvarez. The films works as a horror film for a number of reasons, many of which are easily understandable.""Don't Breathe"" is receiving its well earned attention and success because it is something new within contemporary horror cinema. Today, we are bombarded with films that try to scare us in a non scary and overused way- think Paranormal Activity sequels, The Boy, The Shallows etc... These films heavily rely on frightening the audience with A)found footage, B) CGI or C) jump scares. We are tired of the same old formula. But the guys behind ""Don't Breathe"" saw this audience expectation as an opportunity to make something really great and terrifying. The film indeed does have jump scares, but not one every 2 minutes. In fact i think there is barely 5 times in the film where the audience is meant to jump out of their seats. In the majority of the film,the audience is left not only on the edge of their seats, but in the situation of the characters. The use of terrifying long takes and silence make this film feel realistic and authentic, and it doesn't need found footage to do it.""Don't Breathe"" has definitely breathed new light into the horror genre, and i am looking forward to the sequels and films that copy this formula in the future. All in all, ""Don't Breathe"" is the greatest contribution to horror cinema since ""The Blair Witch Project"" and the best horror film(minus the ""Babadook""-they're both on the same level) since Scream.WARNING:Please don't die of suffocation during your viewing of this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Movie but BAD ending!!,"I was really hoping that none of the three individuals would survive. They had no right to burglarise a blind persons house purely because of greed. I was very disappointed to see the girl walk out of the house alive and with the blind man money what sort of example is that!?

Turning Blue,"This is my review of Don't Breathe (spoiler free)**** (4/5)Lately, there has been a cycle of home invasion movies having a vulnerable protagonist ‚Äì for example the deaf heroine in Hush, the agoraphobic of Shut In (a.k.a Intruders) ‚Äì turning the table on murderous, larcenous thugs. Don't Breathe takes a slightly different tack on this premise, focusing on three varied crooks ‚Äì an unstable bad boy who provides all the jobs, Money (Daniel Zovatto) a girl who need money to escape her not-so-happy home life, Rocky (Jane Levy) and a basically decent guy with a crush (Dylan Minnette) ‚Äì they all make the mistake of targeting a grizzly tough ex-combat soldier (Stephen Lang) as their last target. Although influenced by many home invasion movies clashing regular criminals trying to make an extra bit of money with a contemporary maniac (No One Live, The Neighbour, The Collector). Although having dashed off the competent, not-so-memorable Evil Dead remake, Uruguayan writer/director Fede Alvarez doesn't exactly go all-out to break new ground with this 'original' ‚Äì but he demonstrate the understanding of how this sort of suspense picture works. Making revelations every ten minutes, but as the more perilous and extreme moments come in there is a genuine element of terror and a thrill that will be memorable for any audience. Through the 88 minutes it adds terror, thrills, suspense and a memorable antagonist who is a lot more proficient, and less vulnerable than the young crooks last thought.The scarce use of dialogue isn't exactly worth while as there isn't much to go on when it comes to character development (spoken term) but as the story goes on turns out we don't need it as the slow and creepy editing style adds to the dark feel of the film, as we are constantly on edge as the element of threat gets stronger. One of the editing styles adds a night vision shot at one point and zooms it in really close to one of the invaders, so as you see their scared face it will increase the tension that this story was already full of. So in terms of story its limited but certainly makes up for it, not really classed as a go-for-broke horror as there are a few jump scares not really taking over the sheer threat of having a blind combat proficient man chase after you. Although this could be shown as a message for home invaders. The story is filled with constant suspense as the three thieves try to escape the blind man's home, although what they don't expect is that the Blind Man already has a plan for the thieves. That gives the thieves an idea, but as the story goes on in the main set-up inside the house he's not as paranoid as they thought, in fact, far from it. As stated above the jump scares are limited kind of strong however the feeling of suspense adds to the scares. Filmed practically it shows there is no need for special effects pizazz as some horrors try adding to make the story scarier, however it really wasn't needed in this as this antagonist and the dark atmosphere add enough horror.Also the feeling of claustrophobia is shown as one of the characters is in a tight confined space in a moment which will have you constantly on edge just many other characters in movies that have to deal with tight spaces, this is more towards the terrifying denouement which we'll get to later. There is a sense of shock in one of the scenes as the thieves discover which they did not expect and it adds a sense of imprisonment which is the whole theme of the film, but when it gets to this bit it is a very memorable moment which the audience will remember until well after the credits roll. It shows prolonging sense of agony. All this including the thrill are all made the bit creepier with Roque Banos' foreboding score which will send a shiver right down your spine. Each time this adds the feeling of every time one or the other robbers has a chance to get away clean, something pulls them back whether they creak a floorboard or even break some glass the antagonist gets ever closer to catching you.Finally as we all know at the end of a horror film in this case home invasion film the terror gets more fast paced, but in this not only is the terror nearly taking over the entire film there are also some feel good bits. But also as we get closer to the end the last act subjects the girl to a ferocious, slobbering guard dog, a padded basement dungeon (with a suspension harness) and a shocking home medical procedure. Although Lang, is an underrated character best known for his good-guy-cum-villain-cum-hard-to-kill-guy in Avatar, he is a powerful, menacing presence that also manages a little bit of pathos as we start to feel sorry for him as he is the real victim because we learn that he has lost everything he knows/loves and he preaches that there is no God because he took away the things he knew, so essentially he has nobody and he just wants to be left alone that is the message that this sends.VERDICT: Alvarez gives full blown suspense, terror and darkness in an original escapee horror that will make you struggle for every last breath.8/10 terrifying.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid 7...liked the premise but soundtrack wasn't what I expected,"This is worth watching. Many predictable scenarios but good acting and directing make the movie worth while.Stephen Lang as the blind vet is excellent and Jane Levy's acting is upped by the use of facial expression .Movie had 9 mil budget and I remember Insidious with 1 mil scaring me more. One interesting fact is this director's style. No slant imaging or plating..he used the terror of a robbery and all parties trapped in the house to create his movie.The sound track was given high reviews in places; maybe I'm just spoiled by my recent viewing of ""It Follows"". Only as a reference to sound track will I tell you It Follows is in line with Jaws and John Carpenter's original Halloween as far as a sound track making the movie.The writer Fede Alverez and Rodo Sayagues deserve a mention as this was a well planned and building story line.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Don't Breathe"": Not as simple as Good Guys vs. Bad Guys.","How can we genuinely root for either ""side"" in the crime thriller ""Don't Breathe""? Both are reprehensible. And yet each in their own way also manage to stimulate an investment of pathos and pity.On the one hand we have the trio of desperate young folks, whom life has collectively exploded a big ol' gigantic sh-- bomb all over while they slowly disintegrate in the dregs of Detroit. We feel for these kids, yeah. But not overly so. After all, it is of their own free will that they engage in a series of suburban home break-in robberies, with the most unstable among them the only one who is armed. Not exactly keen inspiration for advocacy on behalf of the audience with this boorish bunch, is there? Enter the other component in the equation presented in ""Don't Breathe"". He is ""The Blind Man"", a Gulf War vet who lost his eyesight in battle fighting for his country, and whose misfortune is compounded by the tragic loss of his only child, a daughter who was accidentally run down by a car. Instant sympathy for this sorrowful soul, right? Ah, but not so fast. Consider that this guy is also liable for kidnapping, imprisonment and torture, all within the creepy confines of his dilapidated domicile, and even the most compassionate among us are given pause to reconsider our position.So, given the respective parties in ""Don't Breathe"", it is for us, then, to examine and assess where we come down regarding any potential allegiances as we watch the grim and grisly proceedings play out in this house of horrors.Until, at last, it is game over.Or IS it?......",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
7.5/10 - A simple but thrilling movie with a perfect villain for a tense hour and a half.,"It's tension everywhere: Don't breathe delivers effective scares and thrills with a simple story and last-minute twists. The plot is nothing new in the home-invasion genre, but the story, characters and antagonist help to make it a pretty welcomed addition. There isn't much character development or background, but the precise information given about the protagonists and other flaws are more than compensated by the heavy atmosphere of the flick.A wickedly written and perfectly casted villain makes this movie a satisfying journey. Stephen Lang is perfect in the role. What attracted me most from the character is the fact that he isn't a psychopath, not a madman, not a degenerate, he is a normal person (well, a very strong and meticulous ex-soldier). He is a father who suffered and takes justice into his own hands, without getting into traumatizing or pervert actions. One thing is for sure if he must be a mean son of a @#$%&, he will be the worst mean son of a @#$%&.Something cool is the scary end of the movie (don't worry I won't spoil it), but I'll only say this: You will finish thirsty for a second part, saying ""Damn!!"". Asking yourself: ""What if...?"" ""Do you think that...?"" ""Holly @#$%&, will he...?""FINAL CONSENSUS: The simple but thrilling storyline, protagonists, and main villain are highlighted by the tense and chilling atmosphere of the movie, making a worthy horror-packed hour and a half.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"That's a quite good movie, it's worth to watch it in the cinema","So, at first the situation. I think that's not bad. Three simple people want to rob, because they need money to live, to ""run"" out from Detroit. They get an info that says there is an old man, who has a lot of money, and they try to get it. But then they notice that the old one is blind. And now start the story, exactly. So I think the basic situation is quite good. Interesting. The actors/actress work well. I gave tho this film 9 stars, because there is one think, that's a little bother me. It's the dog. But I won't say anything else about the film. It's totally worth to watch it in the cinema.

Whoa!  Don't Breath!,"When I first saw the trailers of this film I didn't really know if it was something that I would want to see. I thought it was just going to be one those below average and poorly written horror/thrillers, Boy was I wrong! Even my wife enjoyed this film and we have totally different tastes when it comes to film and I'm not trying to make fun of her but she has awful taste. This film was filled with suspense, thrills, out of your seat jumps and a little drama. With all that being said, this film isn't perfect. There were a few plot holes here and there, which normally bugs me, but the suspense and thrills made up for that a little, that's why I think some of the bad reviews I read of this film was a little too harsh. The story-line and plot were a little simple but sometimes that works depending on who's doing it and it worked in this case. This film was recommended to me so I'm recommending it to anyone who likes thrillers.

Don't Breathe Review,"Don't Breath(2016) Starring: Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto, Stephen Lang, Jane Graves, Katia Boko, Sergej Onopko, Emma Bercovici, and Jon Donahue Written By: Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues Directed By: Fede Alvarez Review THIS HOUSE LOOKED LIKE AN EASY TARGET, UNTIL THEY FOUND OUT WHAT WAS INSIDE. Coming off the mixed reception of his Evil Dead remake, Fede Alvarez is back in the horror genre with Jane Levy and his third directorial, second that is a major motion picture. I found out about this film through a YouTube advertisement and I'm so glad I usually don't skip trailers when there the Ads. I decided to see it for three of the main leads Stephen Lang(who looks like he would make a great Cable in a future X-Men or Deadpool sequel), Dylan Minnette who stared in my favorite horror film of last year(Goosebumps) and of course an actress I would like to see more of and in more horror films Jane Levy. Rocky, Alex and Money are thief's who decide hey let's go rob a blind war veteran so we can have the money to get out of this joint. The War Veteran is a blind man who's angry at the world and holds a dark secret. This film will do what it's set out to do and make you grip your hands tighter and tighter on the seat with the urge of tension filled in your body as the picture unfolds, It has ingenious camera-work in the first scene where the three get inside the house and start looking around. As it spans the house, camera-work I might have seen before I'm sure but when your touring a small environment that your going to be in half the movie it works when the camera spans through going upward to the upstairs, showing us a TV screen and moving towards the right to the bed and under the bed back to the door which is being opened. Most would assume the story isn't interesting since the majority of the film is taken place in one small location especially if it's a horror picture, I bet you have had that thought as well. I however love it when horror pictures are mostly taken place in a small house it's Hitchcock'n in my eye. But as the story unfolds you won't see what's coming. You won't figure out how it ends and you won't figure out what happens next, you'll just have to hold your breath. As you have read I like three of these performers I'll start with Dylan Minette, he doesn't play the same kind of kid he did in Goosebumps I mean come on in the deleted scenes of that film he got bullied I wouldn't by that but here he plays an intelligent kid who can get pass through the security of a home, you can imagine since his father in the film is a cop, he still gets insulted in this film but when he shines out through the rest of this film trying to escape the house he really shows fear due to his situation, Stephen Lang who I must admit I don't know much about was so great when he was on screen he was intimidating, fierce, quick and downright scary. The one actress I really went to see this for Jane Levy I haven't seen her in a film since that Evil Dead remake(and to be quite honest while I do think it's great It's a little too overly disgusting I wish I could watch Ash Vs. Evil Dead that looks way better) and when I saw she was in this and Fede Alvarez was directing I was like this looks way better! She does a great job as Roxy where Jane Levy is once again the final girl(but then again she's the only girl in this situation) and pulls out just a great a performance as she did in Evil Dead with great dialogue. Don't Breath is the horror film I was waiting for Fede Alvarez to make he's a great director who pulled out some great shots in this film with writing and a tight script that you don't see quite often, great performances, and nothing but tension throughout, so what ever you do Don't skip, Don't miss, Don't Breath because it get's a five out of five.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unnessarily over the top.,"From director Fede Alvarez comes his second feature film, 'Don't Breathe'. His first being the reboot of 'Evil Dead'. If there's one thing that a horror film can do for a director its shoot them into the limelight. Mainly because they are typically cheap to make and, like this one, don't require a complex narrative. It's more appealing to studio's and audiences eat it up. There has been quite a few gimmicky horror movies this year but this is for sure the best. Unlike those other films, this one looks great. It's easily the most cinematic horror movie I have seen in quite some time. Everything from the direction to the framing, color pallet, and the movement of the camera looked and worked incredibly well.But the most important question to ask when you see a ""horror"" movie is, is it scary? While horror and comedy are especially subjective, I think I can easily say that this one just works. It's driven by thick atmosphere. This mainly has to do with both the look and the premise. Now, the story is very simple. Three kids decide to rob an old man after finding out that he has at least $300 thousand stashed in his house.What they weren't expecting was that he isn't just a docile old blind man. It's a classic story about random people that get in over their heads and are slowly picked off. In fact, it reminded me of the slightly better 2016 film 'Green Room'. It actually follows the same story almost to a T as that film. But instead of the basic home invasion film that we see a whole lot, this one flips it around.Instead, our main characters are the robbers rather than the people being robbed. The first thirty minutes of this film are nearly perfect. It sets up basic info about our characters, their robbing abilities, and demonstrates the brutality of the man the pick to rob. Not to mention the subtle hint that the old man may just be a victim in all of this. It could not have been a better set up.Where it starts to falter is when it makes the old guy the villain. If it were to keep him and the main characters as murky human beings, this film would've worked extremely well. It would have transcended the basic us against them film. And it would've become a film where you aren't sure who to root for. But what we got is the two-dimensional horror flick everyone expected.Even though it kind of turned into an unoriginal horror film, I still had hope. It was still very tense and simple enough to be fun, but it really derails near the middle. Where the villain becomes a B-grade comic book bad guy. With a completely unnecessary plot twist, the film turns this almost relatable old man into an utter psychopath for no reason.It was from this point on that nearly everything became nonsense. Beforehand almost every scene felt like it belonged in the film. But after that point, almost every scene seemed to end with a question mark. Guns suddenly had infinite ammo until it was convenient not to, the old man suddenly had the magical power of teleportation, and spare keys were randomly hidden away in safes for some reason.But the biggest issue with the film is that it had no idea when to end. There were two or three times where I swear it was going to end and it just didn't. There was a hilariously out of place and forced moment involving the old man and the main girl that lasted way too long. Then she managed to get out of that situation with the help of another dumb plot twist, then there was some running around, and then it just kind of ended.It was like twenty minutes of the film but it felt like hours were going by because none of it felt like it belonged. It was really in the last half of the film where things started going off the rails. Everything before hand was very well executed and tense with some beautiful visuals to boot. But the latter portions of this movie just did not work for me. Really nothing felt like it connected to anything because it seemed designed to simply shock. That was it. It didn't want to be a film, it just wanted to shock its audience. But instead of building around that shock it just kind of threw it in there. Even though I respect this film and can give it a passing grade, it's not one I will ever see again.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't mess with the blind man,"Don't Breathe is a tight, thriller that doesn't let up. There were several parts of the film where I was convinced we were nearing the end, only to be grabbed by the throat and dragged back in. Three young criminals are trying to get out of Detroit and onto bigger and better things. In order to do so they need cash, and lots of it. After receiving information on a potential big score, the group decides to go for it. The target is a blind, Iraq War veteran who is rumored to have $300,000 somewhere in his house. What looks like a cake walk turns into a nightmarish game of cat and mouse that will leave you truly holding your breath until the very end.Alvarez reunites with Jane Levy, his leading lady from Evil Dead. Levy really wowed me in that film and I was excited to see her in a new role with new scares. While some actors are remembered for their screams in horror films, it's Levy's eyes that stand out. They convey so much emotion, and given that a good amount of this film requires her character to remain silent, she pulls it off brilliantly. Accompanying Levy is veteran actor Stephen Lang as The Blind Man. Lang's screen and stage presence is well documented in productions like Gettysburg, Avatar, and as Col. Jessup in the original stage production of A Few Good Men. His intimidating physique makes him the perfect choice to play this role.Alvarez assembled a great team of actors, but his best selection might have been behind the camera with cinematographer Pedro Luque. He was the cinematographer for La Casa Muda, (The Silent House) a film that almost doesn't deserve the genius camera-work from Luque. He shot the film to appear like one continuous take and the result is truly unique. He didn't disappoint here either with some great tracking shots and an unforgettable chase scene in the basement.Luque's images are made even creepier thanks to brilliant sound design. Sound ups are common in horror films, and there are plenty to jump at in this film. While those work great they can be tiresome. I prefer the quiet moments. The shuffling of feet, creaking floor boards, and muffled breathing not only intensify the mood, they force the viewer to fill in the silence with their own imagination. It's like when you here something in your own home and you don't know what it is. You run through every possible scenario until you find the source.When the credits starting rolling I felt like I myself had spent the night in the house. With a run time of just under 90 minutes, they really jam packed every second of it. While the dialogue isn't anything to write home about (especially the first act), it doesn't detract from the story (I watch for scares, not for the conversations). A fine job all around and hopefully just the beginning of a long career for Alvarez. With two big films under his belt already, I can't wait to see what he has in store for us next!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

And the script? Well, you have a blind Bluebeard. But you have Stephen King's Cujo too. You have the dark house from the Silence of the Lambs and a lot of others. You have a mad man's trap, because it is not a fortress, but a conventional alarm system. And the guy can have sensitive ears, which is not obvious for someone so skilled with guns, yet he has a high pitched alarm system.So if you want a roller-coaster ride without any thinking, this is the movie for you.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Don't BreatheThe most dangerous aspect of a blind person's house is their chaotically arranged furniture.Which is why the burglars in this thriller shouldn't walk around in the dark.Hard up for cash after a deal goes south, Detroit hoods Rocky (Jane Levy), Money (Daniel Zovatto) and Alex (Dylan Minnette) decide to break into the residence of a blind vet (Stephen Lang) who has a large legal settlement stowed away inside.However, the home invasion turns into murder when the sightless occupant begins offing the intruders to keep them from discovering what he has confined in his basement.Enriched by a number of narrative twists, Don't Breathe does a decent job of keeping up the tension and delivering the thrills.

The only way this movie could be better is if I was also blind.,"Please do not watch this movie. The directing was decent and the premise was interesting, acting wasn't very bad either, but the plot was the biggest pile of convoluted garbage I have ever seen. They set up no character development for the main bad guy, or any of the characters. A blind guy with a gun? That isn't even remotely scary. At least give us a reason to give a damn about the main characters to get invested in them. The characters decisions also made no sense, even for a horror movie.

Chillingly tense.,"This is a movie that tries to rely on simplicity rather than going into more complicated territory, and it uses the simplicity to try and stir the more natural fears we ALL share. Does it accomplish this? Absolutely!From the get go we as viewers know that the story is about a trio of house burglars who find out that an army vet has a lot of money stashed away in his old and rusty house in a very quiet street, the catch is that the man in blind.The film sets up its characters well enough, particularly the character of Rocky played by the very camera-friendly Jane Levy. We see a glimpse into their lives and what it is that drives them into the house in the first place. I liked this about the movie, but I found myself wanting to see more of the other two as well, and unfortunately we don't get that.The character of The Blind Man is also handled well, perhaps more so than the rest of the cast. Stephen Lang does a fantastic job of portraying this surprisingly complex character. The greatness comes with the slow but steady transformation of our viewpoint of the man, and it is a haunting transformation to say the least.The other strong points of this movie are particularly the well thought out screenplay as well as the sleek cinematography. I am dead serious when I say that this is a genuinely well produced horror/thriller film. The minimalist soundtrack rounds this all off with great style.Now, with all of the positives out of the way, I do need to point out some of the places where the movie doesn't succeed, because, trust me, there are a few of them.The film kicks off with a real strong start, and for the first hour it is almost flawless, however, later in the film the whole thing starts getting a bit much. We are pulverized with twists and turns that sometimes feel like they don't really need to be there, and these actually make the movie drag on a bit when it feels like it should have already reached its climax. The movie then drags on even more in the last ten minutes and by then I had seen enough of the same thing for it to not be quite as exciting as it was in the beginning.The other big problem with this movie is the plot holes. I'm not going to say that there are many of them, but the ones that are there do stand out when you stop to think about them.This is a very chillingly tense movie that was handled with enough care for it to stand out as one of the finest horror films of the year. I was sitting at the edge of my seat for the majority of the film, and it is so originally simplistic in its approach that it ends up delivering a surprisingly scary experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Is it possible to love yet be thoroughly angered by a film?,"There are people saying that 'Don't Breath' is the best horror in years, and honestly it almost was. However one thing knocked the film down. From all the tension, and smart camera-work, and brilliant directing, one thing angered me so much that I almost walked out of the film three times towards the end of the film.I did not care for Rocky aka the main protagonist of this story. Now it doesn't matter if your a horror, drama or action film, we need to care about our main character. There are three burglars, and the only likable one, is someone you know from the opening shot, is not going to be alive at the end. I won't spoil how, but from the beginning you know only Rocky will be left at the end.Granted they give her a valid motivation, but I need more than a text message, and a two minute rushed scene with her daughter, to make me care and accept everything she does. The actress Jane Levy who plays her does a great job, but the way the character and story is written just ruined any care I had by the end of the film. This character goes full 80's Hollywood horror logic, and the selfish attitude, made me root for Stephen Lang's psychotic blind man character by the end, and there's a twist about that character that makes me feel sick knowing I wanted him to win even after the fact. Like Jesus Christ why can't horror characters ever at least knock out a human antagonist in this film. The character was selfish, stupid and not very fleshed out.That aside. This was a fantastic horror movie. No false scares. Stephen Lang was intimidating as hell. The pacing was nice. The twists were disturbing. There was well built up tension.That scene that in the trailer when everything's shot in night vision, is one of the most tense things I have ever seen, and was genuinely frightening. Alex played by Dylan Minnette, is the real likable character in this story, he fights, he isn't selfish, he steps up to the plate and is played brilliantly by Dylan. If he was the main character, I would have been on board until the end.The sound design and cinematography were exactly what we need from a horror. It takes the show whats supposed to be scaring us approach and it works. Instead of a loud sound effect of bit of music making the audience jump every time the blind man suddenly appears, they let the lack of noise, or simply the sound of the door being slammed open when he enters do all the scaring. We see the blind man show up, and we as an audience freeze as soon as the characters do. This is the best sound design in a horror since 'The Babadook' that's how good the sound design is. All these long shots establishing the space and where everything is in the house, should be commended. Its great story telling, Hollywood has finally learned how to make a good horror movie.This film could easily be a 4.5/5 had it not been for the unlike-able, generically stupid clique lead.

"Read this, it's my first review, wish it was for a better movie lol","Stephen Lang plays a very captivating antagonist in this 2016 Thriller, Don't Breath. At first, Stephen makes us feel remorse for his situation only to later makes us feel repulsed with his vengeance. The movie grew with suspense for hours, like a piece of gum you're blowing in your mouth, only to, well, never really burst. As much as the audience jumped, which was very seldom, the movie wasn't very scary. I never felt my heart pumping fast and I certainly wasn't on the edge of my seat. I was waiting and waiting for the twist. When it finally presented itself, it was like New Years Eve, you kinda just knew that the ball was going to drop, what a big surprise right? I want to make this clear, I'm not a hatter, I'm just a realest who loves movies. My friends think I expect to much, I don't, I just want to leave the theater satisfied, I was not. Stephen Lang was great and the plot had a ton of potential. However, I once again leave another movie in the summer of 2016 disappointed of what could be. I give Don't Breath a 5/10. All 5 coming from Stephen Lang. He can't do everything, but he can sure carry half the movie on his performance alone.",,Anonymous,Horror

if you enjoy watching extreme violence perpetrated without the consequences,"Difficult one for me to evaluate. I'm sure it does everything the makers intended and that for some this is one rocking good non-stop action movie. I watched the much earlier, Five Dolls For an August Moon (Mario Bava) the night before and in truth that is very much a case of style over substance. It looks great all the time but while there is violence, most of this is off screen and almost incidental. With Don't Breathe, the action is everything. It is very well done but just how many times does someone get beaten to death and not be dead? It is a simple tale that could be told in five minutes but is drawn out like some interminable boxing match. It is interesting that this has a modest 15 certificate in the UK, even Holland gives it a more 'adult' rating of 16 and I guess this is because despite the awful and constant bludgeoning of each other, there is little or no blood. Strangely enough in the aforementioned Bava film, although the killings are not shown, the dead bodies are revealed as having what looks like a bottle of ketchup over them. I think maybe I'm rambling so I'll stop. To conclude, if you enjoy watching extreme violence perpetrated without the consequences being too apparent, this is for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Suspense killed by violence,"Well, the story-line is brilliant, and that is half the work done on this horror/slash/thriller type of film. I was told it was less predictable than most. That's right, but it does not take a surprising turn like The Others does, or The Village. Just compared to Hammer House Horror maybe. It's a mix of horror and psychopath violence, and it tries to satisfy all audiences, except the ones who like a joke now and then. Too much bashing and thrashing to my mind, we would all be dead after one blow. And therein lies my objection to this otherwise well made movie: I need to believe it could be true, and I do not. Not after all those knives,pistols,garden tools and what-not. Less would have been be more, to my mind.

Intense but flawed,"I thought this movie was quite suspenseful. Just watching this movie I felt the need to not make any noise.

This movie didn't try to be anything more than an intense thrill ride that kept you on the edge of your seat, and they did just that.I'll try to describe my issue with it without spoiling anything. There are just some points where you get so frustrated with the characters for not doing the obvious thing they should do in whatever situation they're in at the time. It makes you want to yell at your TV and say ""WHY DONT YOU JUST DO THIS??"" Also there are a couple parts in which the events are a little far-fetched and leaves you wondering ""oh come on how is that actually possible?""Nonetheless, this movie is quite the thrill ride and very entertaining, and I would love to rate it higher but the flaws are kind of obvious at times.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Immersing in the Suspense,"A group of teens looks for an easy come up by attempting to rob a blind man in his home..Small and intimate cast, this film does a terrific job with immersing us in the suspense of a robbery and the fear of being caught. Majority of the film is spent during the spectrum of the suspense which provides a steady appetite of engagement towards the plot. There are enough unpredictable events to keep you wondering what will happen next, will they survive, or will there be a happy ending.The ending scenes are crucial because it connects the dots to the story behind the old man, the height of the suspense is reached and is repulsive enough to add to the overall experience. This can happen in real life, thus making it seem real.Verdict:If you like suspense films that immerse you in an experience, this is for you. There are enough elements that make this an engaging movie to watch. Be prepared to be sickened towards the end, there's enough plot buildup, twist, action, and good pacing.

It is a thriller, not a gory slasher movie. It is a movie which twists and turns and toys with your loyalties - Do we want the teens to get what we think they might have coming to them, or do we want the blind man to get his?

Blind Horror,"This is a bit disappointing. I had higher expectations for such an acclaimed and sequelized horror movie, especially because its home-invasion plot revolves around the monster being blind. The ""Quiet Place"" series (2018 and 2021, thus far) exploits this quite well, as the aliens are anti-movies in that they are combatted and enraged by all manner of cinematic-related stimuli. One of the heroic characters, too, is deaf, which both emphasizes the primacy of the visual in the art form and the importance of the use of sound, including its absence. Blindness has been exploited effectively in quite a few films in such ways. This goes back to at least Russian filmmaker Yevgeni Bauer, such as ""Za schastem"" (1916), variously translated as ""For Luck"" or ""For Happiness,"" but the earliest such well-known instance may be Charlie Chaplin's ""City Lights"" (1931), a silent film made in the age of talkies that feature a blind romantic interest to emphasize the beauty of silents and the relative squawking of the talkies, which it did in conjunction with being a lovely-looking and scored film, as well. A fair amount of horror movies have played on the inability of characters to see to frighten or thrill the voyeuristic spectator. In recent years, there's been ""Get Out"" (2017), ""Bird Box"" (2018) and ""The Invisible Man"" (2020), for examples.The blindness of ""Don't Breathe,"" on the other hand, seems even more inept to me than, say, the recycling of the blind-seer trope in ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004), or if you think that actually deserved Best Picture, how about ""The Matrix Revolutions"" (2003). Other examples, such as ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935) or ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (2000) handle this somewhat better, or at least more literately.Here, though, it's just, let's not breathe too heavily or step on a creaky floorboard sort of tension building, and, then, the blind guy gets the upper hand for one scene when the lights are out. Seems to me just about the most unsophisticated use one can make of a blind character in a visual art form. One may see just as well that nearly every other horror flick may produce similar cheap thrills without that. The only reason I rate this as high as I do is because it's admittedly more effective than others at that, although I wish it hadn't telegraphed everything so early: who are the good guys and the bad guys and such, especially with the backstory of the girl's little sister. Just because most movie-goers can see, doesn't mean we can't also survive with a little ambiguity.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

An Intense and Well Put Together Thriller‚ÄîDefinitely Worth the Watch,"Don't Breathe is a well put together film and excels in many areas where many horror/thriller films fail.This film puts together and extremely tense mood with twists and turns.

"Cheap and unpolished, still suspenseful and entertaining.","For honesty and coherence's sake I'll start off by saying I gave Don't Breathe a 6 out of 10. It's compelling, keeps you on edge and at times truly shocking without allowing itself to be pulled into anything too clich√©. Pretty much all the makings of a decent modern Horror film not dealing with the supernatural, definitely achieving its initially set goals both story-wise and cinema-wise.Having said that, the film is (in my humble opinion of course, feel more than free to disagree) quite frankly cheap and enjoyable despite it, not due to it. First, the cheap psychological trick of presenting the villains (no, they are NOT anti-heroes, simply a bunch of misfit delinquents forming a street gang of egotistical spoiled brats) as the protagonists from the exposition to the very end. Three jerks who decide to break into a war veteran and bereaved father in order to rob him of his settlement funds (his sole livelihood), and the audience is coerced into sympathizing with them on account of the female coming from a messed up home with an abusing mother and the male being a slightly dorky ""good guy"" in love with her. The screen time they are given achieved the effect of making us (or me at least) secretly (or not quite so) root for them despite them being the obvious bad guys from the get go.Second, the fear and shock factors are as cheap as they come. Jump scares as the only truly ""frightening"" feature. Dark secrets revealed which flip the script and imply that there are no good guys in this film (so much for the film avoiding clich√©s). And my favorite - the ""antagonist"" (again, a 50+ year old veteran protecting his house and wealth from a bunch of no good would be burglars) being a hybrid of Superman and God, easily able to overpower a youngster half his age and twice his size, survive two hammer swings hitting him straight on the back of the head and escape handcuffs. Perhaps this was a supernatural Horror film after all.Third, the sheer stupidity of certain scenes for the sake of the plot instead of choosing one of a million other more authentic and realistic options. Like the war veteran suddenly losing his accuracy and missing the kid he tries stabbing with garden shears when he's literally on top of him, moments after he was able to track said kid using his hearing alone and hit him with a pistol bullet form the other end of the hall. The bullet of course didn't kill the kid, as that would have made far too much sense. That's not just foolish, it's cheating.Yes, the film is fun to watch even if you aren't able to ignore all those blunt shortcomings. It's suspenseful and keeps you guessing and hoping. Some scenes are truly shocking regardless of being cheap and overall result is definitely worth watching. Just please don't be fooled by the relatively high score Don't Breathe has received here on IMDB (yes, that's pretty high, people here get a kick out of trashing excellent Horror films) and don't expect 2016's Horror masterpiece. Aside from the great acting nothing about this film should have been as it was, and it wouldn't have been all that challenging to make it better or at least less cheap.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

This movie seemed just too similar to the aforementioned movie. The only real difference was that this movie had a blind ""bad guy"" in it.On a side note: The one thing that this movie did really well was creating suspense. Somehow the blind antagonist had super-hearing abilities which at first glance seemed like something out of a Marvel comic (Yes, I'm talking about Daredevil comics in case you didn't get the reference).

The movie has A rather original concept and it does execute that rather well I think to the point that it does grab your attention and keeps you and you invested in the Fiom. Imagine suicide you but also possibly swapping your thoughts on the whole situation. Really for the most the movie you're more or less rooting for the old man. Because even though at least with the girl they give some idea what her life is like at home. You still don't really have much sympathy towards these three who break into his house. It's of course of horror film so obviously the old man is hiding something himself. Though overall the Characters for the most part the three thieves I didn't really find them all that interesting. Again outside of the girl you don't get that much on them. Eventually she fall more into the dumbass category. Honestly the one guy name Alex is probably the only likable one. He's the only one Who speaks any kind of sense whatsoever, one the choices the others make.

Don't watch.,"In the opening scene to Don't Breathe, three youths - Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money (Daniel Zovatto) - break into a posh house, steal anything of value, and vandalise the property, smashing ornaments and urinating all over the place before chucking a rock through the window; their next target is a blind man who is rumoured to have a small fortune in his home, the cash settlement he received after his daughter was run down and killed. Writer/director Fede Alvarez then has the audacity to ask his audience to give a damn about what happens to this trio of white trash scum-bags.Not on your nelly!I don't care how rotten an upbringing Rocky has had, or that she cares for her little sister, or that the blind man turns out to be far from helpless and more than a little bit twisted - rooting for Rocky and her thieving pals is not an option, making the film a frustrating experience from the outset.But unlikable protagonists aren't my only issue with Don't Breathe: there's the small issue of the blind man (played by Stephen Lang), who makes Zatoichi and Daredevil look like clumsy buffoons by comparison. Some of the things this sightless guy is able to do are utterly ridiculous: disarming a gun-toting enemy, repeatedly turning up at the right place at the right time, abducting a woman and keeping her in a basement prison (which, presumably, he also constructed), reaching up to yank Rocky from air ducting, and silently tracking his victim in the surrounding derelict neighbourhood, all without stubbing a toe. His guard dog also displays supercanine qualities, the hound even climbing up furniture and entering an air vent to pursue Rocky.Alvarez manages a couple of effective jump scares along the way, and delivers a memorably yucky scene involving a turkey baster and a large helping of 'gentleman's relish', but the movie is, for the most part, way too dumb and loaded with implausibilities and glaring plot holes to be good for anything but unintentional laughs.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

The movie has a tense and chilling atmosphere throughout the runtime and I was on the edge of my seat. There were also moments where I was holding my breath. The performances from the cast were awesome in particular Jane Levy and Stephen Lang. Jane Levy just has this likable energy to her that you can't help but root her even if her character of Rocky isn't the best person. Stephen Lang, on the other side, manages to make this blind guy both scary and terrifying at the same time. And finally, I appreciated that the jumpscares in this movie felt natural and realistic.Mixed for Don't Breathe (2016):
Fede Alvarez decided to take the typical home invasion premise of this movie and subvert the auidence's expectations perfectly and I appreciate that little touch. However, there are certain issues that come with those decisions and it has led to this movie having a very divisive reception among critics and auidences.Negatives for Don't Breathe (2016):
The main issue that comes with those decisions is that there's no one to root for in this movie. Now to be fair, the only character who is actually a good person is the character of Alex played Dylan Minnette, the three other characters in this movie I didn't like any of them. Jane Levy's character of Rocky is a character that I'm mixed on because while I wanted to see both her and her younger sister get away from their addictive mother and her douchebag boyfriend, that doesn't give a reason to rob this blind guy of his money. But at least, Rocky isn't either her ghetto boyfriend Money or the Blind Guy. Money is the worst character in this movie because he not only once but twice almost screwed up two robberies like a stupid idiot, but thankfully he gets himself killed and I was so happy to see that happen. Then, you have Stephen Lang's character of the blind guy, who starts off the movie as this Gulf War Veteran who lost his daughter in a car accident and then it's revealed that he kidnapped Cindy, the woman that accidentally killed his daughter, and then he proceeded to rape and impregnate her with a turkey baster. After that reveal, I immediately wanted to see Rocky kill this dude and take all of his money. And I'm sorry but I don't care if he served in the U. S. Army, lost his daughter in a car accident or that he didn't force himself onto Cindy, rape is still rape and he deserves to die for that reason alone.Overall, Don't Breathe (2016) was a thrilling and tense experience from start to finish and while I can certainly appreciate that Fede Alvarez took some risks with the story, those decisions have divided the reception from the audience. So while I can understand why some people don't like this movie, I had a blast with Don't Breathe (2016).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's fine.,"I was worried that I was in for an obnoxious ""Ha ha! the old veteran is actually pretty formidable you stupid thieving millenials, semper fi!"" kind of movie but it wasn't.The scenes that think they're suspenseful are all very well but they do go one for a while.

Sounds good but I just couldn't bring myself to care,"Some scalawags break into a house to steal an old mans treasure only to find he is blind.
As the title suggests he is not a man to be underestimated.This is a great idea for a movie and it is executed quite well with great production and acting.It didn't really grab my attention though.
For some reason the scenes where the main characters are sneaking around didn't feel tense, it just felt a bit stupid.
The home owner is strong and determined but is definitely no ninja.Worst of all I found it hard to bond with the main characters.
They were set up as anti-heroes with good hearts, stuck in an awful situation, but I just couldn't get passed the fact that they were thieves.I think perhaps in a time where home invasions and burglaries are prevalent in the media and a genuine concern to most homeowners it is hard not to root for the ""bad-guy""Nothing bad -but not much to be excited about either",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...""Don't Breathe"" is a gripping tale of suspense, and had me completely pulled in from beginning to end. Consisting of a primarily no-name cast, other than our rather unique villain, Stephen Lang, everyone played their role to the hilt, making for an immersive, and believable moviegoing experience. This, to me, was the sleeper surprise hit of 2016 - it is dark, yet rich with atmosphere, and I loved every minute of it.Wanting to escape her dead end life in Detroit, Roxanne (or Rocky, as her friends call her) agrees to burglarize houses along with her boyfriend and one other to put away enough money to take her and her little sister away from it all and start a new life in California. When they get a tip on a blind war veteran who supposedly has well over $300,000 stashed away somewhere in his home, it is too good to pass by and they break in hoping to hit the jackpot. What they get instead is a nightmarish night in hell that they won't soon forget ... if they can survive.Every once in a blue moon, a hidden gem like this will just come out of nowhere and grab you and pull you in. Stephen Lang was magnificent in his role and was convincingly formidable, despite being blind. As the story continues on, your paradigm does a complete 180 degree turn and you realize that the victim(s) is not who you thought it was. ""Don't Breathe"" moves along at a good pace and doesn't miss a beat.It was filmed well with good cinematography, use of light, colors, and shadows. It is extremely effective in establishing the mood and keeping you tied to the screen. It is hard to turn your eyes away from this film. I highly recommend it at a solid 8 stars out of 10 - and I am highly anticipating the sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Proof that thrillers can be developed on the cheap,"The emergence of indie suspense-thrillers/horrors in the past few years has not gone unnoticed. And while Blumhouse Productions has virtually owned this genre of late, Screen Gems/Ghost House Pictures had a monster hit with 2016's low-budget 'Don't Breathe.'The premise is simple enough - three young burglars in the metro Detroit area decide to break into a decrepit home of a blind war veteran to steal $300K he was awarded in a settlement following the death of his daughter. What could go wrong here? Well, let's start with the fact that said blind man (Stephen Lang) has basically turned into a dog with a heightened sense of hearing and smell. Of course, things don't start out well for the three bandits (Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto) and they don't get any better as things progress.The reason why 'Breathe' works is because it's so raw and it doesn't try to be some grandiose spectacle. The success of the film relies on the small cast, the setting (i.e., the house) and sound - or lack thereof. These basic elements are enough to captivate audiences when done correctly, and that's why 'Breathe' is what it is. There are enough scenes where you are on the edge of your seat because you know what will likely happen, but it's just a matter of how it will happen. The best part is, a lot of what's expected either doesn't materialize or the plot is a winding road that takes a while for things to actually play out.Sure, there are some part of 'Breathe' that feel a bit cliche. The foreshadowing/harkening back to moments noted earlier in the film, particularly those relevant to Rocky - the female bandit who is motivated to seek a better life for her and her little sister - are blatant and can be seen from a mile away. There are also plenty of ""Seriously?"" moments that just seem ridiculous, but that's also what makes this film so interesting.'Don't Breathe' is proof that you don't need millions upon millions of dollars to create something edgy, smart and thrilling.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Fede Alvarez's film is a pulsating and intense experience, benefited by the director's mastery of the genre and a well-applied range of references and subversions of the genre","Full of surprises, the script, although not shy of some silly conventions - coincidences (such as ammo that closes when convenient), uncomfortable immortalities, clich√©d endings and so on -, is endowed with a simple plot and a rich subtext. There is an atheistic and disbelieving speech in human beings. The art direction is subtle in placing a crucifix imprint on the wall, indicating that the object has been there for some time but has been removed (leaving the imprint). Further on, man opens up his worldly disillusionment by asserting that ""God is a bad joke"" and that He ""does not exist."" His foundation is that, if there were a deity, he would not allow a world with so many evils. There is a likelihood between the drama suffered by the character and her philosophical-religious conclusions - which, evidently, does not justify the atrocity of her actions, the result of a severe psychopathology. It is also in this area that the portrait of human fallibility resides: the four characters have their ""flaws"", there is no exemplary conduct, an aspect that grants them realism and humanity. The blind man starts out as a victim, but the situation is brilliantly reversed, which, on the other hand, fails to make him a villain (at best antagonistic). That is, they are all wrong, even though they may have partially noble motives. They seem like archetypes (the psychopath, the delinquent, the lover and the object-woman), however, there are idiosyncrasies in their personalities that only the vicissitudes of the narrative manage to expose.Also as a subtext there is an association between social marginalization and criminality. Again, it is not a justification for criminal acts, but a logical consequence for the characters. Rocky sees in theft a catapult for the longed for restart in his life in the absence of opportunities. The plot doesn't verticalize as much on Money and Alex, leaving aside their dramatic arcs. As for the first, it is not clear whether the crime is the result of a deviation in character or whether he is driven to this life by social circumstances (more likely, as he is the one who most dominates the ""world of crime"" among the three). Alex's motivation is fragile (easy gain and platonic love for Rocky), and his father's subplot is nebulous. In any case, the ideology of the lack of opportunities is visible as the driving force for committing crimes - in the last analysis, the fallacy of the fullness of meritocracy. For no other reason, the blind man claims that ""rich girls are not arrested."" It is, in short, an incisive social criticism of an intellectual nature.The plot is interesting and creatively reverses roles by introducing us to the criminals, who are the victims here, and the ""poor victim"" beyond the mortal. The claustrophobic and survival situation is a real hell (for the protagonists) who get into a hostile home. This hostility felt in the air at all times is obtained from the use of various filters in the filming of Alvarez, who transforms the house into a bloodthirsty labyrinth. The director has a rare talent for creating sadistic sequences that will leave the viewer at all times on the edge of the chair. The script written by the director and by Rodo Sayagues (Panic Attack!) creates plausible situations, especially for the first and second acts, as well as very well motivated characters, each one acts that way for a reason, from the supporting role to the villain their attitudes they are driven by a well-defined goal. The weak point of the projection is the ending that is very exaggerated compared to everything presented. There is a chase scene in one part of the house that feels like the grand climax. There is, however, a huge sequence of scenes afterwards. The feature has practically four acts, two being pure climaxes. There are also many opportunities to close Don't Breathe in an exemplary manner, but the film extends two or three times longer than it should and ends up delivering a predictable ending, taking the impact of the countless good surprises that occur during the projection.The rhythm of the narrative drives us in a way that generates an increasing and continuous tension. The artifices that built it range from well-fitting and not-so-obvious jumps cares, to not knowing what the next room reveals, nor the characters' attitudes. There is an unease about our feeling towards those figures. The director has fun with the audience leaving us bewildered. Amazing that there are few moments to breathe and it still works. The Dark Man is the typical feature that could be just another exercise in genre, which in fact is with extreme skill, but is not content to be just that.The film could also focus only on this claustrophobic argument, that blind man's house could be any house, in a kind of horror of private life. However, Alvarez locates his story in Detroit, an American city that after years of intense economic growth and that with globalization and industrial decentralization found itself in crisis. Today, Detroit is a city of ruins, collapsed by the physical and moral destruction of the American dream, in its daily demolitions the city becomes an extension of rubble. And it is precisely from these ruins that the characters in Don't Breathe arise, there are no moral roots in the figures that inhabit the universe of the film, ambiguity is the rule for both villains and heroes, who legitimize their faults only for their motivations or by his sadism. In this way, The Dark Man subverts any kind of moralistic thinking possible, there is nothing to judge in what is seen, in that city, in those rubble, there can only be survival.When the film enters the Blind Man's house, another one of Detroit's ruins, the film becomes a journey into fear and violence, that room works almost like a ghost train and Alvarez' camera works as an engineer on that journey. Right from the start, the director conceives a sequence plan that reveals almost all rooms and objects in the house that will serve for the narrative, before the characters themselves, the spectator visits that world, knowing what can be used in favor of the horror that the movie will follow. In this way, Don't Breathe manages to build an environment of tension from the beginning, through the information provided, Alvarez understands that the spectator is privileged and, thus, manipulates their feelings and sensations with knowledge of the plot provided in a purposeful way. In this way, the spectators, together with those characters, share this journey to fear and violence.And it's interesting to note when the only way out of those young people is that man's basement, thus, going to the deepest part of that house is also a dive into that character's maddened mind, it's digging into the more violent and darker side of the blind man. That blind violence, which seeks to repair all the old traumas of that dark being, generates more horror and the only possible way out is to respond in the same way. There is no possible redemption, there is no imaginable peace in that setting, there is not even a light that inhabits that space. It is at this moment that the film presents its heaviest ideas, bordering on extreme violence in the same way that it repudiates eschatology, there Alvarez even dialogues with trash and does very well. Don't Breathe is not a film that makes concessions, that does not seek to please its viewers through easy fright and, thus, remains faithful to its ideas from beginning to end of the plot, being a feature that subverts expectations.Jane Levy (Rocky), Dylan Minnette (Alex) and Daniel Zovatto (Money) are competent in the roles, but who really shines is veteran Stephen Lang as a scary man. With just a few lines, his body language is stark to outline the character: a brutish, unscrupulous, cold, skillful and extremely dangerous man. In his second appearance (the first one is very brief), he seems harmless, not knowing what is going on in his residence, but in a short interval it becomes clear what he is capable of. Calculator, he makes sure to lock the exits from the house (a situation similar to ""The Panic Room"") so that no one escapes. His strength and quick reflexes (the shot on the vibrating cell phone is sensational) surprise, and the actor's work becomes admirable in extreme moments - notably memories of the melancholy past (which made him bitter) and irritation at key moments. It's one of Lang's best interpretations.Don't Breathe still has room to make one think, the horror is never treated as escapism in this feature and perhaps the most frightening moment of the film is the last sequel, which I will not reveal evidently. But it is exactly how a current reality would treat through the media and the like, terror is real and in the ruins of this collapsed civilization there is no room for redemption, nor for heroism. Fede Alvarez's film is a pulsating and intense experience, benefited by the director's mastery of the genre and a well-applied range of references and subversions of the genre that help make this one of the best thrillers of the year it was released.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quite entertaining.,"Three teenagers go around houses stealing valuables to resell them and make a profit. Although of a very young age, their dexterity when committing a robbery is quite remarkable. One day, they decide to go for a bigger pay day and enter the house of an old man who supposedly keeps $300000 in his house. What the three burglars don't know is that this blinded old man used to be a marine and he moves around the house like a cat at night. What should have been a straight forward robbery becomes an run for your life situation, where the marine will hunt them down one by one. The mechanics of the movie do not feel like anything new, and although you can guess a few of the things that will happen throughout, there's enough suspense to keep you entertained till the end.

Hell, I would notice the change in air pressure. It's incredible stupid, so I guess the script was written by toddlers who don't understand how a blind person is put together. Other than that, this is a decent thriller, highten alot by the always menacing Stephen Lang (notice the contact lenses to make him look like some vampyre).

an incredible thriller,"Don't Breathe is a great thriller/horror movie about three buglers who break into the house of a blind man who is not as helpless as seems at first.

It is incredibly entertaining, however, this movie confuses you as to who you should root for at first, but shows a clear antagonist in the end. It is beautifully shot, very well directed and makes for an extremely entertaining focused watch.

A lesson in why crime doesn't pay...,"Don't Breathe follows 3 thieves - Rocky, Alex and Money (surely not their real names?) who make ends meet by breaking in to wealthy homes and stealing. Longing to make enough money to escape their abusive home lives and start afresh, their target becomes the house of a blind man who they know received a huge payout after a rich girl killed his daughter in a car accident. Thinking a blind man will pose zero threat, plus will probably have the cash stashed somewhere, they put their plan into action. They soon find out that not only is the guy a war veteran who has turned his house into a fortress, but he also houses some dark and disturbing secrets...I have to say I thought this film was great. Taking an original premise and making not only the protagonists morally questionable, but also gradually turning the blind man from a helpless victim into, well... quite frankly a disturbing scum bag is a stroke of genius. The film has an awesomly grubby claustrophobic setting and effortlessly oozes atmosphere thanks to the fact that the blind man a) has highly attuned hearing... and b) knows his house inside-out. The slightest noise and he's right there, which makes him terrifyingly efficient, but yet can also be used against him. Add in a few curveballs that you genuinely don't see coming, and this film ticks all the right boxes for a frighteningly great time. Add in some great performanes (especially Stephen Lang as the blind man), and this film becomes extremely easy to recommend. Get it watched!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good concept done right,"A group of robbers invades the house of an former US Navy SEALS man, now completely blind from his war injuries, to steal his cash. Things go south when the seemingly fragile man turns out to be a skilled defender of his property.Our unfortunate group is a stereotypical trio made of Money (the douchebag), Rocky (the cute girl with terrible family problems), and Alex (the good guy that invades houses because he loves Rocky.) The former SEAL is an old man we will call Mr. Blind-Man.I like that this movie portraits Mr. Blind-Man, at first, as a fragile innocent dude. Turns out he is one skilled _sonofaB_ that will do anything to protect his goods. Lang's acting is great. To be fair, the overall acting is great.The horror element is present because we are in constant darkness. Each sound seems like a scream echoing right into Mr. Blind-Man's ear, and we know that he will pop up at any minute from the darkness. Not much in terms of gore and you get a few jump-scares, but they are done right. What is disturbing is this situation could be real, although, of course, I don't think even someone not blind could subdue 3 or more robbers at once.The plot gets a nice twist once you discover one dark secret.In the end, I think the only problem is no on is likeable. No one is the bad guy or the good guy. So you really don't care about what will happen. Also, Alex's character development is unexplored, leaving some holes towards why he is doing what he does in the first place, when everyone else seems to have a sort of reasonable explanation to it.One minor thing: the ""don't breathe"" title is cool, but not explored that much in the movie, although you do get some visual hints. One better title, as it is the Brazilian title, is definitely ""The man in the dark.""

Don't you dare breathe,"The film starts off a bit slower as we get a bit of character development for our trio of protagonists. ""Don't Breathe"" takes the home invasion subgenre and twists it into something I don't think any of us were ready for. The atmosphere of the film is incredibly tense, despite this being my second viewing I still found myself in a constant state of apprehension and almost duplicating the actors reactions by trying to stay quiet without exhaling a single breathe. The cinematography is fantastic, especially the scenes where the lights are out and the burglars struggle to make their way through the pitch black darkness of the house. Intensifying this uneasiness is an extremely unsettling score full of distressing sound effects courtesy of Spanish composer Roque Ba√±os L√≥pez.""Don't Breathe"" has a relatively small kill count for a horror film but that doesn't hinder it at all. The film excels at creating tension filled moments and has an incredibly bleak tone. I won't mention any of the deaths here but there is a turkey baster scene that is sure to make you scream.

"Good story, really bad character design","There are 4 main characters in the movie excluding the blind home owner other 3 characters are the most classical and boring characters everRocky: Hot girl dating handsome meathead
Alex: Loser nerd in love with hot girl
Money: meathead dating hot girlAnd thats it. Nothing less nothing more. No character developement what so ever, no deep background stories to make us feel for characters.Good Side is the story excluding characters is pretty well-written and has plot twists. Does a good job keeping you on your toes. Sometimes I realised I was holding my breath with characters as well.
So in general is it a must watch? No.
Is it a waste of time? Not really.

What?,"I am not a film critic. I do not pretend to be. Nor do I care. When I watch a movie I expect either entertainment or an interesting original artistic view into the human soul or mankind's history. Bottom line: it has to be fun or memorable to be worth watching. Otherwise it is a waste of time at best and poison the mind at worst.This film is neither fun, nor memorable. It is a waste of time and a bitter pill.This film is a tortured effort for a deep drama-thriller and is a massive fail. Its attempt to create some form of a moral is ludicrous. People with unhinged and nasty fantasies wrote it and put it together. No offense to Alvarez but I have no respect for his work. While keeping up with the secrets of the trade the characters are unrealistic, unsympathetic, and the ""glamorous"" ending, which contains a twist, does not make sense. You will be on the edge of your seat not because of suspense but because of disgust. As in all ridiculous contemporary films out of Hollywood, which makes 95% of them vulgar and deprave sexuality seems to be the way to entertain.There were no good guys -- all bunch of criminal scumbags. The chick's cheesy dream to go surfing in California with her sister is just too clich√© and ridiculous. I just could not sympathize with any of the characters. Art is the ability to compress in two hours a story which will show you life and will make you ponder. Forget about it with this flick. You'll be happy that it's over and sorry that you started it.If you want to watch a film of high artistic quality, totally unpretentious, based on true events, watch Gruz 200 (Cargo 200, 2007, director Alexei Balabanov). No Hollywood gimmicks and an absolute horror. With absolutely minimalist use of gore. Watch and compare.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A movie you may not remember later...But is a gem in the moment.,"I went to a screening of this film last night, not expecting anything or having any prior knowledge about the film. I have to say, the overall experience was an enjoyable one, albeit, not one I would remember through the ages. In fact, the moment the film ended and the more I thought over it, the less likable it seemed to get. At first, I blamed it on the insanely high standard Hollywood has set for movies and TV in this day and age that it seemed to have stolen away the light this movie deserves. But then I realized something that would be a lot helpful for those wanting to see this movie: Do not take this movie too seriously. This home invasion genre film serves as a well shot, neatly written and decently acted addition to a lineup of predictable, boring movies. Don't Breathe manages to satisfy moviegoers by avoiding genre- traps that would've ultimately changed the entire narrative of this review, and for that it gets special recognition! Got some time on your hand? Give this movie a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Perfect directing and tension thriller. I missed something, but it was great","Imagination to use every single way to create tension through the movie in every single scene (once the action starts).The movie is short and doesn't try to do more than it should. And that's not a bad thing, and makes the movie really good, but also doesn't make it a 10.There are some twists (little twists), and the first one comes too early. The characters are beyond shallow, which again, it doesn't ""really"" matter, but could've used just a bit more depth. There is no point, really. Not even a thin one.Saw: Revenge; Serial Killer with an ideology; Irony of life (survives a suicide attempt, yet the cancer can't be cured).
Last House on the Left; Spit over your Grave: Over the top Revenge against sexual crimes.

Don't Breathe: Walking on egg shells,"My, the period 2013-2017 has been great for horror movies! With this, the Conjuring 1&2, Babadook, It follows, Lights Out and Get Out among another have really stood out as well as raising the bar for horror writing and acting. I am so happy that this is the case. If this trend continues maybe more people will take horror more seriously as an art form. Who knows maybe one will get a best picture Oscar soon?Don't Breathe centres around three thieves. Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money ( Daniel Blanco) who for a number of different reasons want to get enough money to improve their lives. Rocky in particular wants to leave her abusive parents with her younger sister in the hopes of a better life. The answer to all of their prayers seems to come in the form of robbing a blind man's (Stephen Lang) house which supposedly has enough money to solve all their troubles. However once inside the house the blind man as it turns out is not as helpless as he looks.....Don't breathe takes full advantage of the claustrophobic set of a small, cramped decrepit house. You feel that every corner could result in death; the tiniest creek of a floor board might help the blind man hunt down the three. Director Fede Alvarez takes every opportunity to make the viewer feel on the edge of their seat, make you feel the stress the characters are experiencing knowing how the smallest sound might kill them. Because of this the film has a terrific atmosphere.The acting too is fantastic, everyone is not only believable in their roles but are able to show just how scared they are when they find themselves in over their head. Alex, Money and Rocky are stupid either and despite their chosen profession are likeable to an extent. Even the Blind man is sympathetic to an extent, even if his motives are questionable. The idea of not making noise to survive is really cleaver and further contributes to some incredibly intense moments, the film again does not waste any of the material the concept has.I would say that, without going into any spoilers the story suffers from unnecessarily complexity. If the film had just been about the three escaping the house but it adds story elements that at least I feel are not really needed and detracts from the pacing. However it is very personal and I doubt most would be bothered by this.As a horror movie Don't Breathe is a thrilling watch, as a piece of film making it is a very well made film. I would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An entertaining, horror thrill ride","If you're in the mood for a good movie and just looking to have some fun, Don't Breathe will leave you satisfied. Is it one of the best horror films ever? Not at all. But it is a new fresh take on the genre in 2016 and among the most memorable in recent years.It is along the lines and reminded me of the Final Destination movies. That's not a spoiler and not to say it's anything similar at all in plot, but it has that fun type of horror-thriller combination with young characters that it had.The great thing about movies like Don't Breathe is that you can't go wrong if you just are looking for entertainment instead of diving into anything that you might not be in the mood for. While the film contains a few major plot holes, it makes up for them quickly and within a few seconds, you forget about them.Horror is not my genre, but every now and then I run into a good one, and Don't Breathe is good.

A very tense and progressive modern horror film,"Don't Breathe""You would be surprised what a man is capable of once he realizes there is no god."" - The Blind Man.A very tense and progressive modern horror film, which I enjoyed this film very much for several reasons.The first I would say that it has a unique narrative in which you don't really know who's side is the right one, if either are. The film is about 3 young adults who are going to break into a blind man's home and steal his $300,000 left to him. So immediately you think you are on the side of the villains. But once things get going the morality shifts and changes throughout giving lots of twists and turns and so you don't really know where the film is going despite it being based completely in one place.The 2nd reason I liked this film was the camera work, it was quite experimental it seemed because of the unique shots and the ways they were captured, for example when the kids first broke in there was a sequence in which they were all looking around on the 1st floor with the camera moving from one character to another in one long continuous segment. The colour grading was gritty but beautiful giving a mostly green tint overall which could possibly suggest envy because the blind man has what these kinds do not which is money but the kids have sight, youth and hope which he does not. It could also symbolise the old famous 'It's not easy being green' expression as they are in his territory which is the only place he does not feel banished from or unwelcome. But whatever the reason for this vibrantly asserted colour it was quite nice on the eyes.I liked the characters to an extent despite them not being particularly likable. None of the characters in this film have much to like about them but the film did not dwell too much on their back story it sealed up what they are about in about 10 minutes and got right to the nitty gritty which I think was a good idea.To me the core of this movie was about the suspense and the morality, it was very tense at times where you cannot tell what is going to happen and who is going to strike next, shifting the roles of protagonist and antagonist frequently, and if I am honest I was routing for both sides and neither throughout, which was a fascinating experience because this was a completely different take on the house invasion theme. One aspect of the story I did not think was fully developed was the story of the 'ladybug tattoo'. This could have been more meaningful to the story and the character of Rocky but in the end did not seem to have much point to it.I give this modern, unique, suspense horror a 7.5 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Surprising,"I had no idea who had written/directed/produced this film. It had been advertised for years (seeing as it came out nearly ten years ago) and upon realising there was a sequel, I thought I had better dive in before i'm too far behind.What a surprise this film was. I haven't seen a horror/thriller like this, done this well, in quute some time. So long that off the top of my head I can't recall anything that falls into the same category as this.A few films have been truly disturbing a la Green Inferno. Others that have shown great ingenuity like Escape Room. But rarely does a film possess both elements.This has it all wrapped up in a not so neat, fairly destroyed house in a secluded and quiet neighborhood. Everyone turns in an amazing performance. Even the dogs are on point.The entire premise of this film is considerably thought-provoking. There are no good guys and truly i was rooting for no one. A new twist behind everydoor.Its like being in a funhouse of death, or an escape room, so to speak. When the credits rolled and I saw the people behind this film i thought: damn, no wonder.No wonder this film was so bloody good. I'm ot sure if they can recapture the magic of this film with the sequel but I aim to find out.Entertainment Value 10/10 -

"Watch the amazing first two-thirds, then go home and read the synopsis.","I watched this movie because Chris Stuckmann reviewed it so enthusiastically, and I generally like his horror recommendations. Short version: I left the screening disappointed.The movie starts out great. The premise alone is very interesting: Burglars break into a blind man's house, but he's not as easy a target as they thought. It's a brilliant and promising idea that is handled exceptionally during the first two-thirds of the movie.The movie is exceptional up to that point. The acting is perfect, the directing is precise and adds to the tension, the music is very good and avoids most of the horror clich√©s, pretty much everything works. So where did it go wrong?Well, there is a part that feels a lot like the climax of the movie that comes in a bit too early. It's also a great climax. But then the movie kind of restarts, for no reason whatsoever, no explanation, and it gets boring, repetitive, and almost laughable (many audience members were groaning from a point on, although they were loud and annoying throughout the entire movie).The last half hour feels like a mediocre (but not too clich√©, to be fair) horror movie. Like they run out of ideas and just tried to fill in a proper runtime. The movie clocks in at just 88 minutes, so it seems very probable to me. And then there's an extra sequence after a cut to black, right at the end, that also feels unnecessary.So, to sum up, my recommendation is to leave when you start getting annoyed (no spoilers but, trust me, you'll know what I'm talking about), then leave and read the synopsis if you want closure. Or make up your own ending. But spare your time and don't bother with the last half hour. It ruins the rest of the movie, which is easily a 9/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
You Almost Can't At Times. 8.5/10,"Don't Breathe is a very intense movie. It has some flaws, but regardless, it is a chilling and worthwhile film for anyone who enjoys the horror genre.The plot follows some teenagers who are bored with their life in Michigan (my home state, in fact.) To entertain themselves, they strategically break into houses and steal money and valuables.One day, they decide to break into a blind veteran's home and steal his fortune. However, the blind man can hear them, and thus begins his chase to kill all 3 of them for their crime of breaking and entering.There is much to praise about Don't Breathe. For one thing, the title is accurate, because it's so scary that you sometimes can't breathe due to the terror. (Although, the title refers to how the teens try to be silent to be unheard.)Stephen Lang also gives a powerful performance as The Blind Man. While I might prefer his acting in Gettysburg and Gods and Generals, this was very good nonetheless. The teens are decent as well, but Lang's performance is the outshining one.The movie's budget was just under $10 million, and while it does look a little cheap, it doesn't look bad. Compared to some faith based movies with the same budget, this is well shot.The movie is also engaging. While most of it takes place at the Blind Man's house, and the movie runs under 90 minutes, the place goes by decently, and it ends before you know it, save for a couple of slow parts.That gets me into my flaws. Despite its brief runtime, it does seem slow at times, like in the first few minutes.Also, there is the typical ""why would you do that?"" horror movie logic. For example, one teenage girl tries to get rid of a dog near the car window. She tries to stop the dog by trapping him in the trunk of the car with her. Yeah, great way to get rid of the dog, girl.Regardless, if you are a fan of horror movies, I highly recommend Don't Breathe for its horror elements and Lang's performance. It's not quite one of my favorite horror movies, but it's a very well made one nonetheless. Just be warned- you truly can't breathe at times.Happy Halloween.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The right house, but an underestimated person!","It's a great comeback for the director after his first film, 'Evil Dead' remake had got a mixed response. This film might feel very familiar to you if you have got a good knowledge of the B movies. It was still a very refreshing and very thrilling. The film was short, because there were none segments wasted, it comes to the point quickly. I mean the event, because the story was a one liner, but the event was what this film based on.Three youngsters who rob the houses when the people are out, mark their new target on a blind war veteran. But when it does not go as they have planned, they find trapped inside his house. Struggling to escape from there, they also get so close to what they had come for. Though it becomes a suicidal, and left without any option, what's next for them and the result of their attempt is what becomes the film's conclusion.Really a great effort. Almost a one night based theme with the limited cast. The title is not just what the film revolves, it also for us to hold breath while watching it and most probably sitting on the edge of our seat throughout. But I'm very disappointed with many flaws, or maybe you can say those unexplained stuffs. Like the end seems very silly, because there were lots of evidence to prove the film character had committed a crime, but easily got out. Likewise there are many more, but the film does not explain and I believe there are sure reasons behind them.The writers did not care to waste time on those, because they wanted only a thriller, a non-stop one and they got one. Now it is going to be remade in Kollywood and also a sequel was announced. I expected that when I saw the ending. Maybe, a prequel, though sequel seems more interesting idea after what happened in this. Surely one of the best thriller of the year, so make sure you watch it soon.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Flawed Characters Face out in this Tension Filled Film,"This film is one that I'm not entirely sure what drew me to it. It was either for my sister or I was starting to do year-end lists. It actually could have been thanks to podcasts as well. Regardless, I sought this out right after it came to DVD. I enjoyed that first viewing. It also shocked me where it went. I'm now giving it a rewatch so I can see the sequel in the theater with Jaime. It is also on the Podcast Under the Stairs Summer Challenge for the 2010s as well.We start with a man walking down a street, dragging a woman by her hair. We see them from above and it makes it tough to make out who either of them are. This image will be revisited later as we figure out what is going on. It then shifts to someone entering a door and an alarm tries to trigger. Before it goes off someone steps in front of it to disarm it with the code. We have three young people who are robbing the place. There is Rocky (Jane Levy). Her boyfriend is a jerk and goes by Money (Daniel Zovatto). There is another guy as well, Alex (Dylan Minnette). They have strict rules to not take cash and what they steal has to be under a certain amount. We also learn that Alex's father works for the security company.As they're leaving, we learn that Rocky and Money are saving up to move to California. Alex has a crush on Rocky, but can't leave his father behind. From there we see that Rocky has good reason to want to leave. Her mother isn't great and she is worried about her younger sister growing up in this environment.Money then meets with a man in a van who tells him about a score. They will have to break their rule, but there is a blind man who lives in a house in an isolated neighborhood. He won a settlement when his daughter was struck by a car. It is supposed to be upward of a million dollars. Alex states he doesn't want any part of it and goes home. He does have a change of heart and wants to help out of Rocky as well as go with her west.They canvass the house.. There are a bunch of abandoned buildings around it for blocks. The backdoor has multiple locks on it and they have a remote that will turn off the alarm system. There is a dog and they give it a drug to put it to sleep. They soon realize this guy doesn't even trust his security company. There are more locks than they have keys to. There is a door into the basement, but it is locked from the inside. Levy sees a window that is small, she thinks that she can get through it. She goes in, giving them access to the house.As they search around the house, they don't find anything. Money goes up to the room where the blind man sleeps, he is portrayed by Stephen Lang. A smoke bomb of sorts is used to put him to sleep. It doesn't work as they planned though. The blind man is drawn downstairs by Money trying to get into the basement, thinking the money is down there. Being blind might be a handicap, but it doesn't make him any less dangerous. It becomes a fight for survival to get out of the house before it is too late.That will be where I leave my recap for the movie. Where I want to start is that I think Fede Alvarez, who co-wrote and directed this, has an interesting idea we are playing with here. What makes this movie different is that we have Rocky who we feel bad for. She is stealing as there isn't much for her in Detroit. Her homelife is rough and she doesn't have much in the way of options. She also is dating Money who reminds me of men her mother would date. Alex is the better option, but she might never realize it. I like that we have this trio who are stealing from the rich. They're doing something bad, but they also become our heroes.Going from that idea, I like that we are blurring the lines of who is good and who is bad. I've laid our thieves. In the start, you think we have a helpless blind man. He attacks Money, but he is an unlikable character. I think we are supposed to feel for Rocky and Alex. This is even more so with what is found in the basement. To reiterate, we are blurring the lines of who is good and who is bad. Plus we are looking at, how much of the bad can we take?To dive a bit deeper into the blind man. Having him be unable to see puts him at a disadvantage. What I like though is that we are in his house. He knows where everything is and what is out of place. This is even better in the basement when the lights are turned off. The blind man is a military veteran. If he could see, he would just kill everyone with no problems. I like here that by taking away his sight, it weakens him. His smell and hearing are enhanced which makes for an interesting aspect.Since I've delved into the characters, I'll go to the acting. Lang is perfect for this role. The first thing I saw him in was Avatar. This character here feels similar to that in that we have a hardened soldier. He is slightly sympathetic in that I feel bad for him as to what happened to his daughter and what happened to the person that hurt her. How far he goes though isn't good and makes him the true villain. Levy is great as Rocky. I like her and glad that she got her start really in horror. I hope she comes back to the genre. Minnette is good as well. I dislike Zovatto, but I think that is what he is going for with his character so it works. The rest of the cast fit for what was needed.The other part that I wanted to go into would be the cinematography, effects and the soundtrack. For the former, I think they do some great things there. We get some interesting camera angles and movements. If anything, I think it does get a bit heavy-handed with foreshadowing. I can live with that though. I like simulating the darkness though with characters. It makes it feel like how the blind man handles things. The effects can be brutal at times, I think they work. The blood has good color and consistency. Other than that, much like with how things are shot, I love the use of sounds. A gunshot goes off by a character and their hearing goes out. It is realistic. The rest of the soundtrack also works for what was needed.So then in conclusion here, this is a solid movie. I liked it the first time that I saw it and it still holds up for me. There are some aspects to the story that don't work for me. What does work though are establishing these flawed characters and seeing the story play out. I think the acting works there. The cinematography is well done along with the effects and the soundtrack. For me, this is a good movie. I'll probably not go higher than that, but it works for me for what it is.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Good Thriller,"First of all, in a year that not much productive for movie sector up to me, this movie is absolutely worth to go movie house. Don't Breathe is a good thriller that it's tension never falls. As watching the movie, sometimes you feel like you are not supposed to breathe as it's name. You will never got bored when watching this movie. When considered that three young people can't get out of a blind man's house, there some illogical points at this movie. But thanks to it's nondecremantal tempo, you can ignore most of these. As a fan of Sam Raimi, it is very happy to see him as a producer of this movie. Also Fede Alvarez did a good job as a director.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Simple, intense, gory and well packaged. Best enjoyed with pop-corn in your hand and brains in your pocket.","What works is its simplistic premise, short run-time coupled with breakneck pacing, unexpected twists and overall intensity. It sure has a recipe for a slick and gory B movie which can be actually enjoyed when watched lazily. But once you start putting a little brain to it, the whole thing crumbles like a pack of cards - a result of gaping holes in its plot, continuity issues, manipulative screenplay and hypocritical character morals.Rocky (Jane Levy) and Money (Daniel Zovato) are a couple who along with Alex (Dylan Minnette) are small time burglars preying on empty rich houses. Money comes across a tip about an old & blind ex-military guy (Stephen Lang) living in an isolated house and sitting on some substantial money that he got as a compensation for his daughter's death in an accident. Their standard modus operandi is to go unarmed, when nobody is at home and just steel valuables and no cash - enforced by Alex considering the legal implications if they get caught. Will the blind guy become too much to handle for these experienced burglars where they have broken all their set rules? It is slickly made, highly focused and maintains necessary intensity throughout. However it over-glorifies a blind man's capabilities even in his turf where 3 relatively intelligent and healthy youngsters couldn't tackle him. A typical thriller movie screenplay is designed to play with the audience's train of thought (remember the climax of 'Silence of the Lambs') and this movie too has many such moments - but overuse of them could feel a little manipulative which is the case here. The self-righteous subplot that occurs in the basement is contrived which is followed by a hypocritical climax where the surviving member of the gang feels dismayed upon knowing that the blind man got away while they themselves opted for much worse choices in their life. So the empathy or sympathy just goes out of the equation leaving you no character to root for - I am fine with it but I think most of the audience looks for one.Coming to the good points, if not in retrospect - one would find this movie to be an excellent thriller which is more than good enough. The objective of a movie is to provide entertainment when being watched - which it does. The actors are competent and there are moments where Stephen Lang brings depth to the blind man's character with very minimal dialogues that makes you more drawn into it. The relentless pacing hardly lets the audience a moment to process before the next twist or a jump-out-of-your-seat thrill pops up. It works mostly for the unexpected surprise in terms of how well it is directed despite its linear, simple but bumpy script.Simple, intense, gory and well packaged. Best enjoyed with pop-corn in your hand and brains in your pocket.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A thriller for the ages,"A wild ride from beginning to end. To start off, and nothing is revealed here, there are no good guys in this story. As witnessed in the trailers, we are watching three thieves and a man with a dark secret (via locked up girl in the basement seen in the trailer). As an audience, we get pulled in all kinds of directions to find a side to pick throughout the film and this was awesome for me... There are no brakes applied to the ""thriller"" concept of this film. This one is intense and violent from the get go and it presents frequent ""wtf"" moments over and over... Beyond the story and elements of the film, I have to give appreciation to the cinematography, score, and sound effects (or lack of). The film places the audience in a state of suspense with the way it goes completely silent and, at times, only allows the sound of light breathing come through the speakers. Creating an absolutely chilling experience.One of the best films of the year for me. Suspenseful and chilling from beginning to end. Highly recommended.--Oberrated--",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Best Original Movie Of The Year,"The most difficult was not enter the movie theater, the most difficult is to get out alive from it. From the second one to eighty-eight minute: this is the amount of time you will be suffocated - literally, holding the breath - within the asphyxiate and perturbing home invasion of one of the greatest of modern horror, Fede Alvarez. He is proudly latino, Alvarez managed a swift leap to the prodigious Hollywood by means of a sci-fi short uploaded on Youtube in 2009 called ""Panic Attack!"", basic but supreme posed an invasion of robots in Montevideo, Uruguay. A few weeks later, Ghost House Pictures proposed him to direct the coveted remake of ""Evil Dead"", colossal work considered as the official feature film debut of the talented director within the American film. After the high expectations that he reaped after the almost perfect cinematic experience in 2013, the Uruguayan gets into the field of the thriller genre for obfuscate us with a suggestion as simple as complex, a cult film and a clear sign that the brilliant and original minds still exist.From dark first shot in style of 'flashforward', with a slow descent in high-angle towards the focus of attention, ""Don't Breathe"" promises a well-measured ferocious adventure intelligent enough to delight both fans of the genre and adrenaline junkies with psychological and physical horror that will leave you submerged in a catatonic state approximately for the rest of your life. Without the need of an intricate dialogue and subplots which do not give novel anything to the story, the introduction of the main leads happens in the blink an eye, a couple of scenes that will have significant weight along the footage and we are already in, no exit. A young trio with different personal motivations perpetrate private properties of the wealthy during the summer months, despite these do not lead to much significance since they do so without committing a truly grave criminal-offense. With the condition that this will be their last burglary, because of the economic magnitudes that this entails, the burglars break into the desolate dwelling of a military veteran in Detroit - known only as the Blind Man -, a city that has been affected by social and economic turmoils, the perfect ghost town to run a robbery. After they are inside the house, a storm of unexpected events occur uncontrollably, proving that in the land of dark, the blind man is king.With a script conceived by Fede Alvarez and his recurring collaborator Rodo Sayagues, the film deliberately slips away between personal boundaries of each character to gradually reveal who are the real preys. The narrative standards of this duo do not have moderation, nor imaginative standstills because they leverage each minor opportunity for disturb with professionalism and natural exertion. The curiosity by seeing the final result of a premise so simple and nothing muddled perverted my mind, and indeed, this is a genuine work of the suspense and horror. As a fan of the genre, it is a categorical conviction to see the unforeseen resurgence of original ideas to temporarily revitalize the harassed and wasted world of horror, though, there is no doubt that both the simplicity and efficacy of ""Don't Breathe"" will cynically be emulated in future films.The continuous use of space is vital energy to join us with the setting of the story. Just as its argumentative aspect, the film insinuates us the idea of having a limited geography about the house, nonetheless, Alvarez and his team find ways to make the viewers aware of the claustrophobic impasses inside the abode. From the beginning, the camera movement makes specific focuses to key places or elements for the plot - as we will see later -, in order to situate ourselves in the sinister and colorless environment of the basement, lounge, closet or air ducts.For the stifling and oppressive atmosphere were indispensable two fundaments with excellent finishes. Roque Ba√±os is the Spanish author responsible for the tense soundtrack that accompanies the second primordial characteristic, photography. Pedro Luque - also Uruguayan - prettifies masterfully the spaces of the setting with components well measured such as lighting, brightness enhancement, suffocating camera angles and limited special effects. As you will surely remember, the chase scene in the pale dark, something in neo- noir style, without a doubt, one of the most awesome of the year since in the land of the dark, the blind man reigns and now each human being with its five senses will be more prone than the trained blind man.""Don't Breathe"" takes control of each visual and narrative help at its disposal, it does not worry about to please critical spectators because it unintentionally does. The best original film of the year runs an intriguing narrative, a great-looking survival structure, tremendous innovations for the horror genre that will keep you glued to the screen and the constant improvement of a new combination of film genres (""Green Room"" & ""10 Cloverfield Lane""). Relentless, unique, simple and concise, terrifying, impressive, allegorical, gloomy, intimidating, suffocating. Fede Alvarez owed us a perfect cinematic experience after ""Evil Dead"", ""Don't Breathe"" is it, pure film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Amazing thriller.,"Don't Breathe has one of the most interesting ideas for a movie I've seen in a long time, and it doesn't fail to provide a good movie to go along with it. The characters, story, and twists could have used some work in my opinion, especially nearing the half-way mark, but it didn't take away too much from the rest of the movie since scene structure and pacing were done so well. Despite being classified under the horror genre, I found it to be less scary and more suspenseful than anything else. If does a great job of setting the atmosphere, and making the audience feel connected to the characters. All in all, Don't Breathe is a very well made horror/thriller that I don't think people are going to forget about any time soon.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A old-fashioned and eerie thriller that is bound to leave you breathless,"Now this is what I'm talking about. ""Don't Breathe"" is a simple, but very energetic home-invasion horror thriller that has chills and thrills. Plus, no cheap jump scares found here, just pure horror done the good old-fashioned way. And it also provides a few twists that are so shocking, they will leave you speechless. This is Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez's follow-up to the ultra-gory, but stylish and thrilling ""Evil Dead"" remake. Here, he takes a more relaxed approach with less gore and more storytelling. Set in Detroit, the movie follows Rocky (Jane Levy), a young girl who is trying to get herself and her little sister out of here, along with her boyfriend Money (It Follows' Daniel Zovatto). Rocky's friend is Alex (Dylan Minnette from last year's ""Goosebumps""), whose dad works at one of those security companies. Their plan to end all plans, of course, is to rob the house of a blind man who has a huge sum somewhere and they will be on their way. It turns out that this blind man known as ""The Blind Man"" (Stephen Lang) is a war veteran and is a lot more skilled than they think he is. He knows every corner, frame and room of this house and he is certainly not afraid to strike. But he also has a few things lurking in that house. Now, this is where I stop, because the rest I want you to see for yourself. The way how this movie was designed is through the old-fashioned techniques that most filmmakers haven't used in a while. Alvarez uses tracking shots, sound and a great deal of foreboding to keep us on our toes and to make our hairs stand on end. Credit must given to cinematographer Pedro Luque, production designer Naaman Marshall and three editors for knowing how to pull us in through style, substance and restraint. It also features one of the best scores I've heard since ""Gone Girl"" and that is the unsettling and eerie score courtesy of Roque Banos, who seem to have taken a few pages from the Reznor/Ross guidebook. I think one of the most memorable characters ever created in my opinion is ""The Blind Man"". Stephen Lang, who has played villains before, makes this character subtly effective and very terrifying. He doesn't say a lot (nor does he should), but with those piercing eyes, a magnetic presence and the way he walks with no mercy and no fear, Lang carries this challenging task on his shoulders and runs with it. There's no need to question his loyalties, because you can't tell if these characters are good or bad. Jane Levy, who worked with Alvarez on ""Evil Dead"" and gave such a fearless performance in that film is even more convincing this time. She and Dylan Minnette are great at conveying fears with their eyes and trying not to make any sounds while walking in the dark. I'm certainly not going to forget this movie. I haven't reacted to a film this stunning since David Fincher's ""Panic Room"". Both films do give a very claustrophobic feel of what's it like to be trapped in a house. But ""Don't Breathe"" gets the upper hand because someone knows how to take that fear and cranks it up to 11. You never know what you're going to expect and you don't know how it is going to turn out, but it takes a big dive and it's not afraid to go all out. Here's a very subtle response from me: It's bound to leave you breathless.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
DHKR: Don't Breathe,"Don't Breathe is actually a really unique kind of horror movie that delivers what it advertises, and then some. Even if some of the extra stuff is kinda...out there for most viewers.No Spoilers here, just recovered from a bad head cold, and I'm just getting back to writing reviews on here. All you need to know is the movie works well as a scary movie, much like last year's The Witch. And for those who have not seen that particular film, The Witch was a scary movie that was more aligned on the darker themes rather than the terrifying being itself. It felt less like a modern scary movie, and more like a very dark drama that just so happened to be about a witch.Don't Breathe is pretty much like that; a very dark movie with themes of revenge, that just so happens to have a presence that's scary. In this movie's case, a psychopathic, blind Gulf War veteran simply known as ""The Blind Man"".The plot is pretty simple for most horror fare. Three teenagers who expertly rob the houses in their dying neighborhood learn of the Blind Man's fortune, about 30,000 USDs, and presume to break in at night, believing it to be easy. However, they soon find out that this supposedly ""easy"" target is anything but, and one of the kids gets shot and killed off by the Blind Man. Soon, the movie turns into a game of cat and mice, as the remaining two thieves have to find the money and get out, before getting killed themselves by the psychotic war vet.The movie goes out of its way to be as dark and original as it can with it's premise, and it well succeeds in that regard. The victim characters are set up as punish rogues with good hearts(at least two of the three are), which at least make them more sympathetic than the usual kind of idiots. The Blind Man is also set up as a sympathetic villain from the start, but that gets turned up on it's head after an actually well kept twist that I dare not spoil to those interested. The claustrophobic feel of each scene, combined with the super-senses that the villain has makes for some extremely tense moments that will leave you in a cold sweat.I wish I could continue on, but I can't without spoiling some good twists. Go and watch the movie, and experience the horror yourselves.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"great movie, possible spoilers","Like I said this was a great movie. One of the best I've seen in quite awhile, of any genre. Lets get one thing straight though. this is NOT a horror movie. There's no monsters, aliens,weird looking humans, or zombies. Its a thriller and a damn good one. The character build up is quite good.But once we get into the meat of the story after about 15 min. in, the tension is non stop. I won't go into details but they're easy enough to find here and on you tube but suffice it to say these kids haven't got a clue what they've got themselves into. Fede Alvarez did a great job on the whole movie with the tension but especially the ending(s).

"Decent, but nothing very memorable","It's far from a disaster, but far from as great as many critics say- Don't Breathe is a fine horror film with an interesting concept and unfortunately not much more. I have a lot of problems with this film, first being that the pacing is all over the pace. With a 90 minute runtime I expected most of the film to be a slow burn as the 3 characters delve into the blind man's house- but it's a lot messier than that. There is almost too much needless exposition and a lot of scenes just prove to be too dragged out to be any fun in terms of suspense and thrills. That being said, there certainly isn't a total lack of scares in this film, it has its moments of intensity- but hardly anything particularly memorable. The acting is rather decent for the most part, but Stephen Lang as the Blind Man is absolutely fantastic and truly proved to be my favorite thing about the movie by its end. Its cinematography is also pretty well done at times as well as its score. In the end, Don't Breathe is disappointing, but a fine movie nevertheless. Given some extra time and dedication, it could have made more of its interesting premise, but instead it's just another concept lead horror movie that has its moments.My Rating: 6.1/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't watch alone,"Director Fede Alvarez demonstrated some potent skills in 2013 remake of Sam Raimi's classic 'Evil Dead', showing an solid balance of over-the-top gore and spine-chilling scares. Though the dark humor factor from Sam Raimi's entry was mostly absent, it not only made for an astoundingly terrifying experience from beginning to end, but fostered strong nightmarish visuals that made Sam Raimi's installment a true scare fest. This gripping thriller sees Fede Alvarez continuing his journey of brood, white-knuckle thrills with a brilliantly crafted plot and nightmarish atmosphere that is bound to leave even the bravest of the bunch leaning at the edge of their seats. While the movie isn't terribly original or groundbreaking in any sense, it knows how to deliver the scares effectively and smartly. This film follows three teenagers: Alex (played by Dylan Minnette), Rocky (played by Jane Levy), and her boyfriend Money (played by Daniel Zavotto), growing up in the poor streets of Detroit, who make money off of committing robbery hoping to make enough money to leave town and move to California. When they across an old rundown house, they not only discover it's holding of a $300,000 cash donation he received following the death of his daughter but learn the house is owned by an old blind Vietnam War veteran (played by Stephen Lang). Using his blindness as a perfect opportunity, the trio breaks in to and take a run for the money. Unfortunately, they learn the man is not as helpless as he appears and soon pitted in a violent fight for survival.If you are someone who is easily scared in horror flicks, then you are in for a perfect treat because this one 88-minute piece almost never lets you rest easy; especially when sitting under the loud surround sound at the theaters. From the opening minutes of the robbery to the end, this film pits you in a dark, eerie atmosphere where suspense is around every corner and not limited to an ominous music score to tune up the suspense. And the scariest part is it takes almost entirely in one house, and mostly during the nighttime. The suspense is generated not through the effective lighting, but also with a powerful music score by Roque Banos. The music score is effective at capturing the sheer intensity of the scenes during the the characters' encounters with the old man. But the films is quite fair at not overlying on the ominous music to keep the suspense in tune, and thanks to Fede Alavarez's strong execution some of the scares work even without support of the heavy music. A good example lies in a scene the living room when the characters try to escape from the old man (who's blind) but must overcome the creepiness of the floorboards that disturb hearing. The man's ability of head comes to a great advantage above his lack of sight in many scenes. There's over a handful of jump scares that come when you least expect it, some of which involve a vicious dog; and plenty of scenes destined to make viewers with claustrophobia uncomfortable. From the frightening visuals and low lighting, these scenes are deeply unnerving, but definitely not without the solid performances by Dylan Minnette, Jane Levy, and Daniel Zovatto. These three are undeniably convincing in their roles and make for some interesting characters. While these characters are a bit gray in the moral compass that makes some a little hard to root for, they are always interesting and never too short of humanity. Stephen Lang is also solidly convincing, if a bit off-putting in the antagonist role. Though it doesn't have a whole lot other than a dozen lines, his portrayal of the disturbed tyrant figure is not easy to ignore.Don't Breath is easily the best and most scary film of the year so far, and it definitely shows director Fede Alvarez at the top of his game. This film is a must-watch for all horror fans, though it's not likely to go down as a classic; but safe to say it is close enough. If you see this movie, I strongly advise you bring a friend because watching this alone will probably not be an easy ride, but that is what makes this such an effective horror film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good thriller. Not so much horror.,"In general I liked this movie though I didn't love it. Especially the characters seem underdeveloped and the first act is quite bland. The movie does really get going though after that. I love the concept. Though not every aspect is taken into account at times which makes its sometimes frustrating.The acting is good all around, dialog is okay.. there's not much but what there is is not that great.Music and sound design is top notch though, and you can really tell they focused on that (obviously) and its a joy to listen to on good headphones or in a theater.To me this movie felt more like a slasher than a horror. Regarding gore, its light. There is one other scene at the end which is pretty damn horrific but not in a gore/kill way, more of a psychopath way.Lots of people say this movie felt realistic but I really couldn't get with that, its realistic in the sense there are no ghosts or demons. But its got some things that took me out of it.All in all, not really much else to say. It was enjoyable but not really too interesting after the fact.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
You won't be able to,"Being a horror fanatic, I'd been in the know about Don't Breathe for months before the trailer had even come out. It had premiered at some weird festival and started generating a lot of hype. ""The best horror movie in decades!"" You know that sort of thing which people seem to say about every good horror movie coming out. So I'd been excited about it and I was also a fan of Fede Alvarez's fun Evil Dead remake. I avoided any trailers and tried to put aside the general hype after being disappointed with Green Room earlier in the year and just went in with the mindset that this was going to be an above average horror film. I needn't have worried because Don't Breathe totally lives up to the hype.Don't Breathe is exactly the kind of horror film I love. Intense, thrilling and relentless. It's set mainly in one location and follows three young tea leafs robbing an elderly blind man. Fede does a great job of crucially making us care for these criminals, or at least one of them. Jane Levy is the girl you'll be rooting for here and we're given a lovely bit of context which outlines her desperate situation so that our sympathies lie with her. It takes just enough time to build the characters and the plot so that we care about the rest of the film.Once the kids step into the little old house the film really begins and I was left holding my breath until the very end. At first I was a little concerned as I couldn't see how the filmmakers could spread robbing a blind OAP into a 90 minute film. I mean, he's blind, how hard can it blummin' be? It turns out very. This isn't just any old blind man, this is an ex soldier with ears like a bat who's still equipped with the skills to beat any grown man to a pulp. He's a character who you'll go away remembering thanks to Stephen Lang's dominant presence as well as the character's dark backstory which is best left unrevealed.Don't Breathe spends most of its running time squeezing every last bit of suspense it can. It reminded me a bit of the French horror, Inside, although of course far less extreme. Just in the sense that it's an absolute roller coaster despite being confined to one location and a few characters. It's a really intense film and at times I was left covering my mouth just in case I made a noise which the blind man could hear. All of the tension comes from Fede Alvarez's superb directing skills though. We're given long and still takes instead of quick shaky edits so you can see what's happening on screen. The use of silence is particularly key in creating tension though and the effect is used to its absolute best here.Whilst the film isn't the most original, it still feels fresh and unpredictable thanks to the superb high level of quality across all departments. The directing is masterful, the writing is taut, the music is effective, the acting is good for the most part, although the young Tom Cruise lookalike was a little wooden at times. The film also offers some deliciously dark ideas which I've never seen explored before in a horror film. So whilst we've seen this kind of scenario before (Livid has exactly the same premise) Don't Breathe still proves itself to be one of the very best of its kind.To say any more about Don't Breathe would be to spoil the nail-biting twists and turns in store. All you need to know is that it's a relentlessly intense experience which never gives you a chance to breathe. It looks like Fede will have a long and promising career in horror, as with only two films under his belt, he has proved that he has the skills to create some of the best horror films that Hollywood has to offer. And let's just take a moment to appreciate all the fantastic horror films 2016 has had to offer. In any other year, Don't Breathe would've been my number one but with films like: The Conjuring 2, 10 Cloverfield Lane, The Witch (my personal favourite of the year so far) and the upcoming Blair Witch, we've been treated to a surge of seriously high quality horror. Don't Breathe can still sit proudly among them though. It's a taut, adrenaline-fuelled ride which I can't imagine anyone not enjoying.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

It had foreshadowing, amazing acting, editing was incredible in every way, symbolism, great writing, directing; I could go on.If you like Sinister, The Sixth Sense, The Shinning, 28 Days Later, High Tension, Halloween (1978), or It Follows, I can almost guarantee, you'll like this film. Any of those films have in common with this film the gift of constantly making you stressed for the preyed upon characters.I've noticed that James Wan started a trend with the long fluent single shots like in his film Death Sentence, where there is a scene in a parking lot that runs multiple stories and goes on for about a straight five minutes. In this films they had a shot when the teens enter the house that would prove to be incredibly difficult to shoot and probably take quite a while to figure out the timing of the camera and actor's movements. That said, the shot was so perfect that most movie-goers probably wouldn't even notice. I however look for that specifically or else I wouldn't have noticed.The acting in the film was above average. I've seen two of the four actors out of the main cast, but the other two I hadn't and I can't believe I haven't. There are moments in the film that you're probably rooting for the actors and not even realizing that it's fake. It feels so incredibly real because of all the film elements that are just perfect.The film as a whole, is an experience and one that other films should start comparing themselves to. This film should set the bar for all future horror films. If they have half the potential this does, then they will be just fine. See this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Proof there are good scary films to be made,"Director/Writer Fede Alvarez, along Producer/Writer Rodo Sayagues, know a thing or two about scary and suspenseful films (Evil Dead, Panic Attack). Here, three young low level hoodlums decide to rob a blind man (well played by Stephen Lang - the ""Avatar"" series) who lives in an abandoned neighborhood in Detroit. Rocky (the edgy Jane Levy - TV's ""Suburgatory"") is the female attraction to the gritty Money - that's his character name - Daniel Zovatto (TV's ""Fear the Walking Dead) and wholesome Alex (cutie-pie Dylan Minnette - TV's Scandal). With a plausible storyline and terrific acting by all involved, things and situations go south quickly, leaving the audience little time to breathe. To Alvarez's credit, he doesn't include any of that typical unnecessarily busy camera work associated with many of today's horror films, so the audience finds themselves easily walking the walking (at times in the dark) along side the characters. There is a not so plausible subplot that comes to light towards the end of the film, but luckily it manages to not weight down the overall experience. ""Don't Breathe"" is small film filled with big suspenseful, proving there are still good scary films to be made.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The hype was too hyped,"Hype is a strange thing. When you miss a film the first time round and then you hear positive things about it, your whole perception of what to expect is completely changed. It happened with The Sixth Sense (an average film with a great twist) and it's always a good idea to keep away from other opinions in order to temper expectations.Don't Breathe is one of those films. Some great reviews prompted an excitement that made me expect scares of an epic scale. This didn't happen and the predictable narrative meant that it was never likely to.This is not to say that Don't Breathe was a bad film. Some great moments of tension amid the low-key lighting, allowed for an engaging film while Stephen Lang is a constant intimidating presence that steals the film as the blind war veteran, mourning the death of his daughter.Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette are believable as the small time crooks looking for a final heist to set them up, but there are no real 'wow' moments that make this a game changer. Horror this isn't but a watchable thriller it is.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A first-rate suspense, good cast and a great tone.","Do not Breathe surprised me, I always thought it would be a movie in the middle, did not expect it would be great, is a movie to watch in silence, since it is a movie that has a very somber tone, has tense moments, a good Cast, and good performances, highlight Stephen Lang who is great, the script is good, but I thought the film had a very weak end, and also did not like the revelation about the blind character, I liked the direction of Alvarez that is A very promising director, without doubt one of the best film of the year, and perhaps the best suspense / horror movie, I recommend too much, not so many scares, but remember that it is a suspense thriller.

Not for the older generation,"I am a senior citizen who saw this movie so was able to make a comparison with an old Audrey Hepburn movie I loved Wait Until Dark, blind woman, thieves break in to find a doll stuffed with drugs her husband has in the house. It is a great movie but this one, unless you are into non-stop brutality, don't waste your time. This was a blind vet who had super strength and power, now the dog in the movie added some decent horror scenes but all in all, not a film my generation can relate to and enjoy. If this is what the younger generation gives an 8 out of 10 too, that is pretty scary in itself. Also hard to believe there was one really nice house in a neighborhood of falling down houses.

Nail-biting thriller,"Few horror movies can keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. This one does.Thanks to the well-written story, the never-stopping pace and the very credible acting, the thriller will take you within the house of a blind man, defending himself against three ordinary burglars.The characters have excellent depth. Stephen Lang (Avatar) does a terrific job as the blind ex-military, his lesser-known fellow actors are very authentic and have stories going of their own.Clich√©s are avoided. Expect to be surprised many times. The typical silence before the surprise or action is very misleading, adding up to the tension as well as the creative story development.If there's one remark to be made, it's the color in the movie. In some parts appropriate, in some parts a bit annoying.Every few years, there's a really good thriller/horror movie made. Don't Breathe is one of them, even good for non-fans of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tense, but poorly plotted and structured","I wanted to like ""Don't Breathe"" a bit more than I did. It has moments of genuine tension. How many movies have that? How many thrillers thrill? How many horror movies scare?Unfortunately ""Don't Breathe"" falls down in terms of plot and structure. It lost my interest a lot of the time. The tense bits brought me back, but when they were over I stopped caring.The plot is very simple but is told in a confusing way, especially the unnecessary revelations about the bad guy at the end, that make him less scary, not more so.So many movies try to produce tension and so few do. This one does. I just wish there was more surrounding the tense moments to maintain interest.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Interesting and exciting movie, but dragging a little at times.","This movie is more a Thriller than a Horror film. We have a lot of suspense and scary moments where we need the kids to escape the house of the evil blind veteran. Or isn't he evil? We ask that question many times, because it looks like this man is protecting his house and money from burglars. Although there are more locks on the door than seem to be necessary, and some you don't want to open.We had a fun time in the cinema, I love watching these kind of movies in a crowd because it gives a feeling of sharing the same fears and scares all together, which make it fun instead of troubling. Some films you just shouldn't watch alone. With this one that would be perfectly fine, it's not that scary, there is no gore apart from a little blood and a shot wound here and there.The acting is good, good enough for this movie. The blind man doesn't talk for most part of the movie and when he does more than just a sentence, it's a little distracting because it feels late to introduce that with one of the main characters.The setting is good, although I must say that the basement must be probably 6 times bigger than the whole house. Does it spread under the whole neighborhood?It ended rather abruptly. After wanting to finish several times (but delaying the ending) we suddenly have the end titles. Funny enough it was an interesting and exciting movie, but by dragging it a little too long at times we were a little bit bored.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Breathe and you die.,"As someone who is extremely frustrated with horror movies these days, I can definitely say that 2016 has been a great year for Horror and R rated feature films, and Fede Alvarez's ""Don't Breathe"" is no exception, ""Don't Breathe"" is an intense, inventive, and well crafted offering from the people who brought you 2013's ""Evil Dead"" remake, the film is definitely not without its faults, it lacks character development, doesn't quite know how to end itself, features some questionable acting, and is plagued by stupidity like most Horror films, but thanks to Alvarez's great direction, Stephen Lang's haunting performance, and being a unique twist on the home invasion Horror/Thriller, it succeeds more than it fails.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good but not perfect,I loved that this horror had the villain as a blind guy which made this very different from other home invasion movies. Also with the man's home who they broke into being from the army and traps them in and takes their lives into their hands it was a good outlook. I also liked how the beginning was shown as a woman being grabbed and dragged down the road and why this was relevant to the movie.I do wish they showed more gore and that the film had more scare factor even if jump scares as it didn't come across as scary to myself for a horror movie. However this was a good movie.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Three Blind Mice,"(RATING: ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ out of 5 )  THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A nifty little thriller that relies on suspense rather than  gore.  GRADE: B  SYNOPSIS: Three thugs decide to rob a home with unexpected results.   JIM'S REVIEW: Let me begin my review by sharing one of my favorite  movie-going experiences. As a child, we were visiting all the tourist  sights of New York City. That afternoon, we were hustled to our seats  at the cavernous Art Deco beauty known as Radio City Music Hall to see  the Rockettes and their musical extravaganza, to be followed by a movie  called Wait Until Dark. The thriller, about a group of robbers  terrorizing a blind Audrey Hepburn was riveting to me. And during a  climactic battle of wits between the defenseless victim and her  stalker, the entire community of moviegoers gave out a loud primal  scream, levitated from their seats, and then laughed at their own  reactions. Like a well choreographed flash mob scene before its time,  but totally unplanned. Wonderful, I thought, this is what movies can  do!  Which brings me to the film, Don't Breathe, which follows almost the  exact same formula and plot. Not to the same desired effect, but still  impressive by today's standards. The cat vs. mouse set-up is part of a  time-worn tradition in a game-turning series of events. Strategically  staged and with a hell-bent slyness, the film has more bumps in the  night than most usual horror thrillers. This is due to the skills of  its director, Fede Alvarez. With this being only his second film that  he directed (the first being an awful remake of Evil Dead), Mr. Alvarez  is a talent to watch. Vastly superior to his first venture where he  seemed more obsessed with the grisly blood factor, this film is not as  graphically violent as that first film (which detracted from the  suspense). With this film, he is more restrained and in control as a  director. The shock factor is still there, but handled with more  finesse (except for a short detour into sexual abuse that is crass and  disturbing).  The premise is simple, more an outline than a story: Three thugs decide  to rob a home with unexpected results. The trio includes Alex (Dylan  Minette), a sensitive love-sick delinquent, Rocky (a fine Jane Levy), a  desperate and savvy partner wanting to escape from her abusive and  poverty-ridden lifestyle, and Money (Daniel Zovatto), a psychopath.  Their victim is supposed to be the owner of the house, a blind  ex-soldier who is nameless in the film. Effectively played by Stephen  Lang, the stage is ready for twists and turns...perhaps too many, as it  wears out its welcome with an overindulgence of multiple endings and  strained confrontations that become contrived and threaten to impact on  the film's credibility as the predators instantly become prey.  Still Don't Breathe generates maximum tension with a minimum of  modern-day gore, just enough which should suffice its Generation Z  audience. The script, by the director and his writing partner, Rodo  Sayagues, is formulaic and predictable, but it successfully maintains  suspense and provides the thrills. Going in to this genre of movies you  get what you expect, but there is some wit and cleverness in the film's  visuals, particularly in a ""lights-out segment"" that is downright  creepy and excitingly filmed by Pedro Luque .  With the spooky sleeper hit, Don't Breathe, the tension builds in a  logical and slightly claustrophobic way, as Mr. Alvarez and his cast  notches up the suspense ratio in a nifty little thriller that delivers  more goosebumps headed in your direction. So sit back and try to relax.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Intense ""Saw"" inspired thriller","As in the Saw franchise bad guys are getting trapped and punished. I liked this film a lot, especially because I dislike burglars that much.

She took part in the robberies as much as the others and hence deserves the same fate.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't Turn a Blind Eye to This UnScary Thriller,"The end of August is usually full of blunt films that are meant to fill spaces, but sometimes Hollywood knows how to close out the summer in style. The promise of this weekend is the latest horror film called Don't Breathe. Robbie K here, and I'm back to share my opinions and advice on the latest movies. Do we have a champion horror movie? Or are we fooled once again. As always¬Öread on to find out.LIKES: ¬ï Suspense ¬ï Plot twists ¬ï Good paceWhen a trailer promises suspense, my experience has been a few on the seat moments often deluded by cheesy plot lines and over exaggerated monsters. Fortunately, Don't Breathe decided to cast its die another way to deliver on what was promised. The movie is filled with suspense from the moment the ""heroes"" enter the house and begin their journey to rob a blind man. Using very simple, though well planned, tactics our main cast of three traverse the dark corridors in hopes of escaping with their lives. Many of the audience cringed with the creak of a rogue floor board, waiting for the military man to appear and hunt his prey. One doesn't realize how silent things are until that sudden sound effect pops out. Yes, the presentation certainly gives you the suspense you are craving, but that's not the only thing they did right.In terms of plot, horror movies often have quality components, but as a whole are mundane, unoriginal, and formulaic. This movie is very similar to many films, but stands out for the plot twists thrown into the mix. You can get some of these twists from the trailers, however our screenplay writers dropped a few bombs into the mix that take the story down a new road. These surprises keep things fresh and add more urgency to the moment to further bring the thrills you sought with the trailer. And even better its presented at a quick pace that adds more energy to the scenes and a since of adventure that you often miss in horrors. It all feels like a visual version of the most dangerous game and doesn't dawdle to deliver the good stuff.DISLIKES: ¬ï Overly drawn out at times ¬ï Not that scary ¬ï Uber cheesyOkay¬ÖI know that horror movies are always a stretch of the imagination and there are a lot of overly done moments. Don't Breathe, while more on the realistic side, certainly drops into many moments that sometimes feel like it won't end. While some of these moments are focused on narrow misses in the basement, or dodging shots from a gun with seemingly infinite ammunition. My main issue has to be with some of more violent moments, watching the buff military guy beat down the trespassers in vicious fury. Yeah, it delivers some swift justice, but hearing the sounds of squishing blood and grunts of pain gets stupid after a while. I can't say most of it was pointless, but our director may need to get checked out for how much he seemed to enjoy the violent moments. In fact, it seems that the violence was the focus that the scares were left out. Speaking of which¬Ö.The scare factor of this movie was not really there for me. Oh sure, a whacked out marine sergeant with a wicked temper and skills is a scary thing to witness due to the realism factor. However, it is not the thing to keep me up at night, minus one of the scenes near the middle of the film. The Blind Man is not the creepy, nightmare inducing monsters/demons/spirits that the genre is famous for. In fact, you kind of feel sorry for him at times which dilutes the scary/creepy factor for most of the film. And the movie fails to use the creepy edge and replaces it with those jump scare moments you can see coming from a mile away. Maybe if they had added a serial killer edge, or a creeped out mental patient moment it would have sweetened the pot.Finally, the last dislike is the cheesy moments in the film. Before you rip me a new one and say this review is useless hear me out. Yes, horror movies are cheesy it's what allows for the monsters and situations to exist that fans want to dive into. Unfortunately for me that cheesiness took a turn down the wrong avenue for me. First of all, the whole situation wouldn't exist if the main characters weren't overzealous thieves trying to justify their action. The means for the movie made my eyes roll and I actually cheered against the kids in the beginning because of how much I disliked them. In addition, the convenient elements (e.g. guns with lots of shots, vents that are just the right size, and surprisingly resistant bodies) are just some of the other cheesy things they amplify in this movie. I'll give them props for resourcefulness though and managing to dilute the factors to fit into the suspense.The Verdict:When it comes to Don't Breathe, the word Thriller is the most appropriate way to describe this film. It provides the continuous suspense that your attention craves and throws enough surprises into the mix to make a decent tale. However, in terms of scary, I can't say it was the most system shocking of the mix. Still I have to recommend this one for the crowd who longs for a fast paced horror who like a bunch of close calls. Yet for the rest of the world, hold out for this one and catch it at Redbox in a few months.My scores:Horror/Thriller: 7.0 (Thriller alone a 7.5) Movie Overall: 6.5",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Excellent,"Rocky, Alex, and Money are a trio of young house robbers. Rock and Money are a couple while Alex has a crush on Rocky. Rocky, her daughter, and Money have dreams of moving from Detroit to...where else...California, it's not like there any other states in the union... Alex is key to their operation. His dad works at a home security company and has files on the homes and for some reason even keys, which Alex then uses to break into the homes. He also knows about the law and the punishments for all crimes. They steal only objects but no cash. They then sell the stuff on the cheap to some guy in a van.Money comes up with their next score. A blind Army vet who received a multi-million dollar settlement from some rich family whose girl killed the vet's daughter. He lives in a house in a neighborhood full of abandoned houses. When they scout the place, they discover he's got a Rottweiler. Alex doesn't like the idea, because they don't steal cash, but of course eventually agrees.They drug the dog, find all windows barred, and 4 locks on the main door. Rocky has to squeeze in through some small window. Now they are all in. The plan is to gas the guy to sleep, while they look for the money. They find a heavily-locked door. But then the guy shows up. He fights with Money and kills him. The vet doesn't realize the other two are still there. By luck Rocky discovers the location where he keeps the money. They have no choice but to escape through the basement, through the locked door. In the basement they discover something that changes our view of the vet completely. By now, the vet, who doesn't have a good sense of hearing smells the two and starts going after them, shooting and violently beating them up. The dog by now also also woken up. What follows is almost non-stop action as the movie resolves who, if anyone, gets to survive this.The movie starts with a little intro by the director thanking the audience for watching it. I thought that was pretty cool. Don't Breathe is one tense horror movie. And to its credit it manages to maintain the tension nearly to the very end. Of course, character development isn't what this movie is about. And this scenario where for most of the movie the characters can't communicate makes for a difficult movie for the audience to connect. But Levy and Minnette make it work. They are likable criminals. And Lang stands out as the blind but buffed and trained vet both vulnerable and threatening. The story could have easily stayed at that but it gives us more with the revelation in the basement. Kudos also to the filmmakers for letting the dog survive which rarely happens in movies. Don't Breathe then has to rely on sounds and cinematography to keep the audience involved and it succeeds remarkably well.Up to this point, 2016 has been an awful year for horror movies. Don't Breathe is the strongest one so far excelling for its relentless tension.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sweet Manipulation,"There is a special arrangement exclusive to the horror/thriller genre that audiences subconsciously agree to, we want to be manipulated. If manipulation is detected in any other style, it is met with incredulity and a sneer. The makers of ""Don't Breathe"" are shameless in their understanding of this paradigm. I surprised myself in how much I was willing to overlook the lazy writing of the first 20 minutes, and the gaping plot holes of the last 60, just to feel that enthralling sensation only a good thriller can provide. If you are such a stickler to continuity and details that ""Don't Breathe"" has no effect on you, it might make you a more astute viewer, but also a more pitiable one.In simple terms this is an imperfect, but highly effective movie that sidesteps story structure to deliver one hellova setting. Once in that setting, we are given ample time to marinade in it, and believe it. 3 twenty somethings; Rocky, Alex, and Money (guess which one is the white guy with corn rows) start to grow more confident and desperate in their small burglary enterprise. Rocky is the stealthy blonde with doe eyes and small build, perfect for squeezing through tight entrances (or hiding places.) Alex is the brains and voice of reason; which doesn't amount to much as his breed of character never has enough confidence to be heard. And Money is the reckless muscle with an attitude who functions only to provide leads, break locks, and roll his eyes at good advice. When their most promising lead has a possible six-figure payday, aspirations of getting out of the gutters of Detroit bring them to a rundown suburban home with a plan that borders on incompetence. The reason for their frivolity, the target is blind. Stephen Lang is billed only as The Blind Man, a war veteran sitting on a possible fortune, hidden somewhere in a three-story pile of squeaky floorboards and crawlspaces.This house has a familiar feel, like that of ""The People Under the Stairs"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" where daylight does nothing to brighten it. Knowing the present state of Detroit, it's unsettling to know this house is far from one-of-a-kind. Once our young prowlers enter, we get our first clear glimpse of the blind man. He whimpers almost pathetically with a sotto voce ""Who's There?"" His eyes don't look blind-stricken, more like something exploded from inside the eyeball. With battle scars spreading like cracked glass from the socket. After he appears in a doorway, you will find it hard to believe him as a victim. Stephen Lang is 64 with a body MMA fighters train tirelessly for. He wears a wife- beater for the duration, intimidating arms half-cocked at his sides. It becomes clear why he's not billed as the blind ""old"" man. With his loyal Rottweiler and dilapidated abode, the blind man draws on a nearly universal fear of the house around the corner you don't dare sell cookies to.As you might expect from the trailers, power roles reverse and you ping-pong between antagonists and protagonists. If the twists and turns were set only on this basis, it would still be a compelling thriller, but ""Don't Breathe"" has much more up its sleeve. There are a few moments where things stretch a bit too far for shock value, but it is praiseworthy how infrequently ""Don't Breathe"" relies on them. This is a technical achievement with beautifully choreographed long-takes and staging that you can't call natural, but certainly can't call ineffective. At 90 minutes and a $9 million budget, it's a welcome break from the 9 figure marathons Marvel produces every 9 months. And as a side note, you will undoubtedly have a few plot holes start nagging at your brain on the ride home. If you think they're enough to ruin the movie, just imagine telling them to Stephen Lang in a dark room.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
8.5/10,"Small time house thieves Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money (Daniel Zovatto) think they have just found the perfect house to rob and end it all: in the middle of a deserted neighborhood they discover a blind veteran (Stephen Lang) who lives in a house alone and he is sitting on three hundred thousand dollars of cash. Ready to get the money and flee to California, the three enter the house convinced it is going to me smooth and easy when they discover that there might be much more trouble than they anticipated.At his second full length feature, Fede Alvarez demonstrates a confidence in style and storytelling that is really rare to find and appreciate in a horror picture, 'Don't Breathe' is a masterful effort with many layers and surprises and excellent characters.What apparently seems to be a simple, straightforward premise is turned on its head and made into a picture of incredible complexity, which thanks to magnificent craft flows effortlessly as a horror-thriller with a heft in suspense that I had not experienced in a while. The way in which, ironically, the film doesn't let you catch a breath is astonishing. There isn't a moment of calm. Stuff just keeps on happening, obstacle after obstacle you our characters are always in danger, they are never given a dull moment, is simply keeps rolling and you roll with it. The intensity of suspense sustained throughout the whole film is breath taking.The style of the film to is something really special that deserves a deeper analysis that one that I could give upon a first time viewing. The way the beautiful long tracking shots are used, the use of night cameras, how the editing mirrors each of the characters' status and finally how crude some of the details get, but how fantastically they are handled. The gross out stuff isn't there just to let you have an instinctive reaction, it is there to help the story and the characters evolve and enhance a story world which is incredibly designed.Finally, what I probably deem the best element of the film is a script that is almost perfect, one of those that subverts your momentary reservations and proves you wrong in every way you possibly thought it could fail. I really mean it, this is possibly the best script of the year, it works on so many levels: the characters are rich, coherent, interesting and three dimensional, the logic is flawless, the narrative drive is climactic, the revelations are surprising and intelligent, most of all the thematic content is unbelievably rich and explosive: the morality questions the film asks are varied and complex and the fact that the film doesn't give answers on some is possibly the most scary element of it all: no one here is either a good or a bad guy, they are all people with a really fuc*ed up dynamic that is grounded in reality and lends itself to a moral debate that is sure to spin your head round and round.Possibly, my favorite part of this remarkable screenplay is the deep and original humanization of the blind man, Stephen Lang's character. It is very easy to have a flat figure in these films as an antagonist and it could have been even easier here. Yet, Alvarez and Sayagues craft on of the most compelling opponents of recent years, humanizing him in a very unconventional way, making him a strangely sympathetic character, full of surprises and little touches that elevated the entire film.The film only has a couple of flaws to account for and even then they are all minor: there were two editing cheats that broke continuity and therefore partially took away from the flow and tension of two small moments. Moreover, there are many jump scares in this film, some used intelligently and to great effectiveness, unfortunately a couple were really gratuitous and didn't fit organically. Lastly, this is a real nitpick, but I thought that as beautiful as some of the tracking shots were, I found a couple of brief moments in there to be a little too on the nose in setting up later elements and they could have easily been edited tighter.This is excellent, intelligent and inspired filmmaking and yet another great horror film from this year and this recent period that, after a stale period in the 2000s, seems to be becoming a new golden age of horror films just like the one we had in the 70s and early 80s.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stylish Horror,"The development needs some fixing, but the style is right on. The camera movement that focuses on limited space heightens thrill and tension. I especially love when the camera moves freely up and down to show the whole house structure in the beginning. Very refreshing and creative move. Lighting switch at the right moment is spot on. In the basement, by turning off the switch, the blind man takes back the advantage of the hunting. When Alex and Rocky find a kidnapped girl, sudden and bright lighting magnifies dramatic effect. Music is sleek and modern as well.I'm short of thirty four characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, but kind of a let-down for me","Don't Breathe is a second movie directed by Fede Alvarez, the director of the 2013 remake of Evil Dead. Evil Dead was surprisingly very good and a fresh take on a story while paying homage to the original. Knowing this is by the same director, it got me even more excited. It's about three young burglars who decide to rob a seemingly helpless blind old man. But they had no idea who they were messing with. So, did it live up to the expectations. I hate to say this, but not really. At least not mine.The movie isn't bad, it's another good twist on home invasion movies, it's got an amazing cinematography and sound design and Stephen Lang is terrifying as the villain of this movie. The problem is, it's not as intense as I hoped it would be. The movie itself is called ""Don't Breathe"", and the trailers made it look like this man is something like freaking DareDevil. But no, he can't hear every breath in the house and he's just a regular blind man with some nice skills. I know it sounds kinda stupid to complain about villain not being a super-villain, but that's how the trailers showed it and it made the film lose the sense of paranoia to soon. After a half, I just kinda started losing interest and I never really felt like I was at the edge of my seat. It wasn't boring, that's for sure, but I expected some more anxiety and the villain being a bit more powerful.That's pretty much all I have to say about this movie. Everything else about it is solid, okay, but nothing remarkable. I'm not saying it's not worth watching, it has nice style to it, but if you decide to skip on it, you won't be missing anything special.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Exactly what the trailer advertised,"Its rare nowadays it feels to see a movie trailer that does exactly what it should do and make you want to see a movie, but not only that.. the movie delivers on every single thing I feel this film represented itself as.Don't Breathe does an amazing job of getting right into the action and not letting up. We only spend a few minutes at most getting to know the main characters, but its more than enough to set the stage and to get the audience to invest in what is going to happen to these characters.As far as scares go, I would say there were maybe 2 or 3 big scares that made me jump in my seat so maybe if you're looking for something really scary then this may not be for you.Bottom line without saying anything remotely close to a spoiler, if you watch the theatrical trailer and said to yourself, ""that looks like something I'd watch"", then give it your time. You won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Don't Breathe""- A wickedly intense and highly entertaining thriller that delivers the goods despite faltering a bit in the third act.","Well... that was intense.""Don't Breathe"" is the brainchild of director Fede Alvarez, who along with his writing partner Rodo Sayagues has crafted one of the more inventive and exciting thrillers of the year, mixing a wonderful sense of all-encompassing paranoia and claustrophobia with a surprisingly dense sense of internal debate about the moral dubiousness of the events taking place. It's a film that has quite a bit going for it, and it has a lot more depth to it than I think many will admit or even accept.We follow a young group of thieves who are attempting to rob just enough houses to get the money to escape their dreary, going-nowhere lives in Detroit. Chief among them is ""Rocky"" (Jane Levy), who is desperate to escape her abusive family and give her kid-sister a better life that their current situation just cannot afford them. Along with her friends ""Money"" (Daniel Zovatto) and Alex (Dylan Minnette), she takes on the classic ""one last job""- in this case, robbing the house of an elderly blind veteran (Stephen Lang of ""Avatar"" fame) who is allegedly sitting on $300k in cash... a payoff from the family of a young, rich girl who accidentally killed his daughter in a car accident some time prior.However, despite his visual impairment, it soon becomes aware that the blind man may not be quite as handicapped as the group has believed. And soon enough, the group will be forced into a life-or- death struggle against this tremendous force of nature that will stop at nothing to protect his home and the strange secret that lurks inside of the locked basement...The strengths of the film really lie in the top-notch sense of suspense that director Alvarez relishes in piling on scene-after- scene, and for the shockingly complex questioning of the morality of the events occurring.Alvarez- best known for helming the under-appreciated ""Evil Dead"" reboot from 2013- is at the top of his game. His slick sense of composition and movement constantly has you at the edge of your seat, and you'll often literally find yourself holding your breath in dread and anticipation, much as the film's title implores you. Often, I found myself wowed by just how solid his work is here- with camera-work and expert editing that borders on Hitchcockian at times, giving it a near-classical feeling. Bravo, sir. Bravo.I also was quite taken by how complex the film can be when it tries. While it mainly remains as subtext, there's a constant lingering question at the back of your mind... questioning just who the true villain (or even villains) are given the complex nature of the storyline. Or even if there are any traditional ""heroes"" or ""villains"" in this story? After all, our ""protagonists"" are basically career criminals who are trying to steal from a blind man... At what point does sympathy for someone come or go? At what point does breaking the law become acceptable? And can two wrongs really make a right? Questions like these will be bouncing around in your mind as the film continues through it's varied (and unpredictable) twists and turns. And it added a lot to the experience for me.And to top it off, the performances are just a ton of fun. Lang steals the show as our antagonist, with minimal lines and an almost purely physical performance that generates sympathy at first before becoming a shocking threat. Levy is likable and really gives her character a sense of pathos, and you identify with her reasoning for doing what she is doing despite condemning it at the same time. Zovatto is a great deal of fun as a bit of a wannabe thug with a chip on his shoulder. And Minnette is a great, sympathetic figure, being the only one of the group who really questions what they're doing.All that praise being said, I do have to take off a few points for the one major fault of the film- and that is that it does falter quite a bit in the third act. I can't really go into it here without spoiling anything (which I refuse to do), but suffice to say, the film takes a few hard-left turns with twists that are interesting but contrived, and the climax is extremely disjointed. A few key moments almost took me out of the movie completely. But thankfully the first two acts are so enthralling and engrossing, that I could forgive a decidedly mixed- bag climax.All-in-all, ""Don't Breathe"" is a satisfying and chilling suspense- thriller. It may not be perfect, and it nearly falls apart in the end, but a masterful first and second act, top-notch performances and incredible direction more than make up for this.I give it a very good 8 out of 10. Head on down to the theater, sit back, and get ready to be scared!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Improbable plot line. Only for thriller fans,"While the movie has fairly good rating, which was one of the reasons I went for this movie, the experience was honestly underwhelming. The movie has an improbable plot and the director aims to manufacture tension and to that end he is successful. After a while the experience became dreary and does not offer anything by the way of acting, plot or even cinematography. In the end it is just the question of who will get out of this alive. Avoid if you go to movies to watch a good drama.The blindness angle brings in some interesting cinematic moments. But in the end its only a lot of bangs and crashes which makes up for the sound track. Definitely this one is not among the good ones that i have watched and will not watch again.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Don't Breathe Review,"SummaryIn the movie Don't Breathe, 3 teenagers break into a old blind mans home to try to steal his money he got from a settlement following the death of his daughter. Little do they know that this man is an army veteran, who knows the surroundings of his home very well. Throughout their time in the house, they find out this man is more than they thought; he has a very good security system, a guard dog, and himself for weapons. They find themselves trapped inside and have to try to find a way out without letting the man know they are there. Storyline 5/5 You can definitely tell that the story line of Don't Breathe was a long thought out process. There is always something happening in the movie, it will always keep you on your toes. Even if you think something is finally over, it is most certainly is not. It was put together well so that things didn't get confusing, and that you could follow along easily. I really was really interested the story this movie told.Acting 4/5The actors in this movie play their roles very well. Each person seemed aware in the role the had to play and embraced it. In this film there is a lot of intense acting that needs to be done, and they each showed the intensity needed to make this movie better. You can feel the fear of the characters as they are trapped in the house, which makes it a better film. I don't think the producers could've chosen better actors for this movie. Cast:Stephen Lang- The Blind ManJane Levy- Rocky Dylan Minnette- Alex Daniel Zovatto- MoneyHow Scary: 4/5The movie Don't Breathe is probably one of the top 3 most intense movies I have ever watched. There is so much to follow and it always keeps you interested enough where you cannot stop watching. You are jumping all throughout the movie whether it's from a dog chasing someone, or watching teens try to find their way through a dark home.Overall Score 5/5Overall, Don't Breathe was a great movie. The story line was great, it had great content, and it never bored you. It was easy to follow, and you always had something to look forward to. The actors all played their roles well, and helped make this movie the best it could be.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fun flick,"Greetings from Lithuania.To be honest, for the most running time of ""Don't Breathe"" (2016) i was kinda rooting for Stephen Lang's character. And why not? He is a a bit old blind man whose house is being robed by three thieves. Should I've been rooting for thieves? No way. Then the movie showed a bit more lets just say ""awkward"" side of this blind man, which made him kinda villain.Overall, as there isn't really much to say about this flick i only will say that i was entertained during the whole 1 h 20 min. Its very good paced flick which is entertaining if you can leave your brains for a rest for a while while watching this flick. A pretty good flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tense but predictable.,"I kept waiting for someone to say Don't Breathe at some point. This movie is exactly what is expected of the title. It's got a lot in the dark, and a lot that is quiet, and that makes for some good suspense. But the ending was never in much doubt. The actors look frightened enough and Stephen Lang is suitably creepy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent,"This is one of those movies that works well with a limited cast and setting, as a team of teenaged thieves break into a blind man's house to steal his substantial fortune. Problem is, he is not as helpless as he seems, nor is anything else about his house, and they wind up in a horrendous situation. A decent story with good suspense and characters, this movie is well done with a good villain and ending.*** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blind uncle Feature takes over any crazy animal feature,"Don't breathe has effortlessly entered into my favourite heart pounding nail-biting thriller list.It has broken all pre fixed notions I had like it would be a home invasion gone wrong, Psycho killer, Haunted house with a possessed person, creepy creature attack. But this was a bit different from the above said track and definitely hit the right chord what an intense thriller has to deliver.Some of you might come back and argue it's a home invasion thriller but why I deny that point is here the invaders become the victims of the inmate of the house.Long story short three friends break into a house of a blind man thinking it would be a piece of cake to rob some dollars and run, but they didn't know that they are in for a crazy ride of survival. Well that's enough not to spoil further as this much was shown in the trailers.Stephan Lang as the blind man had nailed it to the core where he didn't have long dialogues but has brought out the fierceness and terrifying looks through his actions and body language. I would say he provided me more thrills than other creature feature movies so old uncle feature wins the creature feature. Jane the lady from Evil dead's recent remake has also emoted well and her desperation over the money even in the life or death situation was a shocking surprise.Very well managed budget movie inside a small house but can sure give you at least five six jumping up moments and stopping the heart beat moments for sure. Get in and you will enjoy the thrills by this crazy old man.I would definitely give a 7.5 on 10. Except for the logic holes here and there the movie delivers 100%. Thrills and chills guaranteed.

"More like ""Don't Mess With Stephen Lang.""","Ending the summer season in horror style, Don't Breathe is about three teenagers robbing houses where they come across a blind army veteran who has quite a lot of money, but not all as it seems because this blind man...is Stephen Lang. The same Stephen Lang who tried to destroy Pandora in Avatar...you just know what you are getting yourself involved in. Right from the opening scene, the tension is building and throughout the 88 minute runtime the suspense just does not stop. This is simply edge of your seat cinema, less horror but more thriller. The performances were great, obviously Stephen Lang is a badass (I mean what were the teenagers thinking!? Don't mess with him!) but the robbers themselves played understated performances, each character with their own backstory which were developed enough. The direction from Fede Alvarez just oozed confidence, he knew exactly what he wanted to do and he did it. Excellent camera work (a nice long shot near the beginning of the film, I was impressed!), great lighting to create the atmosphere and good editing to create those jump scares. Speaking of jump scares, there are a few of them however I would not class this film as a horror, it is more a thriller. I was not scared (and to be honest, no one in my cinema was either) but we were all on the edge of our seats. Whilst some might find that a flaw, if anything it is just a misrepresentation of the movie. One flaw that this film does have is that all the characters are bad people and therefore not likable, which means it is difficult to become attached to them. Overall, Don't Breathe was a great suspenseful thriller with sublime technical aspects and¬†brilliant performances albeit if the characters are not likable.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A must watch for thriller fans.,"Saw this last Sunday with my dad n son in a theatre. It was on my watchlist for a very long time.It is a tense thriller, terrifying at times with plenty of twists and turns.The script is brilliant and provided a perfect ingredient for a fast paced thriller.Stephen Lang did a fantastic job as a blind army veteran which went well with his muscular body and heavy voice.Director Alvarez did an awesome job. The idea of showing certain things which would play a key role later in the movie as the burglars enter the house worked well.Some scenes are very well shot inspite of being in dark.One can make out what is going on. Amazing work done by the cinematographer Pedro Luque.The background score by Roque Banos is one of the highlight.The editing is top notch. Eric L. Beason, Louise Ford n Gardner Gould did a fantastic job.Man, it grossed over $90 million against a $9.9 million budget. Speaks volume.Similar ones for genre fans - Panic Room, Wait Until Dark, The Collector, Livid, etc.Sam Raimi n Fede Alvarez did a wonderful job of satisfying thriller fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Utter Suspense,"I was really bored when I started watching this movie and I just wanted to kill some time. I got hooked up after the first 15 minutes or something.

You start by feeling bad for this man, and then you end up feeling absolutely different!

Relatively minimalist but high-octane thriller,"""Don't Breathe"" follows a trio of delinquents who plan to rob a wealthy blind man whose house sits alone in an abandoned, derelict Detroit neighborhood. What seems like a relatively easy heist turns progressively worse as the young adults find the tables turned on them.In a decade that has offered little in terms of high(ish)-caliber horror-thrillers, ""Don't Breathe"" stands out, not necessarily as an exemplar of excellence, but at least as an example of a hard-edged thriller that is head and shoulders above the majority of its peers. Fede Alvarez, who gave us the divisive 2013 ""Evil Dead"" remake (a film which, for what it's worth, I thought was unfairly bashed), returns as writer/director, teaming up again with Jane Levy, who also starred in the ""Evil Dead.""Conceptually speaking, ""Don't Breathe"" is straightforward, almost minimalist; there is no pretense to speak of, and after a brief but sufficient exposition, the film jettisons its audience into the cat-and-mouse dilemma that dominates its remainder. Somewhat of a quasi-inversion of the home invasion film, the script allows room for moral ambiguities in spite of its conceptual and narrative straightforwardness, toying with the audience's sympathies and facing us with situations which challenge the moral compass. This is of course not to say that ""Don't Breathe"" is necessarily a deep psychological thriller, because it's not‚Äîthe primary focus here is maintaining suspense‚Äîbut there is food for thought amid the action.Solid performances from Stephen Lang and Jane Levy help carry the narrative, with Lang as an ice-cold, disturbed veteran and Levy as a poverty-stricken young woman whose desperation jeopardizes both her and her friends' lives. The film is nicely shot and features some impressive cinematography, including a noteworthy single-take pan through the house that follows each of the three protagonists as they search for the man's stockpile of cash. I did feel that the film's final act edged into predictable exploitation territory, where shock value and redundancy came close to overriding the general tension that the first hour had done so nicely, but the final two scenes were solid enough to carry the film home.All in all, I was impressed by this film; not as a groundbreaking piece of cinema, but as a generally well-plotted, candid thriller that manages not to steer too far off course for its own good. It's not often that such a simple concept is done with so much finesse, let alone is able to keep its fuel burning. A definite standout thriller of the decade. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Same old trope,"This film appears in a lot of the different horror movie rankings from different sites so I thought I'd finally give it a try. Started out OK with the blind antagonist being an military veteran so you know to expect some extreme PTSD. But very quickly the illogical decision making appears. Like actually climbing DOWN a ladder going into the basement instead of heading for the nearest exit. From there it's just bits and pieces from your average ""horror"" movies. Some WTH moments and Lang really made you feel the use of other senses. Ending nothing new. This is why I've started indulging in foreign horror flicks. While the premises may not be new the stories are told/shown in a much more original way. And they don't ALWAYS have teenage and young adults as the main characters.

Love it! The best horror film of 2016 - A classic!!,"This is certainly one fantastic thriller, a very original home invasion movie that's very tense and lots of fun and gripping throughout its running time, this movie is described in some reviews as a horror film but its really not, its horrific maybe as a thriller but not a straight up horror, there's no supernatural elements here. The movie is also described as having the best twist in years but that's overhyping just a tad I think as there is not so much a twist that makes you say wow I didn't see that coming its just a twisted story, none the less its a very well directed movie, very nice looking sets and locations, very well acted by a great cast and a tense soundtrack, if you like scares and jumps and nail-biting movies this is certainly for you, its not blood and guts.

Don't Breathe - Review: Refreshing but Lacking,"Fede Alvarez (director of the Evil Dead remake) is back with a new horror movie called Don't Breathe. I for one didn't like Fede Alvarez's remake of the Evil Dead. I thought the Evil Dead remake was fantastic from a technical aspect, however, the movies overall execution was seriously lacking.First off, Don't Breathe has an interesting premise, three kids attempt to rob a blind man, but the blind man is not as helpless as they think.I thought the premise of this movie was truly refreshing, I'm sick of seeing movies about ghost and demons, and so I was glad that this one strayed away from that and told something basic.The directing is pretty stylish, the camera moves swiftly, and it's filled with nice tracking shots.Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, and Daniel Zovatto all deliver a believable performance. Stephen Lang plays the blind character, his performance is memorable and convincing because it requires more demand.Just like in the Evil Dead remake, all of the technical aspects are fine, but the movies overall execution is lacking.I didn't care about any of the characters well-being, except for the blind man. The characters presented here gave me absolutely no reason to care about them or their outcomes. I sympathized with the blind man because of his overall situations, but I didn't care about the kids because there was no reason to. The movie didn't explain what the three main characters overall situations were, it doesn't have to, but I thought it would've at least made sense to provide the audience with minor information.The suspense presented in the movie is top-notch. I was on the edge of my seat as the movie progressed. There's not much that happens here as far as death scenes are concerned, but what is present is a whole lot of suspense.Overall, I enjoyed this movie, for the most part, it's a suspenseful piece of work, but it lacks in character development. Don't Breathe is an extremely refreshing horror movie, it's properly executed, but it lacks in character substance.Final Grade: B",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
An intense thriller,"As many people told already, the least you know about the movie, the more you end up enjoying it. I for one went in knowing absolutely nothing but the name, and while I'm not a big fan of the genre, I found this title to be superb. To give as few information as possible, the story begins when three amateur thieves attempt a robbery inside a house inhabited by a blind man and his lovely dog, thinking it'd be an easy target, but then things start going awfully wrong for them.Truth be told, it's pleasant to see titles not going over supernatural based-on-real-facts-yet-truly-unbelievable kind of stuff (yes, I'm looking at you The Conjuring) for a change.

They broke into HIS house...,"It's hard to really be scared as it's hard to feel bad for the teenagers who broke into this old man's house to steal from him.The idea of being in the dark with a creepy man out to get you is scary, but he wasn't chasing them, running after them, or hunting them down or stalking them. They broke into HIS house and wanted to steal from him. That's what they get honestly. They're intruders. That's someone's home, we're supposed to feel safe in our home. I'm against stealing from other peoples homes, that's not okay, steal from big stores instead. And he's lonely, has lost, leave the poor man alone.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Horror Movie if wasn't Twisted,"This movie is great if you have a strong stomach and love a good suspenseful movie with action, and jump scares. This movie is definitely worth seeing,however turns from suspenseful,and scary to Grose, which may turn off a lot of viewers. This movie is probably one of the most suspenseful I've witnessed in the last few years, but one of the grossest as well. Bottom line if you can handle Grose and suspenseful jump scares this is the movie for you. Overall I thought Don't Breath was a great story,and intense almost all the way through. The movie starts off slow, and then slowly gets more interesting,and intense by the minute. Don't Breathe starts off with Teenagers thinking they have a good shot of Robing this blind old man, when little do they know this guy is the wrong twisted guy to mess with. Midway through the movie it seems like the old man is useless, but that isn't the case. Don't Breathe is one of the best horror movies I've saw all year, and grossest. So if you like Grose and scary go see this movie! Why is this movie so interesting? The story line, and the suspense with it. Why is this movie not in some areas? Well that's easy! It can get really unpleasant in some spots of the movie near the end. If the movie wasn't twisted I think this would hands down be the best horror movie of the year because it includes every aspect of an awesome horror movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
