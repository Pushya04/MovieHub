A great interpretation of a great classic,"I thoroughly enjoyed this collaboration between Tim Burton, Andrew Kevin Walker and Washington Irving.  Combining such incredible talents as Mr. Burton and Mr. Walker proved quite the appropriate recipe for recreating the Irving classic.  I have read may other comments about this movie and I find it very disturbing that most people either compare it to Star Wars: Phantom Menace or complain that it is too far removed from the original story.For these people I have a few comments.  First, the only connections and comparisons to Star Wars are the actor Ian McDiarmid and the actor/stuntman Ray Park.  Beyond that there is nothing within this movie that comes remotely close to a comparison to Star Wars.  In my opinion this movie was better than that box office behemoth.  If *****had spent as much time on his script for ***, perhaps it would have been as intriguing as Sleepy Hollow.  Next, for those who were not satisfied with the movie's departure from the Irving classic I have but one piece of advice: read the story again.  Washington Irving was masterful at creating scenes and setting atmosphere but The Legend of Sleepy Hollow was a 20 page examination of the little village and the loves of Ichabod Crane (women, food, writings et al) The Horseman, though mentioned a handful of times, did not appear until the last couple pages and then it alluded to the idea that Brom Bones was the culprit, in disguise, to frighten the poor hero Ichabod.There have been other writings and interpretations of the Sleepy Hollow story that focus more on the spectral form of the Headless Horseman.  I believe this movie was done in the spirit of those other works and is among the best.  It brings to life the setting of this little valley and attempts to recreate the feeling that Washington Irving described best in his story. It was indicated that Sleepy Hollow was a magical and dream like place, thus the name ""Sleepy Hollow.""  In this little upstate valley the strangest things occur and such ghosts and goblins roam freely if only in the mind of the inhabitants.  Tim Burton manages to capture that sensation and allows the audience to feel as if they stepped not into a theater, but another world.Andrew Kevin Walker's workup and translation of the story also makes for a compelling movie.  Allowing the changes for the movie adaptation were a sign of genius.  Displacing the hero and introducing him to the Sleepy Hollow atmosphere along with the audience, enhanced the experience.  Giving a clear background for the Horseman, which is only briefly provided in the original story, was also an improvement to the movie's story.  Let's face it, if they had made a 105 minute movie that tried to replicate the original short story there would have been whole theaters full of ""sleepy"" patrons.The acting was also superb giving a hand to Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci for fabulous performances.  As for the rest of the cast?  Fantastic.  To see all of these wonderful actors in secondary roles was a treat.  Starting with Christopher Lee as the chief magistrate in New York; Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson and even Casper Van Dien all did magnificent work.Though the story lagged at moments, they were few and far between.  The editing in the beginning was a bit choppy but ran more fluently after the 20-30 minute point.  An excellent adaptation of a great story.  This was definitely a movie that Burton was born to make.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"A visual masterpiece, pure Tim Burton. ***1/2 out of ****","SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999) ***1/2Starring: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, and Christopher Walken Director: Tim Burton   Running Time: 102 minutes   Rated R (for graphic horror violence and gore, and brief sexuality)By Blake French:Tim Burton is just about as good as they get in the movie business when it comes to creating an atmospheric world to inhabit specific characters. ""Sleepy Hollow"" is the perfect kind of movie for his directional Midas touch; it resembles the best of Burton in every way. In the film, an adaptation based on a story by Washington Irving called The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, he captures the slumbering, creepy village of Sleepy Hollow with vivid details and imaginative description. The way everything is presented, the trees look like something out of a fairy tale and the scenery represents deception in a mysterious wonderland, is what makes this production one of the years most captivating and magical film experiences.Some of the visual credit should also be given to the film's Cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, and the credited production designer, Rick Heinrichs. These elements contribute a great deal of success to Burton's masterpiece. Both the design and Cinematography are some of the best seen all year, and deserve a hard earned Oscar Nomination. They make the film intriguing and visually stimulating.The film takes place in the late 1700's, in New York. Constable Ichabod Crane, a timid and but smart man played by Johnny Depp, is assigned to investigate a series of grizzly murders in a nearby town called Sleepy Hollow. He's rather concerned about his latest task, however, due to the content of the killings. The victim's heads have been sliced, in one clean sweep, straight from their bodies. He accepts his duties, and travels by horse and carriage to the isolated village.Once Ichabod arrives, the locals, including Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson), Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien), and Reverend Steenwyck (Jeffrey Jones), greet him with eagerness. They explain the legend of the headless horseman, who is supposedly causing the murders in their town. At first he is skeptical. Then, after witnessing a victim losing their head personally, he arrives at the conclusion that a headless horseman is responsible for the tragic catastrophes accruing. Ichabod soon meets Katrina Van Tassel, an innocent looking, self spoken young woman who may have some advice, as well as several secrets of her own.The Headless horseman is a perfect portrayed villain for ""Sleepy Hollow."" He is brute, oversized, and roughly textured with outwear. The actor who brings him to life when his head is on is perfect for the role; Christopher Walken. For some odd reason, however, popular film critic Roger Ebert reluctantly refused to tell his readers the name of the actor, thinking it would give something away. Well, I am sorry, Mr. Ebert, but it isn't that hard to find this information elsewhere. The filmmakers are not trying to hold Walken as a secret. Stating he stars as the headed horseman gives nothing away. One must see his performance and make up for themselves to even imagine what material the film's bad guy brings forth.Tim Burton's direction is focused and wonderfully observant here. The murder sequences are gory and violent, but never way over the top. Burton never losses sight of his main characters, has a good idea about what he wants to place in film, and the special effects do not distract his ability to do so. He has a knack for allowing an audience to become involved with his pictures. We must think for ourselves, figuring out nuggets of the plot on our own, without the projectors help. He has demonstrated these techniques before in such films as ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" and even the best Batman film yet, ""Batman Returns.""Johnny Depp offers an Oscar worthy performance as Ichabod Crane. He brings the squeamish role to life effortlessly with striking details and perfect form. He is flawlessly cast, as well as Christina Ricci, who also acts with style and poignancy. Compliments also go out to splendid costuming the actors are permitted to wear.Although ""Sleepy Hollow"" offers lots of creepy impressions, the film is far from being very scary. Some moments do generate some minor thrills, but for the most part, the production is not as terrifying as it could have been. Much of it lacks momentum and build-up for the dozen or so graphic beheadings that take place. Burton could have easily loaded his picture with bombarding amounts of shock value, suspense, and tension filled fright, but instead goes for all out violence, plot, and mystery. Not that this effects the overall production. This is more of an atmospheric movie than a scream feast. The atmosphere is certainly above the average.The conclusion of ""Sleepy Hollow"" works in a bizarre, but unpredictable fashion. The climax occurs unexpectedly and excitingly, with much surprise and special effects. The film's foreshadowing is effective, but regardless of how experienced of a filmgoer you are, this is one ending that is not meant to be figured out before it takes place. It is one of the preferred closings I've seen in a while. Despite a few personal objections, ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a brilliantly crafted work of art--one of the years better films.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Dark, Comic, Evil, Tense, Tim Burton...","I just saw Sleepy Hollow in an advanced Preview show in the UK.  I went with a couple of mates, all of whom had seen some Tim Burton before but only I was a big fan.  I simply love Tim Burton's surreal style of directing and of all the films I've seen of his (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissor Hands, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks!, etc.) I thought only Mars Attacks! Was less than superb.  ESH for example has a superbly innocent atmosphere to it but it extremely dark at times.  So now, with the release of a new Tim Burton film (of a story I remember fondly from the old Disney Cartoon of the 50's) I was rather excited to see it!  And so, I sat in the darkened cinema at my local Multiplex and was amazed.  From the dark and mysterious opening to the more humour-spiked yet no less horrific end this is one of my favourite films ever!  I'm a big horror film fan and was so looking forward to seeing what take Tim Burton would have a true horror film.  My god, he did well.  The look of the piece is both extremely dark and evil (the Horseman kills men, women and children with equal relish) but it retains scenes of beautiful, dreamlike states once again making good use of Mr. Burton's own thoughts and visions.  It's a very funny film too.  Depp is great as an Englishman (only slipping into American twang in one syllable early on in the movie) who will battle the horseman and inspect headless, beetle filled corpses with gusto but then leap onto a chair, screaming when he sees a spider!  Christina Ricci was also very good.  Usually, her parts are beautiful yet rather evil characters that look innocent and pure until you look into her eyesnot this time though.  She just looks, well, sweet! She's softly spoken, and very caring and that's it, no daggers in the pupils, no sly frowns to the camera.  Christopher Walken made the small role he had in the headless horseman (he played him on the few occasions he actually had a head) his own with his usual evil visage and a load of screaming!  Plus nastily shaved down teeth.  The real masterstroke of this film though, or at least its main bad guy is the use of Ray Park.  For those of you who saw Episode One and enjoyed the lightsabre battle at the end, Ray Park was Darth Maul!  He brings a very modern look to the fighting, most scenes are fought with a sword in one hand and an axe in the other! Its like a medieval John Woo!  But almost every time that he gets hold of a weapon he does some kind of stylish one-handed flip to the sound of wonderfully over-the-top swish sounds!  The deaths, most of which decapitations of course, are all seen onscreen in their full, gory glory.  Not a single piece of blood escapes the cameras here!  The film really does have a lot of blood in it but it's a kind of comic book redder than red blood, which adds to the whole films not quite real feel.  The cinematography is once again, from Burton, superb.  The vile smog0filled 18th century New York and the Scarecrow at the beginning.  My god, the scarecrow, its so evil!  Onscreen for a second but its image lasts But anyway, in short, this is a fantastic film.  Burton has never done anything this visually eye-popping before (take a bow Industrial Light & Magic).  The plot is both intriguing and whimsical, the acting excellent, it has a cameo from Hammer Horror master Christopher Lee and it boasts one of the most evil, most frightening, most superbly realized supernatural baddies I've ever seenand I've seen plenty! Go see this film if you like horror or you just want some fast-paced fun 9 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Stunning version of Washington Irving novel  with particular Tim Burton style,"Enjoyable version about known Washington Irving's novel, titled ¨The legend of Sleepy Hollow¨. It concerns on Ichabod Crane(excellently personified by Johnny Depp). He's a N.Y. constable assigned to investigate brutal murders in a little town named Sleepy Hollow. Crane is housed by Balthus Van Tassel(Michael Gambon), whose beautiful daughter(Christina Ricci) falls in love for him. At the beginning Crane denies to believe that a rider without head committing the grisly killings, but he's early convinced when seeing the graphic evidence of his own hands. Meanwhile, wealthy authorities and rich proprietaries (Richard Griffiths,Ian McDiarmid,Michael Gough,Michael Gambon) from village reunite to planning and defending against the amazing beheaded creature.Finally, all it leads to an unexpected twist and breakthrough ending on what's happened before.This is an agreeable and effective film, still has shock value from grisly killings .It's proceeded with a Burton style and containing colorful images and wonderful dreams with Burtonized narrative. The movie is plenty on suspense, thriller, grisly terror and sensationalistic set pieces horror when the decapitations take place. Wide use of gore and now famous decapitation , for those who like this kind of things. Casting frankly extraordinary with several famous actors and exceptional secondary cast and special cameos by Martin Landau and Christopher Lee .Glimmer cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and sensational musical score by Danny Elffman, both are Burton's usual. The film is lavishly produced by Francis Ford Coppola-Zeotrope studios- and Kevin Yagher-famous makeup expert- .The motion picture is marvellously directed with visual style and fair-play by the great Tim Burton. Rating : Magnificent flick and better than average.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A Superb Version of Washington Irving's Classic Horror Story,"The movie, Sleepy Hollow, embodies Tim Burton's unique take on one of the most well-known horror tales of all time, with a few new plot twists and greater character development, including a dark past for Ichabod Crane and a ""story behind the story"" of what's going on in the haunted town, which is beautifully rendered, dark and foggy for an eerie atmosphere.The dream cast puts in great performances, but obviously it's Johnny Depp who steals the show with his intuitive and sometimes over-the-top portrayal of the anti-hero, Ichabod Crane, who displays admirable bravery while at the same time often succumbing to fear.The lavish production, masterful acting, background music, beautiful periodic sets and costumes and the careful attention to detail, most notable in the special effects used to bring the headless horseman ""to life"", if you will, all come together to tell the tale of Sleepy Hollow's plight and deliverance as it's never been told before. It's unlikely that this cinematic version will ever be surpassed. Superb!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Looks fantastic but never quite engages as it should,"I found this a little hard to pin down but if there is a problem with Sleepy Hollow then it probably lies with Johnny Depp and the depiction of supernatural fantasy here without ever making it convincing. Depp is all over the place in this one, adopting a comic tone in a movie that really shouldn't have one, and coming across like a poor man's Bob Hope than anything else. His frequent fainting is ridiculous.To make the supernatural convincing in movies you need to build up to it and handle it carefully; but Tim Burton just throws it at the viewer, making it far less believable (and effective) than it could have been.The main compensations in the film are how jaw-droppingly Gothic-gorgeous it looks (almost taken for granted when Tim Burton's the director), and the chance to see some great old actors do their stuff. Christopher Lee, Michael Gambon, Michael Gough (yayy the star of Konga is back!) etc give it an air of class, and Christopher Walken is genuinely creepy as the horseman.Burton's main weakness is that he struggles to tell his story as well as he might - probably only in Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood (maybe he should film MR. ED next!) does he keep the narrative on an even keel. And yet his love of horror films is so genuine it comes through in every frame. The windmill used at the film's climax is surely an homage to both Frankenstein and The Brides of Dracula. If only Depp had played it straight the movie might have worked much better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Strangely comical, yet still an excellent film.","Any reservations that I had about the film being be a turkey, were almost immediately quelled upon seeing the movie. From the offset Mr. Depp throws himself into the role of Icabod Crane with enthusiasm and gusto; portraying excellently a man of ""science"" suddenly out of his depth in legend. Christina Ricci also plays the role of Katrina van Tassel superbly; a sure sign of good things to come from this talented young actress.I would be reluctant to call this film an outright horror film - the special effects are used primarily to enhance the plot and visual appearence, and the gore level is low. The visual detail is a masterpiece - the sets are fantastic and lighting brilliant. Tim Burton has superbly used music and suspense to build the thrill in the film. However, the comical interjections provide the required break-up of the suspense.All in all a very well put together film, with solidly good acting, and most of all a superb plot. Well worth seeing!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Not perfect, but very, very close","First of all, the so-so parts: While Christina Ricci's cool portrayal of Katrina gives the character an appropriately otherworldly aura, she really could have used more fire at emotional moments.  Some scenes are unduly rushed, including a few with crucial exposition, making the plot hard to follow at some points.  Finally, Danny Elfman's music is too intrusive at times, distancing viewers when they should be drawn in.That's ALL that's wrong with this picture; everything else is perfect or nearly so.  Tim Burton's films are always visually rewarding, and this one has terrifically moody atmosphere.  Having lived in hilly, wooded areas close to rivers and creeks, I can testify that there are indeed places that look and feel a lot like the Sleepy Hollow of this movie.  Many scenes have so little color that they might almost as well be in black-and-white; this makes the few splashes of color (flames, witchcraft symbols, and of course blood) much more striking.  One understands how the movie got an Oscar for art direction.The plot, which as you probably know varies drastically from Washington Irving's original story, is diabolically complex and closer to a mystery/thriller than horror as such.  It reminded me of the fiction of Avram Davidson, a noted fantasist with a penchant for complex mystery plots.Anyway, back to the movie.  Except for the rushed scenes alluded to above, Burton handles the plot (perhaps the most complex in any of his movies) with exceptional grace, dropping in telling visual details along the way that come back in unexpected places later on.  I especially liked the underlying theme about science vs. superstition, and note that while many details of this particular case lie beyond the realm of science, it is still science and reason that crack the case open in the end.  The bits of ca. 1800 cutting-edge (so to speak) technology were fascinating as well; my favorites were the magic lantern that threw lighted shapes on the walls, and the thaumatrope toy which combined pictures of a bird and a cage.  (It's probably not a coincidence that both of these are ancestors to the motion picture.)Finally, I loved Johnny Depp's performance as Ichabod Crane.  Even though the character's situation and background were quite different from Irving's version, Depp, Burton, and scriptwriters Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker remain true to the spirit of the original Ichabod Crane.  He could almost be a Buster Keaton-type character, an awkward wimp who accomplishes great feats of derring-do by the end of the movie, and for me Depp's portrayal recalls ""Sherlock, Jr."", in which Keaton dreams that he is the world's greatest detective.  Even though Irving wrote no sequels to ""Sleepy Hollow"", I'd love to see more of this film version of Ichabod Crane; while the movie looks great and has a terrific script, it's Depp and Crane who put it over the top.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A truly stunning film,"Tim Burton has done it again. It seems he can't really go wrong; especially when he's paired with Johnny Depp. Sleepy Hollow is the most visually stunning movie I have seen this year. The production is gorgeous in every way; the cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, the set design is incredible and the way Burton uses the color red to accentuate the lack of color and dreariness otherwise experienced in Sleepy Hollow is a visual treat. This movie is just absolutely beautiful to watch. The performances are flawless, I have to commend Burton for using such a great array of underappreciated character actors, such as Jeffrey Jones and Michael Gough.. and even poor little Casper Van Dien; the man just can't seem to get any respect (and he doesn't here either). Ricci is wonderful in a role totally against type, and Depp is refreshing as ever. Christopher Walken is just the coolest guy ever, and as the Headless Horseman he's even scarier than normal. The best thing, though, is Danny Elfman's music. Why on earth doesn't the man have an Oscar yet? What is going on?? He should at least get a nomination for this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Well, Burton succeeded in what he was trying to do.....","which was to make a homage to the old British Hammer films of the 60s. The film could have been following a checklist:Does it have dark, gothic set design? CheckDoes it share a title with a work of classic literature? CheckDoes it bear absolutely no resemblence to said classic? CheckIs it instead a needlessly complicated whodunnit with an anticlimatic resolution? CheckAs far as costume design, does it think mainly of tight corsets straining to contain amply endowed women? CheckDoes it contain overwrought and melodramatic dialogue straight from a penny dreadful novel? CheckDoes it conain oodles of blood? CheckAnd Christopher Lee? CheckWith ""Sleepy Hollow"" Tim Burton forgets the cardinal rule of homage; refer but do not recreate. The film's main fault is that it is not so much a homage to Hammer horror as a carbon copy. Fidelity is not always a virtue, for while the film manages to capture all that was good about Hammer horror, it also manages to capture all that was bad.I have to say that ""Sleepy Hollow"" had one advantage over its source, there were moments in this film that were genuinely scary and suspensful, and I can't remember being scared once while watching any Hammer film. However, Hammer's failings ultimately undermine it. Most of the cast deliberately camped up their roles, and so did disservice to themselves (Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Christina Ricci, and Johnny Depp are all excellent actors and it is a bit depressing to see them as they are here) but Christopher Lee, who only appears briefly, reminds the world why he is and always has been the greatest conveyor of primal menace in the history of film; a fact Burton makes all the clearer by pairing him with his lesser modern counterpart, Christopher Walken. I find it interesting that Lee's career shot into the sky after this film was released.Given its aims, ""Sleepy Hollow"" could be called a success. But since it was aiming so low I can really only call it a failure.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Good or awful? that depends...,"Pretty good if you expect to see a rather thrilling fairy-tale for kids. Really awful if you expect to see a good thriller for grown-ups.

"Gore-ror film, thin on fright and plot","Having seen Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands, as well as knowing about other Tim Burton films (Nightmare Before Christmas, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Mars Attacks, etc.), you'd think going into a film such as this that not much could really put you off. Wrong. Despite how I rate it, this film is entirely watchable...maybe even two or three times compared to some other films out there. But, to me, it falls short on several fronts.First, I'm a big-time reader and I thoroughly enjoyed Washington Irving's short story, ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."" So I was disappointed in that this film made more or less no attempt whatsoever to follow that story. In Irving's story, Ichabod Crane moves to the area and is a school teacher. In this movie, he is a constable sent from New York to investigate three murders by decapitation.Second, part of the allure of the short story is Crane's infatuation with Katrina Van Tassel and the friction this causes between him and Katrina's would-be lover ""Brom Bones"" (Abraham van Brunt). The story alludes to the fact that perhaps the headless horseman is indeed Brom Bones scaring Crane (the Disney cartoon actually hints at this as well); the movie allows no such character interplay.Third, the whole point of this movie seems to be the mindless decapitation of people. And there is a lot of it. A LOT. Men, women, and one child (though the child's decapitation takes place, thankfully, off-screen). And it is gory. Not a whole lot of blood, but plenty of flesh. If you're squeamish at all, that's a good enough reason to avoid this film.Fourth, the evil character's recitation of motivation (a staple among Saturday morning cartoons from 20 years ago, but grossly out of place in a 21st Century movie) at the film's end is drivel. It could have been shortened, ""figured out,"" and almost entirely left out -- although it did allow for one more beheading on camera. Whopee.Fifth, the script (and acting) is pretty poor. Now, I like Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc.) and I think the guy is great at playing unusual characters, but his performance here reminds me of an Al Gore speech. Because he's done so much so well, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and just blame the script. In fact, you can pretty much blame the script for the whole movie.Not all is bad in this film. The swordplay by the horseman is excellent. The special effects are pretty well done (some are meant to make you laugh, but just come across as cheesy). And there is the neat bow-tie at the end as the villain gets it and the good guy goes home happy. Again, it's entirely watchable, just not that good.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Gothic masterpiece,"Drawing from his Gothic roots (Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas) Burton has created a truly chilling horrific fantasy that keeps you guessing at every turn. The use of special effects is seemless and yet again, as in his other films, Burton excels at creating a whole look and feeling for the piece. He has managed to re-work the classic horror genre staying true to his own highly personal style and catering to post- Wes Craven cinema audiences' cynicism without taking itself too seriously a la Blair Witch. It is so refreshing to see the work of an art-house genius who hasn't let a big hollywood budget get to his head. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci give charming performances as ever, as do rest of the assembled anglo-Brit. star-studded cast. They all look like they had a ball, as will you!",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A typical Tim Burton movie.,"If you enjoy Tim Burton movies, you will certainly enjoy this one. Although not particularly true to the original story, or even the Disney version, the movie does contain all the elements that make Sleepy Hollow a classic scare story.  Also throughout the movie are little touches that just scream Tim Burton.  Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Nightmare Before Christmas, and Beetlejuice all receive a nod in this movie (whether intentional or not I don't know).Sleepy Hollow does deserve the rating it has been given due to a few instances of gore.  It certainly isn't the Disney story we all remember from childhood.  Although, there are just as many laughs as there are squirms. A definite must see if you enjoy black comedy with a dash of real horror thrown in.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Thoroughly enjoyable,"Tim Burton has again proved his worth with a masterpiece of gothic horror. The whole way the film is made is excellent, from the way the special effects are used to enhance the story, rather than sell the movie, to the superb acting of the entire cast. I must confess I was a little reluctant at first to see Johnny Depp in the lead role, but from the outset my mind was changed as he threw himself enthusiastically into the part with exactly the right mix of assumed self confidence tempered by a realistic portrayal of a man hopelessly out of his depth in the situation in which he finds himself.The story, the sets, the special effects and most of all the cast and director make this a film well worth seeing, definately the best thing out of Hollywood in a very long time. Other directors take note..it's not how big the budget, it's what you do with it.

Unmistakably a Tim Burton film but not one of his best,"These days, there aren't a lot of directors working in Hollywood that have a style all their own. Tim Burton is definitely one of them. His brand of quirky, often gothic-inspired filmmaking is ideally suited for a property like ""Sleepy Hollow"" with its legendary headless horseman.Based on Washington Irving's classic short story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", this movie adaptation definitely falls into the category of 'loosely based on'. The iconic Ichabod Crane is here in the form of Johnny Depp but instead of a schoolmaster he's a police constable dispatched from the big city in order to investigate a series of decapitations. I think this was a step in the right direction in refashioning the story for a modern audience. Depp's Crane is still a less than heroic character but his futuristic (at the time) methods of detection make him a more palatable protagonist. However, I think that the script goes too far with the mystery angle by presenting us with an altogether too convoluted plot.Luckily, a fine cast was put in place to prevent the movie from completely losing its audience. As always, Tim Burton brings out the best in Johnny Depp and here he has no problem carrying the movie. Christina Ricci, on the other hand, seems miscast and fails to leave much of an impression. Instead, it's the fine supporting cast that stands out with the likes of Michael Gambon, Richard Griffiths, Jeffrey Jones & Michael Gough all contributing greatly to the film's atmosphere.Speaking of atmosphere, this movie is shrouded in a rich gothic atmosphere from beginning to end. The Oscar-winning art direction is exquisite, as are the Oscar-nominated costumes & cinematography. Add in a score by Danny Elfman and you've got a movie that unmistakably bears the imprint of Tim Burton. The only complaint I have is that some of the special effects are a bit cheesy, which may have been intentional.""Sleepy Hollow"" is a movie that does a lot of things right but its effectiveness is crippled by a meandering story that fails to keep you on the edge of your seat. As a horror movie it's fairly tame (despite all of the decapitations) and as a mystery it's not really that satisfying. It's definitely worth watching for fans of Tim Burton but it fails to wring all that it could have out of Washington Irving's template.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A Stunning Visual Treat,"Tim Burton has to be one of the best filmmakers in recent memory. He set the standard for the first 2 Batman films, he astounded us with his visual creativity with Edward Scissorhands, and he made everything that appeared in A nightmare before Christmas seem believable. Now he has brought us Sleepy Hollow which has to be one of the best films he has directed thus far. his vision for this film made it a truly great one.Here's the basic plots. In the small town of Sleepy Hollow murders are being committed where the killer is claiming the heads of it's victims. Constable Ichabod Crane is sent there to investigate and he believes the killer is of flesh and blood but the towns people know of the true horror in sleepy hollow and it's in the form of a headless horsemen. Soon crane discovers that all the victims are connected and that there is a conspiracy at hand.The acting in this film is great. Johnnt Depp is the most versatile actor of our generation. Crane is by far one of the best characters he has ever played.

Excels as a Gothic exercise in atmosphere and dark humor,"Director Tim Burton's elaborate take on Washington Irving's tale of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman doesn't have much in common with Irving but excels as a Gothic exercise in atmosphere and dark humor.This rich visual feast demands a viewer's attention with its stunning photography and art direction, with countless memorably framed shots of 18th Century New York, with its foggy woods and small town cobblestone streets. Lurking about, too, of course, is the legendary Headless Horseman who seems to be collecting an increasingly large number of heads of his hapless victims.This brings about the arrival of Crane, transformed by Burton from Disney's spindly school teacher of animation fame into an analytical would be Sherlock Holmes type detective. Only this detective is decidedly squeamish about blood (not to mention spiders) and, on at least one bloody occasion, will pass out. The role is an ideal showcase for Johnny Depp, whose Crane is both darkly handsome and a bit prissy. Depp is truly endearing in his part, an engagingly idiosyncratic individual who will eventually turn reluctant hero.None of the rest of the cast, while capable, make much of an impression next to Depp. A few old timers occupy that cast, however, including Christopher Lee, Michael Gough and Martin Landau. However, Christopher Walken also appears, chillingly, in a significant role.It's a shame, of course, that Burton's skills with narrative story telling are not nearly as effective as his flair for visual dramatics (as unquestionably impressive as the latter are here) and, as far as the story itself is concerned, the film is confused and falls a bit flat. Nor are the horror elements of the story all that horrifying, though this is a film in which the decapitations by the Horseman will keep the heads a rolling. Burton largely treats these moments of bloodshed and ""terror"" as darkly humorous more than anything else.More than any of the special effects involving the Headless Horseman, what stays with me are Depp's performance and, particularly, the Gothic elegance of this production. That alone makes Sleepy Hollow well with the investment of a viewer's time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Very Burtonesque,"The movie suffered, in my opinion, from being too Tim Burtoneque, a feature that I am not really too fond of.  All was pointedly black, plain, and grotesque.

"Absolutely nails the atmosphere, but the plot is a little muddled","The first time I saw Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow, I was disappointed. I'd been a fan of the story since I saw Disney's animated adaptation as a child, and this version strayed a little too far off the path of what I expected. Watching it again, knowing what to expect, I think it absolutely nails the spooky atmosphere. From the gothic sets to the dim & foggy lighting to the elaborately drab costumes, this looks and feels like a Halloween movie should. The plot, however, feels a little muddled. And some of the additions don't work for me. Nevertheless, I'm glad I took another swipe at Sleepy Hollow.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"""Heads will roll."" Sleepy Hollow(1999)","Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane was a good choice, and he was able to play a character who is odd and quirky, yet not stupid or insane. It's a much more subtle version of some of the Johnny Depp characters we've seen in the past decade. Most of the supporting cast was pretty good too, especially Christopher Walken as the Head-having Horseman and Gorgeous Christina Ricci is his beau. The look and feel of the film was one of the highlights, as Burton was able to make everything look authentic, yet give the feeling of unease. Lots of scenes, if not all of them, were filmed with blue-tinted filters that gave everything a cold and detached look.Gothic fantasy movies just don't come more lush than Tim Burton's efforts, and in this thinly disguised slasher film, based on the novel by Washington Irving, a legendary headless horseman lops off the noggins of the inhabitants of the small north eastern town of Sleepy Hollow in 1799.

"Visually stunning, one of Tim Burton's best.","Sleepy Hollow (1999) follows a detective as he is sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders where the victims are found beheaded. This was a fun movie with so much atmosphere and spooky vibes. I really enjoyed this and will be rewatching it again!The film has super gothic imagery which I liked, it really shows Tim Burton's iconic and unique style! I loved the dull and spooky setting, and the set designs were always good! The colour palettes were impressive, and the contrast between the colour of blood and the pale colour palettes was very effective. The gore was more intense than I expected, but was very tasteful in what it showed the audience. Also, I loved the costuming!There isn't much to talk about in terms of sound design, but the score was very spooky! It was immersive and definitely added to the experience of watching, but wasn't too overbearing and didn't take the attention away from the film itself.Johnny Depp was likeable as the lead and gave a very strong performance. This was helped by the well written and engaging dialogue that kept me constantly entertained. The casting for Ichabod's young self was super accurate too which was a nice touch! Marc Pickering was loveable as Young Masbath too and I was very impressed with him.This film had a very good atmosphere, and I believe is the perfect film to watch near Halloween. It had slow, steady pacing and was consistently interesting. The plot and how it unfolded was very complex too! It definitely was more than meets the eye, it perhaps got a little too complex near the end but luckily the narrative explains it well as the reveal was tense and shocking!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Amazing film,"This is an incredible, beautifully crafted film that is highly recommended. I have watched it probably five times now and every time it seems like I'm watching it for the first time. This film has a halloween themed horror genre to it that is very authentic and original because it is based in the late 1700s and there is no modern distractions in it so you an focus on the thrilling plot and keep and in depth look at the characters, especially the main character Ichabod Crane played by Johnny Depp who does a great job portraying an emotional wreck of a man who happens to be very likable at the same time. Christina Ricci suits the part perfectly of the very beautiful Katrina Van Tassel, the love interest of Johnny Depp's character.

Lives up to it's name: Both Hollow & Sleepy,"I really tried to like this one.I went in with no expectations. I ignored Johnny Depp's incredibly bad accent, his profoundly trite and exaggerated mannerisms and his hammy one liners. I dismissed the disjointed plotline and superficial characterization.About half an hour into this movie I heard the dulcet tones of someone snoring in one of the rows behind me. I thought to myself, how rude! At that point I was still under the impression that this movie had some hidden substance it was about to unleash on the audience.Tim, you're a bad bad lad. How could you rob me of my $7? I'm very sure Tim Burton fans will like this, but this movie will seriously make me reconsider ever paying to see a Tim Burton work again.The only thing which saved the movie a little maybe was Christopher Walken as the deranged face and Ray Park (Darth Maul) as the deranged stunt body of the villain. Even then Burton managed to film the action sequences with such little originality and such a heavy hand on the 'dark is cooool maaan!' lever on his camera that the action was forgettable at best.So what do we have?

"Great Looking, But Out of Balance Tone","22 August 2016. This gorgeous looking and designed period setting for the movie seems to capture the dirty, chaotic, but simple and supposedly less frantic urban life of contemporary society. The movie begins with a finely honed balanced between terrible horror and the amazing subtle Johnny Depp performance of charmingly odd and eccentricity. For the first half of the movie Depp is able to deftly insert an entertaining light, weird sense of humor among the more dark and definite nasty evil invading this quaint town. While the story teeters between science and magical horror, the second half of the movie seems to descend into a runaway riot of the fantastic that even Depp's character can't charm himself back into balance like the first half of the movie.This is a dark comedy, horror thriller that for the most part offers up sinister villains though there is something uneven and not completely convincing by the end of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"With dark visuals, impressive acting, and loads of tension, this Tim Burton movie is a stunner for the most part!","I was first introduced to ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" by Washington Irving at a very early age, when I started hearing an audio book version of it. Not long after that, I saw the short animated Disney adaptation of the story. I remember both hearing the audio book and watching the Disney cartoon several times as a kid, it must have been in the early 90's, so I had been familiar with the story for years by the time this adaptation from Tim Burton was released in 1999. However, for some reason, it took me ten years to get around to watching the whole film (I saw just a bit of it years ago), even though I've seen every other Tim Burton film with Johnny Depp. I was expecting ""Sleepy Hollow"" to be a good movie, and my expectations may have been slightly surpassed!In 1799, there has recently been more than one mysterious murder in the American town of Sleepy Hollow, and the bodies of the victims have all been found with their heads missing! A police constable named Ichabod Crane is sent from New York City to investigate, and soon after arriving in Sleepy Hollow, he is told of the Headless Horseman, the ghost of a Hessian mercenary sent during the American Revolutionary War who was caught and beheaded with his own sword! It is believed that he is the one responsible for these murders, but Ichabod doesn't believe this, and begins his investigation believing the murderer is a ""man of flesh and blood."" The constable is boarded in the home of the wealthy Van Tassels, and quickly falls in love with the family's daughter, Katrina. As he continues to investigate, he eventually sees the Headless Horseman himself, and learns that the story is true!One of the things that make this film great is Burton's dark visual style, added to the scenery, full of leafless trees. These visuals are amazing and really fit the haunting atmosphere of this horror movie! The acting here also helps the quality of the film, as Depp puts on a noteworthy performance in the lead role of Ichabod Crane, and the performances from a number of supporting cast members stand out as well, including Christopher Lee as the Burgomaster, who sends Ichabod to Sleepy Hollow, and Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman. For the vast majority of the film, there's a lot of tension, which makes most of it consistently entertaining and really keeps the adrenaline pumping! The haunting musical score adds to this. The first romance scene with Ichabod and Katrina is probably the weakest part, but after that, the scenes involving the relationship between those two characters aren't so bad, and don't hurt the film.I know this has obviously been said many times in the past ten years, but Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" does take liberties with the story. Long before sitting down to watch the whole movie, I knew they changed Ichabod's profession from schoolmaster to police constable, and now that I've watched it, I realize there are more differences than that, from what I remember about the story (which certainly isn't everything). However, I'm not complaining. Since the movie is so entertaining, I really don't think it matters how much it follows the source material! Now, unlike some versions of ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", this one is not for kids, which I'm sure one would assume with the R rating. But for adult viewers who like horror movies and admire creative filmmakers like Burton, watching this 1999 box office hit could easily be a hauntingly entertaining experience, and not likely a film one could easily forget!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Sleepy Hollow - Burton Swings the Axe and Strikes Gold,"Tim Burton is the guy who could make a funeral feel fun. With Sleepy Hollow, he blends 18th-century England with a slasher flick dripping with gunpowder and shadowy woods. The result? A gem that proves he's the undisputed king of elegant macabre. Heads fly, blood spurts, but always with style. Hitchcock would approve-and Christopher Lee already did (oh wait, he's here, too?).Johnny Depp in this film is Sherlock Holmes reimagined as a Valium-soaked emo detective. As Ichabod Crane, he's a man who startles faster than a kid watching It. Yet, somehow, he exudes an improbable charm through his awkward movements and perpetually dazed stare. It's like watching a mix between an opium-loving scholar and a socially anxious genius. Depp, during his golden years with Burton, delivers a masterclass in quirky brilliance that reminds us why we loved him before Disney turned him into Jack Sparrow on repeat.Burton paints every frame as if Rembrandt and Lovecraft teamed up to create a horror movie. The sets? Breathtaking and haunting, shrouded in thick fog and forests so eerie you'd sprint back to the city. The lighting? A macabre poetry that pays homage to classic Hammer horror films. Burton's camera dances through each scene like a grim reaper waltzing through a nightmare, keeping your eyes glued to every shadow.The violence in Sleepy Hollow borders on gleeful. The decapitations aren't just gore for gore's sake-they're bloody choreographed masterpieces, like Tarantino went goth. Every severed head is a twisted work of art. Burton manages to be both darkly fun and deeply unsettling. It's like watching Game of Thrones on fast-forward, minus the tedious desert plotlines.Howard Shore's score is a masterpiece in itself. Every note wraps you in gothic grandeur, plunging you into this hypnotic, haunted world. It's the musical equivalent of a haunted mansion played by a full symphony orchestra-epic, ominous, and perfectly in sync with the film's blood-drenched beauty.Sleepy Hollow is a gothic masterpiece-a perfect blend of horror, humor, and poetry. It's a macabre ballet directed by Tim Burton at the peak of his inspiration. Watch it once, watch it twice-head or no head, it's a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Striking visuals...little else,"OK, the film LOOKS fantastic. The scenes are almost always in darkness, there's plenty of fog and some breathtaking shots of the Headless Horseman going after his victims. Other than that, the movie is hopeless. The plot is, to put it mildly, confusing; the cast is surprisingly bad (even Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci!); and the film gets very unpleasant after a while (we are almost constantly seeing somebody's head lopped off). SPOILERS AHEAD!!! The plot is the main problem--none of the characters are clearly defined, Depp is real annoying, every single female character is a witch and it's very hard to follow (looks like there were huge chunks of dialogue edited out). They do pull it all together at the end, but there are still many unexplained characters and motivations (the witch in the cave for example). EVERYONE is bad--I never thought I'd say that about Depp and Ricci, but it's true. Also the scenes of people's heads getting lopped off gets very boring after the 8th time. Visually it's incredible though, and some of the scenes are really creepy. So if you're into visuals, you'll probably like the movie. If you want plot, character or depth--stay away.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Head-Chopping Fun,"Sleepy Hollow is definitely ranked among my five favourite films (and considering I could be ranked among the ten greatest cinema fans, that is saying something).

The only minute flaw I find is that the plot is quite difficult to follow, and you probably won't get it the first time you watch the film (if you do, have you considered joining Mensa?).

"Trite plot, but great visual experience","This film is a good example of how a movie can work even when its plot is sub par or lacking substance (Terrence Malick's The New World also comes to mind). The score, cinematography, and art direction are all superb, but the main plot is rather unoriginal and uninspired. The film piques your interest from the start but eventually devolves into a standard murder mystery. Yet in the end, the film remains a thoroughly enjoyable experience, if only for its sensory value.Tim Burton successfully creates a hauntingly beautiful Gothic setting in post-independence America, with many memorable dark scenes that will be sure to tickle your macabre fancies. Ichabod Crane's back-story is particularly disturbing yet simultaneously fascinating. The contrast between light and dark is intentionally stark, and it helps create the supernatural setting. The town of Sleepy Hollow has an uneasy feel about it, as expected, but interestingly enough, Burton's portrayal of New York is even more harrowing. The city is shown as a sort of puritanical version of Gotham, which is of course Burton's bread and butter.The film has a remarkable cast, and most of the actors turn in excellent performances. Johnny Depp is brilliant as usual, and he truly becomes the methodical Ichabod Crane who is haunted by a dark past. Christina Ricci is quite believable in her role as the down to earth and sensible Katrina Van Tassel. Miranda Richardson is the only real weak link in the cast, as her performance seems over the top and contrived. Also be ready for a let down if you are a Christopher Walken fan, as I am; though he is magnificently terrifying as the Horseman, he does not get much screen time at all. (The Horseman is headless after all--I just wish the writers could have found a way around this small detail.) This movie is a must for all Tim Burton fans. If you don't particularly care for his work however, and if you absolutely need a strong plot to interest you in a movie, you may want to pass on this film. But if you're looking for a visually stunning and creative piece of fantasy, Sleepy Hollow will not disappoint.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

A decent enough evening flick,"et us get this over with right away. I do not think Johnny Depp was the right person for playing Ichabod Crane. Maybe I am too influenced by seeing him in Pirates of The Caribbean but I just do not think he was the right person for this role. He really did not work for me. He is to whimsical and gesticulating to be taken seriously as a scientifically inclined crime investigator as far as I am concerned.Too bad since the story itself and the movie was quite promising. As is often the case with Tim Burton's work the movie has quite dark tone which I quite like. The various scruffy and suspicious characters that Ichabod meets right away as he enters the village inn fits right into the eerie atmosphere.Unfortunately Ichabod's inclination for science clashes with the rest of the story which is undoubtedly supernatural. It makes the movie not really have a distinct direction but instead waddle with one foot in each camp. I would have preferred if the movie either had gone all science and in the end Ichabod had exposed an evil but perfectly human adversary by scientific means or if it had gone all supernatural and Ichabod was an adept at exposing (exorcising) supernatural beings rather than a scientist.Having said that, the movie was still a decent enough evening flick and fairly enjoyable. The footage and scenery are well done as one would expect from Tim Burton. It is not exactly a special effects loaded movie but what is there is fairly okay, at least for a movie from 1999.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Depp Is Back With Burton,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to his last release of the decade Sleepy Hollow.Teaming up with director Tim Burton for a third time, Depp once again totally imperceptible himself in a character. He is superb. One thing I remember from 1999 was Depp not wanting Christina Ricci cast, as he had known her since she was 9 (filming Mermaids with Winina Ryder) and felt filming a love scene would have been awkward!! The scene Depp had an issue with was removed and she was cast!! I think it was a good move as she fits right in, in her second movie with Depp.The supporting cast is full of familiar faces Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths and Emperor Papatine himself Ian McDiarmid. I won't reveal who plays the headless horseman for those who have not seen it, but he is well known, it's not his first Depp movie and he was great.Burton, who jumped at the chance to make this movie after his disastrous time on Superman Lives, really knows how to set an atmosphere and he is right at home here.Depp ended the decade on a high, as Sleepy Hollow won an Oscar for Best Art Direction and was the highest grossing movie (in which he had a leading role) of Depp's career (almost doubling the gross of the previous holder Edward Scissorhands) grossing $101 million dollars at the domestic box office to end the year as the 21st highest grossing movie of 1999. It was also the first Depp led movie to cross $100 million at the domestic box office.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Well, there was nothing else on offer .........","I could never be a Tim Burton fan, and even less still one of Johnny Depp's. However, on seeing that this film is based on a story by Washington Irving, I thought I would give it a try . With the result of a few mixed feelings. My attitude towards both Burton and Depp have not changed in the slightest.Irving gave rather good accounts of stories based on the mythical and fantasy-surrealist, generally in a historic context, that is to say, in a specific place at a specific moment. His tales have become minor classics in a way. I would thoroughly recommend `Tales from The Alhambra' for example.What the film has in its favour is good photography, mostly good musical accompaniment which at times became somewhat overly present, better than good scene-setting and directing, and Christina Ricci; as well as some of the other actors playing very interesting rôles. The story is right: the treatment was a little wrong. This is basically because on a number of occasions the scenes being enacted take on a certain comic perspective, which, following Irving's story, should never have become apparent. Maybe another actor instead of Depp. No; that would not have saved the situation: Burton could not repress these comic failures, which lent nothing to the telling of the story.Anyway, it was not a worthless watch: I enjoyed some of it, even most of it. But I wish people would be more faithful to the original story when adapting one for the screen. For example, do not worry about trying to see `The Ninth Gate' starring Johnny Depp, adapted by Polanski from the novel `La Novena Puerta' by Arturo Pérez-Reverte (qv): absolutely a sacrilegious outrage which the original book does not deserve at all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Steampunk sleuth...,"One of my favorite versions of SLEEPY HOLLOW was the black and white comic book adaptation by artist Bernie Wrightson; though much shorter than the story upon which it was based, Wrightson's patented style made the comic worth reading. Likewise, Tim Burton's Hammer-driven take is worth a look: it's dark, but light; scary, yet funny. The idea of Crane (Depp) as a steampunk forensics ""expert"" was sheer genius; that he's squeamish at the sight of blood was a nice touch, too, and his fainting spells make for some fun moments. Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken and every other member of the cast are perfectly cast. The music is memorable; the cinematography to die for. If not Burton's very best (I still tend to lean toward the remake of FRANKENWEENIE, though that may be comparing apples to oranges), it's certainly ONE of them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Tim Burton's Macabre Mystery Take on Washington Irving,"Washington Irving's gothic classic The Legend of Sleepy Hollow remains one of the earliest pieces of American fiction with enduring popularity to date. So in 1999, no one better than the macabre surreal artist filmmaker Tim Burton himself managed to loosely adapt the story into a supernatural thriller. Based on a murderous slasher take on the story by makeup artist Kevin Yagher and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker, the film went on to be receive generally positive reviews and modest financial success. Although Burton fanatics don't often rank this film among his best work, there's still enough to be intrigued by.Set in 1799 New York, the story follows police constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) who is sent to the upstate Dutch town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate an onslaught of murders done by a mysterious headless horseman. Taking numerous creative liberties from Irving's tale, the film's plot is executed more as a mystery case than the tale one would expect. It is of course not without romance as Crane's fancying towards Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) is hinted at within first sight, but the main focus of the feature is the investigation behind the headless horseman's ongoing murders. While keeping its mystery intact, the determination Crane has in tracking down the evidence behind the horseman is what keeps the momentum going, and Depp carries the film through a surprising amount of sympathetic pathos and bitterness. With many of the hierarchy in Sleepy Hollow showcasing some form of guilt in relation to the horseman's killings, one could almost see a conspiracy tangling within the plot, and it's through the updated scientific methods of Crane that carry the plot on its shoulders.As for the headless horseman itself, while Christopher Walken's hammy performance should not be undermined, Ray Park's presence as the headless man could send shivers down anyone's spine, showcasing how skilled of a weapons expert he is without needing to see. Adding into all that, Rick Heinrichs and Peter Young's Oscar winning production design appropriately paints Sleepy Hollow as a gloomy sunshine ridden town where anything dangerous could be lurking, complete with props and architecture translated directly from Burton's sketchy imagination. As a clear tribute to the Hammer horror films, the specific choices in cinematography, color and even character interactions showoff Burton's abilities in bringing a long lost form of horror cinema back into the mainstream. As gory and bloody as the film is, it is all shown through artistic intent, detailing the consequences of different ideologies and the tragic fate of the horseman himself. Complete with an unsettling score from Danny Elfman and the recipe for a twisted take on Irving's story is all intact.With all of that said, there are some notable flaws in the storytelling that do keep the film from being truly magnificent. As it is established that Ichabod disapproves of late 18th century New York City's barbaric torture devices in favor of a more earnest trial, a lot of this stems from his own tragic past that also inspired his fascination of magical ornaments. While it does play a big factor in his character arc, it often gets sidelined by the main narrative and is rarely touched upon enough to leave a bigger impact to the whole of America. One would hope the film could at least acknowledge at least some notable change in direction from the beginning, and yet we're merely left with more questions than answers. Also, the original story's famous Brom Bones is merely utilized as a typical arrogant brawn over brains aristocrat whose fate is too obvious for its own good. Lastly, the ending itself is a bit too traditional for both Irving fanatics and Hollywood cynics, to the point where Crane's battle over the horseman becomes too over the top, even by Burton standards.In spite of its shortcomings, Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow nonetheless proves to be a delightfully horrifying twist on the acclaimed story, elevated by an intriguing mystery angle, gorgeous art direction, artistically crafted carnage and strong performances. Unless you're too much of an Irving purist to give this film the time of day, it is still worth checking out for its own take on the story rather than it being a fake faithful adaptation. By taking the already gothic elements of the story and expanding on them for a more macabre execution, there's much to dissect in a feature filled with eccentric filmmaking techniques.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Please Don't Call It a Remake of the Washington Irving Story,"Come on. If it weren't for the names of the characters, including the Headless Horseman, we wouldn't have clue that this had anything to do with the original. A remake has to have something to do with the original plot, even if it's butchered. For God's sake, Ichabod Crane is a police detective!? He comes to investigate murders using forensic techniques. Katrina Van Tassel is a potential suspect. Remember that Ichabod, in the original movie, was the victim. So let's let that go. If this is just a period piece it's a decent movie. It is well constructed and has some really interesting plot development. The detective must wade through the provincial prejudices against him and try to solve the murders. I suppose most of the people who went to this film had never read the original, but it bothers me that the title and characters have any connection to that story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Wow!,"I suppose any comment from me will be suspect, because I usually like Tim Burton's movies (even Mars Attacks!, 'nuff said!). I went to see this movie because it was by Burton: I like Washington Irving's stories in general, but I always considered Sleepy Hollow as a rather stupid story. Just in case you loved the movie and wish to check out the book, I say, well, don't. If I remember correctly in the story Ichabod Crane is a highly irritating schoolmaster, Katrina is a stolid but good-looking future Hausfrau, and Brom is just like in the movie, only it's he who gets the girl in the end. The screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker (he of Se7en), very intelligently turns the story into a fairy-talish comic-horror whodunit, Ichabod into an all-questioning detective whose superiors can't wait to get rid of, and Katrina into a smart witch apprentice. Johnny Depp plays his Ichabod with comic zest, Christina Ricci proves once again to be a quite talented young lady, and the rest of the cast is also excellent, including a stunning Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman (in an uncredited appearance, I believe), and  Christopher Lee and Martin Landau also shine in small parts. The Gothic-Old Flemish atmosphere is superb. This is quite the movie for you if you like your movies to be unusual and unpredictable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Legends,"Another somewhat dark and fairytale like type of film from Tim Burton, but it's also a fairly fun film. It's a pretty strong outing from both Burton and Johnny Depp. Christina Ricci is also interesting in a number of films, and well, Christopher Walken is acting royalty, is he not? Not that he really gets to show that acting off much here, but anyway, legends are legends nonetheless. Here, two legends, the Headless and the Walken unite. This isn't my favorite Tim Burton feature film, but it's among my favorites of his overall. As Burton films basically always do, his creative visuals here fit the film extremely well. 7.5/10Some days, I may even feel that this film is more like an 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
the only horror is in the editing...,"surely this film was hacked up by the studio? perhaps not but i feel there were serious flaws in the storytelling that if not attributed to the editing process could only be caused by grievously bad, criminal indeed, writing and directing.i understand the effect burton wished to achieve with the stylised acting similar to the gothic fairytale atmosphere of edward scissorhands, but here unfortunately it falls flat and achieves no mythical depth of tropes but only the offensive tripe of affectation. ie bad acting and shallow characterisation even for a fairytale.finally not that scary, indeed only mildly amusing in its attempts. the use of dialogue as a vehicle for plot background was clumsy and unnecessary. the mystery of who is the headless horseman would suffice, no need for the myth about a german mercenary, although christopher walken did cut a dashing figure but not that menacing - seeing the horsemans head makes him seem far friendlier that a decapitated inhuman nine foot tall spirit as in the original legend.no real rhythm or universal tone was ever established and not a classic in burtons oevure. stilted and clipped as my parting shot...",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
sleepy hollow is brilliant,"sleepy hollow is a truly brilliant film, there are lots of twists and turns which are guaranteed to keep you on your feet. I was most impressed when seeing it for the first time. As Johnny Depp is in it that is an added bonus most definitely. He is gifted with being able to take on lots of very different roles and there is no better actor then Johnny for doing voices. His character in Sleepy Hollow is certainly nothing like any role he's taken before. The special effects are excellent they all look very realistic. All Tim Burtons films have that magical thing about them, they are all very different to your average movie and are most definitely worth seeing, I would give Sleepy Hollow 10/10 and if you have not seen it already you are missing out because its a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
scary scary story,"Johnny Depp verily is a great actor - i think he would be just as brilliant in silent cinema, for his face and especially eyes can express any emotion. And he is a remarkable comedian. I love the way he looks in this film, and i adore the image of it in general, cold and gloomy, an excellent atmosphere for something scary to be happening all the time. So it does , but the story once frightening gets a bit grotesque and full of hilarious moments. Depp's play is just flawless, his somewhat crazy character is adorable, Christina Ricci looks amazing with blonde hair, and also i love the inimitable Christopher Walken whose character here is merely ridiculous... ooh, ten lines, finally.

Probably Burton`s Best Movie,"This opens with a great hook , maybe not as great as some of the very best hooks seen in DOCTOR WHO  and THE X-FILES but still very effective as to pulling the audience into the story . The screenwriters have also written a very well paced script that gives a background story featuring a German mercenary during the American revolutionary war . Yes it`s a good script well directed by Tim Burton who has resisted the temptation to cover the movie in his own bizarre signature , okay he has included a couple of unnecessary ( Probably solely made to give his girl friend at the time Lisa Marie a part ) dream sequences , but there`s not much else that had me think "" Oh my god a Tim Burton film , I really must do something more interesting like watch paint dry"" as can be the case with his movies . Yes it`s stylized but not to point where it becomes unbearable and I doubt if Burton will ever make a film this good againI mentioned the script and direction but perhaps the best aspect of the movie is the cast . How many movies set in late 18th century North America have characters with North American accents ? That`s right - Far too many so it`s nice to know someone had the common sense to realise that American people of that period spoke with a sort of bastardised Anglo accent and therefore it`s logical that a bunch of British character actors were cast with the American actors adopting none American sounding accents . Johnny Depp so awful accent wise in FROM HELL has no problem with his voice here and the more I see of him the more I think that he`s not taken seriously by a large amount of critics is simply down to the fact he`s just too damned good looking . Depp will one day be remembered as one of the finest actors of his generationSo a good film . Maybe not a classic but it`s well written , well acted and well directed . Almost certainly the best film by Tim Burton",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Best scary movie ever!,"This film is excellent. it is truly awesome. It has a star studded cast including Johnny Depp!. Not for the faint hearted though as this film mixes Gothic, gory and plain heads rolling around with romance, hilarity in a way and filled with the hottest of hot Johnny Depp who plays Ichabod Crane an intelligent yet perhaps slightly wimpy detective. He faints 7 times for crap's sake! I do feel the movie lacks faults as it is always good to laugh at stupid mistakes people make! This film is really worth seeing and will make you scared of axes forever. it send that cold yet exciting chill down your spine and will make you want to see it again and again. And even again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Another fairly decent offering from Burton & Depp,"Detective Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent from New York to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders and bring the culprit back to New York to face justice. Using advanced forensic techniques, Crane believes that the task that he has been given shouldn't prove too difficult, but his world is soon turned upside down when he learns that the man that he's pursuing is not quite of this world...Sleepy Hollow is another dark and somewhat macabre offering from Tim Burton and Johnny Depp (whom have both collaborated many times together over the years). I've never read Washington Irving's novel (upon which this film was based), but was interested in this film when I read the plot summary. If I'm honest I didn't find the film to be consistently thrilling, but in fairness the basic story was fairly good and had enough about it to keep me involved (particularly in respect of the Horseman and how and why he selects his victims). Due to the very fact that everyone was a bit wacky I was never quite sure who to suspect and I found it entertaining trying to piece everything together.The screenplay is pretty good, but Director Tim Burton and star Johnny Depp are both on top form as well; having worked together on a number of occasions you do get the feeling that both men understand each other fairly well. Although the film has a dark plot and overall dark feel about it, the film does still have some amusing moments and a few gentle winks from time to time which made the film slightly more enjoyable overall.Depp gives a very impassioned performance here and does make the film a lot of fun to watch. It was interesting watching him getting swept up into the mad world of the inhabitants of Sleepy Hollow. The supporting cast all do fine with what they have to work with, but this is definitely Depp's film and he carries it well.Whilst overall the film has more hits than misses I didn't find it to be entirely successful; it does have its slow stretches (particularly in the first half of the film) and character development is quite poor, but I suppose part of Burton's problem is that he does sometimes get more swept up in the style of his products at the expense of substance. It's also fair to say that the film also suffers slightly when the headless horseman isn't around.FINAL VERDICT; Worthy of your time, but with the odd miss here and there.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Very successful filming of a nice horror story.,"Before watching this movie, you should keep in mind that what Tim Burton likes and always tries to do is telling stories somewhat reminding of fairy tales. He likes to act like a ""storyteller"". Therefore, you should not take the story very seriously. For if you do, you will not understand what the movie really tells about.Sleepy Hollow is based on an English folk story about the curse of some killed warrior. Burton's filming of the story is really excellent, for the story is a really short one. Making it a long and whole film with no disturbing extras must have been a really hard job. Burton has perfectly overcome this difficulty. The natural and still thrilling atmosphere is another success of the director. He felt no need to special effects, mostly thanks to his efficient and affective use of the camera. This way, a fairy tale looks like a real story.The actings of Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci have contributed to the atmosphere to a great extent, as well: It is a horror story, yet we see no over-acting by the two leading characters. Christina's mimic-less face has been subject to criticism, but the fact that we do not know whether Katrina is good or evil is mostly thanks to that mimic-less face. Thus we see a really good acting, I think.The one problem of the movie is its editing. It looks like made in a hurry. But it does not harm the wholeness of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Visual masterwork from Burton...,"This 1999 version of the legend of Sleepy Hollow as told through the visionary director Tim Burton really stands out as being unique in many ways. First of all, and most noticeably, is the visuals and the typical Burton style of images. And that is something that really makes ""Sleepy Hollow"" an impressive movie to look at. But it is also the very impressive ensemble of casted talents that make the movie come to life so well on the screen.Without going to much into detail about the storyline, as we should all be familiar with the legend of Sleepy Hollow. Then this is the story about Ichabod Crane who comes to Sleepy Hollow in order to investigate some mysterious deaths where the victims are found without their heads.If you are familiar with other works of Tim Burton then you know what kind of setting and level of detail you are getting into here. And everything in ""Sleepy Hollow"" has exactly that. And personally I do love his unique style.The story was well told by Burton and there was a good pace to the storytelling, and a good continuous flow to the movie. So the 105 minutes that the movie runs for fly by in no time.Now, the impressive thing about ""Sleepy Hollow"" is the cast. That was just spectacular. Of course you have Johnny Depp in the lead, and here again he shows how great in collaboration with Burton that he is, and his acting was spot on for the role of Ichabod Crane. Normally I am not much of a fan of Christina Ricci, but she did a good job here. Miranda Richardson is as always phenomenal and she was so well-cast for her role. Furthermore, there are impressive talents such as Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDiarmid and Michael Gough on the cast list. And although he has not a single line in the movie, then Christopher Walken was really great in the role as the Hessian Horseman.""Sleepy Hollow"" is a very entertaining movie, regardless of you being a Burton fan or not. The story is well told, and what is there not to like about the legendary tale of the headless horseman. And furthermore, it is the type of movie that can be watched again and again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Sleepy Hollow,"This fantasy captures the essence of American folklore using the charms of Burton's film-making. Subtle and nuanced in its approach to the genre, and yet wonderfully horrific at times this flick shines with creativity unlike any film of its type in the past ten years. For those film buffs who have had their fill of sub-par filler fantasy this movie will whisk you away to a mindset you had far forgotten you possessed. All performances throughout the duration of the film where stellar and it is quite easy to tell that this cast (each chosen wisely for their role) where enjoying this film as much making it as I was watching it, which adds hugely to the film's appeal. Extending to an even broader audience this movie puts a heavy importance on its cinematography which casts itself as a narrator that not only introspectively delves into its scenes, but transports the viewer deeper and deeper into this world. Definitely a must see for those of us left with a little imagination and a yearning for out of the ordinary.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A good film with a Gothic and gloomy atmosphere.,"This film is the Tim Burton's free adaptation of the Washington Irving's classic, already several times taken to the screens. This time, Ichabod Crane is a police investigator sent to the village of Sleepy Hollow (founded by Dutch immigrants) to discover a killer who cuts and collects heads. Obviously the star of this tale could only be Johnny Depp, a bizarre movie buff and an old Burton collaborator, as well as one of the most versatile and talented actors of the day. The film also features Christina Ricci (a Wednesday from ""Addams Family""), Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon and Casper Van Dien. Christopher Lee, who was the master of terror in the seventies thanks to his extraordinary voice and diction, also makes a brief but excellent appearance.The cast is extraordinarily good and does a great job. No fish bones, as we say in Portugal. It does not deserve a single negative note: the good quality of the actors and the precise direction of Burton was a combination with impeccable results. Depp is effective, can even be funny when he can; Ricci is seductive, engaging and mysterious. Miranda Richardson does a good job but the script requires that only in the end we be able to see the true value of this actress. The scenarios and ambiance, deeply Gothic, gloomy and hazy, is mysterious and scary, preparing the audience for eventual scares and giving the film the atmosphere of a horror movie when, in fact, we are in a suspense thriller. The CGI is used with caution and prudence, getting good visual effects and sound without boring or saturating the audience, as it is supposed.Not corresponding to the original story, it is however a very good film, appeals easily to the majority of the audience and is very well done. Certain scenes can cause big scares, but overall it's not a movie I would call scary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Nice,"The works that bring a greater sobriety due to Tim Burton certainly have that fantasy footprint that are often very good and preferably have Jhonny Depp as an interpreter, resulting in a fantasy/horror style film that convinces with a stunning look . The plot is simple and as the title says, it speaks of the legend of the headless knight who torments the population and to solve this a peculiar detective is directed to end this supernatural being once and for all. Visually incredible with a photograph, scenery and beautiful costumes and has not won many technical awards, the script is well written, although I prefer a darker plot, he is efficient and knows how to introduce the characters at the beginning and make connections to them at the end, this is a positive point. The direction is by Tim Burton and he does what he knows to use the atmosphere more down to earth and make a tale of legend. In the cast the performances are good and do not leave anything to be desired. A Lenda do Cavaleiro Sem Cabeça is a typical film of tales of legend that manages to build well what he proposes despite leaving an impression that could be better.Film seen on October 31 to November 1, 2020.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Eerie Gothic Entertainment,"Sleepy Hollow manages to impressively balance out a brutally graphic premise with an interesting mystery and decidedly timely humor. It's easily one of Tim Burton's most entertaining adventures to date.Period pieces are ripe for great horror flicks. To me, the creepiest film of 2016 has been The Witch, and that's large part due to the eerie 17th century setting on a secluded farm. Sleepy Hollow is a much more habited town, but the same eerie tone is set brilliantly by cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki. I love the way he and Burton used the town itself as a character which is a part of the mystery.Speaking of the mystery, It's nice to see Burton tackle a mystery, which I believe is the only time he's ever ventured into that genre. And he handles it well for the most part. A good portion of the film focuses on why exactly a headless horseman is taking out certain members of the Sleepy Hollow community, with Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane at the center of the investigation. Crane, in typical Burton fashion, is a bit of an eccentric and unpredictable twist to his detective style. But the real issue with some of the mystery is that the third act reveals come at a rapid pace and the story gets a little convoluted.With that said, once we get caught up as an audience, Burton gives us a juicy climatic showdown with the infamous horseman, and it doesn't disappoint. He's done a few horror films, but Sleepy Hollow ranks up there with some of his best overall features. It has his distinguished tone and style with plenty of colorful kills by one of the great horror villains of all time, the headless horseman. An awkward romance and a somewhat convoluted third act prevent it from being flawless, but it's more than just your average horror entertainment.+Lubezki+Burton hits all the right beats+Amazing climax+Well-crafted-Iffy romance-Somewhat confusing reveals9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Heads You Lose,"Tim Burton absolutely feasts on this loose adaptation of the old Nathaniel Hawthorne short story. It's 1799 and Ichabod Crane is transformed into a budding young detective from New York whose belief in modern detective methods puts him very much at odds with the prevailing ""clap-'em-in-irons"" philosophy of the courts.He's sent to the small country-town of Sleepy Hollow, which is being terrorised by a supernatural being known as the Headless Horseman who charges about on his black steed, chopping off the heads of the locals. But how is this possible what's the reason for it happening at all? The initially trepidatious Crane, aided by the young son of one of the victims and the daughter of one of the suspects finally uncovers the truth and solves the case but not before many a head has fallen to the floor like so many apples from a tree.Reportedly filmed through a blue filter making the giving the movie a look reminiscent of an old-fashioned daguerreotype, Burton is naturally in his element, piling on the gore and much more with many a chase scene involving horses racing at breakneck speed, set to Danny Elfman's thunderous soundtrack. The special effects are excellent, especially the various decapitations and the Horseman's dramatic entrances from the bloody Tree of Life.Burton's favoured leading man at the time, Johnny Depp delivers a typically quirky if occasionally off-putting performance while Christina Ricci doesn't really register opposite him but thankfully they're supported by a healthy smattering of talented British actors including Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon and Richard Griffiths and even Christopher Lee who all know how to put the go into gothic.In turning Hawthorne's short story into a movie, Burton is guilty of frequently going over the top but as someone who personally likes a creepy old ghost story with the best of them, overall this was a rip-roaring Penny Dreadful, in the best sense of the phrase, of a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Strong, Mixed Emotions On This One","This is one of the few films I still watch despite it going against my principles. Like a black man not wanting to have any part of a movie that has racist overtones in it, I, as a Christian, feel likewise with the anti-Christian bias in this film.I'm just such a freak for great visual movies that it's hard for me not to view this DVD every few years as it is one of the most stunning films - cinematography- wise - I have ever seen. Anyway, this visual feast also offers interesting characters and an intriguing story, all of which make the 105 minutes fly by. For the record, what offended me was the overt promotion of ""science"" over Biblical faith. The Bible is pictured several times, always in a negative connotation, portraying Believers as nothing but superstitious bigots. The reverend in the film is pictured as just as corrupt as the town leaders. Meanwhile, Depp - the good guy in here who solves the crime - points out that science of course has the answer to every question man could have. In addition, the occult is given credence, something the Bible says should not be. So you see why I have trouble with this movie in a number of regards.But, despite all that, ii is not so heavy-handed as to deter me from enjoying the incredible visuals - one of the top ten best-looking films I've seen out of almost 10,000 - and the fact that it's an extremely interesting story with almost no profanity, either. I just look at it as a far-fetched fantasy and enjoy the wild ride.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
great Tim Burton look,"It's 1799. NYC police constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is bucking the system using modern forensic methods and being berated for it. The Judge sends him off to investigate the beheading murders in the small town of Sleepy Hollow. Wealthy Peter Van Garrett, his son Dirk and the widow Emily Winship are all found without their heads. He is boarding with Baltus Van Tassel and falls for his daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci). The elders recount the tale of a Hessian (Christopher Walken) who was beheaded during the Revolutionary war and has reborn into the headless horseman.Tim Burton brings a brilliant dark moody foggy atmosphere. I love all the designs and the look. Johnny Depp is also terrific as a science geek. I like that he's a weakling and not necessarily the heroic type. Although he has determination. Depp adds a good deal of fun. The horror element isn't very scary but it is fun. It's definitely a movie more intrigued with the style than being a thrilling horror.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Darkly comic rendering done with self-conscious style and a sneer,"Realistic decapitations--and what a host of them there are!--generally are not the stuff of dark comedy, but director Tim Burton manages a scary chuckle or two at these blood-spattered dirty doings in a Dutch farming village at the turn of the century. What's afoot? Revenge, a little black magic, and a headless horseman serving as an assassin. Adaptation of Washington Irving's story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" from screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker (working from his original treatment co-written with Kevin Yagher) has atmosphere to spare, also a loose, amiable cast (with the sole exception of a too-modern Christina Ricci as Katrina). Still, the pall of the grisly killings becomes tiresome after a while; this coupled with the bleak scenario may be prove too much for restless viewers. The screenplay isn't as solid as one might hope; why, for instance, do the residents start shutting their windows when Icabod Crane first comes into town? What are they afraid of--a resolution? And why set an escape sequence in a weathered windmill when the windmill's demise is all that's delivered? The finale is well-done, although the wherefore and why of the legend may come as a let-down to some (it was probably a daunting task for Walker as well). The film is certainly an eyeful, and a prime example of Burton's intriguing mix of self-enamored slyness, self-conscious style, slick visuals and gleeful bloodlust. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Tim Burton's visually amazing gothic tale (but slightly hollow),"Someone has said that Tim Burton's movies are more style than substance. I feel like that statement fits this film especially. I've always loved its visual look - the foggy fields and autumn-clad forests...that's perfect...but I always tend to forget what happens in the story, until watching again years later.The script is based on a quite popular novel/story so it can't be too bad. For some reason I have never read it, but someday... So, I can't exactly say if the film's main flaw is because of the book or the adaptation. Probably both. Fairytale-ish material don't easily create a very deep story unless that is the main aim of the projct....But knowing Burton he's not that kind of guy, no, he's about taking an imaginary story and making it look as fantastical as possible. I don't blame him, that's his thing. However, for example ""Big Fish"" was a film that got both right, the visuals and a story that blows me away every time. This one leaves the story a little bit on the marginal. I always seem to remember this movie as pictures painted on the canvas of my mind. When the movie was quite new, I downloaded Windows wallpapers of the movie's still images and had them in my computer. It's that kind of film.Hey, I have to comment also the cast. This will be a long paragraph. Well, I was never really a fan of Johnny Depp in this movie. He's a little bit too Johnny Depp... Not as comical as in the Pirates movies but he's a little bit quirky, and I might like a more serious performance better. Well, I'm under the impression that the character in the books might also be a bit eccentric so maybe it's just that. Then there's the lovely Christina Ricci for whom I had a crush back then when I was a teenager. Guess whose picture was on my desktop the most? Then there's of course Christopher Walken as the villain. It's a small role and he doesn't have much space to use his acting skills but he makes a cool looking monster-warrior anyway.Not done with the cast yet! Before watching the movie again tonight I did not remember that Christopher Lee was in it, the great Michael Gambon (from The Singing Detective), Michael Gough (Alfred from Batman), and Ian McDiarmid, among others. These are smaller roles but it's nice to see so many legendary actors. And the executive producer is no other than Francis Ford Coppola. Did not expect that.It's a movie that always leaves me yearning for more...something. The story does not make me feel enough something to call it a masterpiece. But still I kind of love it because of the atmosphere and simply beautiful images. Fans of gothic romanticism and Tim Burton's world of dark fairytales check it out.

"Tim Burton, and Johnny Depp make a masterpiece and exceptional piece of film.","Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" begins with a story that would not have distinguished one of the lesser films from the Hammer horror franchise and elevates it by sheer style and acting into something entertaining and sometimes rather elegant. It is one thing to see a frightened lawyer being taken for a ride in a carriage by a driver who has lost his head along the way. It is another to see the carriage bouncing down roads that have been modeled on paintings from the Hudson River School. This is the best-looking horror film since Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" It is not, however, titled ""Washington Irving's Sleepy Hollow,"" perhaps because the story has been altered out of all recognition from the Irving classic. Perhaps not. No power on earth could persuade me to reread the original and find out. What it depends upon is Burton's gift for bizarre and eccentric special effects, and a superb performance by Johnny Depp, who discards everything we may ever have learned or thought about Ichabod Crane and starts from scratch. Depp plays Crane at the ""dawn of a new millennium,"" he says, confusing the roll-over of 1799 to 1800 with the transition from the 1000s to the 2000s. It is time to discard the barbaric torture of the past, he believes, and bring the legal system up to date with improved methods of investigation and justice. He sees himself as a detective of the new order, and a New York judge, impatient with his constant interruptions, banishes him to the upstate hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, where there has been an outbreak of decapitations. Let him practice forensics there. Johnny Depp is an actor able to disappear into characters, never more readily than in one of Burton's films. Together they created Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, and now here is an Ichabod Crane who is all posture and carefully learned mannerism, attitude and fastidiousness. It's as if the Horseman gallops ahead in a traditional horror film, and Depp and Burton gallop right behind him in a satire. There's a lot of gore (the movie deserves its R rating), but it's not mean gore, if you know what I mean--it's gore dictated by the sad fate of the Headless Horseman. The ending is perhaps too traditional. We know the requirements of the genre absolutely insist on struggle between Crane and the Horseman, followed by an explanation for his strange rides, and harsh justice for those who deserve it. Burton at least does not linger over these episodes, or exploit them; he's too much in love with his moody setup to ruin the fun with final overkill. The most astonishing thing for me about the movie wasn't the Horseman anyway, but the fact that I actually found myself drawn into this old Classics Illustrated material--enthralled by a time and place so well evoked that the Horseman almost seemed natural there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Full of heady goodness,"Tim's got an undeniable knack for visuals... they'll usually be Gothic, mostly breath-taking, and always excellent. He also has a bit of a twisted side to his humor. Furthermore, he is talented in bringing colorful and well-designed creatures and characters, often of his own creation, to life. And lastly, he does atmosphere so extremely well, it's really just about beyond reproach. All of those are evident here. He takes an old and famous legend(which, I should point out, I have not read, all I know of it is what was in this, and that dull made-for-TV movie that I've also reviewed, from the same year and of the same title, save for adding ""The Legend of"" to the beginning... so I can make no comparisons or judge the accuracy of this adaptation), reinterprets it and puts together a period piece of immense enjoyment even for those not necessarily into such(I should know, I am one). The plot is interesting throughout, and develops nicely. It's not too predictable, and the twists are great. This is a rather satisfying mystery. The pacing is pretty much spot-on, this is never boring, and the action is cool and exciting... you really can not go wrong when you let Ray Park loose in front of a camera and give him someone to beat up or slash at(the choreography is masterful). This has great acting by most... putting Depp(as the squeamish and eccentric Ichabod) and Ricci(am I the only one who can just get lost in those doe-eyes?) in the same film makes perfect sense, especially under this man's direction. Even Van Dien and the children are pretty convincing. Richardson utterly steals the show, and it looks like she was as ecstatic to be in this as it is for us to watch her. The script is well-written, and the dialog is marvelous. In addition to being bleak, creepy and a stunning recreation of the look of the period(with magnificent sets and costumes), this is wacky and comical. Somehow, the tone works. Fantastic score. The FX hold up well, and are used as a tool, not the focus. A young police officer(Johnny) openly protests the horrible conditions of the justice system of 1799, and advocates science in place of imprisoning people based on pure suspicion. A judge(played by Christopher Lee, who commands the screen in his short cameo) sends him to the small town of Sleepy Hollow, under the guise that he is to capture whoever has been killing its citizens recently. What he isn't told until he gets there, is that this is no mere mortal... it is the feared headless horseman(who is built up well, and has an impact whenever we see him in this). Will he have to reconsider his stance, that everything has a natural explanation? And what, precisely, *is* going on? There is quite graphic, bloody violence and gore in this, some material is disturbing, and there is a little bit of mild sexuality and language. The DVD comes with an informational and funny commentary track by Burton, a 29 minute documentary entitled Behind the Legend(I will review it on its own page here on the site), 11 minutes of cast interviews(worth the time, note that they contain spoilers for this, as does the cast list here), a teaser and a trailer for this and finally a small photo gallery.

"""When Talking Heads Stop""","Decent watch, might watch again, and can recommend.While Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci do carry quite a bit of the movie, there is quite a lot else going on here. The horseman does tend to dominate much of this story as the original does.I don't feel there was much to the original fable of the Headless Horseman so pretty much any take you do on it seems fine: though maybe an Easter Bunny version would push some boundaries.This is about as weird, but more because it has to create a weird atmosphere, then add Depp doing weirder stuff than the weird people can handle, despite believing in ghosts which he all but fights with them about. Ichabod Crane being a smart, if cowardly, constable is interesting as he literally has the ""hero"" role painted on him.This is surprisingly more of a mystery than any other type of movie. The action is usually intense and brief when it happens, and much of the movie is spent looking for rational explanations until ocom's razor wins out.This is a good movie and a decent mystery, but I do feel it's just awkward in too many cases for most people to be on board.I expect Headless Horsemen and mystery fans to enjoy this though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
My favorite horror movie,"This is the first Johnny Depp /Tim Burton movie that i have seen. It is simply an entertaining horror movie with a nice gloomy atmosphere which I much enjoy. I am a horror fan, but I'm not the Exorcist kind of horror fan. I like this one better, it has a more Gothic, beautiful yet dark atmosphere, it doesn't rely on gore and violence, but on the creepiness of the surroundings, like the human-like trees, mist and scarecrows.It's the images that impressed me the most. The hamlet covered in darkness and mist is the most persistent image for me, and it reminds me more of a desaturated painting rather than a movie. The apparent tranquility adds to the creepiness of the whole thing, it reminds of the Grimm Brothers' stories (and of Gilliam's movie which has a very similar look by the way). Another powerful image is the town folks whose' deformed faces are like Halloween masks (the mayor, the reverend, and so forth). They seem like caricatures, which adds to the overall sense of surreal. The interior scenes resemble Dutch Renaissance paintings.Johnny Depp gives a breathtaking performance in his role of Ichabod Crane. He doesn't try too hard, which I like, and carries the whole movie. As in other Burton movies, Depp wears strange glasses at times and uses some sort of steam punk-styled gadgets. The other characters are less developed but enjoyable. I also appreciate the spectacular fighting scenes, they seem like titanic clashes between even opponents, and they are quite memorable.I give the movie 4 out of 5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Another masterpiece by Tim Burton,"The legendary fairy tale comes to life in the hands of visionary director Tim Burton, and the result is nothing short of a masterpiece.Johnny Depp is well cast as Ichabod Crane, the film's unwilling hero, in a toned down performance by the superstar. 'Sleepy Hollow' is visually stunning and atmospheric. The film features some seriously creepy moments, enhanced by excellent photography.The humor is subtle and effective, and so well performed by Depp. Humor, horror, action and fantasy blend to perfection in this mystery horror thriller. The film became more intriguing - and more horrific - as it progressed. There's literally never a dull moment here. Great acting by a veteran cast and a compelling script ensure credibility.

Quick Review,"Oh! Look there... its' a Tim Burton and Johnny Depp collaboration!Sleepy Hollow was a great film, but has lost much of its magic with the passing of the time. It's still pretty good though.The number of Hollywood's legends working on this Pictures is just mesmerizing and one of the main reasons that it works. The make-up its also exceptional and (a long with the rest of the Picture) pretty much underrated.I cannot recommend it enough, if you are seeking for a movie to pass your time.

"Visually arresting dark tale is gory, but a clever piece by Tim Burton","Embracing a dark, quirky vision and engaging characters from Washington Irving's novel 'The Legend of The Sleepy Hollow', this film sees Johnny Depp collaborating with director Tim Burton for another fantasy adventure, but with more blood and gore and less kid- friendly material than most of Burton's. With Burton taking place in the director's chair, it is only anticipated that the director captures his trademark macabre storytelling and Gothic visual atmosphere, take a look back at Burton's 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' for an example. As expected, this film embraces it beautifully, if a bit creepy. So the movie takes place in near the dawn of the 18th century where we witness a wealthy farmer, his son, and a widowed woman as they riding on a stagecoach in the middle of a dark field when they suddenly beheaded by the Headless Horseman (played by Christopher Walken). A New York City constable Ichabod Crane (played by Johnny Depp) is appointed by the government to travel out an old town of Sleep Hollows to investigate the grisly murders and bring the headless slayer to justice. Upon his investigation, he meets Katrina Can Vassel (played by Christina Ricci), the daughter of the wealthy townsman Baltas Van Tassel (played by Michael Gambon) who he gradually falls in love with. As the body count in the old town continues to rise, Ichabod is accompanied by Katrina and Masbath (played by Marc Pickering) to put an end to the Headless horseman's tyranny.This Tim Burton fantasy picture is with zero doubt creepy in both the visual and narrative department, not to mention quite gory as decapitations occur more often than a slasher flick by Wes Craven. Calling this a slasher movie set in the Victorian Age however, does a feel somewhat of an overstatement as this film's main element is visuals and storytelling than a plot of individuals getting picked off one by one. Nonetheless, there are definitely some scares to endure here as we experience some of Tim Burton's dark, creep trademark imagery, one of which includes a living tree filled with severed heads from the Headless Horseman's slayings. The visuals suite the story quite well and make up for the story's eerie atmosphere. The costume design and makeup, particularly done on Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane is dazzling and captures an accurate feel of the Victorian Age setting. The character development is fine, though the manner in which they are written give them a feel of more like caricatures than lively characters. Then again, this is Tim Burton we are talking about, and the slight quirkiness of the characters only deliver an appropriate feel for a Tim Burton picture. As Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane and Christina Ricci's character develop a relationship, we experience a romance that feels pretty weak than realistic. As a result, it is hard to buy into these two falling in alive, especially considering the heavy age gap between the actor and actress. Overall, the film's engaging, solidly paced storytelling make up for the flaws, with plenty of surprises and twists to experience.Sleepy Hollow is a visually arresting work of art by Tim Burton, one that is definitely worth checking out, but perhaps not for non-Tim Burton fans. This movie may plague with nightmarish imagery and gruesome violence, but it is done a genuine manner that never feels gratuitous or exploitative. In the end, Tim Burton's macabre storytelling, characters, and artistic visual aspect are certainly worth admiration.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Unique and beautifully crafted,"As I like Tim Burton, and I am fond of the timeless story, I was eager to see what this 1999 film was like. I also grew up on the Disney classic The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, the Headless Horseman creeped me out so badly when I was little I thought I would never see the day when I would see that topped. Now after seeing this I think I just have. The Headless Horseman is terrifying here, Christopher Walken does a phenomenal job playing him. I do agree that the story does drag on occasions, but plenty makes up for that minor fault. Visually, Sleepy Hollow is amazing, like Batman Returns and Edward Scissorhands, the sets and cinematography are dark and Gothic, and the special effects are wonderful. Also Tim Burton I think was the perfect choice for director, he is oddball and eccentric and that directorial style is perfect for this film allowing him to give a clever, unique and atmospheric take on the story. The music score by none other than maestro Danny Elfman is dark, suspenseful and haunting, like it should be. The story is a true timeless tale of horror, and really well structured here, as is the nuanced script. The performances are excellent once again, with Johnny Depp absolutely brilliant as the maverick yet intuitive Ichabod Crane and Christina Ricci fine in a poignant sort of way as the lovely Katerina. Solidly supporting them all the way are Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, Ian McDiarmid and Richard Griffiths. And of course the film is full of cruel shocks and thrills, the murder scenes are shocking and violent but not in the sense that you have to look away. Overall, very unique and beautiful take on the tale. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"""The Horseman Comes. And Tonight He Comes for You!""","Working his way through the canon of American creative geniuses, Tim Burton turned his attention from Edward D. Wood Jr. To Washington Irving with this fanciful version of 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow', previously filmed by Disney half a century earlier.Despite the Academy Award-winning production design and an attractively nerdy hero in Johnny Depp it totally lacks the delirious nihilism of 'Mars Attacks!' so Burton's only film ever to feature Christopher Lee proves surprisingly rambling and inconsequential for a production that contains copious quantities of blood and eighteen decapitations (""which must be some sort of record for any film not set during the French Revolution"", as critic Anne Billson wryly observed).",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

"Sleepy, and hollow","""Sleepy Hollow"" is a pretty accurate moniker for this version of Washington Irving's classic tale--it can make you sleepy, and it is hollow.Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane is way out of his depth here; whether by sheer inexperience, bad direction or bad writing, it is hard to tell.  Likely one of the last two, as the accomplished actress Christina Ricci scarcely comes off any better and it is such a shame.  There is too much melodrama, too much glowering and too much over-acting, all of which crushes any attempt at subtlety, if any was intended.  Some of it is plain ridiculous, and none of it scary for anyone over age ten or with an I.Q. over 70.  (Its good points: lavish scenery, and an impressive but-all-too-brief appearance by a very evil-looking Christopher Walken as the head-hungry Hessian Horseman.)And that's just the first hour.

Dark Legend,"Tim Burton directed this violent adaptation of the classic Washington Irving story that stars Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, who in this version is not a schoolteacher but a New York constable(and forward thinking scientist) who is sent by his burgomaster(played by Christopher Lee) to investigate a series of brutal decapitation murders that have occurred in the New England town of Sleepy Hollow, where he is much surprised to find the cause to be a phantom headless horseman(played by Christopher Walken) who is being used in a devious plan of revenge and profit. Christina Ricci plays his love interest Katrina Van Tassel, and Miranda Richardson plays her stepmother.Gothic film has a fine cast and superb set design & art direction, and a clever script, though is marred by too many decapitations, when that should have been left more to the imagination.

A disappointing adaptation.,"I hadn't heard much about this movie before seeing it so I was hoping it would be a period murder mystery. I was disappointed when the first overtly supernatural content surfaced. After that it became just another monster movie.The music during some parts of the movie was very annoying -- I kept thinking someone had turned up a stereo in another room of my house.I found the Ninja-style twirling of the weapons silly. The costume warn by the horseman, who was supposedly a Hessian mercenary, bore no resemblence to any uniform worn by Hessians, mounted or not, during the American Revolution.Depp's character seemed to vacilate from inept and bumbling one moment to bold and capable the next. There was no character development, he just fluctuated between Indiana Jones and Inspector Clouseau.The plot was confusing, too. There were too many characters and way to much needless bloodshed.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Headless world,"The engineering of any Tim Burton starts on the visual side. He is a master in creating his own specific and special vision for the stories he illustrates. And the word is quite correct, i think, he is fundamentally an illustrator. Most of the times he picks up stories, popular tales, slighted reinvented popular myths, and he embodies them in the creation of worlds the characters can inhabit. In a way, his mind works pretty much like that of a child, and i say it in the best way, there are few things better than a child's mind. This specific mind is interesting to visit, quirky, dark, sometimes weird, but worth the look.The problem is that most of the times, that specific vision, materialized on sets, and characterizations, is all there is to it. Many times he can't make that world really live and move once he magnificently designed it. In this matter, Burton's work is close to that of a designer, or an architect, who design spaces and objects, only for others to put life into them.The problem of this film is that. The world is darkly good to visit, everything is finely built, from a visual perspective, worth the visit. But the narrative dynamics function mostly like any ordinary commercial production, and that ruins partially the experience. There's no real mystery behind the story, and the interest in the headless knight is purely in his visual appearance (apparently the tale is quite known in the US, i didn't know it so i didn't expect anything in advance from it).Depp is a great actor, one of the best these days, and i think one of his greatest qualities is to know how to place himself in advance. To understand that as an actor, his first and most important decision is to know how his specific character should play along with the context of the film so that he allows things to flow around him and through him. So notice how, despite being a protagonist, his performance always gives space to the side characters, making us analyse and 'investigate' them, in the same measure that Depp's character is doing. We act with him. That's great. Christina Ricci plays this game with him, and successful looks 'just' a side character with an emotional angle until the right moment in the story comes. This is hard to do, i think. I appreciated it.My opinion: 3/5 check the acting, and visit the world Burton proposes.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"""Sleepy Hollow"" is good, creepy fun","Tim Burton put his own spin on the classic short story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" with the surprisingly good 1999 adaptation Sleepy Hollow. In the movie adaptation, New York detective Ichabod Crane must travel to the mysterious Sleepy Hollow in order to solve a series of murders that took place there, but realizes the town's dark history and the legend of a headless horseman might be the true culprit. Sleepy Hollow is essentially a highly stylized slasher flicks. There are lots of gory decapitations set against a fittingly Gothic tone, and although it's never truly heart-poundingly intense, there is a great atmosphere and some creepy imagery. Burton does make this movie a bit darker than his previous films (at the time), but there's still a bit of humor in its heart, mostly because of Johnny Depp's role as the Ichabod. Even though it deviates significantly from its source material, Sleepy Hollow is a fun, atmospheric movie",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
An All Time Favorite!,"""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" has been one of my favorite stories since I was a kid.

Needless to say, when I saw the advertisements for Tim Burton's take on the story I had to watch it and, to no surprise, I fell in love with Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"".The movie is full of Victorian Gothic imagery -- and, as someone mentioned, it has a bit of ""steampunk"" thrown in to the mix which really adds to all the wonderful imagery in the film.The movie is an exciting mystery which is ""peppered"" with some (Tim Burton) humor.

eerily beautiful,This movie is typical Tim Burton style but this has got to be one of his best movies. The special effects and visual effects are amazing and the cinematography is stunning. The only real flaw with this movie in my opinion is the story line but that had nothing to do with Tim Burton as this story already existed..This movie is about a young detective who is sent from the city to invesitage 3 murders in a small town. He goes there with a logical frame of mind but as rumors from the towns people include a headless horseman he is forced to think outside the box as this might be true.This movie was pretty good just not the best.

You Can't Reason With A Headless Man,"Any resemblance between Washington Irving's whimsical tale of the Hudson Valley and this Tim Burton Gothic horror fest is purely coincidental. Of course that does not mean the film isn't good. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have combined their talents to make a really good film.The original short story involved a bumpkin of a man in Ichabod Crane in love with Katrina Van Tassel who is also being courted by the local jock of the village Brom Bones. When he starts to get serious though the legendary headless horseman who is reputed to be the ghost of a Hessian mercenary from the revolution goes after Ichabad one dark and stormy night and he clears out of Sleepy Hollow. Irving is most cryptic about just what was the Headless Horseman that night.Instead of the bumpkin, Ichabad Crane is transformed into a Sherlock Holmes type constable sent from New York to uncover the mystery behind several beheadings. That's the character that Johnny Depp plays and he's soon courting Christina Ricci as Katrina to the jealousy of Casper Van Dien as Brom Bones.Tim Burton took and expanded the story and we meet the village of Sleepy Hollow who are living in mortal fear. But as Sherlock Holmes would say there is method in the seeming randomness of the Horseman and his victims. It's quite the convoluted plot that brews in Sleepy Hollow.Not only did Tim Burton get a great ensemble performance from his cast, but the film did a great job in recreating the Hudson Valley and at the beginning and end of the film, New York City in the Federalist era of the country. Great Gothic sets, I think Burton was inspired by some of the horror classics that Universal used to do back in the days of the studio system.In addition to those already mentioned, Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson as Mr.&Mrs. Van Tassel, Michael Gough as the village notary and in flashback Christopher Walken as the Horseman before he went headless should all be singled out.Sleepy Hollow is a well done film and even though it is more Tim Burton than Washington Irving it will give you more than a few frights. As for Johnny Depp as his portrayal was more Sherlock Holmes than Ichabad Crane, perhaps he'll consider doing a Sherlock Holmes movie as a future project. We can only hope.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

More Of A Murder Mystery Than A Horror Movie - And A Pretty Good One,"Being totally unfamiliar with the original story by Washington Irving (all that I knew about it was the obvious fact that it featured a headless horseman) I waded into this movie with no preconceived notions and no expectations of what was going to happen. The end result was a pretty enjoyable ghost story. Johnny Depp seemed perfectly cast here as Ichabod Crane - the New York City policeman (sort of a Sherlock Holmes-type) who gets sent to the sleepy village of Sleepy Hollow in 1799 to help investigate a series of murders in which the victims' heads have been cut off and never found. It was a typical quirky sort of role for Depp, who's teamed again with director Tim Burton. Crane wades straight into the legend of a Hessian soldier beheaded during the Revolution who now haunts Sleepy Hollow until his head is returned to him. The mystery is around who he chooses to kill and why he chooses them.That mystery is pretty well put together, although a bit confusing at times, and while it does all make perfect sense in the end, I had absolutely no idea who the person responsible for the horseman's killings was going to be. I did make a guess and it turned out to be wrong. As always, Tim Burton puts together a perfect blend of story and atmosphere that makes the movie very realistic to watch, and the special effects are very well done. Although the murders are graphically depicted, they're not especially bloody considering that they feature beheadings (especially compared to, say, the bloody gore of Burton's ""Sweeney Todd,"" which also featured Depp) and I would tend to call this a murder mystery rather than a horror movie as it's suspenseful rather than frightening. Enjoyable though it was, I found there was a period in the middle when the story seemed to lose its hold on me and I had to force myself to concentrate on it, and I'm not really sure why. I also thought Crane's arrival in Sleepy Hollow - an isolated 18th century town in which most everyone is related to everyone (a point made later in the movie) was accepted a bit too nonchalantly, given that he was a complete stranger, and small towns - even today - tend to view strangers (especially city folk) with some sense of suspicion. That may be considered by some to be an unimportant detail, but I did notice it, and it caused me to question the story's credibility from the start. Still, it's a pretty good piece of work by all involved.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Sure, it does contain gore, but it doesn't really look that realistic (I personally don't mind), the presentation of horseman, again, wasn't scary, but creepy I would say. In general, I wouldn't say that this film could scare someone. The best phrase to describe this, is ""spooky with dark humour elements"". Also it's absolutely gothic, which I love it!

Washington Irving would roll in his grave,"Having grown up IN the ORIGINAL Sleepy Hollow I've walked down the streets and through the graveyard. I've seen the landmarks a dozen times, toured Washington Irving's home, and read his original work more time then I can remember. As usual, the powers that be have taken a piece of literature and so twisted the story around that for all intents and purposes ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a completely differant story then it was. To start out with, the entire look and landscape is almost completely differant then the actual area. It is much spookier, darker, and stranger then anywhere around here that I know of. In actuality the area is actually quite pretty, sitting right on the Hudson river with only the occasional fog and rain. Second of all, the Headless Horseman never had an axe, nor did he decapitate his victims, nor did he even HAVE any victims. The original story depicts the Headless Horseman as a story, a myth, a legend of which there is no real evidence to back up his existence. Bodies were not found all over the area and the towns people were not genuinely frightened by his supposed presence. Perhaps the biggest mistake made is that of Johnny Depp's character, ""Constable Crane?"" Where did THAT one come from? Read the original story and Ichabod Crane is a clumsy, bumbling school teacher that is sent to the town as just that, a teacher. Depp's character is more reminiscent of a Van Damme or Stallone-type action hero then Irving's original character.In and of itself the movie is well done, Tim Burton chalks up another point for his visual imagery and all of the actors do their jobs well, particularly Depp, Walken, and Ricci. The only problem that remains is that again, a studio has taken a masterful story and butchered it in to a more gruesome, bloody, and differant story than it was back when Washington Irving first scribed it. Finding a copy of Irving's original text is not difficult, I urge anyone who has seen this movie to read the work and then make up your mind.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Has many moments of succeeding, but like most Burton films, a mixed-bag overall.","(Credit IMDb) The cruse of the headless horseman is the legacy of the small town of Sleepy Hollow. Spearheaded by the eager Constable Ichabod Crane and his new world ways into the quagmire of secrets and murder, secrets once laid to rest, best forgotten and now reawakened, and he too, holding a dark secret of a past once gone.Tim Burton is an artistic Director, no doubt about that, but he often does it to the point of overkill in his movies. I remember watching this as a teenager, and being wowed by it, unfortunately that wasn't the case this time around. The creepy atmosphere is clearly apparent, and Johnny Depp's out there sort of style benefits the film immensely, but the film as a whole is very inconsistent. The whole Headless Horsemen ordeal should have been much more powerful than it was, and Christopher Walken's screen-time is precious, and not as much as I'd have liked. It tries to balance a romance (Unconvincing one I might add) a creepy horror story and a heavy Gothic atmosphere all in one, and it just isn't able to do it.Performances. Johnny Depp is better then the movie itself. His weird facial ticks, his presence, and his unique style are a treat to watch. This guy is capable of anything, and it shows here. Slight criticism, his chemistry with Christina Ricci fell flat. Christina Ricci is OK, but nothing noteworthy. She looks elegant, but her part felt vastly underwhelming. Miranda Richardson has a creepy presence, and did eerily well in her part. Michael Gambon is good, while people like Michael Gough, Richard Griffiths, add some English class. Casper Van Dien is wooden in his part. Christopher Lee is sadly wasted as a Judge, while Christopher Walken could peel potatoes and look creepy doing it.Bottom line. I enjoyed bits and pieces, but the over-kill hampered the overall enjoyment for me. It's certainly worth a viewing experience, but it's not as good as the 7.5 rating indicates in my opinion.

"""Their heads weren't found severed. Their heads were not found at all""","This brought back some nostalgia from my childhood. I remember seeing Sleepy Hollow way back when it was released and being utterly entranced by it.Tim Burton's style is visually entrancing. His specialty showpieces of the Victorian era look and feel authentic, and genuine and are an aesthetically pleasing backdrop to a classic, unforgettable tale.The film blends into a few genres and has a great mixture of action, romance, suspense, mystery and intrigue.It didn't feel like a transnational horror film although Tim could have gone down that path if he wished and turned this film into a bloody, gruesome massacre.Without reading the story.

She makes each character unique and seems to belong in a variety of roles that can test out her darker side.Michael Gamndon is one of those actors that has brilliant facial expressions and is also in a plethora of films that you have probably never even realised until you go back to rewatch a swath of 90s flicks.Christopher Walken was simply just born with the right features to play a villain. Those bulging deep socket eyes and sharpened teeth as the Hessian made him look vicious and unnerving. I did feel it was borderline comical, however, the way he would scream and grunt in battle.The portal to hell or horseman's grave at the tree of the dead was a scene I vividly remember all those years ago and it still sticks with me. Especially the blood oozing from the cut tree limbs and the not-so-subtle reveal of the plethora of human heads.Another rememberable scene was when the horseman begins his siege on the church with the townspeople barricaded inside. The few minutes is non-stop entertainment that goes perfectly with the saying 'Every man for themselves"".When the culprit was finally revealed, it was probably as good a twist as it could be without being entirely surprising or gobsmacking considering the horseman had killed off all the usual suspects.There were a lot of lies, deception and coverups, meaning everyone who met their demise was in one way or another guilty so you didn't emotionally attach to anyone in particular.In conclusion, Sleepy Hollow is a lot of fun, and it could also be considered somewhat of a cult classic that you could revisit on Halloween. It fits the mood beautifully and is a film that I vividly think back to and was always meant to revisit when I was older.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"A horror film, but it's a Tim Burton horror film, make no mistake about that.","Tim Burton directed this 1999 adaptation of Washington Irving's 1820 short story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", and his trademark gothic fantasy imagery influenced by Hammer Horror films is also over the production. Even Christopher Lee makes a cameo appearance. Johnny Depp plays squeamish police constable Ichabod Crane, sent from New York City to investigate a series of murders in the village of Sleepy Hollow by a mysterious Headless Horseman, who decapitates his victims in the woods. Christopher Walken plays the ghostly rider, and the strong supporting cast also includes Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, and Michael Gambon. Despite never going beyond the thrills of the obvious, Burton keeps up the pace and tension throughout the film, aided and abetted by Danny Elfman's dramatic score and some remarkable visuals.

Tim Burton at his best!,"Just got done watching Sleepy Hollow (1999) for this review and I loved it. In fact as of this moment, this is easily my favorite movie in Tim Burton's filmography.Positives for Sleepy Hollow (1999):
This movie was a perfect recreation to the style of the Hammer Movies. The atmosphere to this movie is so emersive and creepy that I was glue to the screen. Visually, the movie looks gorgeous and it's masterfully directed by Tim Burton. Danny Elfman's score in this movie is haunting and beautiful. The movie's setting of New York City in 1799 looks amazing and the production value is absolutely phenomenal. The costume design for the characters in this movie is perfect. The acting from the entire cast are all top-notch especially from Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. And finally, there is a brilliant mix of both practical and digital effects in this movie.Overall, Sleepy Hollow (1999) is a top-tier horror movie from the 90s in every way possible and it's easily the best movie in Tim Burton's filmography.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

One of the best looking horror film in years,"What a beautiful movie to look at, it's gorgeous, Tim Burton's vision of Washington Irving's tale feels alive!'Sleepy Hollow' is the new incarnation of hammer horror, a genre long gone, and Burton is able to get the exact point that made the hammer horror films so unique. The plot is about Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a constable who moves to the town of Sleepy Hollow to solve a series of murders that have been happening there, all murders with the same M.O., their heads removed from their bodies.The screenplay is very based on the hammer style of filmmaking, it is very different from the book, confused, and well...

All i can think of is that i couldnt tell if the actors and actresses were playing a serious roll or comedy rolls.

Burton Hollow,"It's a tricky thing, updating these old, well-known stories for a modern audience. Stray too far from the source material, and you lose a lot of the spirit of the original work. Don't change things enough, and...well, you probably won't make very much money. Which brings us to Sleepy Hollow. A very well-known, American story. How does it fare?Well, it gets Burton-ized. Tim Burton leaves his fingerprints more heavily on some movies than others, and Sleepy Hollow is one of those movies. It only resembles the original story in name, location, and villain, and the rest is heavily influenced by...whatever the rest of Burton's work is influenced by. If you like that idea, then you'll like this movie. If you're tired of his visual style and cinematic signature, then Sleepy Hollow won't change your mind. I didn't feel like the tone really fit what Sleepy Hollow ""should be"", but that's just the result of a preference on my part, not necessarily a flaw. I can appreciate what Burton did in updating the tale of Ichobod Crane and the Headless Horsemen, but it didn't connect with me as well as I hoped.

Why should we want to see decapitation after meaningless decapitation? What, precisely, is ""...a Hessian"", anyway, and what has it got to do with the people of the town?

Tim Burton's spin on the Washington Irving horror classic,"This iconic story is given a new take courtesy of Tim Burton's brutal, bloody and depraved style of filmmaking. In this version, Ichabod Crane is actually a New York law enforcement official who comes to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders by decapitation. What follows is a dark journey into the underbelly of this quiet but ominous town where many a dark secret resides.Johnny Depp is exceptional as Crane, but his screen presence is complimented nicely by Christina Ricci as the young woman who seems to know more than he realizes. Miranda Richardson is devilish in a seemingly nominal supporting role that becomes more fleshed out.

Lubezki,"While I champion the separation of powers in the realm of politics, I find a certain allure in the convergence of creative forces in the world of art and literature.In the case of ""Sleepy Hollow"" (1999), Tim Burton's adaptation of Washington Irving's 1820 short story, this confluence of talent is evident. Burton, in his reimagining of the tale, enlists the collaboration of luminaries such as Emmanuel Lubezki, Scott Rudin, Kevin Yagher, Andrew Kevin Walker, and Francis Ford Coppola, amplifying the potency of his storytelling prowess. And let us not forget his long-time collaborator and friend, Danny Elfman, whose haunting score adds another layer of depth and atmosphere to the film.With its visual homage to the classic Hammer horror films and a cast as impressive as its behind-the-scenes crew, ""Sleepy Hollow"" can be considered one of the last examples of its kind. In today's cinematic landscape, dominated by mass production, such meticulous craftsmanship is becoming increasingly rare, even from a visionary like Tim Burton himself.The film's cinematography, masterfully executed by Emmanuel Lubezki, is a visual feast for the eyes. The autumnal hues of Sleepy Hollow, bathed in an ethereal mist, create a sense of haunting beauty and otherworldly dread. The camera movements, at times fluid and graceful, at others jarring and disorienting, mirror the protagonist's own journey into the heart of darkness.Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ichabod Crane, the eccentric New York City constable dispatched to investigate the mysterious murders in Sleepy Hollow, is a delightful blend of vulnerability and determination. His initial skepticism towards the supernatural is gradually eroded as he confronts the terrifying reality of the Headless Horseman. Depp's performance, nuanced and layered, brings a fresh perspective to the iconic character.The supporting cast, including Christina Ricci as the enigmatic Katrina Van Tassel and Christopher Walken as the menacing Headless Horseman, is equally impressive. Ricci's ethereal beauty and Walken's chilling presence add to the film's gothic allure.Danny Elfman's score, a masterful blend of orchestral and choral elements, is the perfect accompaniment to the film's visual splendor. The music, at times playful and whimsical, at others dark and foreboding, enhances the emotional impact of the narrative.""Sleepy Hollow"" is a film that transcends the horror genre, offering a rich tapestry of gothic romance, psychological thriller, and dark comedy. It's a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and the transformative magic of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Gotic legend,"It is good movie from creator Tim Burton, I loved the gothic atmosphere and the theme of science v magic/ fantasy. Part of The the characters were good, i think Johnny Depp were very good and make a fresh take on the science detective guy who try to solve the mystery. Christina Ricci were very interesting as the The romantic interest and also wtho who through her we learn about the ""magic"" , great supporting character. The other supporting cast were outstanding and help to the atmosphere of the film and the genre (mystory, horror, fantasy and detective movie)Unforntally this is also one of the weaking spot of the movie, the love story between Christina Ricci character and johnny depp character were a little bit unnecessary, i understand this is one of the way that the movie deals with science versus magic because he is science guy and she is witch. I am ok with that spect of the theme but the The chemistry is not there.The second problem of the film is ""The solution to the mystery"", when we find out who is the ""killer"" and who control the ""Headless Horseman"". The problem for me is that we as audience can't solve the mystery and the motive of the killer is something we can't notice him the all mystory is among the drops, On the one hand we get some clues on the other hand the all backstory of the killer and why he kill his victim is something we find out in the final act. For me in mystery-detective movie the viewer ""play"" as detective alongside the main hero, and yes there is some movie that are exceptional but for me ""Sleepy Hollow"" is not this case maybe for you it is.Overall it is great movie, great performance and and a good and present Gothic atmosphere but if you don't love blood in film horror and a little bit of grotesque this is not the movie for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

If you don't have any other reason to watch this movie, Johnny is the reason. The rest of the actors play their parts well and are enjoyable to watch.

Not hollow!

I'd go so far as to say that he is perfect for the role.I think that it could have perhaps been improved with a few more scenes focussed on the town as a whole to show the fear that was there for everyone and make it less obvious who might next get it ""In the neck"", so to speak.I could see a TV series made in the same style working well, where Ichabod would use his scientific knowledge to aid the town in its day to day living and then deal with the other-worldly elements as they crop up in a similar way to 'Buffy, The Vampire Slayer'.Overall, I like this one, it doesn't knock my socks off, but it's an enjoyable viewing experience that I can even enjoy with the Mother.718.12/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Where is Washington Irving?,"OK, I liked the picture as a horror film - but I think I would have enjoyed it more had they just used a headless horseman, and called the film something else.

Not enough blood I guess. If one has never read the original book, I'm sure they would love this film (it is visually stunning); but for someone like myself who loves the book, this picture was a great let down. The new rule in Hollywood for adapting great works of literature? Change the story, film it dark, add lots of mud, and oh yes, don't forget the blood. What a shame.

"""It's Alright! I'm Here Now!""...","Director Tim Burton's magnificently dark take on SLEEPY HOLLOW is, of course, a grownup horror version of the tale by Washington Irving.In Burton's version, Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a squeamish police investigator dispatched by the New York City Burgomaster (Christopher Lee) to the titular village, where a series of grisly, unexplained murders will test his forensic skills.Upon arrival, Crane uncovers that an allegedly supernatural killer is about, and that the villagers seem to believe they are cursed. The longer Crane remains, the more he realizes they could be right, and that there may be good reason for their fear.Packed with a dream cast of familiar British and American actors, and a brilliantly bleak script, every minute of this film is a Halloween treat! The otherwise muted, bleached color scheme, makes even small amounts of blood stand out like sudden splashes of crimson on a black and white print.Depp plays Crane as a twitchy genius who must overcome his doubts in order to face what defies his scientific training. This allows for some nifty Burton gadgets to be displayed. Christina Ricci is the perfect Katrina Van Tassel. Her look is essential for a film such as this, since she is the Barbara Steel of her day. Christopher Walken is absolutely vicious as the relentless Hession!The Horseman footage is priceless, appearing -quite convincingly- to show someone in actual need of his noggin!

"For a bad film, very good indeed","It's better for a film to have good art direction than a good cast.  Not that I want to begin by complaining about the cast.  It's always a delight to lay eyes on Christina Ricci, all the old codgers of the town are very well done, and Johnny Depp is more or less tolerable role that appears to have been written with Rowan Atkinson in mind (it's a pity he wasn't available).  But a good cast can't rescue a bad script, whereas good art direction, to some degree, can.  And, to some degree, it does.  This is a gorgeous, amazingly CONSISTENT looking film.  Sleepy Hollow is not so much a town as a world.  And the woods outside, and New York itself, belong to the very same world.  There are one or two neat cinematic ideas: the two girls with the twigs, Christina Ricci's ambiguous white cloak ... actually, that's just two, but I wasn't taking notes.But, too be honest, the visual ideas aren't THAT great.  Look at this work next to a REAL masterwork of design and the difference is at once apparent. Many of Burton's images don't even justify themselves, let alone the narrative digressions they necessitate - such as the laboured, overwrought and irrelevant whodunnit.  There's a limit, after all, to how many people can die in the attempt to prevent further deaths before it all becomes just too ridiculous, and that point is passed after an hour or so, with half the village still to die.  I don't think I've ever seen so many corpses in a detective story.  Furthermore the explanation given for Ichabod's so-called obsessions is the usual kind of childhood-rooted psycho-analytical rubbish, put in because the writers read somewhere that characters need `motivation' and didn't realise that THIS kind of motivation reduces a flesh-and-blood character to the status of a simple wind-up toy.  All that guff about the poverty of reason which WE must endure because of Ichabod's childhood trauma is predicably trite.  Basically this a confused film, at war with itself in too many ways for me to tell you them all.  Let a single instance suffice. After all of Burton's effort and guile has given us a good Headless Horseman, he becomes just another guy on a horse in the chase scene towards the end.  Ichabod actually pinches his horse! and a black denizen of Hell suddenly becomes as alarming as a spare bicycle.I wasn't kidding earlier when I said that the poor script is - to a degree - rescued by art direction.  It's refreshing to see a really-well crafted fantasy world, one that isn't just our own world in disguise.  Of course it matters that what HAPPENS in this world isn't worth recounting, but strangely it doesn't matter as much as you might think.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
The most beautiful horror film ever made,"Reviewed by FilmMining101Perhaps the most beautiful horror film ever made, Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"", an adaptation of John Irving's book ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" takes a remarkably elevated approach to the supernatural tale of the headless horseman.Courtesy of Andrew Kevin Walker's polished script (of the ""Seven"" (1995) fame), it includes a lovely spin on a whodunnit plot which involves demonic creatures chopping off heads in a remote village. What could have been easily denigrated as another entry in the creature feature genre featuring several decapitations just for the sake of it becomes an engaging story of witchcraft and betrayal. Populated with several gasp! Moments, Walker never loses focus of the narrative even when he adds efficient doses of black humor separating ""Sleepy Hollow"" from your typical bombastic and overly serious horror films that plague the audience with Satanic paranoia and banal slasher tropes.Depp relishes his role as the eccentric Constable Ichabod Crane - an alter ego for the director himself - who believes in up-to-date scientific methods and deductive reasoning, expanding his already wide roster of peculiar characters whose actions range from heroic to flat out embarrassing but nonetheless are genuine when they found themselves neck deep in such extraordinary circumstances. Surrounded by a number of dignified British theatre thespians (e.g., Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gabon), he shares excellent verbal counterpoints and a great chemistry with an appropriately elusive Christina Ricci.""Sleepy Hollow"" finds the wacky filmmaker at his creative peak, an exercise in high style delivering his own personal (expensive) homage to the Hammer horror classics by employing a monochromatic palette of black, grey and earthly tones in order to emphasize blood in rich crimson color to maximum effect. As a director with a unique visual sense, Burton and the creative minds behind the costume and production design and Emmanuel Lubezki's otherworldly cinematography managed to capture some of the best atmosphere ever put on celluloid and the setting of 19th Century helps a lot too; the forests of Sleepy Hollow are not a place you want to be bearing all the trademark characteristics of an otherworldly scenery (e.g., fog, Halloween pumpkins, clouds, witch lairs, dead trees). The rightfully Oscar winning art direction makes it clear even during the opening credits; the sun does not seem to exist replaced by a sense of dread and decay which the main antagonists brings.Speaking of the devil himself, he is a marvel of special effects and an eerie presence showcasing that you do not need a face (or a head for that matter) to provide characterization! As the primary(and unstoppable) source for decapitation, his wide range of skills offer plenty of action and suspense in several locations (e.g., a windmill, a carriage, a bridge) guaranteeing a grand guignol spectacle that fits nicely in the R-rating department slashing through the more slow but ultimately rewarding horror aspects.""Sleepy Hollow"" has the right balance of horror, action, intrigue and why not? Humor which make it so effective and downright entertaining. Under a keen eye for twisted visuals and the orchestration of unique Gothic landscapes, someone might wonder why Burton never returned to this genre (""Sweeney Todd"" (2007) excluded)? After all, he did craft the most beautiful horror film ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Come face to face with the headless horseman...unless you find yourself decapitated...,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the horror mystery Sleepy Hollow (1999) based on Washington Irving's short story about the series of murders in a small town where the headless bodies have been found. Directed by Tim Burton and starring the ever-versatile Johnny Depp as the New York City detective brought on the bizarre supernatural case, Ichabod Crane. The case itself is derived from a local myth and legends of a headless demon hunting humans. Depp's character Crane does not believe this due to his belief in logical explanations and uses his unorthodox gadgets to nail the case before the headless demon is on the prowl again.Burton nails the production and direction of this flick which has a flair of a Gothic and eerie tone which further enhances this supernatural atmosphere. In particular the mist that oozes through the town and extinguishes the lights during the night watch. Watch the scarecrow scene and you will know what I mean folks. The blood gore in this film is campy and over the top which I didn't mind at all. Depp's humour and quirkiness brings life to the character Crane and really shines in this film. His usual odd behavior in all the characters he has played gives the performance a different eccentric touch.

Besides, this is a Tim Burton film, and his Edward Scissorhands is one of my favorite films; and a few days ago I saw Ed Wood and that's a very good Burton film, too, although not on the level of Edward Scissorhands (IMO). I will say this movie looks good. Better than good actually. I must give credit where credit is due. An Academy Award went to Best Art Direction and Set Direction. To be honest, Academy Awards hold no value to me anymore, as it's mostly politics (and not my kind), but I guess the art direction hasn't yet been politicized.A missed opportunity was that there wasn't anything done with the Dutch element of the story, except maybe the visuals (I recognized some Dutch architecture). From the start, it became clear that this movie was going to be superficial entertainment, made for the big screen. I didn't care for the story, nor for the characters.

Using saturated colors, whitened skin tones, and a lot of fog, Burton successfully transports the viewer in to the magical realm where fairy tales live and legends are born. Emulating Hammer Horror Films of past, Burton stretches our reality. As a director, he is free and bold. Always making the unexpected seem ordinary and the ordinary seem like magic. Using 1899 New York as a template and the world on the brink of scientific revolution as a moving plot force, Burton further endears the American tale... only this time we get transported into the world of Icabod and his eccentricities.

80 % Wonderful ...,"Released well before Johnny Depp's star exploded in the form of Captain Jack Sparrow, this is nonetheless a well-crafted, superbly entertaining piece of film. Set in a spooky, beautiful Gothic fairy-land, the plot follows 18th Century New York detective Ichabod Crane (a man whose beliefs are rooted firmly in science) attempting to solve a very supernatural mystery in the small village of Sleepy Hollow. Surrounded by local conspirators and aided by a fearless local girl, Katrina Van Tassel, and a plucky servant boy (known to all as young Masbeth) Ichabod sets himself against the town, its elders, and an utterly terrifying foe in the form of a headless (and very dead) horseman.Depp's rising star is much in evidence as he portrays the bright, well-meaning, eccentric, scared witless but ultimately heroic Crane, with only slightly more restraint than he's brought to the likes of Willy Wonka or Edward Scissorhands. A variety of good actors and actress flesh out neatly sketched supporting characters, and there's a truly ace mystery to be solved within the film. The set pieces are stunning, the action fantastic (though very very gory) - so why the 80% rating? Plot and dialogue, sadly. The 18th century speech is often cardboard in its stiffness, and only Depp manages to liven it up. And as aforementioned, despite the excellently plotted mystery, the storyline is cluttered up with a complex (but totally unnecessary) back-story for Crane that rather detracts rather than adds to the essence of the film's major goings-on.These criticisms aside however, this is a great film and a fine way to distract yourself on a dark evening ... leaving the light on, of course.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
An Exquisite Fantasy Film 👻,"What I absolutely love about Sleepy Hollow and in general all of Tim Burton's films is that he lets the aesthetics tell the story on his behalf. A combination of gothic stage design and gloomy camera lenses dancing to a melody of pure innocence and thrill.In their 2nd collaboration ever, Johnny Depp once more helps Burton to create a corner that binds the fabric of reality to the dream. We follow the story through the eyes of an aspiring young constable from the big city of New York, who is very fixed on scientific methods, but soon we find him shaken as the world he knows gets distorted by the powers at work in this lonesome desolate town...",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Depp, not Disney (and Burton)","Based very loosely on the literary legend and set in 1799 New York, Ichabod Crane goes searching for a serial murderer who beheads his victims and is said to be a Headless Horseman who himself has no head. Johnny Depp is as usual well cast for this quirky role and there is good support from less well known actors (although the Headless Horseman is played by Christopher Walken. Interestingly, he looks a little like Depp). But this Tim Burton rendition tries to be very complex in plot and character with unusual and original spins, yet ultimately fails to deliver. The brave Ichabod inexplicably has certain phobias which do not play consistently and a troubled past that we can only guess about from his surrealistic dreams. The love interest is rushed - we wonder where Depp's character gets his passion. In a Showtime post-interview he talked about how he based Ichabod Crane on several characters from the classics and horror films of old. That comes through but finally fails in integration as does Burton's convoluted story. Effects and entertainment are there, but we are hoping for something more and we don't get it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"I... oh, my!","I'm not sure exactly what to say here. Wait... yes I do. This movie is absolutely creepy! The script is well-written, the actors do a very good job, and the suspense just kills me. Well, not literally though. I also thought the costumes were top notch. I mean, the costume designer must have worked 24/7 on them. An honourable mention goes to Danny Elfman, who has done another fantastic job on the music. May your career live on for the rest of you life, Mr. Elfman. One caution though: I *highly* recommend that you keep your young children away from this film. My little sister was at a sleepover with her youth group, and I'm glad she didn't see this. Otherwise, she would have screamed at the sight of blood splattering all over the floor. If you can stand the sight of blood, and if you love being scared, this is the movie for you. I should warn you though: this is pretty tame for a slasher flick.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Surprisingly Addictive,"I went into this movie, having already seen Planet of the Apes, thinking that it was going to be another unsucessful Tim Burton movie, but I was surprised. Sleepy Hollow is strengthened by Burton's fantastic visual imagination and Johnny Depp's wonderfully pale performance. No wonder they always say ""From the imagination of Tim Burton comes a new film..."" because this ""horror"" movie could have easily sucked. However, this is a film more darkly beautiful and strangely humorous than it is scary. Miranda Richardson is the weakest part of the movie, and she makes the last 1/3 of the movie the worst part, but with an amazingly comic, out of breath Icabod Crane by Depp, and further strengthened if not outdone by Burton's images and the great score, Sleep Hollow can be considered a surprisingly addictive and enjoyable film. Sure, this is definitely not on the same level as Batman, Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, or Nightmare Before Christmas, but for what it sets out to do, it does surprisingly well. The last third of the movie is silly, granted, but it's hard to hate this movie.My grade: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
an underrated horror movie,"""Sleepy Hollow"" was an interesting movie that caught my interest and attention from start to finish. At first, I was hesitant to watch this film because of the what critics had said about this film, but I thought to myself that everyone should judge for themselves.I thought ""Scream 3"" was scary but with ""Sleepy Hollow"" I found a movie that equaled it. ""Sleepy Hollow"" did a great job of grossing everyone out by showing the severed heads and even the insides of he heads.This movie turned out to be an incredible murder mystery that tested the mind as to figure out what the real plot was. Furthermore, I enjoyed how Tim Burton maneuvered the cast into not revealing too much of the true plot until just the right time.My favorite scenes in this movie came when the headless horsemen came out of the dead man's tree. However, every scene in ""Sleepy Hollow"" was excellent and my favorite because it kept my interest as well as wanting to know what would happen next.Depp knew just what to say and when to say it. I was truly blown away by his performance.If I ever saw a movie that was underrated, it would be ""Sleepy Hollow."" I recommend this movie because it has thrills, chills, action and dramatic scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
This Film is Far From Hollow!,Tim Burton creates an environment for his films like no other director. He seems to appreciate that by placing his characters in a space that reflects them you enhance the depth of those characters and they are made more relatable because the viewer is able to insert themselves into the environment alongside the characters.Sleepy Hollow is a visual buffet of yummy treats. Depp provides one of his career best performances. Its an incredibly atmospheric movie.I've lost count of how many times I have watched this movie and I still love it as much as I did the first time I saw it :).,8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

"""Sleepy Hollow""- Tim Burton's take on the classic story is a fiendish, frightening... and hilarious riff on an iconic tale!","Inspired by the Hammer films of old and hyper-stylish storytellers including Mario Bava, Tim Burton's 1999 release ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a successful and enthralling reinterpretation of Washington Irving's classic short-story that blends Gothic horror and slapstick comedy to an expert degree. From a script by makeup effects maestro Kevin Yagher and the delightfully twisted Andrew Kevin Walker, Burton's film aims high at bringing a tale everyone knows into the modern world of filmmaking, and it's an absolute blast from start to finish. With nonstop action and intrigue, moody and awe-inspiring atmospheric direction and a charming cast of characters who supply plenty of belly- laughs from start-to-finish, ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a wonderful film that continues to win over audiences to this very day, nearly twenty years after its initial release.Burton regular Johnny Depp stars as Ichabod Crane, a New York City police constable whose ""modern"" methods of scientific reasoning and deduction don't sit well with his by-the-books, old-school superiors. Ultimately tasked to prove that his cutting-edge ideas work, Crane is dispatched to the small village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a troubling series of murders- a number of the town's residents have been slain, their heads removed from their bodies. Upon arrival, Crane is informed by the spooked and superstitious townsfolk that there is already a suspect- a devilish, spectral figured called the ""Headless Horseman"", whom has returned from Hell to claim more victims. Ichabod soon enough learns that despite his initial hesitance, the townsfolk are correct and he is dealing with a supernatural threat from beyond the grave. And thus, he must piece together the mystery of why this demented ghost of the past has only now returned to the world of the living...In many ways, you could call ""Sleepy Hollow"" the perfect Tim Burton vehicle, and it reflects and relishes in the mastermind filmmaker's various likes and eccentricities in virtually every moment. Burton has always been a beloved and yet somewhat polarizing figure in the world of film, as he has a distinct and definite style and methodology that either speaks too audiences or leaves them feeling somewhat alienated. His leaning on moody, dark and mind-warping Gothic visuals and sharp design, in addition to strong archetypal characters are a major strength in his many films, and give his movies a feeling all their own. And I think its a perfect fit for this particular story. His ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a world that seems to exist all on its own, and it helps to ground the film in its own sort-of delightful, fairy-tale eseque atmosphere. I also very much appreciated the visual contrast he injects into many scenes, which gives the film a dream like (or even nightmarish) quality. And yet, he's clever enough to know never to go too far into the world of the strange and devious, and makes sure to punctuate almost every scene with a sharp visual gag or character-centric joke to lighten the mood.The cast of remarkable performers Burton has assembled also do great justice to the material and help to drive the film forward. Depp, a friend and regular collaborator with Burton, is just fantastic in his role as the brilliant but sometimes cowardly and bumbling constable Crane. He is clearly having a complete and utter blast, and the feeling is contagious. His take on Crane is endlessly likable and endearing, even though he's far from being a perfect man. Christina Ricci is also a great deal of fun, portraying young Katrina Van Tassel, whom joins in with Ichabod in his investigation. While her role can feel somewhat underwritten and she's more-or-less there to provide a romantic interest, she does a very good job and adds much to the proceedings by being the ""heart"" of the film. A small army of veteran character actors round out the townsfolk quite well, including Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson as the elder Van Tassel's, Richard Griffiths as a troubled Magistrate and Ian McDiarmid as the town's local doctor. They add a sense of class and realism to the proceedings that came very much appreciated. We even get a small but memorable turn from the brilliant Michael Gough as the town notary, which was a fun callback to his role in Burton's prior work on the ""Batman"" franchise. And then there's Christopher Walken, whom plays the role of the Headless Horseman in a key flashback scene early on. I won't spoil it, but fans of the actor are going to love seeing him here.I would also like to take a moment to discuss the continued collaboration between Burton and his longtime composer, Danny Elfman. While Elfman is now mostly recognized for his work on big, bombastic superhero-movie scores, a lot of his earlier compositions with Burton go under-appreciated, and I do think that ""Sleepy Hollow"" is among his most underrated work. The score for the film is just outstanding, and compliments every scene and moment fabulously. It's so deliciously moody and eerie, with a great, Gothic theme for the town and sinister background vocals in key sequences. It's just a phenomenal piece of work, and it's a shame the score doesn't get more love. It's perfect Halloween-time music.In the end, Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" continues to excel and entertain, delivering a spooky but very fun ride that could be appreciated by all ages, were it not for the large volume of gore that probably makes it a bit too harsh for younger children. The characters are endearing. The mystery genuinely interesting. And the keen mixture of horror and comedy handled exceptionally. It's another masterpiece from its talented and beloved director, and it's one of my favorite go-to's for the Halloween season. Sure, there are some minor squabbles I have with the film, and they do hold it just shy of perfection for me... but the fact remains- this is a great, fun film. And I give it a fantastic 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Sleepy Hollow,"This is probably my favourite role from Johnny Depp. Based on Irving Washington's wonderfully spooky tale, he is the scientifically minded Constable ""Ichabod Crane"" despatched by that other Tim Burton regular Christopher Lee to investigate a mysterious murder in the eponymous sleepy Dutch settlement. When he arrives, he discovers that the murders are being attributed by the seriously superstitious residents to the ""Headless Horseman"" who has returned from hell to seek vengeance upon those who betrayed him back when the United States was fighting for it's independence. It soon emerges that there are plenty of sordid and evil goings on amongst the Van Tassels - Michael Gambon, a super Miranda Richardson and Christina Ricci and their sleazy, creepy neighbours ably depicted with some great performances from Richard Griffiths, Ian McDiarmid and especially, though briefly, from Michael Gough. The story is cleverly layered and moves quickly, knitting the threads well and leading us down a path of jealousy, betrayal, witchery, and greed with the surroundings - an eerie, fogbound forest providing an excellent setting for this feature that is atmospheric and actually quite scary at times, too. I really enjoyed this - and it's still worth watching 20 years on....",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Great elaborated look at the Sleepy Hollow legend.,"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow takes a more detailed and closer look in this Tim Burton horror flick, where Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow to help solve the murders that were allegedly committed by the mysterious headless horseman. What results are an unleashing of dark secrets one after the other, and soon, it may be that the sleepy town may not be as innocent as it seems.It's a dark and eerie film with a suspenseful plot from start to finish, from the gruesome be-headings to Ichabod Crane attempting to solve the mysterious of the cursed town. The ghost intrigue builds as secrets are revealed and unpredictable moments mount, making this an entertaining and enjoyable movie throughout.The appearances of the Headless Horseman is a fantastic effect, as is the cinematography effects Sleepy Hollow, detailing the town's gloominess, dark atmosphere and turn-of-the-century look. The costumes and set designs were great; it mirrors the classic look of the 19th century.The acting was great for the most part, thought I thought some humor were forced into the story, particularly that of Johnny Depp's skirmish expressions. But, the casting director did a great job assembling such an extraordinary cast of, in addition to Depp, Christina Ricci, Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Ian McDiarmid, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and Casper Van Dien.Overall, great movie about the creepy legend - one that you can say answers all the mysteries surrounding the story.Grade A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A Guilty Pleasure Halloween Flick,"We have now come to October, my favorite month of the year, which means I'll be reviewing horror films all throughout the month. Lets start it off with an adaptation of a classic story directed by Tim Burton, that adaptation being ""Sleepy Hollow.""Probably the best thing about this movie is it's visual style. It has a great Gothic, moody environment, a very classic horror feel to it all. It is the usual Tim Burton style. You can see it in the cinematography, the production design, in almost every frame you have these great visuals. Its to bad the rest of the movie wasn't as great.Its not that the rest of the movie was bad, it just it was justOK. The acting is fine and sometimes entertaining (Christopher Walken much), but it isn't anything all that notable. The music did serve the style of the film well, but it wasn't anything memorable. The story was somewhat unique (probably because it was written by the guy who wrote ""Se7en"") but not as strange or out there as some of Tim Burton's other movies. There were also some uses of CGI in the movie that were pretty bad, and I know that the film also has a bit of a cartoonish tone in some scenes, but even then the effects were still surprisingly bad.Even though I have been criticizing this movie for not being very unique, besides the visual aspect, I still find it very entertaining and I would definitely watch it for next Halloween. Its kind of a guilty pleasure movie, its technically kinda sloppy but still enjoyable. I'd compare it to my reaction to Jurassic World,I didn't think it was very unique, but it was enjoyable none the less.Final Score: 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Tim Burton's lone horror outing is fantastic!,"Gnarled trees drip blood, Christoper Walken with sharpened teeth, and more decapitations than you can shake a stick at! Easily Tim Burton's grizzliest film and one of his most underrated. He's done many horror adjacent films, everything from BEETLEJUICE to EDWARD SCISSORHANDS to CORPSE BRIDE to DARK SHADOWS to even his BATMAN films (particularly BATMAN RETURNS), but outside of SLEEPY HOLLOW never made an out-and-out horror film and his sole horror film is fantastic! Heavily influenced by the gothic horror of Hammer Films (i.e. HORROR OF DRACULA) and the Italian horror films of Mario Bava (i.e. BLACK SUNDAY) and written by Andrew Kevin Walker, coming hot off of SEVEN and 8MM, it's a unique take on the classic Washington Irvine tale. This version has Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) as a New York City police constable sent to the rural village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders by a supposedly headless horseman. Depp is a ton of fun in this incarnation of the character, where he's miles away from the goofy Disney version. This time Crane is ugly on the inside as a smug insufferable pompous ass with little tolerance for the superstitious rubes of Sleepy Hollow. Boasting a strong supporting cast includes Christina Ricci (strangely with blond hair), Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Hammer Horror veterans Michael Gough and Christopher Lee, and Christopher Walken as the headless horseman (he has zero lines and only roars! Ray Park does the fighting scene for the headless horseman.), a great score by Danny Elfman, wonderfully dark and moody photography, it's really Burton's direction and production design by Rick Heinrichs (who's done everything from FARGO to PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN to STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI) who are the heroes of the film. Fans of gothic horror will find this film irresistible! Much like Guillermo del Toro's underseen CRIMSON PEAK, it's an old-fashioned mood piece, but unlike del Toro's film, SLEEPY HOLLOW has tons of action and moves at a fast pace as its mystery unfolds. Overall, Burton's one foray into a hard R-rated horror film is a real treat for fans of 60s Gothic horror films and more in general anyone who just wants to fun, scary, bloody good time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Action, horror comedy.","A fairly good film, though more humour than really scary. The movie employs grey colours, a drab look and a misty wintery setting. The film has many of the usual Tim Burton quirks and sort of takes the form of an old legend. The cast is actually quite good, there's some real British legends in here. Some of the action sequences are also quite well done. I wasn't sure if it was meant to be more of a horror or action or comedy, perhaps a bit of all three, much like the 1999 Mummy. Johnny Depp plays a fish out of water character dispatched to a rural village to uncover the truth. The film is pretty fantastical needless to say, you don't really believe it's even the 18th century the way a movie like Barry Lyndon was able to convey. Some of the lighting is quite odd the night scenes never really look like night. To really love this film you probably have to love it's art design, there's also the usual trope of how the real baddies are not the ghosts and ghouls but the humans who are plotting and up to no good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
About as exciting as a yawn.,"Adored by fans for his unusually charming creativity and by Hollywood for his softball, user-friendly movie-making techniques, Tim Burton tipped the scales too far in formula's favor with his new upset of a cinematic legend, Sleepy Hollow. Following the quest of Ichabod Crane  played by Johnny Depp, delivering this dreary film's only shining point  to the heart of the mystery surrounding a town's seemingly random and gruesome murders by a fabled headless horseman, the story plays out as if it were purposely trying to be repugnantly predictable. Contrived as a children's bedtime story, humdrum character introduction is laced with intended-upon exciting non-engaging chase scenes which, with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives, produce about as much fright and thrill as The Nightmare Before Christmas.Toss in an endless bundle of old trees for ambience and a wide-eyed, big-busted blonde love interest (Christina Reechi) and Burton has himself a movie that takes the age-old legend of Sleepy Hollow and succeeded in making it like a Disney movie without the charm or captivation. Dialog was choppy and ridiculous, severed heads were aplenty, and there were enough plot-revealing monologues to embarrass the likes of James Bond. Even with the backing of Emmanuel Lubezki, the most sought-after cinematographer in Hollywood today, the wonderful acting of Depp and Burton's astounding name-recognition, Sleepy Hollow is nothing to lose your head over.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

All he wants is head...,"'Sleepy Hollow (1999)' is, for my money, one of Tim Burton's best efforts. With its gloomy atmosphere and rustic yet gothic production design, the picture instantly immerses you in its period setting and fantastical nature. The narrative sees a squeamish detective with a sceptical mind and a scientific method travel to the supposedly sleepy town of Sleepy Hollow in order to investigate a series of bloody beheadings. It's a murder mystery at its core, but it revels in the sort of old-fashioned spookiness that its director so obviously adores (further evidenced by an obvious environmental reference to 'Frankenstein (1930)', which he would go on to repeat in 'Frankenweenie (2012)'). Though it isn't a particularly scary movie, it oozes atmosphere and has a lot of seasonal charm to it. Its gooey gore, blobby blood, paranoid performances, scrumptious sets, superb special effects and novel-like narrative all add up to an experience that knows - and loves - exactly what it is. Though the enigma at its core is let down by the expositional execution of its climactic reveal, it's still an interesting and engaging hook on which to hang the rest of the picture's otherworldly ambience. Every eerie element just works wonders and it amounts to a flawed yet enjoyable experience filled with delightfully devilish design. It's perhaps a little long, running a tiny bit thin as it approaches its finale, and some of it is a bit too hokey for its own good (I'd completely forgotten about Christopher Walken's sharp-toothed scene chewing and the sobering fact that it's his goofy head that's missing from the imposing shoulders of the headless horseman). Despite its issues, though, it's a well-made and entertaining affair from start to finish. As I mentioned up top, it's one of Burton's best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

More style than substance,"In ""Sleepy Hollow"" a rational detective (Ichabod Crane played by Johnny Depp) investigates the murders by a ""Headless horseman"" in the deeply superstitious village of Sleepy Hollow.Sounds like ""The hound of the Baskervilles"" (1939, Sidney Landfield), so one is inclined to believe that also in this case the monster ultimately will be man made. Yes and no! The ""follow the money"" method Ichabod applies is successful in the end, but Tim Burton wouldn't be Tim Burton if the supernatural element did not survive.The story of ""Sleepy Hollow"" is rather complicated, but the film is more about style than about substance. This is clearly demonstrated by the awards the film received:Art-direction & set decoration: Oscar winner.Prudction design: BAFTA winner.Costume design: Oscar nominee and BAFTA winner.Cinematography: Oscar nominee.Special visual effects: BAFTA nominee.From all these awards and nominations I would like to call atention to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. In his career he has collaborated with directors such as Alejandro Inarritu, Alfonso Cuaron, Joel and Ethan Coen and Terrence Malick. In ""Sleepy Hollow"" he does a very good job working with a blue filter on his camera.

"Pretentious, expensive twaddle","The horror genre relies on atmosphere and a certain amount of shock.  Sadly, many directors rely on gore to get their popcorn guzzling audience to sit through their work.  Tim Burton is an interesting director but he relies also on visual excess to cover up that his films often lack a plot. Sleepy Hollow is as its title suggests - a yawn.  Granted, the production design is spectacular, a delight to the eye, there is cleavage to delight the soul and lots of British thespians to delight the brain, but there is little else.  I was not chilled or thrilled by this pretentious, expensive twaddle.  Loosely based on the Washington Irving story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", the film is badly miscast with Johnny Depp in the role of Ichabod Crane (one wonders what Jeff Goldblum - closer to Irving's idea of Crane - would have done with the role).  Depp puts on some sort of accent while everone around him is touring the British Isles with theirs and Miranda Richardson has an inexplicably American twang which disappears from time to time.  Christina Ricci is wasted - she does not even get good frocks, only a billowing cape, the frocks are left to Miranda Richardson who gets several costume changes, some mad-woman histrionics and a bit of rumpy in the forest (why - don't ask).  Burton and his plotters play around with the original story and add some modern bits because hip, hop and happening audiences like their costume dramas with current references so they do not get lost.  An uncredited Martin Landau gets his noggin lopped off at the start and then it's on, for young and old - axes fly, heads roll, Miranda glares, push up bras strain, Danny Elfman's score goes over the top, the British thesps think of the money they're making, swallow their pride and the whole thing ends with a blatant rip-off from ""The Moonspinners"" and ""Terminator"".  This movie goes on and on and on - I can tell you there are few words you can make from the letters in the Exit sign.  I cannot spoil the plot for you because there isn't one and the revelation about the Van Tassells cheating the Van Dammes because of the Van Halens by stealing from the Van Goghs is so convoluted and uninteresting that I concentrated on the cleavage.  Incidentally, there is some sub-plot about Ichabod Crane's mum floating in a forest (dream sequence) which is a hoot - primarily because the actor playing Depp as a child is the weirdest looking kid (think Uncle Fester's love child with Monica Lewinsky) and an obscure symbol involving a red cardinal (bird).  My bottom went numb watching this and the entire cast and crew should be spanked for their crimes against intelligence.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Atmospheric Chiller,"Tim Burton's SLEEPY HOLLOW is a pretty good flick, which combines good elemental story telling with exceptional special effects. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci in the leads, lend their solid performances with the gloomy settings. The inisde jokes were good relief, in the midst of the gruesome plot. There was at least a few good references (wink-wink) to the 1958 Disney telling of this story, as well.The supporting cast was also quite good, with Jeffrey Jones, who always lends his best in any picture I've seen him in. The cameos, including the legendary Christopher Lee, were fun. Add Christopher Walken, who chew up a scene as if it were mincemeat, and we've got some great inspired casting. He clearly relished his role. Good for him!The music score by Danny Elfman was outstanding. Overall, a good pcture. The only drawbacks I encountered was the story twists started becoming predictable, and that resolution seemed pretty weak. A rather lackluster wrap up, to an otherwise exciting outing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

You can't reason with a Headless Man,"To begin; love Elfman's music, got a little Scissorhands & Nightbreed in it. If Vincent Price was alive he'd a been in this. Landau though his part was short.. love he's in it. Walken is a wonderful Horseman though i heard Brando was to be the Horseman. He'd a been good too. Didn't care for the story change of Crane not being a teacher. Boo woo! The real bridge is not covered. Like the windmill homage to Frankenstein. Like the Jack Skellington scarecrow. The dark atmosphere i like, not the comedy or obvious fake blood. Never cared for Depp, can mildly tolerate. Love the chase at the end. Love it when the horse comes out of the tree. Like Christopher Lee has small role. Like the fact they use frogs from the 1949 one. Should have had a small Horseman laugh from the 1949 one too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A cult classic horror film,"The real talent of Tim Burton is the ability to blend horror and endearing sweetness.
I like this movie, it is very unique. I am amazed how grounded the whole plot actually is. It remains throughout a murder mystery and a detective story. Onto which, Burton grafts this dark twisted fairy-tale. A fairy-tale in reverse: a horror story. It is the type of stuff parents would tell their children when they refuse to eat their vegetables, but it is geared towards adults. It works brilliantly. At least for the first two-thirds of the movie.It starts off, as a murder mystery set in Early National Period Middle Colonies. The movie keeps these two elements: the faithfully accurate historical setting and the murder mystery that explores the town's social structures throughout the film. Yet early on, it introduces supernatural horror devices. That stuff is uniquely Burtonian. It is somewhat satisfying how he twists whimsical fairy-tale tropes into horror. Which in turn is supported by terrifyingly terrific visuals. Tim Burton's style completely ascribes to all the definitions of the word ""Awe"". That is good enough to support even his lesser movies. But, here there is enough restraint on the weirdness coupled with the murder-mystery plot that keeps the whole affair grounded and enjoyable.The movie is very simple but everything is executed perfectly. Visually it is haunting and dreadful. Normally I would dislike a movie that soaks in the same colour palette, but here it is used on purpose.
Everything is grey and moody. The forest is simultaneously dense and desolate. The cinematography, except in a few key scenes, creates this sense that the clouds are low, like there is a ceiling at all times. It reinforces the feeling of being trapped and of inhospitably.The acting is good. Johnny Depp was not yet the superstar he became afterwards, he gives a very convincing sincere performance. It is almost refreshing. The rest of the cast play heavily into their respective stereotypes, but I felt Miranda Richardson really gave that little self-aware touch that makes great villains.Overall, it is a very good film although I was a bit disappointed by the third act. When the movie goes full-on fairy-tale nightmare and resolves the plot. These elements don't mesh as well when you break them down. For instance, the Witch murders some of the victims herself, when she could have the Horseman do it. It was established that was the whole point of the Horseman. Also, the windmill action scene looks very cartoonish. Ultimately, it works and the scene of the Horseman's bride is as terrifying as it should be. However, it contrasts a bit too much, in my opinion, with earlier parts of the film.This film instantly became a cult classic despite the fact that it might be a bit too awesome/awful for mainstream audiences. But, there is nothing really like it, and it is a great display of the power of cinema, an excellent use of film to tell a story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Great settling, but...","REALLY excellent gothic gloomy settling, maybe the best ever seen. It is all OK, except one thing: the plot was clearly too heavy, and they had to cut some corners to get to the end.

And finally, they couldn't save the movie from being a BIT boring near the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Good cast, good movie.","Sleepy Hollow is without a doubt Tim Burtons best film. He sure as hell ruined the Batman movies but we could almost forgive him for this little gem. Luckily this time Burton 'heads' out with the great old story of the Headless Horse man, a better than average script and, what I believe to be the winning factor, a fantastic cast. Johnny Depp was perfect for the role of Constable Craine and Ms Ricci was above par in her role as the sordid love interest. But forget them. What made this movie great was the fantastic supporting cast. Everywhere I looked I saw the familiar faces of some of my most loved actors:- Jeffrey Jones (Ravenous),Michael Gough (Alfred from Batman), Christopher Lee (Dracula},Miranda Richardson (Blackadder), Christopher Walken (Waynes World 2)and the great Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine from the Star Wars series). It was the characters of these 'supporting actors' who made this film as good as it was (especially Walken and McDiarmid).

Pretty decent horror,I felt that at times throughout the entire movie that Tim Burton was being his deliberate just plain gross self which does bother me. There was no need to go completely overboard just to impress the younger horror crowd but he did and there you have it. Johnny Depp was good and the rest of the cast was the same. It also does not have much to do with the original story so if you are looking for a carbon copy of the old Disney classic keep looking you won't find it here. Icabod Crane is called upon to investigate a series of deaths in Sleepy Hollow and begins to suspect that the young daughter of Van Tassel is more than involved. The headless horseman is also an obvious suspect as everyone's head keeps getting cut off. A good twist ending is mandatory and is duly delivered.

Washed out and wishy washy,"By now, Tim Burton has a whole genre all to himself, and this is just yet another tired and tiresome entry.  There's nothing here we haven't seen (and heard) before, time and time again.Pros:  corsets and cleavages.Cons:  just about everything else.Sorry fans, it's just a big old predictable yawn from start to finish.  The narrative meanders, the dialogue is tedious and forced, and the whole construction is based around a series of mood shots rather than any actual plot.  It's uninvolving, it's formulaic, it's overly smug, it's just plain *dull*.And accents...  yes, there are some decent attempts at 20th century psuedo-plummy English, but the thing is, people in England in 1799 were talking like Yosemite Sam.

Just saw the preview,"I just saw the preview for this movie before South Park: BIgger, Longer, & Uncut.  It looks great!  As soon as I saw the words ""A Tim Burton Film"", I knew it would be good.  Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors, he has yet to make a truly BAD film.  The Legend of Sleepy Hollow makes a perfect match with Burton's macabre style.  The cast looks great too.  Johnny Depp, Jeffrey Jones, Christopher Walken, Christina RIcci, and Christopher Lee are all great actors.  I'll be really surprised if Tim screws this one up.  I can't wait until Thanksgiving!",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A great ride!,"One can expect, in a big-budget Thanksgiving spectacular, that the story would depart from the original macabre tale of an awkward school teacher. Once you anticipate Ichabod as a preternaturally handsome, fidgity NYC constable and a healthy dose of kitsch you will find the movie easier to enjoy.Elfman's scores are always a valuable part of Burton's vision, and his music for Sleepy Hollow is no exception. Burton's presentation might have become heavy-handed for me by the end had it not been for an interesting score. His directing scheme for this one featured (you guessed it!) scenes low on color and high on mist. It has become a Burton cliche (Beetlejuice, Scissorhands, Batman, Nightmare) to give his scenes little color and his leading men lots of vertical/shadowy light, but it simply keeps working in Sleepy Hollow.Cast and acting: no real detractors (unless Ichabod's cowardice wears on you), the townspeople were well cast and thoughtfully acted, Christina Ricci has come into her own (few hints of Tuesday or Pecker's girlfriend), and Christopher Walken steals the show in his limited maniacal scenes.In all, the film could have benefitted from some better editing. In its two hours, a few too many people get killed, and though their deaths generally pack a visceral thrill, a touch of restraint might have added to the suspense. Many moviegoers will wish for more restraint in the blood dept. Believe the tagline, heads most certainly will roll; I didn't find it all that gruesome, but I can see how one might.A few times Burton cashes in on cheap thrills and laughs, but this is still his finest since Batman. The story remains interesting despite the changes and the horseman is awesome (in the traditional biblical sense of the word). Expect some Hollywood-ization of the original, suspend your disbelief and enjoy the hell out of this one on the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

An unusual detective story.,"What I expected was an horror movie, what I got was a mystery movie. It was a pleasant surprise!""Sleepy Hollow"" is stylish, dark and it has a typical atmosphere, in other words it's a typical Tim Burton movie. But having seen almost every Tim Burton movie I have to come to the conclusion that this one isn't his best movie. But does that mean it's a bad movie? Not at all!The cast is impressive and full with stars like: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Michael Gambon, Christopher Lee, Ian McDiarmid, Christopher Walken and many, many others. but thank God the cast isn't a celebrity overkill (such as in ""A Bridge too Far"" is the case.). Especially Depp as in every Tim Burton movie is brilliant! Let's hope this wasn't their last movie together.Two other things that stood out were the production design (very beautiful and typical Tim Burton sets!) and the musical score by Danny Elfman. Another thing that deserves to be mentioned are the costumes.Although the movie can be qualified as an horror film the movie never really gets scary and I don't think it was intended to be. The movie is too fun and entertaining to be.The movie has some nice dialogue especially for Ichabod Crane the Johnny Depp character. However there are some missed opportunities in the script and the conspiracy theories and when everything comes together at the ending might be a bit too much for a movie like ""Sleepy Hollow"" that should be light to watch. Also I wouldn't have minded the movie to be a few minutes longer.Nevertheless the are some wonderful moments and lot's of things that make this movie worth watching such as all the headless horseman scene's for which Ray Park did most of the fight scene's.All in all I see no reason why you shouldn't watch this movie!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Visually Stunning,"I wasn't too thrilled about the acting in this new take on the classic Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Most of the other reviewers here have stated that Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci were both spectacular, but in my opinion, almost any actor could have delivered a similar, if not better, performance. The plot, which is very different from the original story, was innovative, but the screenplay nearly ruins it by explaining the whole background in one speech towards the end instead of showing it to us.However, this movie is not a complete loss. It is almost fully redeemed by stunning cinematography and set design, as well as top-of-the-line special effects. The whole movie, from its opening scene to its ending, carries an appropriate, gloomy atmosphere. Director Burton perfectly captures the essence of 1799, better than other historical movies have been able to do. Okay, so I wasn't scared at all by this movie--it takes more than gore to frighten me--but it was an entertaining two hours. 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Thumbs Up.,"Tim Burton loves film-making and, thankfully, he and the production crew for Sleepy Hollow have created here a perfect blend of art and action that anyone can tolerate and enjoy. I pretty much forgot that Tim created 'Mars Attacks!' before this.An outspoken constable, smooth on theory but weak in practice, gets sent from New York up the Hudson Highlands to the small town of Sleepy Hollow, to investigate a series of murders.What's great about the movie, aside from the hauntingly beautiful town that was built, are the near-perfect casting of characters that inhabit and drive Sleepy Hollow. If you want a perfect example of a good Burton movie, this is it. We've all seen the familiar pursuit scenes before and there is a certain disturbing scene, that Tim Burton could not help but say, ""One of my favorite scenes, don't ask me why."" Otherwise, an entertaining feature.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

A real disappointment.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
great visuals done in by lame story,"`Sleepy Hollow,' though no worse than dozens of other similarly designed films, seems as good a spot as any to pull back and ask ourselves this question:  are special effects ruining the movies?  Time was when filmmakers, sorely hampered by technological limitations, were forced to make a virtue out of necessity and develop scripts filled with subtlety, imagination and humor to help sustain an audience's attention.   Now, all a filmmaker need do it seems is provide the barest essentials in terms of plot and character development in the vain hope that the astonishingly realistic special effects will single-handedly carry the day.  Such a philosophy, however, far more often than not, leaves the audience feeling assaulted, detached and empty, both mentally and emotionally.Like so many films, `Sleepy Hollow' starts out promisingly.  No one is better at establishing a mood of bizarre, otherworldly eeriness than director Tim Burton and `Sleepy Hollow' is certainly a total triumph in terms of its art direction, set decoration and cinematography.  Through these elements, Burton creates an entire sunless world of mist-shrouded bogs and forests, filled with twisted, gnarled trees, somber graveyards and dreary lonely roads that greet many a quaking traveler with doom and destruction.  For, in this quaint New England village of Sleepy Hollow, a number of citizens have been recently dispatched in a most inglorious way - cut down, literally, by the avenging headless horseman, their heads sliced off and carried away leaving only the decapitated bodies behind as a reminder of their earthly existence.  Into this scene of inexplicable death and carnage comes Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a New York investigator sent to the town to unravel the mystery.Very loosely based on Washington Irving's classic tale, `Sleepy Hollow,' almost inevitably it seems, violates the spirit of the original through the customary reliance on over-literalization. The headless horseman, like so many figures of classic horror literature, is a creature best left in the abstract, for once he has been realized on screen, much of the majesty and mystery that comprise his aura simply evaporate.  Absolutely nothing is left to the imagination.  He is interesting and frightening as long as he remains off-stage.  The moment he gets off his horse and starts swinging his sword in full view of the camera he loses those qualities.  Despite the magnificent atmosphere, we find ourselves growing more and more restless as the body count begins to swell, especially since the explanation for the horseman's actions, when it is finally revealed to us, comes across as both confused and uninspired.  Once again, a film filled with so much quality and potential at the beginning simply collapses under the weight of conventional storytelling and over-reliance on special effects.The writer attempts to bring humanity to Ichabod by emphasizing his nervousness, hesitancy and squeamishness, yet Depp is allowed to play the scenes with such a comic undertone that he undercuts the thriller aspects of the work.  This technique worked brilliantly in his portrayal of Ed Wood because that was a film filled with warmhearted affection for its subject. Here, the tone works against the intended mood and leaves the audience confused as to just what type of film `Sleepy Hollow' was intended to be. The flat performances delivered by Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson don't help a bit either.Thus, `Sleepy Hollow,' though definitely worth seeing for its many technical marvels, fails to emerge as a very compelling film overall.  Though I know it has become fashionable lately to pooh-pooh `The Blair Witch Project' for its lack of visualization and cinematic finesse, I sincerely believe that the sense of terror lurking in its forest far surpasses that found in Burton's, for all the latter's big budget impressiveness.  Once again, a movie proves that money alone - and great visuals to boot - cannot buy - or guarantee - a quality film.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A film worth watching,"Near the end of the 18th century, a gentleman police officer comes to a Dutch colonist community, northwards the state of New York, in order to conduct investigation around a series of repulsive murders, where the residents believe are committed by a revenging headless horseman.The rational, sober young man with his vanward, for his time, methods of medical jurisprudence, although hesitant at first, doesn't take too long to understand that the legend is based on truth, while at the same time develops a special relationship with the enigmatic daughter of a local eminent resident...Tim Burton tries to adapt one of the most popular Gothic fables of American literature (written by Irving Washington in the 1800s) to his monumental filming universe. It is obvious here, that we are a few steps away from the typical Burton thorniness (the stain of diversity and the non-acceptance by an environment intolerant), not however from the peculiar tonality that lives each of the authors work ; result of his beautiful use of stylized, austere, plain rhythm in writing, melancholy, and the use of eccentric humor and picturesqueness in narration.Brilliantly incorporated are the superbly made special effects, when, and where needed in order to accelerate the effect of fiction - while the music as well as the recreation of the era are worked and given attention in every single detail. Slightly ""slack"" remains perhaps the content, in mainly what has to do with the characters, if at the end we come to accept that the characters are not just ""ordinary"" people. The actors are doing pretty well their job, and Depp confirms with his performance that he's got more than just the looks. Anyway, none of Burton's work lacks importance and special interest, something that all his (many) fans know very well.This is a film well worth watching, scary but not too much this one has Tim Burton written all over it. There is only this little something missing that makes a great film differ from a truly amazing one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"This movie is easily the greatest Headless Horseman tale ever presented on film, animated or live action","Sleepy Hollow (1999) is a Burton gem that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows Ichabod Crane as one of the first forensic scientists who is looked down upon by the court system and sent to investigate a string of murders in a small town outside the city known as Sleepy Hollow. When he arrives there are tales of ghouls and ghosts and whispers in the streets of a family curse. At first Ichabod doesn't believe the locals but when he sees the ghoul himself he is scared into the reality of the circumstances. He will need to use a combination of his science and the locals perspectives if he hopes to stop the horseman.This movie is directed by Tim Burton (Beetlejuice) as previously referenced and stars Johnny Depp (Nightmare on Elm Street), Christina Ricci (Addams Family), Jeffrey Jones (Beetlejuice), Miranda Richardson (Spider), Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter) and Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers).The settings, look and feel of this movie couldn't have been better. The special effects, props and attire are brilliant. The cast is perfectly selected and Depp and Ricci kill their performances. Crane being a detective instead of a school teacher actually worked and was a brave switch by Burton. The horseman is perfectly presented and the background music sets the intensity of the scenes to perfection. The storyline is smart and very clever and what's going to happen Crane is always in doubt till the very last scene. The ""who done it elements"" keeps you guessing till the very end.Overall this movie is easily the greatest Headless Horseman tale ever presented on film, animated or live action.

""Sleepy Hollow"" is extremely atmospheric and really manages to capture the feel of a creepy town plagued by a monstrous headless horseman.

Entertaining modern slasher,"After a series of strange deaths, a constable sent to the tiny town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate where he finds the townspeople claim an undead headless horseman is the culprit and that there's a sinister reason for the rampage, putting him and the rest of the town in severe danger.There was a lot of stuff to enjoy with this one. One of the film's best features is that there's an incredible look to the film which makes it incredibly fun to watch. The town here looks incredible, from being completely enveloped in darkness that gives it an eerie, claustrophobic feeling of evil surrounding everything, the muddy landscapes and weather-beaten surroundings and the woods surrounding the town add immensely to that feeling which are just incredibly spectacular and worthwhile in creating an impressive atmosphere. From the look of death on the trees to the thick, heavy fog bank that overhangs the ground constantly throughout the entire film, this adds an extra dimension to it all with it's atmosphere while even more visual prowess comes from it's locations. The different areas in the forest being represented, from the Tree of the Dead to the witch's cave and the burned out shack are just fantastic-looking places that work wonders here. The fact that the killer here manages to get a lot of good stuff about it works quite well, from the imposing appearance to the fantastic back-story to the proclivity to decapitation and the different rules about his behavior, it has a lot going for the killer here. The fact that there's a lot more action scenes here than expected is another great aspect, and really helps the movie hugely. From the first scene, where he attacks a couple on a carriage without being seen, a later scene where he is confronted by a couple of swordsmen after performing a task resulting in a rather well-done and exciting fight, the chase through the woods with the two horses and the great finale that gets the great showdown at the windmill that results in some really explosive action to the fantastic, full-on carriage chase and brawl atop it as it's moving along, this one has some fantastic action scenes and works really well. The last good plus here is the film's body count, which provides plenty of good stuff about it. This one is mostly built around tons of gags for decapitations, which mostly work well, but there's also other great deaths in here that give a fantastic body count. These here are the film's good points while there's hardly anything not to like about this one. One of it's only flaws is the fact that there's a rather convoluted and really more in-depth than required back-story here. There's a point where having too much doesn't really help a film because spelling everything out either contradicts something known previously or it seems thrown in for a twist when there's no reason to add one. This one here works so much as a film about a horseman killing townspeople in a remote village, but everything with the village elders and the secret- keeping and the twist and betrayal at the end just overly complicates the film for no reason and really could've been simplified. That, coupled with the fact that some might be put off by the fantastical elements that creep in during the finale, are the film's real flaws.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Brief Nudity and a mild sex scene.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Tim Burton's greatest is the last one before the downfall!,"I heard great things about Sleepy Hollow for years, but felt i was too young to watch it, but over the past few years i really got into classic Burton, Mars Attacks! Batman and Beetlejuice being the finest of them. A chance to watch another film of Tim Burton pairing up with Johnny Depp, probably the greatest, most underrated actor of all time still, stood ahead of me when it was to be shown on TV, and as a fan, i knew a Gothic horror film with lots of decapitations made by the greatest duo in Hollywood ever was impossible to miss.Set in England, the story follows a police constable going to a secluded English village to explore the mysterious beheadings said to be done by a fabled Headless horseman. This is all the story that it needs, though there are a lot of flashbacks, but what you need to know is that this is an extremely violent, camp, Gothic and funny. With hilarious decapitations, random horse chases and even a guy getting chopped in half and another one getting impaled and dragged through a window before being beheaded.

I mean, wow, I have never seen so many heads being chopped off!I had no real expectations before watching ""Sleepy Hollow"", and I'm not really into the horror genre, but for some reason it was quite entertaining. It was full of atmosphere, and I liked the main character, played by Johnny Depp. Christina Ricci also made a pleasant appearance. She's not our typical model of Hollywood attractiveness - and I refer to that as a compliment. All in all, this movie was a nice little surprise.Rating from the Dutch judge: 7 (out of 10).",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Great Spooky Flick for the Fall Season!,"""Sleepy Hollow"" is Tim Burton's stylish 1999 take on Washington Irving's classic tale about Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman starring Johnny Depp as Crane and Christopher Walken as the Hessian horseman. The story is set in 1799 and involves Crane, a constable from New York City, going to the Dutch hamlet of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of gruesome murders where the victims are decapitated.Whether you like Burton's films or not, who can deny his talent for visuals and overall production? This guy knows how to make a film LOOK good, that's for sure. As for Depp, he portrays sleuth Ichabod in a very human manner, e.g. he's afraid of spiders and amusingly passes out on occasion.There are four things that really impress me about this picture besides Depp: (1) I love the spooky Fall atmosphere; it obviously takes place sometime in gloomy November. (2) I always thought the concept of the headless horseman was insipid, but ""Sleepy Hollow"" depicts him (it) in such a horrific/supernatural fashion that he's actually scary, not to mention skilled with weaponry and virtually unstoppable. I wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley, or anywhere else for that matter! (3) Miranda Richardson was almost 41 at the time of filming, but -- man -- is she gorgeous! Nuff said. Christina Ricci also looks great and so does Claire Skinner in a small role. (4) ""Sleepy Hollow"" lacks the goofy vibe that some of Burton's films possess; the material is presented in a respectable, generally serious manner, albeit not as ultra-serious as, say, Hammer horror.Speaking of which, ""Sleepy Hollow"" strikes me as a modern Hammer film more than anything else. Perhaps that's why Burton gave Christopher Lee a cameo. Needless to say, if you love Hammer (and who doesn't?) you'll appreciate ""Sleepy Hollow.""The last half hour or so is packed with action so if your attention starts wandering, don't worry, it picks up big time. The plot's a whodunit and it gets kinda convoluted so you'll need to pay attention (or rewatch it). Not that you HAVE to because ""Sleepy Hollow"" is such a cinematic feast you can enjoy it even if the complications of the plot lose you.There's nothing else to say except to re-emphasize that ""Sleepy Hollow"" is definitely the ideal spooky flick for the autumn, or any time really.The film runs 105 minutes and was shot entirely in England with studio stuff done in Yonkers, New York.GRADE: A-/A",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
error in chronology in 'Sleepy Hollow',"The Third Christian Millennium, by which we in the west reckon time, began on January 1, 2001. There was much debate at the time that the former Millennium ended with 1999 and began with January 1 2000 - this was wrong and this erroneous thinking was reflected in the movie 'Sleepy Hollow', which was set in 1799.The character of Crane mentioned that the old century had ended when January 1 1800 began. At this moment in time the old century, the 18th, had one more year to run.Roman Centurions, as the title states, commanded 100, not 99 persons. We are not one year old until we have lived a full 365 days after our birth - until then we are just living a time span.Centuries end at the completion of the hundredth year, not the 99th and thus 1799 was not the last year of the 18th Century.Roger DESHON - 07 3 824 2981 Australia",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Visually Stunning,"A true Fairytale horror story. Tim Burton takes us to a very fairytale place. With masterful sets and costumes. The details are Stunning. We're brought back in time to the seventeen-hundreds. To a man trying to introduce forensic science into detective work. He is laughed at and shamed. Then sent on an impossible task to solve the mystery of Sleepy Hollow.Johnny Depp is brilliant for this role. He stands out from everyone in a sense that this guy is different. He's so young and handsome. Mysterious. He really brought his character to life. The Sleepy Hollow mystery was intriguing and kept the viewer guessing the entire time. Lots of headless gore.

Burton's finest to date!,"I've just seen Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow at the first Swiss press screening and I'm absolutely delighted by this thoroughly stylish movie. I can hardly wait until it.In Sleepy Hollow, Burton combined all his skills to create an original, though classic blend of horror, fairy tale and even fantasy. But it is undoubtedly a work mainly for adults, in contrast to some of his earlier films (e.g. Batman, Mars Attacks). There are quite many gory scenes that also make this film great fun for Splatter freaks (I proudly admit that I am one). Sleepy Hollow delivers and kicks other recent horror films you know where (especially the terribly overrated The Sixth Sense).NOT TO BE MISSED!

Visually captivating must see! Odd Phantom Menace Parallels too...,"A great film all around, and in many ways (visually for one) Tim Burton's best work yet. Superb casting (Depp, Ricci, and Christopher Walken--could you think of any three actors who more perfectly fit Burton's style?) direction, set design and cinematography make this a must see.On a different note, anybody notice the Phantom Menace ""parallels""? First I notice that one of the main characters is none other than Ian McDiarmid, AKA Senator Palpatine/The Emperor. Then about 3/4 of the way through the film, there's a scene that, without giving anything away, looks like a straight take-off of a famous TPM scene involving Darth Maul, only in this case it's the ""Headless Horseman"". THEN I find out that the stunt double for the Horseman is none other than Ray Park, AKA Darth Maul! Pretty odd stuff. Anybody know if it was intentional?

Unfunny gothic Frank Drebin alights on Sleepy Hollow.,"I found this very disappointing, and I like Tim Burton. The whole film seemed like ""Naked Gun 4:Ye Olde Days"" starring Johnny Depp as an incredibly unfunny Frank Drebin, and I honestly couldn't stop thinking this whenever I saw him on screen. Christina Ricci's character seems so false and irritating I kept wishing she would loose her head in her opening scene! Saying this, the story is very good and Christopher Walken plays the most amazing character, although he is seen all too briefly for my liking - not much work for a lot of money no doubt. Miranda Richardson is by far the best talent in the film, unless Walken had more screen time. The story runs well but it seems to have missed what it was aiming for and doesn't know if it's trying to be a comedy or a gothic horror, and in this case the two just don't seem to mix.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a good film to watch late night,Sleepy Hollow is a good film and the haunting atmosphere and the fantastic production design are the primary reasons for it. Johnny Depp as the milquetoast constable Ichabod Crane is more than competent and frankly I could not have envisioned anyone in this role. Supporting cast are Christina Ricci and Casper Van Dien and of course Christopher Walken as the scary headless horseman. The pacing is excellent although I feel this is a niche film and you need to watch it with a certain mindset.,,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Great throwback rich in atmosphere and style,"Sleepy Hollow is a great throwback with a genuinely engaging mystery at its centre, offering satisfying answers to the biggest questions it poses without sacrificing the supernatural element that makes it so much more exciting. It moves at a really nice speed and plays with some of the most common tropes to show that it isn't afraid to pull its punches when it comes to the rising body count.Johnny Depp is terrific as he's in full control of his quirks and commits to them in an earnest fashion which makes him more likeable. He's gifted at this specific type of comedy too as he constantly gets into awkward situations and it's clear he has no idea what to do through his extremely expressive reactions. He's surrounded by a supporting cast full of accomplished character actors who are chewing all the scenery in sight.Tim Burton's direction is amazing with a rich atmosphere that haunts the entire film. Films that are this visually bleak and constantly grey rarely look this good and that choice pays off wonderfully by making the bloodiest moments stand out just as much visually as they do in shock value. There's also a lot of impressive stunt work on display with stunt men doing lots of swordplay and horse riding all whilst headless.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"A well told and impeccably crafted, if flawed, story.","My roommate walked in midway through; within 10 seconds he had commented on how good the colors looked.This was my first Burton, and having heard much about his style I had high expectations. Sleepy Hollow met them head on with a captivating score and palette for a rock solid cast. Burton departs from the titular tale for a vaguely similar story thats equal parts noir, romance and slasher. Where such an ambitious collage inhibits many films, here it produces a thoroughly engaging picture that moves much faster than its runtime. There's always something to look at, something to feel- to call Sleepy Hollow boring at any point would be sacrilege.Though I was disappointed by the original story not playing a greater role, I thought the writing held up for much of its run. Depp does a great job playing a complicated and well developed character, one equal parts courageous, timid, and sociable. The Horseman is a fantastic villain.Tim Burton displays a mastery of filmmaking throughout, but for all Sleepy Hollow's gothic glory I thought it really bungled the ending. Casting the spotlight on your worst character (and actress) is never a good idea, and the exposition dump made this feel more like a kid's movie than it should have.I imagine this gets lost in the film's other aspects, but at times this is really funny.

A Hauntingly Beautiful Gothic Mystery,"Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow delivers a visually stunning and darkly atmospheric retelling of the classic Washington Irving tale. With its hauntingly beautiful cinematography and eerie production design, this film embodies everything you'd expect from Burton: a macabre yet enchanting visual feast.Johnny Depp gives an engaging performance as Ichabod Crane, bringing a quirky charm to the role of the eccentric investigator. Christina Ricci is ethereal as Katrina Van Tassel, and her presence adds a touch of innocence to the story's dark undertones. The chemistry between the leads is subtle but fitting for the gothic tone.The film's greatest strength lies in its aesthetic. From fog-drenched forests to candlelit interiors, every frame feels meticulously crafted to immerse you in the chilling world of Sleepy Hollow. The Headless Horseman, portrayed with menacing precision, is a memorable villain whose appearances are both terrifying and thrilling.While the movie excels in style, the story can feel somewhat predictable at times, and its pacing occasionally falters. However, the unique blend of horror, mystery, and dark humor keeps it engaging throughout. Danny Elfman's haunting score further enhances the film's gothic vibe, perfectly complementing the eerie visuals.Sleepy Hollow may not be flawless, but it's a captivating gothic mystery that showcases Tim Burton's unparalleled ability to create an immersive and spooky world. It's a must-watch for fans of gothic horror and Burton's signature style.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Tim Burton Gets Heads Up,"Like it says on the DVD sleeve, ""Master storyteller Tim Burton weaves an eerie, enchanting version of this classic tale of horror. Jonny Depp is 'Ichabod Crane', an eccentric investigator determined to stop the murderous 'Headless Horseman'. Christina Ricci is 'Katrina Van Tassel', the beautiful and mysterious girl with secret ties to the supernatural terror."" Director Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" gallops very far away from the classic short story read in high school (at least the one I attended); though, the plot enhancements make it a better feature-length film. This version of ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" should be taken as a completely different story.Herein, Mr. Depp plays Washington Irving's ugly Connecticut schoolmaster as an attractive, faint-hearted New York constable. He is sent to solve a series of mysterious decapitation murders in small-town ""Sleepy Hollow"".Squeamish and scientific, Depp is convinced the supernatural forces are not a factor in the crimes, but events continuously challenge his scientific belief system. Interestingly, Depp is given an appealing sidekick, Marc Pickering as ""Young Masbeth"". The film has the sense of humor welcome in horror, but often goes overbroad with one-liners and blood-splattering ""camp"". Yet, the fantastical ""Sleepy Hollow"" world created by Burton, Emmanuel Lubezki, Rick Heinrichs, Peter Young, and the production crew can't be overlooked.

The photography and set design is just amazing, its visual stunning to the eye and also ties in so well to the story.  There is quite a bit of gore, fairly similar to the type of gore in films such as reanimator, Evil Dead etc- its a real horror, but a horror/comedy/romance all rolled in to one. The story in its entirity works really well, it takes a while for the whole plot to unravel, but it keeps all of us guessing. Johnny Depp is in fine form as is Christina Ricci.

Pure Tim Burton.,"Sleepy Hollow is visually stunning, filled with great sets and a perfect mood to capture the horror and creepiness of the situation. Tim Burton is a master of this genre, and he uses his skills with special effects to give some really effective scenes involving the Headless Horseman chasing down people and taking their heads. What is different about Washington Irving's legend is the story. Burton takes the famed character Ichabod Crane, and turns him from a gangly, unsightly school teacher to a mild-mannered, handsome constable who wants to use modern-day techniques to discover murderers and cause of death. Johnny Depp is very good, as usual, playing Crane as a smart intellectual who sometimes lets his fears and emotions get in the way of his work. Christina Ricci is good as well, but looks to be about only 12 here. What doesn't work here, like many of Burton's films, is the story. The opening quarter is very scary and suspenseful and pulls you right in. The last fifteen minutes or so really drop off and don't really take the audience any further. I was expecting a bigger twist here, since this is done by the man who wrote Se7ven. Still, this is a scary thrill-ride that feeds the emotions but not the brain. If only Burton would start doing that, he might be one of the best in Hollywood instead of one of the better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Visually impressive!,"Sleepy Hollow is driven by a bunch of pretty good actors acting pretty well, a few cheap (the maid, etc.) and a few great (Mary van Tassel's sister, Katrina's fiancee) decapitation/gore scenes, a good mystery horror story with comedic elements, many wonderful sets and environents, great stage design, good looking sterile colors, beautiful cinematography and costumes, and of course a hot and lovely Christina. Elfman did a great job on the score. And hey, Ichabod's mother has a sweet pair of bumps there :o)Where this movie lacks most is the directing (Tim Burton is okay, but he doesn't even try to do better) and the screenplay. Ichabod and Katrina are oh so in love but there's not even one real kiss shown in the whole movie. At the end Ichabod's character hasn't changed at all - he's still the same arrogant and snooty looser of a townsman although he has seen a lot since the day he has arrived at Sleepy Hollow. The red blood was too bright, looking artificial and ridiculous (good Hollywood blood - and real blood - has a solid dark wine red color and is not bright red beverage like looking ;-). Many many more holes in the screenplay (and probably the original story too? haven't read the book).

Halloween Candy In November?,"Entertainment ala Burton. Sinister cinematic visuals, colored with light anecdote, and occasional sophomoric animation.The movie is worthy of viewing, keynoting the word view, but do not contemplate, or expect overpowering dialogue or story development. In fact, the grand finale will likely trouble you with a lengthy recitation of events that were not (but could have been) interwoven and developed in the plot. Therefore, throughout the movie, glimpses of seemingly unrelated, unimportant scenes will be presented (with audience wondering ""when will this stuff culminate""). Yet, a unique story (not Irving's original) is refreshing novelty, creating more curiosity and suspense. Criminology and forensics are tested against the Legend of Sleepy Hollow.Moments of blood spurting, and dismemberment are forthcoming. Several Krafty, aka ""cheesy"", lines (this grammatical twist being representative of the film, not the reviewer) occasionally induce laughter. A few instances of characters with cartoonlike eye bulging and lolling tongues....during horror scenes....were reminiscent of Beetle Juice or Looney Tunes, and were out of synch with movie's flavor. In fact, more horrific than the Headless Horseman, it was hard to discern whether these effects were meant for horror or laughter. Costume, lighting, and other visual display are unarguably horror apperpo and convincingly eerie. Handsomely imaginative investigatory tools wielded by Crane are reminiscent of ""Scissorhands"", grotesquely large, clumsy, mechanical devices.In summation, a light-hearted ""fright"" movie earning early respect with handsome imagery and notable actors.

"Burton creates a respctful adaptation with good moments of dark humor, mainly using cartoonish violence with blood spurting and when the Knight decapitates his victims","Adapting Washington Irving's classic gothic thriller tale Sleepy Hollow, Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is an audiovisually inspired retelling of one of the oldest pieces of American literature. As is customary in Burton's work, the weight of the classic work of Rip Van Winkle's author is barely felt in his construction of the film. The director is comfortable drawing inspiration from specific points in the tale to support an original story of his own.Well, before the attacks begin it's clear that there are several changes to Irving's tale. For those who know the tale, you know that this story is not enough to sustain a feature alone. What Andrew Kevin Walker's script proposes in this adaptation is to create something more for the story, not just the Knight chasing Ichabod. Walker creates a very cohesive plot, which manages to make the film stand. For this, he creates very characteristic characters, who, despite following the standards of mystery stories (the investigator, the girl, the assistant, the suspects, etc.) are rich, far from being seen as one-dimensional. It's not a brilliant script, but it proves to be very functional.Sleepy Hollow blends the reality of the fierce warriors of the past who impaled and decapitated their victims for sheer sadistic pleasure, with the supernatural fiction of ghosts who return from hell to continue to shed blood through their swords. The union of these elements resulted in a film aggressive for its violence, despite good moments of dark humor, and fun for its gothic characterizations, not to mention the several tributes that Tim Burton did both with the specially invited actors and the references of old movies. Tim Burton had already done this in much more detail in the parody of FC Mars Attacks! (96), where he pays homage to all the old sci-fi clichés of the 50s and 60s, the era of ""bull-eyed monsters"" and the paranoia of communist invasion of the United States, in an exercise of pure nostalgia and entertainment, with explicit references to several classics of the ""B"" cinema such as The Day the Earth Stood Still (51), The Invasion of the Flying Saucers (56), The War of the Worlds (53) and Planet of the Apes (68).While adaptations of the story often build suspense around the misty airs of the village itself, giving centrality to the love triangle between Ichabod, Katrina (Christina Ricci) and Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien) - as is the case with Disney animation, for example - the film prefers to pursue the supernatural possibility of Sleepy Hollow. No longer the symbol of a nocturnal tale, the specter here becomes the very real central figure of a supernatural thriller. Expanding from the appearance (always too short) of the mythological Christopher Lee, the cast of British actors playing a highly suspicious group of elite from the village of Sleepy Hollow manages to mix airs of police suspense with the horror of string embodied in Hammer Film productions. With dialogues and interpretations always well aligned, the interaction between the characters is the strong point of the script, which brings very basic dialogues and situations, presented in the constantly interesting light of suspense.The plot structure, therefore, turns out to be far from a horror movie. While the tape does have a fair share of beheadings and explicit sequences, the gore is surreally stylized enough to get closer to the playful aspect of Halloween. In particular, the use of bright and blood-saturated red in contrast to the bronze-grey tones that predominate the rest of the time help to give the tone of the narrative, which flirts all the time with comedy, but which luckily knows the way. Back home. The horror scenes themselves function more as interludes than developments in the narrative itself. Among them, the attack on the Killian family deserves to be highlighted, which brings the commonplaces of the genre well aligned in an unusual moment of subtlety, where Sleepy Hollow appears properly as a horror movie monster. Most of the time, however, the confrontation takes place through Ichabod's precarious Sherlockian activities, and moments of action that are much more reminiscent of a carefree adventure than the imminent despair of a murderous pursuit.There are several memorable scenes throughout the film, such as the autopsy performed by the detective on the corpse of a pregnant woman, victim of the decapitator, where a precise cut in the abdomen also denounces the decapitation of the fetus, which left the young man covered in blood looking like a butcher in a slaughterhouse; the detective's nightmares set in his childhood, in a moment where he enters a torture chamber and sees his mother, Lady Crane (Lisa Marie), dying imprisoned in a brutal instrument of torture of the Inquisition that tore all his flesh and tore his body in a bloodbath; the sequence of the duel between the decapitating knight and a brave young man, Brom Van Brunt (played by Casper Van Dien, from Starship Troopers, 97), where after a long battle of swords, the villain, wielding two slashing weapons in his hands with supernatural skill , quarters the youth in two pieces; the moment where the detective, looking for clues about the location of Sleepy Hollow's grave, comes into contact with a forest witch (actually the sister of Lady Van Tassel, who also witnessed the villain's death), who reveals to him the existence and map of the ""tree of the dead"" through demon possession; the scene where the young Crane, in possession of a great axe, strikes several blows at the roots of the ""tree of the dead"" and with each blow a huge spurt of blood spurted from the tree staining his face; or the final sequence of the fight between Sleepy Hollow and the detective in an abandoned windmill, in a clear reference to the classic Frankenstein (31), where also in the final sequence the creature and the creator mortally confront each other in an identical windmill.Burton develops a horror film that is not extremely heavy - the decapitation scenes themselves involve little blood, which is explained within the narrative, except for a few - and that brings some of that fun and strangely comic atmosphere that he has in other works. What really stands out is the production value. The exceptional production design by Rick Hendricks - Burton's old collaborator - draws a lot of attention not only for the reconstitution of the village, but mainly for making it sound safe and there is always some detail in the scenario that makes him suspicious, especially when the Red color. Of course we see references to German expressionism, the main one being the incredible Tree of the Dead that really manages to be scary. The same can be said for the visuals of the creatures - especially the Hessen and its sharp teeth - and the characters, which says a lot about them. Further details of Hendricks' majestic work can be seen in a quick scene that looks like the ghosts of the Knight's victims in a fireplace, showing what a rich work it is.We can't talk about the visuals, not to mention the brilliant Emmanuel Lubezki's photography that creates the whole atmosphere of the film. Using a monochromatic color palette, low contrast, wide-angle lenses and lots of shadow, Lubezki's work proves to be very important for creating suspense. Even the flashes of artificial lightning that appear every time the Knight attacks works not only as a feature to warn of the monster's presence, but serve to emphasize the threat of the place. Another factor that draws attention is how Burton and Lubezki work with red, which shows the strongest color in the film. As said, the palette is monochromatic, but there is an intelligence in the use of a few colors to give more life to the film. The aforementioned red is always linked to violence (the blood, the carpet in the dreams that the protagonist sees his mother dead and the clothes of the English in the death of the Hesse) while the violet represents peace and love (the flowers and the costume of Katrina). It's just another amazing job for Lubezki's career. For this creation of the atmosphere, a trail is needed that can bring the spectator to the feeling of constant fear that exists in the city. Merits to another frequent Burton collaborator, songwriter Danny Elfman. Even having its characteristics from other works he did in collaboration with the director (the use of wind instruments and choir), Elfman's score follows the same suspenseful tone throughout the film, but doesn't sound boring or repetitive.All the well-executed setting, rich style and tribute character do not save the film from suffering a little from the effects of a thriller with an explicitly predictable resolution. Added to a sometimes too apathetic performance on the part of Ricci, these factors make the third act undoubtedly the weak point of the production. Luckily, the fun action scenes and very precisely executed visual effects make up for the effect, even if they don't save the story at the plot level. Sleepy Hollow is a beautiful and engaging film beyond its plot limitations. In its innate eccentricity, it's a very focused production, the kind that seems to want to know where to go, and which luckily delivers on most of its promises. In addition to the visual care in the composition of the images, Burton creates the atmosphere well and conducts the mystery very well so that the viewer discovers the next clue together with Ichabod. In addition to being able to recreate good moments from Hammer movies (the Knight's attacks follow the same trends: they throw everything and he doesn't fall) and creates good moments of dark humor, mainly using cartoonish violence with blood spurting and when the Knight decapitates his victims, heads seem to fly. It's a very efficient drive on the part of the renowned director.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"It is you, Ichabod Crane, who is now put to the test.","Sleepy Hollow is directed by Tim Burton and co-adapted to screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker and Kevin Yagher from the The Legend of Sleepy Hollow written by Washington Irving. It stars Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Marc Pickering, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones and Casper Van Dien. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki.1799 New York, and Ichabod Crane, a timid but forward thinking detective, is sent to the way out village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a number of decapitations.A perfect match of director and actor to the source material, Sleepy Hollow unfolds as a fun filled creeper of such visual and aural pleasures, it's a wonder nobody thought to put the combination together earlier than 1999. Story is familiar, though with a few changes, and although some of the comedy ends up a bit sillier than is tonally appropriate (really, Ichabod, stop pushing the effeminate angle to breaking point) , film runs along at a fair old clip and never wants for period devilment. It's never really scary when Walken's headless horseman isn't part of the scene, but it's very unlikely that Burton or Depp were aiming to soil underwear anyway. More a case of charming you whilst caressing the tingler on your spine. A case of style of substance? Yes, to a degree, but the source story still comes through the lavish eye candy painting to reveal itself proudly.Burton had created a world of Gothic mysticism, a blend of Hammer horror values and Brothers Grimm bad dreams, a land of swirling mists and tall shadows, where black, red and purple are essential colours. From the quaint duck pond in the centre of the village, to a creaky old windmill, there are visual treats galore here; which are enhanced magnificently by Elfman's foreboding rumbles. Costuming is first rate (Colleen Atwood), as is Lubezki's colour lensing and Rick Heinrich's production design. The cast are led superbly by Depp and appear to be pitching performances at just the right tone, such is the director's want. Although Ricci is sadly underused in a key role, and we could have done with more Richardson since she is wonderfully catty and yummy in equal measure. But with bona fide thespian quality in the support ranks (joining Gambon and Jones are Michael Gough, Ian McDiarmid and Richard Griffiths), picture never falls short of scene enhancers.Period peril with a glint in its eye, Sleepy Hollow is a delightful nights entertainment by the fire. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A simple film revisiting a classic story plot.,"When one wonders just how good a film can be when you take out the excessive gore and brutality, one can see that some films are still good.  Sleepy Hollow is an example where avoiding excessive special effects, and relying on simple acting can be an effective combination.  The plot is from the old classic novel.  This film takes on a moderate pace and is fairly sterile of the modern social pollution, although one routinely sees that every actress under the age of 40 is wearing a wonderbra and exposing her chest as if it were fashionable.  I can't say that the film was too difficult to relate with, which must mean that the acting was fair or adequate.  The special effects of the headless horseman galloping down the foggy countryside was excellent.  There is little more to the story that has yet to be developed. It is obvious that the novel was not really written for film, but it produced a mildly entertaining result when it was re-created for this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"More like ""SLOPPY Hollow""","All dressed up with no place to go. Sure, Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" is absolutely gorgeous to look at, but the script is cluttered and perfunctory and there is no suspense at all. A great disappointment. This version takes a practically foolproof story and tells it badly. It astonishes me the way viewers will so frequently be duped by movies that look ""cool"" but have no substance, no vitality, no reason for being. The plot is by no means ""complex"" as some other comments have asserted, it's just badly confused. There is no sense of mystery, no sense of awe of the supernatural that made Washington Irving's source material so timeless. There is none of that here. Instead, we yawn as a series of poorly drawn, interchangeable characters get their heads lopped off by the leaden, mechanical horseman - a villain about as scary (as depicted here) as Prince Charles riding around playing polo at night. Then, once you see him without his horse, lumbering around in pursuit of victims on foot, you really have to scratch your head. How can Burton not know that the Horseman has to always be kept somewhere in the shadows and on horseback to function as a legendary ghoul and the stuff of nightmares? You put him right out in the open and he's as common and scary as a tax collector going door to door.The cast is mostly uncertain. That is the thing that stands out the most in bad movies: the uncertain, purposeless look on actors' faces as they struggle to find their characters' motivation; something, anything to grab onto. Christina Ricci does a lot of that here. She simply looks like someone who isn't quite sure. The child actor Marc Pickering as Young Masbath, Ichabod's young protege, fares even worse. Burton was obviously looking for someone (who looks quite a bit like he himself must have looked as a child, incidentally) with an unschooled quality, but one always gets the uneasy feeling when the boy's on screen that he's just as likely to wander over to some piece of film equipment and inquire ""What's this do?""Burton favorite Jeffrey Jones? Stands around in the shadows during his brief time on screen waiting for scraps of boring exposition to be thrown his way. Caspar Van Dien? Completely wasted as Bram Van Brunt, who should be Ichabod's romantic rival for Ricci's affections and dark antagonist, but cluelessly marginalized here. Miranda Richardson, one of the most highly regarded actresses of her generation? Amazingly, she gives a terrible performance, with contemporary sounding line readings that are totally out of sync with the time period (1800).Then there's Johnny Depp as Ichabod. At least he is trying to have some fun with the part and doesn't sleepwalk through it the way he did so maladroitly in ""The Astronaut's Wife"". The prissy mannerisms, the always slightly ruffled air - there is a texture to his performance that at times fits nicely with the film's fetishistically textured visuals. This helps for a while, but he is ultimately hobbled by the weak, unimaginative dialogue he is too often given to speak and a character so diluted and distorted from Irving's original that his Ichabod appears to the audience as irreconcilable fragments, not a whole.I had wondered last year why this movie, which had such an enormous opening week, dribbled to a final U.S. take of only around $100 million. Now I see why. Bad word of mouth. In film after film after film these days, with their bombastic soundtracks, schizophrenic editing and overheated direction; I form the same image in my head as I'm watching them self-destruct in front of me: that of an incompetent clown flubbing his juggling routine badly but smiling out upon his audience just the same with all too eager eyes.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Beautiful cinematography but ludicrous acting and storyline,"I am a huge admirer of the calibre of the performances of Mr Johnny Depp, but was so badly let down by this poorly acted, ridiculous story that had all the workings of a cheap ""Tales from the Dark Side"" half-hour schedule-filler (and could certainly have been edited down to such a length), plus all the schlock naffness of a ghost-trainride in a backwater village in Sussex. The over-all hammy acting from most of the cast, coupled with a story too stupid to entertain an over-imaginative child, meant that yet again I had wasted 105 minutes of my precious life in front of the TV screen.The cinematography was good, yes, but so it should be for $65m. This was a classic case of style over content, fuelled by special effects that would delight no one bar the nerd and the simpleminded.As far as the story is concerned, if it deserves so flattering a description as the word ""story"", Depp plays Ichabod Crane in the role of the sceptical investigator from New York, sent to Sleepy Hollow to unravel the murder by decapitation of three of the multiply-inbred residents. The locals talk of a headless horseman who has committed the murders but Depp, who prefers to analyse fact from a scientific point of view and refuses to believe in the supernatural, thinks the locals are talking crap. Hmmm, where have we seen this before?  Special Agent Dana Scully, sorry, Ichabod Crane, attempts to work out a logical explanation until he too sees the horseman. To say any more about the storyline, if you could call it that, would be to spoil any enjoyment that a reader of these comments may one day sustain, as there really isn't an awful lot more than this. Christina Ricci plays the love interest, and enough said about that the better. The year is 1799 and, as Crane remarks at the beginning of the movie, ""The millennium is almost upon us"". Whether he meant to say that the century is almost upon them, whether he was being very forward-thinking, whether late 18th century New York was already gripped by Millennium Fever, or whether in fact the script-writer was, I will leave that up to you. But it set the scene for a film that had clearly spent most of the budget on special effects (or rather, on the same special effect repeated throughout, namely the removal of heads) without paying too much attention to the dialogue or to how it was delivered.The worst thing about this movie was that it has made me approach Depp's future films with caution, a feeling I would never have associated before within myself when preparing to watch one of his films. That this superb actor, whose great performances include Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, The Brave and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, could not shine from amongst acting as wooden as the trees in the forests around Sleepy Hollow, must say something more about the directing than the acting, as most of the remainder of the cast (Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson et al) are experienced actors and yet their performance is equally risible. However, director Tim Burton's other films are normally quite good.Something went wrong. Somewhere. Sleepy Hollow, a film I'd rather forget quite quickly. If you like Johnny Depp, avoid this mindless inanity.TRISTÁN HARVEY E. WHITEI rate this film -3 (on the -4 to +4 scale)",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Excellent version of a classic tale,"Tim Burton tackles the tale of Sleepy Hollow, and he does so with charm and a lavish production design. While true followers of the story will be upset over the major change in the story (witchcraft, science, the fact Crane is not a teacher), one cannot look pas the great cinematography and lighting throughout the film. Coupled with a great production design and some interesting camera angles, one cannot help but fall in the love with this world locked within the bounds of German Expressionism.

A gorgeous and dreamy spectacle,"Tim Burton has delivered yet another beautiful, frightening gothic masterpiece in ""Sleepy Hollow."" This movie surpasses the ""Batman"" movies in the depth of melancholy and stylish gloom it embodies. That is not to say that this is a completely dark film - far from it. But it is suffused with the aching loneliness and utter sense of alienation embodied in the character of Ichabod Crane. Johnny Depp's beauty is used to convey the absolute fragility of the character. Crane's journey from terror to resolution and finally bravery in the face of a seemingly unstoppable foe is portrayed both starkly and with a touch of sensitivity as well. I disagree with those critics who saw the portrayal of Crane's childhood trauma as a distraction. Those scenes showed exactly why Crane became the man he was, and why he approached the situation he found in Sleepy Hollow as he did. Life often takes us to places that force us to confront all of the traumas and inner demons we would prefer to leave buried. In ""Sleepy Hollow's"" dream-like images, we are taken through one man's harrowing attempt to face all that he fears -- death, loss, pain, the unknown and fear itself -- in order to emerge more whole than before. Depp played Crane as a ""frightened schoolgirl"" for a very good reason; Crane wilfully halted and repressed his emotional growth at an extremely young age and attempted to supplant that side of himself with intellectual pursuits. When events dredged up hidden memories of past horrors from his unconscious, his emotional reactions were those of a child. Christina Ricci's character serves as the perfect counterbalance to Crane, very emotionally aware, yet also strong enough to face the horrors around her. The film is a beautifully-wrought vision of a man attempting first to avoid, then to accept and defeat, the irrational side of human nature. It was pure joy to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Visually stunning,"Lush, gorgeous, glitteringly dark--a gloomy, misty landscape of twisted, black trees, and looming shadows--Sleepy Hollow is visually breathtaking. Budding directors, cinematographers, and set directors should be required to watch this film as a textbook study into how one establishes atmosphere. Elfman's score is a jewel as well, the perfect complement to all this visual mastery. At once sumptuous and ominous, brooding on horrors seen and horrors to come, it sets off the misty, haunted look of the thing perfectly.Beyond this, cast and casting are inspired--a wonderful gallery of oddly matched talents, note-perfect in their various roles. Depp is a strangely lovely Ichabod Crane, faithful, all the same, in spirit to the original: quirky, overwrought, his constant efforts to exude competence and confidence are continually undermined by the brutal reality that he is never more than a few short steps from becoming entirely unhinged by the wanton irrationality that abounds in this haunted rural corner of early America. This is Crane as a would-be man of science; uncomfortably finding himself on the trail of a headless ghost, he's determined nonetheless to rise to the challenge and see that justice is done. In his portrayal, Depp achieves a stammering, flustered delivery and gawky physicality that evoke the character perfectly. Ricci, for her part, is cast smartly half against type: playing a coolly beautiful, wide-eyed fairy tale princess, she brings a note of self-assurance and self-possession to the part that makes it as memorable as any of her more overtly dark roles: she's a heroine to complement Depp's Ichabod, composed where he's addled and alarmed, in her element where he's out of his depth. And yes, they do look awfully good together. Add to these principals a wonderfully mixed and matched stable of fine, nuanced English character actors, one icon of the horror genre and a few familiar old faces and favourites of Burton: Richardson, Lee, McDiarmid, Walken, Gambon, Jones, and there's some serious wattage on the screen, here, all generally put to very good use. There are some nice flashes of dark comedy, too, as you'd only expect from Burton. All of which makes the film, all in all, a fine mix of beautiful things.That's what's great about Sleepy Hollow; see it, if for nothing else, for all that mist and shadow--on the big screen or in the gorgeous HD DVD version, if you possibly can, for Burton works this canvas beautifully, and you do want to see it in all the detail you can. And see it for Depp and Ricci, Lee (in a cameo, technically, but it's a key one, and he makes every second count), and Richardson.There are, however, also more than a few weaker spots, here. Burton billed Sleepy Hollow as an homage to the classic Hammer horror films, and it does evoke that very feel, frequently--both for better and for worse. Yes, there's mist and mystery, a suggestion of supernatural dread lurking in every long shadow, and some reasonably affecting horror--but there's also a fairly liberal dash of fake blood (occasionally used for a nice comic effect, but then overused), and a little more latex gore than I've a taste for, personally. The failing is a common one in horror: the old 'too much on the screen/not enough left to the frightened imagination' problem. Having established that beautifully spooky, haunted atmosphere, Burton seems to think he can lean harder on it than he can, goes all kinetic and bloody, in the end, and the whole winds up a good notch or two more overt than it probably should have been, reveling just a little too much in the gore, and inevitably failing, therefore, to use it as powerfully as it might have to terrify. The horseman of the title itself, especially, though brilliantly menacing, initially, loses much of that menace as it becomes too familiar a presence on the screen, and this only gets worse and worse as the film proceeds. I found myself almost wishing Burton had had slightly less effective effects at his command: it might have helped, a little, if he'd been forced by technical limitations to keep his beloved whirling headless horseman o' death in the shadows a little more, let us be a little more afraid of what we can't see.All that said: yes, it's quite worth the time. Absolutely do see it. Against those weaknesses, the sheer dark beauty of the visuals and the general brilliance of the cast make it well worthwhile.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A wisecrack unnoticed by my Parisian audience,"I enjoyed this last Burton very much (for me, it's his best). Although the action is scaring all along, some breaks are provided for the soft-hearted, such as: ""Do you think he's dead?"" ""The problem, is that he was already dead!"" But my biggest laugh was at the end, when Depp tells Ricci: ""This is New York, and you'll get accustomed to it very quickly: the Bronx is up and the Battery's down"" (an hommage to Betty Comden-Adolph Green-Leonard Bernstein's ON THE TOWN). I even expected a final title : AND PEOPLE WEREN'T YET TRAVELING UNDERGROUND.Of course,I was the only to push a big laugh in the Parisian afternoon audience... henry caraso",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Visually enrapturing adaptation heavily marred by lack of intelligence and tension in the script.,"Beetle Juice, Batman, Batman Returns, Mars Attacks!, Planet of the Apes, Big Fish, Sweeney Todd and now Sleepy Hollow. That is the extent of my experience with Tim Burton. I don't often need to take the role of lemming upon me, but I'm left without choice.""Sleepy Hollow"" once again merely is a mask of visual creativity, unmasked however there's little pleasing about this, and every other, Burton film. The script flaunts a shocking lack of intelligence. The film's half and half divided between dark comedy and mystery, the first an instinctive like or dislike, the second an objective fail. Especially the final twist falls flat, the cliché scenes where the villain points out the exit of the plot's labyrinth in an overly long expose hardly possesses any punch due to the insufficiently explored characters (betrayal isn't much of a heart breaker when there's no real trust established to begin with), and the web of clues' only goal appears to be confusing the audience(did Burton really expect us to remember all the names of a dozen characters who've hardly registered on screen due to lack of screen time and unmemorable dialog).Burton's rendition of 'Ichabod Crane' is not so much ""some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield"" (see Washington Irving's Classic Horror Story) as another self-aware, colorful for the sake of being colorful, character, though it's not hard to imagine him filled with hay(why do so many mystery films insist on selecting the dullest, most devoid of personality character as the mirror through which we view the story, rendering it less quirky?).Elfman's score complements the pert visual style, the film's strongest suit beyond a shadow of a doubt. Opting for an almost b&w look (same as Sweeney Todd), he succeeds at injecting the blood shedding scenes with more vivacity. It's the strongest argument for why I feel Sleepy Hollow leans a lot closer towards a comic book film than a Gothic horror story adaptation.Although I can't put my heart into recommending this film, checking out the scenes involving Christopher Walken's headless horseman may just be enough argumentation to give this movie one look.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Not Depp or Burton's Finest, but a Good Ride,","Sleepy Hollow is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a really talented cast. There is a creepy atmosphere throughout and it is certainly one of Tim Burton's scariest films, they normally contained elements of horror but this film is a straight up horror, and Johnny Depp shines in the lead role as usual, further proving his versatile skills as an actor. I have come to expect a bit more from Burton, this film dosen't contain his usual trademarks and many elements that make his work so unique, it didn't feel like he put his own original spin to this, which is a significant thing for any of his films that isn't based on his own work. The build up in the film is great, it's constantly creepy and discomforting throughout as we know something big is coming, and the ending is certainly not disappointing.

"dark, bleak, but somehow stylish; Depp depicts Ichabod compellingly yet humorously","While often theatrical and even overdramatic in its depiction of events, especially the music, Johnny Depp's character mannerisms and reactions - which add some niche humor - and the variations of shock from others, it's all par course. The movie's aesthetic alone just drips with that frigid, bleak, eerie, period-piece horror vibe that it was going for, and bravo for that achievement. While all of the actors casted did great and seemed to fit their roles to a T, it wasn't startling to see that every female was beyond gorgeous, and most of the men the polar opposite. Save for Depp of course, and the ever handsome Casper Van Dien. Though a small role, Lisa Marie was memorably captivating as young Ichebod's mother; Christina Ricci keeps you enrapt in more ways than one; Christopher Walken's terse performance as the fabled Headless Horseman especially wicked; Jeffrey Jones a favorite of mine from the older actors, but not in it nearly enough.

Another Burton Masterpiece,"I have long been a fan of Tim Burton films, being as big a fan of Mars Attacks! as should probably be allowed, but for some reason I wasn't that keen about seeing Sleepy Hollow.It was tremendous. The film had all the Burton tongue-in-cheek charm (the contraptions that Ichabod (Johnny Depp) uses are a personal favourite), but the most outstanding feature was the appearance of the film. The eponymous American village was delightful, and the special effects were never otiose, just perfect for describing the scenes. Christina Ricci was truly beautiful throughout the film, keeping an air of mystery about her character that so many other actresses would have failed to pull off.  Johnny Depp also impressed me  his British character seemed so quaintly over the top in parts, without ever becoming annoying or clichéd. A healthy British cast  Miranda Richardson being particularly strong, backs up this duet.Many have described SH as a modern fairy story, or something of the like, and in some ways that is what Burton does best  the modern creation of fantasy, but to call them fairy stories seems to play down the films as childish.

Not a bad period horror flick,"The problem with horror movies with blood and gore involved is that the audience is so used to the special effects these days that the shock value is no longer there.  Therefore the strength of the plot becomes more important to retain the audiences attention for the duration of the movie.To this end Sleepy Hollow is a novel way of turning a ""slasher"" movie into a period slasher movie.  The problem with this is that the villain ""or the suspense"" associated with the Headless horsemen loses its scare factor after about 20 mins into the film.  After than it is the inevitable ending that you come to expect with the hero saving the day.Thats the problem I have with this movie, it promises so much yet you feel a little disappointed in the end that it never quite achieved what it set out to do.Johnny Depp is a little annoying as the bumbmling constable whislt Chrisina Ricci's characted is not developed enough.

The standard of a Gothic detective with horror elements or the Magnificent Tim Burton: part three,"Gothic detective with horror elements. The film adaptation of the famous story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" by the first American writer Washington Irving, directed by maestro Tim Burton. I cannot say in detail for the book source, because I have not read, but I have heard about the most important details of this work of world literature. At the same time, I will evaluate the film adaptation as an independent work. I watched this picture at least five times - and I was happy to review it again for this review. And although the picture has already turned more than twenty years old, it is still good, and it also looks great. And here's my brief opinion for you - the standard of a Gothic detective with horror elements. Despite my delight in this picture, I will note both its advantages and disadvantages (which have become noticeable to me only now). And with that, let me finish with this introduction, and get to the point.So, the advantages:
1. Scenario - the picture will tell us the story of Ichabod Crane - an eccentric young constable from New York, who is ordered to find and neutralize a mysterious killer in the town of Sleepy Hollow - a small settlement inhabited by immigrants from Holland. All the victims were killed in one way - they were beheaded with one blow. Arriving from a crowded and civilized New York to a remote Sleepy Hollow and having talked with local authorities, Ichabod begins to understand that there was no mysticism here, and this case challenges his principles - logic, science and truth. It will not do without a romantic line. There will be chases and a good detective, although the main villain is calculated quite quickly. The final pleases. The dialogues are good, the characters are charismatic. You can watch the picture again and again, if the mood asks for it.2. Atmosphere - here old Tim played out with might and main. I didn't regret the fog, and this gives the viewer the feeling that everything was filmed in the pavilion (but not). The forest looks ominous, Ichabod's nightmares can make inexperienced viewers shudder. The settlement of Sleepy Hollow itself is catching up with anxiety, and the locals themselves: sullen, almost do not talk, try to isolate themselves from Ichabod's questions, and only those from whom the mysterious killer took relatives go to contact. Danny Elfman's music only enhances the Gothic atmosphere. Old Tim clearly loves old horror genre paintings from the thirties of the last century, and therefore was clearly inspired by them. That's what Tim has always been able to do, so it's to create a high-quality atmosphere.3. Costumes and scenery - costumes are quite consistent with the era of the late eighteenth century (except for small details and well-designed for individual characters). You look and believe that it is that time on the screen, and the scenery does not lag behind. No, this is not a pavilion, and not New England (unfortunately), but a specially made village in England in the style of pilgrims. And be sure, if you hadn't been told this, you wouldn't have noticed it (except for the specialists), and half of the cast are English, which is suitable for the context, especially if you watched the picture in Russian dubbing, but if in the original, then the features of the language are nowhere to go, but we won't go into that. The budget of the picture was huge at that time (one hundred lemons of cabbage leaves), so they did not save money on creating costumes and decorations, for which respect from me.4. The horseman - he is so good that it remains only to take off his hat to old Tim, because only for his sake Christopher Walken agreed to act in this picture, and his image turned out to be cruel, merciless, partly scary, and at the same time attractive.So, disadvantages:
1. The reason for sending Ichabod - it looks so idiotic that you wonder. I hope I do not need to describe here that science in criminology began to be introduced and actively used since the beginning of the Enlightenment, and even in Colonial America this was not neglected (remember the long trial of the Salem witches, how they were looking for evidence there). Legal procedures, collection of evidence, testimony, their reconciliation, and confession is the last. Apparently, the screenwriters did not figure out how to dump Ichabod into Sleepy Hollow smarter, so they left it as it is, it turned out stupid.2. Ichabod's nightmares - they are certainly atmospheric, but it's not clear from them what moved Ichabod to the path of science. An abusive father? And why is he like this? Who was his mother? A healer? A witch? And why did her father marry her then? What is the long white corridor on the second floor of the hero's house? Is his father an important churchman? And a brief explanation closer to the finale is not enough to fully understand the essence of the hero.A little about the main characters:
1. Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp, is a young, eccentric investigator from New York who must find and neutralize the mythical killer from the legend. The hero is comical, modest, who will have to go through a whole bunch of different emotions in the wilderness, well, and pass the test of his principles, not without the help of course. Johnny, as always, pleases with his acting. Well done!2. Katrina Van Tassel, played by Christina Ricci, is the daughter of one of the influential authorities in Sleepy Hollow, a beautiful and attractive girl who has a secret that is better not to reveal to anyone. Young Kristina, after the role of Wednesday Addams, played the complete opposite of her famous role here, and external data only contribute to awakening feelings for her, and dresses suit her. Clever girl!In addition to them, Christopher Lee, Michael Gambon (Dumbledore from Potter 3 to 8) and Richard Griffiths (Dursley from the same place) starred in the film.This picture has become the standard of the Gothic detective, all directors who make films in this genre are still equal to it. Isn't that a measure of success and quality? I think so!Despite all the efforts of Tim and Paramount Studios, the picture failed at the home box office, and only the world allowed it not to go into negative territory, bringing profit, but not very much. But Tim met the new millennium with a famous and already proven director, and therefore he continued to create in his path, and in 2003 he gave us a touching fairy tale ""Big Fish"", but we'll talk about it another time.My rating is 9 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Burton finds the perfect material for his brooding atmosphere...,"Absolutely one of the most satisfying films visually that I've ever seen and it looks great in Hi-Def on a big screen.The visual treats are too numerous to mention, but all the way through this dark tale the camera lingers on some awe-inspiring shots that almost have a Currier and Ives feeling about them.The famous tale of the Headless Horseman by Washington Irving gets a new spin here with the plot elaborated so that JOHNNY DEPP is not a timid schoolmaster but a constable given the assignment to investigate the brutal murders taking place in Sleepy Hollow.Depp is marvelous in the role and it's easy to see why he was Oscar nominated. MIRANDA RICHARDSON is outstanding in the large supporting cast and Christina RICCI, while improbably cast as Katrina, finally convinced me that she's an appealing actress.Danny Elfman's score contributes greatly to the mood of the piece, drumming up the excitement for all the action scenes, one of which includes a mad chase in the forest with Depp clinging to the back of a horse drawn carriage while sliding on the ground on his belly.As usual, Burton gets a chance to show buckets of blood, so the faint of heart may want to turn away for the gruesome moments--and there are plenty of them.

Great Coming of Age Movie for Christina Ricci,"SLEEPY Hollow is bloody, very exciting and sometimes scary retelling of Washington Irving's classic short story THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW.  People are dieing in the small village of Sleepy Hollow, and New York City Detective Icabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is directed by a city judge (Christopher Lee) to investigate.  All the victims have died in the same manner; their heads have been severed by one blow of a broadsword. Legend has it the wielder of that sword is ""The Headless Horseman,"" a ""walking undead"" (well, riding, anyway) apparition of a dead Hessian (Christopher Walken, satisfyingly goulish) Visiting the village, Depp begins to uncover the sinister secrets of the village, as well as his own deeply-hidden past. He falls in love with the daughter of the richest man in the village (Christina Ricci) and finds himself the target of her jealous suitor (Casper Von Dien).  As Depp delves closer to the truth, he must not only face the horseman, but his own fearsand cynicism. This is a great coming of age movie for Christina Ricci.  Her character is definitely a woman, not just a sexpot, like most of her recent outings. Miranda Richardson plays her stepmother, and I've loved her since she played the evil queen Maub in MERLIN.  The best performances are Ricci, Johnny Depp and (surprisingly) Casper Von Dien.  The story is way too convoluted.  I never did completely put all of it together.  And the culprit is surpisingly easy to spot.  Still, the film is exciting and has great atmosphere.  The cinematography is perfect, cold, brittle, gloomy where it needs to be. Ricci looks like a Bottacelli Venus with her lush figure, creamy skin and surprisingly natural-looking blonde hair.  Worth a look, despite the gore.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

The casting is great with a lot of well known people, Johnny Depp does a great performance, and Christopher Walken is hamming it up in this but I love it, anything he does is great. This film is an obvious love letter to classic horror films such as the hammer Dracula or Frankenstein pictures, with references going as far back as the 1931 Frankenstein.

Could have been a family movie,"Tim Burton has made a few adult movies but I fear this one went down the wrong tunnel. For one Sleepy Hollow reminded me of Edward Scissorshands with its snowy landscapes and odd fantastic sets, and of course Depp. That Burton felt the need to add dozens of forced graphic decapitation shots was the only thing that spoilt what could have been a spectacular family movie. The headless horseman was a great concept, but sadly he does little but take off head upon head whilst the rest of the cast figure out what's going on, before he strikes in typically predictable fashion. The climax is a little abrupt and felt a bit comic-like and unrealistic to me (Burtons niche is allowing fantasy films to show realism and convincing story lines without too much ridicule).Sleepy Hollow isn't too bad a film, it just isn't that good.

The Pointless Horseman,"I am always shocked when I see the extents to which people have gone to praise a movie which just wasn't that good.  To these people I have to ask, what on earth are you talking about?  No, Sleepy Hollow was not unbearable or terrible.  It was simply uninteresting.  And that in itself is shocking. How can you make a movie about a demon with no head who chases people down on a black horse and chops of their heads uninteresting?  It would have seemed impossible before SH, but Burton pulled off a miracle.  The movie bogs itself down with plot and attempts to add a conspiracy element which simply does not work.  I agree with a previous reviewer that the movie should simply have focus on the horseman himself - but instead by the end of this movie we think of the horseman more like a robot or mindless animal - not the truly evil being he could be.  I think the feel of the initial scene was successfully creepy, but few other instances in the movie succeeded in raising any fright.  I think Johnny Depp went about as far with the role as he could, but I was underwhelmed with Christina Ricci.  I also expected to see more of Walken, but I suppose since his character starts out the movie dead, you can't expect too much.  All in all, not Tim Burton's best work, and probably the worst of the last four movies I have seen (Dogma, Being John Malkovich, Fight Club, The World Is Not Enough).",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Chilling , Humorous and Well Paced.","Sleepy Hollow offered very few disappointments. The Direction was slick, the mood intense, and the performances for the most part,consistently good. Johnny Depp owes the development of his career to Burton,each film he has done for the director has revealed a finely tuned performance. his comic timing as Icabod Crane is well polished. Christina Ricci fares less well as Katrina. the role is a thankless one and she never really tries to act it. Delightful support is provided by the wonderful 4 town elders played to perfection by Ian McDiarmid (Star Wars evil Senator/Emperor Palpatine),Michael Gambon,Jeffrey Jones(Amadeus's Emperor Joseph),and Michael Gough (of Hammer film fame). I would have liked to see these men have more screen time but it was worth losing more of them to Christopher Lee's great pre-credits cameo. Christopher Walken and Miranda Richardson also provide fine support as the Horseman and the haughty Lady Van Tassell respectively.

A throwback horror film that enchants and spooks.,"Take a step back in time and think of the classic black and white horror movies.  Step it up a notch with a lot more intensity and refined camera work, throw two young perfectly cast leads, and what you have is the latest Tim Burton installment of creative and flawless art.  Burton simplifies the world in a way that we aren't let down, because we aren't overloaded. Sleepy Hollow is the most beautiful approach to solid entertainment. Every day is as creepy as the night, and at times you may just want to reach out and touch the curled twigs framing the screen. Be careful not to get suckered in to thinking that this is reality, because you could end up laughing at the movie.  This is a fable.  It is melodramatic.  It isn't the best movie of 1999 but it is refreshing for a director to create a world of his own and invite us into it.  Sleepy Hollow pays respect to the films that chilled us before reality was necessity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Great Film, One of Tim Burton's Best.","Review:
'Sleepy Hollow' is an American gothic-supernatural-horror film directed by Tim Burton. It is loosely based on Washington Irving's 1820 short story 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'. I'm not the biggest fan of Tim Burton movies, so I went into this movie with low expectations and I'm so happy I did. I enjoyed with movie so much, there is nothing better than expecting garbage and getting an entertaining story.
In 1799, New York City police constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is dispatched to the upstate Dutch hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, which has been plagued by a series of brutal decapitations. Ichabod begins his investigation, skeptical of the paranormal story, until one night he sees the Horseman behead one of his victims with his own eyes.
First and foremost, this is a stacked movie when it comes to high hitters in the British acting community. Not only do we get the talents of Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci being the two leads of the film. We also get the amazing Michael Gambon, Richard Griffiths and Jeffrey Jones as some side characters playing towns folks, and Christopher Walken as the Horseman. The acting felt very 'play like' and that's not a bad thing at all. I loved how it felt and came together, it worked with the type of movie this was.
From the very beginning of this movie I knew I was going to be in for a treat because of the cinematography. The camera angles that are used in this movie and the color play is incredible, they take chances that not a lot of film in this age would try being said to be a gothic genre. The story is also very tight, by that I mean it didn't have any filler scenes. Everything that is on screen is necessary to the story.
Overall, I was personally very surprised by this one. It is classic Tim Burton being a gothic story and having Johnny Depp of course, but it was a dark tale before he got a hold of it and it wasn't ruined with changing the story like he does in a lot of his films.

Tim Burton and Horror is a (Super)Natural Combination,"Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent away from New York City to the small town of Sleepy Hollow, where he can use his unorthodox detective skills without bothering anybody... and maybe solve a murder along the way. What he stumbles on is not just any murder, but an ongoing killing spree of epic proportions.Anyone who is familiar with Tim Burton's work is going to wonder why he doesn't do more horror films. ""Ed Wood"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Sweeney Todd"", and others have that dark vibe... even his Batman films were rather dark compared to other incarnations. How can this be his only true horror flick? It is done so well.And, of course, he wasn't alone... this is the product of skilled people across the board. It was written by Andrew Kevin Walker (""Brainscan"", ""Seven"", ""8MM"") and produced by Francis Ford Coppola, two horror veterans that are never bad to have around.The cast? Ricci, Depp, Walken, Lee, Jeff Jones... each one could get a paragraph of praise. I don't know that this is the best work of either Ricci or Depp, but even their less than best work is better and more entertaining than most others in the acting profession today. And together? A dream come true, if you're a Ricci fan -- Depp already knows how to interact with Burton, so that's a given.The film itself is great in the art department, lighting, cinematography... more or less in every way. It's a very polished, very artsy film. What you may not notice is the use of forced perspective, which I think they hid very well. Most of the outdoor shots were actually shot on set, so if you pay close attention you'll notice that you can never see too far back or too far in the sky... and camera angles were chosen to skew distances. It's a clever tactic and works.The film's audio commentary with Tim Burton is slightly disappointing, and not nearly as good as the film itself. He talks about the difficulty in finding cardinals, and jokes about Dutch masters, but doesn't offer as much insight as you may expect from a director. Many commentaries have a steady discussion going, but Burton seems comfortable to stay silent often and just watch his own film. If this film ever gets deluxe treatment, hopefully a second commentary is added because Burton -- as soothing as his voice is -- can't do it alone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

"Scenery is Great, Dialogue is terrible.","Several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this film. First, the scenery and special effects are incredible -- the best, and if everything else worked as well, its austere presence might have made it a great film.But as soon as the actors open their mouths, you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your den watching a movie.  The story itself is full of cleché and melodrama, and the dialogue is some of the worst I've ever seen. And as if that weren't bad enough, they made a fool out of the protagonist, and in my experience, you don't want to do that unless the film is a comedy.Bottom line: I had a hard time getting into it, and I wouldn't recommend it.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
An overall good effort,"I am a long time Tim Burton fanatic, so my expectations for his latest release, ""Sleepy Hollow"", may have been a little high. Overall it was a great movie. Cinematically, ""Sleepy Hollow"" contains everything one might expect from a Burton film: gothic landscapes, brilliant uses of color, and eerie characters. Johnny Depp (as usual) was amazing as Ichabod Crane and an incredible supporting cast helped to add to the overall effect of the film. Also, the CGI horseman and tree were not terribly overused or bad looking.The film's serious flaw was the introduction of a villainous witch towards the end, who, to make the story short, gave a classic James Bond villain type monologue (a ""You are going to die anyway, so now I will spill the beans"" type thing). From this point on (thankfully only the last 15 minutes or so). the film spiraled downward. The second flaw was the lack of background knowledge of the characters throughout the movie. Sure, Mr. Depp summarized generations worth of family history in a few minutes, however it was hard to follow.All in all, Burton fans and regular movie goers alike will most likely enjoy ""Sleepy Hollow"". While a good movie, those into the films of Mr. Burton will see that ""Sleepy Hollow"" does not rank near the top as one of his better films.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Tim Burton makes an instant classic,"Sleepy Hollow is pure Tim Burton. By watching the first few minutes, you can automatically assume that he's the director. Sleepy Hollow is unique in it's own, dark way. It delivers a sense of a horror/thriller film, and a comedy. Some people don't like those two genres mixed together, but honestly for this film, it works. Johnny Depp and Ichabod Crane is the best. Johnny Depp has his role. I'll never forget him as the dark, sensitive detective, researching the case of the Headless Horseman. Christina Ricci-I've never seen her scarier or more good-looking. She gives this feel of romance and light, as well as a dark, witch-crafty feeling. In all, the film is great. Tim Burton made one of his finest films. This is probably one of his best, but might be tied with Edward Scissorhands.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A triumph for Tim Burton,"I've always admired Tim Burton's abilities as a visual stylist - his movies always have a unique and totally off the wall look - but I've never been truly satisfied with him as a director. His inability to tell a clear, focused story - or to get anything out of his actors except over the top performances - or to stage action in anything but a perfunctory manner. . . have always made him suspect to me. I felt his promotion to the rank of director was unwarranted - that he should instead be making his living as one of Hollywood's most in demand cinematographers or production designers.Having seen Sleepy Hollow though, I'd definitely have to say that Burton has made considerable progress. His distinctive visual touch is still present, though he has reigned in some of his wilder extravagances in order not to overwhelm the story. His ability to stage action sequences is much improved, resulting in some truly hair-raising chases and fight scenes (you're left to wonder what his Batman films could have been with this new found talent). Furthermore, the relentless jokiness which usually undermines his movies has been replaced by a brooding and operatic tone which better fit the story. For example, the flashback sequences here provide some of the most haunting and poetic images Burton has ever created - and they feel sincere, as if they come from a very deep and genuine place inside the filmmaker, and are not just flung at us to dazzle and tickle us with his visual ingenuity.All of which is not to say that Burton is no longer any fun. It's just that he has put his humor into better perspective. There are many nice wry touches in Sleepy Hollow, none more so than in Johnny Depp's truly outstanding performance, which straddles the poles of absurd comedy and genuine heroism. Even as we come to feel for Ichabod Crane and to admire his steeliness and pluck, we are never far removed from laughter at the character's prissiness and squeamishness. Depp walks a real tightrope act here, and it will probably not be to everyone's taste. I thought it was one of the best performances of the year, and represented a perfect marriage between Burton's tendancy toward campy theatrics and his newfound maturity and grace.Some caveats: Christina Ricci is not used particularly well here; her part is too blandly written to give her prickly screen persona much room to breathe. Too bad, as she would make an ideal Burton heroine (I hasten to add that every other single actor in the movie - including Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and yes, even Christopher Walken in a wordless cameo - is solid). And what's with this story anyway? It's a pointless bastardization of the original tale. While it's true that the original is pretty threadbare, it is certainly suggestive enough that a writer could spin out compelling backstories and elaborations without having to resort to coming up with a completely new murder mystery plot (which is kind of overplotted and confusing, anyway). But, taken on its own merits, the script certainly works well enough, and anyone not familiar with the original story won't notice anything amiss.Ok, now that I've said all that - the real reason to see this movie. . . those decapitations! The advertising slogan was ""Heads will roll"" but never in my wildest imagination could I have guessed with what frequency and in how many different kinds of ways. Burton eschews realism or gory details here, and instead goes for a stylization that is at once giddy, horrifying and strangely beautiful. The fact that each decapitation is played slightly differently - either in how it's shot or how it's perpetrated - keeps it from becoming routine and, indeed, every instance of it involves some new kind of twist or surprise. Some may say Burton is sick for focusing so much attention on this aspect of the story, but this is the Headless Horseman after all, and Burton's courage in not backing away from his grisly deeds gives the monster his full due. Although I wouldn't call the film frightening exactly (that is, to anyone but the most absolutely faint-hearted), it is suffused with a powerful sense of  creepiness and dread that prove extremely effective.All in all, a very enjoyable movie, and a signal of even better works yet to come from Tim Burton.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Best Movie I've Seen,"One word for this Tim Burton movie: WOW! The movie was awesome in all aspects. The cast was great, especially Johnny Depp by bringing humor and those spectacular disgusted faces to the film. Burton has outdone himself with the thrills and chills but also the dry humor. The music by Elfman always sets the mood perfectly. I read the story by Washington Irving, and all I can say is, do NOT expect it to be like the story. Burton has given it a dark and harrowing twist that greatly satisfies. If you haven't seen this movie, go out and see it. I almost missed out on the movie that was to become my all time favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A big dissapointment,"Even though I enjoyed seeing Sleepy Hollow, and probably will buy it when it comes out for sale, I would have to say that it is Tim Burton's most disappointing film.  The cinematography was excellent, the action scenes were spectacular, but the story itself seemed kind of half-assed.  The main problem I had was Ichabod's dreams.  They had no relavence to the rest of the movie. They seemed like they could done a lot more with them, for example:  Have his mother be the witch controlling the horseman.  But no, his mom was a witch and his dad killed her.  That's just great.The next problem was ""the villan"" :  Where the hell did she come from?  She just popped in at the end of the movie!  I mean i know that we saw her as a child, and I knew she was Katrina's stepmom, but that's it!  The she just pops in and basically says ""In cased you missed it, here's the plot""  The plot of a movie should be hinted at throughout the film, not just thrown at the end.   It's confusing and irrelevant.I'm sorry Tim Burton, but Sleepy Hollow has to be your worst movie.  Next time I suggest revising your script.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

One of the Best Films of the Year,"I have just seen Sleepy Hollow and I think it is not only one of the best (and most imaginative) films of 1999, but definately Tim Burton's milestone film.  All of his past films have done alot in filmaking, but this new version of Washington Irving's ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" had me speechless with it's dazzling acting, effects, art direction and action (not to mention an unbilled appearence by Christopher Walken.The story has Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp in a very deep acting role, as a constable from New York sent up to the superstitious town of Sleepy Hollow.  Where a ghostly figure named The Headless Horseman rides in the night be-heading people on his steed without mercy in his pursuit.  It gets better after that with a mystery unfolding in a manner only suited for Burton.Despite some story changes from the original Sleepy Hollow story by Irving (and a usual ending as such in these type of movies) it never stopped to amaze me with its good ensemble cast, dazzling set designs, and visual effects.  This deserves to be at the top of the scary films league (though as a horror film, it only makes it prudent with its head severing). A+",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Does Not Capture the True Spirit of Irving's ""Legend"", But Still Mildly Fun Anyhow.","Director Tim Burton's hands are all over SLEEPY HOLLOW, a century-ending update of Washington Irving's classic ghost story of a headless horseman who terrorizes a small New York town.  The story is set in 1799 and even uses some quips about the coming of the 19th Century to tie it together with our time.  Its visually delicious, sometimes chilling, but unevenly odd and bloody.  Heads sure do roll and the murders are surprisingly displayed as bloody massacres, all beheadings considered.SLEEPY HOLLOW is fun.  There is no doubt about it, however Depp is mis-cast and the screenplay is amazingly thin.  The appearances of the headless horseman are not done as well as Burton is capable of doing.  Sure there is mist, vapor, and howling winds.  We are never truly scared by his attacks. They are brutal to say the least.Burton's villain is reminiscent of ""Batman"" in appearance sometimes and he, of course, uses Depp as ""Ichabod Crane"" as his own alter ego.  Do you ever notice Burton's main protagonists look like Burton himself (EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, ED WOOD, even BEETLEJUICE)?   I like the small doses of Burtonesque filmmaking, but a full length feature it cannot make.  Danny Elfman's (another Burton regular) exciting score adds much to the sometimes dreary flick.  Depp never seems entirely comfortable as ""Crane"" and more humor was needed to flesh out his character.Its funny how some people complained about the early BATMAN films not being cartoonish enough, only dark and even depressing.  Here is a dark picture literally that may have worked better with a more cartoonish touch.  I know this is horror but isn't the original spirit of Irving's ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" more colorful and comical?  Yes and this picture needed more spirit and less schlock.An important note: SLEEPY HOLLOW contains one of those scenes that make you want to split - when the ""bad guy"" tells his or her venemous story about how they were able to reak evil verbatim, leaving less to the viewer's imagination and more lines of dialogue.  Why not run some title cards explaining it all?  These points must be thought of, but I must say SLEEPY HOLLOW is fine, simple entertainment from a master filmmaker who I thought would provide a lot more.Rating:  **1/2",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Cheesy Hollow (Junk Commentary from Tim Burton),"This movie is over-the-top cheese, and Depp plays an amusing sort of cowardly constable. Following Demi Moore's ""Scarlet Letter"" school of text adaptation, this has zero to do with the Washington Irving story, but there you go. The movie's value is mostly visual.My previous low-water mark for commentary on a DVD is either Jodie Foster's obsession with talking only about what is real and what is fake in every shot of Contact, or of course the chronically stupid ""funny"" commentary on Blood Simple, but this is right down there with them. It took me exactly six and half minutes to run out of patience with Tim Burtons inane, self-evident remarks. Between long stretches of silence he exhausts one adjective (amazing... Michael Gough is amazing, the cast is amazing, big Spanish horses are amazing...). Hey Tim, feel free to make some notes and watch it once before you you record your comments. But if he could do that, he'd be able to realize that nine out of ten of his movies have crappy scripts; Tim is quite inarticulate.I doubt anyone can top the immortal 4-word summary of this by LA Weekly's Manohla Dargis ""Sleepy and hollow indeed.""

Well directed gothic fairy tale,"In 1799 Constable Ichabod Crane is sent from New York to investigate a spate of murders in the small town of Sleepy Hollow.  The townsfolk believe that the murders are the work of a headless horseman who beheads his victims but Crane believes it is a matter for logic and science.  Crane investigates however his faith in science and logic grows increasingly threatened when he is confronted with things that cannot be explained away by modern police work and logical ways of thinking.I'm a Tim Burton fan, only finding a few of his films to be misguided or poor.  I greatly looked forward to this film, hoping for a nightmarish fairy tale feel to it and for the most part I was rewarded for my expectations. For the majority of the film we are treated to the horseman gleefully wrecking havoc while Crane delivers humour as well as being our wide eyed observer.The plot itself is pretty free flowing until the last 20 minutes where it becomes a more standard detective mystery of sorts.  Many feel this is a letdown and in a way it is mostly because it is a change of pace and style. However it delivers well and has good action and stunts with a good pace. The tidy ends may go against the nature of the film but I still enjoyed it. Up till this point it is very dark and bloody and Burton has stamped his vision all over this.The cast is full of well know faces and is mostly very good.  Depp is funny and deadpan and carries the central role well.  On the downside Ricci is pretty poor.  She looks good but she has no chemistry with Depp and is pale and fails to make an impact.  A support cast of Gambon, Jones, Richardson, Van Dien, Lee and Griffiths all do well and deliver interesting characters. Walken may be limited in terms of screen time but he is an inspired bit of casting and has a strong presence as the horseman.Overall the majority of this film has Burton's vision stamped all over it. He carries the film well with gleeful bloodletting and a good humour.  The end may be all a bit mystery-solving but even it is delivered with some good action scenes.  Not Burton's best film but an enjoyable gothic fairy tale.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"great cinematography, excellent acting, poor script","I'd been looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I saw the trailor, which was great. I'm a big Tim Burton fan; and Johnny Depp & Christina Ricci are great actors. Unfortunately I left the theater disappointed. while the movie is wonderful visually, the story really needed some work.Mr. Burton made this story into too much of a whodunnit for my taste. I was expecting more of a horror story. There are too many charaters, who are barely developed at all, so I didn't much care who the killer was or why he/she was doing it.On the plus side, the acting was first rate. Johnny Depp is hilarious as Ichabod Crane.  His reaction after seeing the headless horseman is priceless.  Christina Ricci makes a whole lot of nothing in her role opposite Depp.  I can't even remember her character's name, it was so porely developed. But she has so much presence onscreen, and chemistry with Depp, she somehow makes it work. I hope they make another movie together.As for the character of the horseman, like the rest of the movie, the cup is half full. He starts out as an unstoppable monster, bringing death upon everyone he meets. Ray Parks does an incredible job in the fight scenes. Unfortunately, we come to learn that he is not killing randomely, but is after selected targets. It ruins the suspense when Ichabod can be around this monster without fearing for life. The movie sure is good to look at, though.  I'd give it 3 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"""Their heads were not found severed. Their heads were not found at all.""","FILM: 9.0
Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's prolific collaboration has yielded many memorable films, but Sleepy Hollow stands out as my favorite among their joint ventures. Burton's ability to adapt existing works shines in this loose interpretation of Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.While retaining the basic structure of Irving's short story, the film enriches the narrative with well-crafted characters, making it a standout adaptation. The odd-couple pairing of Depp's serious and by-the-book Crane with Ricci's free-spirited Katrina is a stroke of casting genius.Supported by a stellar cast, including Burton regulars, the standout performance comes from Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman, delivering perfection in his eerie portrayal.While the film occasionally delves into unnecessary B and C story threads, the overall editing and pace maintain a satisfactory balance. What truly elevates Sleepy Hollow is its masterful atmosphere and tone-a complete horror experience that seamlessly blends scares with a sense of impending doom.Despite its occasional detours, the movie remains an absolute pleasure to watch. Whether it's the chemistry between Depp and Ricci, the eerie ambiance, or the stellar performances, Sleepy Hollow stands as a testament to Burton's directorial prowess and Depp's acting versatility. In my book, this film earns a solid recommendation and continues to be a captivating cinematic experience.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

Gothic horror with a twist...,"I have two words for you - Johnny Depp - That is the main reason to see this film. His Icabod Crane shows that he is an actor of the highest caliber, not a ""star""I loved Tim Burton's lighting, you can feel the cold, damp chill in the air. The gore factor was horrific and nicely done, but the editing was a bit choppy.Ray Parks surpasses his ""Darth Maul"" appearance in Star Wars-Phantom Menace with the phenomenal stunt work as the headless horseman.

Disappointing,"I am not a fan of Tim Burton movies, but watched this anyway.  Perhaps I missed the point but maybe this should've been called 'Scooby Doo and The Headless Horseman'!  Whoever thinks this is a horror is clearly missing something and has not seen any bona fide horror movies such as The Exorcist, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Night of the Living Dead or Psycho.  I thought the film was stupid, but decent performances from Christina Ricci, Richard Griffiths and Christopher Lee give it some credence.  If you like Tim Burton, watch this movie, if not - give it a miss and watch a proper horror film or an episode of 'Scooby Doo'.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Roller coaster,"A Tim Burton's masterpiece, sleepy hollow is a film that perfectly balances the nausea of horror with the unending laughs of comedy. The film set at the dawn of the millennium features acts like Johnny Depp playing ""Ichabond Crane"" , Christina Ricci plays Katrina Van Tassel the daughter of old Baltus Van Tassel ""Michael Gambon"". The film which is an adaptation based on ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" by Washington Irving, revolves around a curious police detective ""Johnny Depp"" with a knack for investigative gadgets and never ending questions which puts him at odds with his colleagues and the new york city judge that eventually led to his fateful detective assignment at sleepy hollow. A headless horseman has been set loose and he is rampaging the city beheading all his victims in one single swoosh of his sword on the neck. Ichabond Crane discovers his victims were not random but targeted specifically by someone with revenge on their mind. Emmanuel Lubezki skillfully cinematographed the city of sleepy hollow casting it out directly as a somber town with little or no mood of life where death and dying is a common event., windows are constantly shut and doors always securely locked. An overly de- saturated look leaves that expressionistic style which Tim Burton is well known for. A touch of romance is visible in this epic film between Ichabond Crane and Katrina, which distracts the viewer a bit from the horrific beheading by the headless horseman to a more gentle side of the story. Crane must unravel the mystery of the hessian ghost that rides in the woods cutting off the heads of his unsuspecting victims. At first it sounds like a local legend to Crane whom with his scientific and calculating mind disregards this bizarre murders as just mere workings of a murderer masking behind a myth. Sleepy Hollow is a roller coaster movie that will leave the viewer at the edge of their seat with bitter sweet taste in their mouth whether to love or hate the headless horseman. The story unfolds when crane himself experiences the headless horseman in action when he attacks and eventually beheads magistrate Phillipse ""Richard Griffiths"" leaving Crane shaken up and visibly scared beyond control. ""It was a horseman! A dead one! Headless!"" he remarks. The film was on a comedic tone when some of the town people played a prank on Crane imitating the headless horseman chasing and scaring Crane until he passes out to beautiful memories of his past.
Grossing over 200 million USD worldwide and bagging one academy award for best art direction ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a must watch film from start to finish one can see, feel and be captivated by the story, journeying with Ichabond Crane as he goes on his task of answering and solving forensic investigations of this bizarre murders that has been plaguing the town of sleepy hollow.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"headless plot, wasted actors.","A screenplay appropriate to the teenage male, and very likelywritten by one: half-begun themes (principle, torture, witchcraft)sacrificed to cheap special effects (how many heads do we reallyhave to see roll?). Any stroke of axe or Heath Robinson devicespurts blood precisely into the wielder's face; yet the level of gore(blood spurting from each nailhole of a victim of the iron Maiden) ismarginally too great to support the only kind interpretation of thisfilm, that it is supposed to be funny. Lines of development sopoorly handled that characters must stop and catch the audienceup with the plot, as in some detective farce.And what a romp it might have been: rarely can so many greatactors - for the supporting cast is potentially superb - have stoodaround with so little to do. Not including Mr Depp, kept very busy,who equates acting with swallowing to express fear, etc etc,unfunny and untrained in pastiche, inadequate to attempting thethemes that first informed this abandoned script.Kudos to the headless horseman, for twirling his axe in the onlyact of real gusto in a long evening. And to the sets, that save thisfailure from a bomb.

hauntingly atmospheric Tim Burton movie,"Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a visually stunning film so incredibly atmospheric it makes you yearn to live in the recreated town of Sleepy Hollow, even though judging by the threat of a ghost tormenting its population one would consider otherwise. This is a gorgeous film and the cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki- who has since become a highly respected DOP must be given all the dues. The gothic atmosphere seeping through the fantastic production design is something to savor. Based on Washington Irving's tale ""The legend of Sleepy Hollow"" Johnny Depp stars as the well meaning but cowardice Ichabod Crane who comes to this town to investigate the murders which are all similar in nature- gruesomely beheaded. This is a great film which has been unfairly criticized.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
I expected more,"I saw two movies this week, ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"". I find it ironic that when ""Saving Private Ryan"" is mentioned, people who have not seen it always mention the ""gore"", for it is reknowned for being ""too bloody"" when blood is used only to enhance the realism of the action and at appropriate moments.  I think it is films like ""Sleepy Hollow"" that are too gory, splattering excessive amounts of blood around simply to be shocking or when the director can't think of any other way to create a jolt.The ""scary"" special effects in this film look amazingly similarto the ones that were repeated many times in ""Beetlejuice. The good parts about this movie were Johnny Depp's acting and Danny Elfman's score. The bits that drew laughs were Depp's whimpiness in the face of danger, but even his raised eyebrows and fainting spells were getting old about three-quarters of the way through.  I think the problem is that the story is convoluted and difficult to follow. This movie would have been better if the story had been simplified, more tension had been built and if it had had fewer actual murders and less blood. Eccentric characters and humor should have been emphasized more.  I am a Tim Burton fan, but I gave this one a 6 and would not recommend it to my friends.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

A lot of fun if you don't expect too much,"The ads promise that ""heads will roll""; this is decidedly not metaphorical. Indeed, from start to finish in ""Sleepy Hollow"" noggins are lopped off with alarming frequency. Tim Burton's sabbatical from directing (since 1996's befuddled ""Mars Attacks"") is gleefully broken by his take on the ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", in this instance a murder mystery that is only tangentially related to the Washington Irving classic. Depp is convincing as Ichabod Crane, a foppish constable devoted far more to ""cause and consequence"" than the paranormal. His reasoning is severely tested when charged with solving a series of mysterious and graphic murders in the eponymous hamlet in upstate New York. Confounding his analysis are clues defying scientific approach and his attraction to the ethereal Katrina (Ricci), leading him to suspect that the vengeance-driven 'Headless Horseman' is all too other-worldly. Not unexpectedly, Burton's reputation for evocative production design and photography is well-evidenced here. Awash in a spectrum of greyish hues resembling a charcoal drawing (save for occasional splashes of crimson), his vision of a spooky village and surrounding wood help serve an only-satisfactory tale of mayhem on the eve of the 19th century. Buoyed by a lively finale and spectacular stunt work by the 'Horseman' (Ray Park, who impressed as Darth Maul in ""Phantom Menace""), this edition of Sleepy Hollow is an amusingly creepy diversion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Ghoulish movie,"This was a well done movie, and quite gripping.  Definately the best movie from the horror genre this year.  And Johnny Depp even does a convincing job acting, although his support cast, especially Ricci, was not as good.One nice touch was that, although there were many special effects they did not stick out as they normally seem to in such movies.  This is probably because even the scenes that were ""real"" had a skewed reality.  And for once the reality was consistent throughout the film, so the suspension of disbelief was not difficult.I do have two complaints, neither of which detract from the movie itself. The first is that this is not an authentic retelling of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.  Amoung other things Icabod Crane was supposed to be a school teacher, and a firm believer in the occult (and it actually gets worse from there)...  But if you haven't read the story you won't miss it (much like if you never read Dracula before seeing Bram Stoker's Dracula).  The second complaint is the use of Christopher Walken.

"Dark, but sweet","Another great Tim Burton movie, Sleepy Hollow is a great re-telling of the Ichabod Crane story.This movie, in fact, reminds me strongly of another Halloween feature by Burton: ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".

But they both have something in common: they are sweet, lovable films. There is something about Burton, indeed.Another thing worthy of mention: the cinematography is masterfully executed. How could they capture such a range of hues with such a dim light is beyond me.A great movie.

A VERY good ride,"Tim Burton's incarnation ""Sleepy Hollow"" sends viewers on a journey with Icabod Crane (Johnny Depp), who has been exiled to investigate a series of mysterious murders in upstate New York so as to rid New York City courts of his objections to their methods of ringing in justice. Armed with a plethora of investigative gadgets of his own making, he is much like a panicky, somewhat slow version of Sherlock Holmes ... if he fainted a lot.Crane meets the cast of town elders and their juniors, as well as Catrina (Christina Ricci), the somewhat enigmatic daughter of the host who summoned him from NYC.The story follows Crane and his young sidekick, an orphaned boy who is perhaps slightly more bold than Crane himself, as they look into the murders, search for the missing heads, and attempt to deduce exactly what the motives could be and who is behind the murders, not to mention who or what the horseman actually is.I enjoyed this film immensely. It had the characteristic Burton touches, where even the use of shades of brown would perhaps be considered too flamboyant for the screen. It used flashbacks effectively to flesh out the Crane character, using bits from his childhood which give the viewer an insight into how he is constituted.Depp delivered an extremely fine performance as the fish-out-of-water constable, and the comedy of the movie reveals itself through Crane. Ricci's performance was acceptable. There really wasn't a great deal that could be done with her character and the voice given Catrina, so no performance would have really shone through. The young sidekick, as well as other supporting characters (including those portrayed by Jeffrey Jones, Miranda Richardson, and Christopher Walken) were played very well, also.The story itself wasn't anything special, nor was the way it was presented. You know what to expect when you go to a Tim Burton movie, and you get it.The intangible this film delivers is, for lack of a better term, fun. This is a FUN movie to sit back and watch. The chase scenes and fight scenes are top-notch and invite the viewer in to the point where you feel almost as though you're there, trying to avoid becoming the next victim to fall prey to the horseman's sword or axe.It was shot beautifully, had solid performances, and takes the viewer on a ride that eclipses any single element of the film.

Sleepy...,"From the early moments, ""Sleepy Hollow"" grabbed my attention. I was immediately taken in by the story. The dark and somber tone set by Tim Burton in many of his previous films was just as evident in the beginning here. Several elements were working together to create an intriguing movie.The design was almost perfect. The colors that made up the background were washed out to a near black and white. Like he has done many times before, Burton gave a lifelike appearance to trees, as well as, houses. The eerie look of the forest was picture perfect. A nearly everlasting darkness was captured with excellent cinematography. The story itself was building up and the acting was strong. Johnny Depp produced a great mix of humor, intelligence, and girlish fear. It was the perfect setting for such a terrifying character as the headless horseman. Burton found a way to strike the audience with fear and managed to find time for some dark comedy in between. This was shaping up to be a classic horror film. I could tell I was going to enjoy this film all the way through.I was wrong.Everything falls apart in the second half. The story becomes too complicated, although not confusing. The idea of a ""conspiracy theory"" is not fitting. The movie loses its edge and the mood it sets by turning into an average crowd-pleasing blockbuster. Although it didn't bother me, the horseman chops off about 10 heads too many. I actually enjoyed that and found that rather funny. Christopher Walken is funny in this movie and I'm not making fun of him. Several chase scenes and explosions follow. It doesn't look like a Tim Burton movie after a while. I lost my initial interest and actually found myself thinking about other things while watching the final 20 minutes or so. Whatever is built up in the first half, it's destroyed in the second.The movie is worth seeing for what it creates in the early stages. The cinematography and settings of this film remain beautiful. Johnny Depp portrays Crane very effectively. However, the story falls apart and reaches a simple resolution filled with explosions. All good elements are drowned out. I just find the second half too disappointing. Overall a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
I hated this movie,"I have in the past loved Tim Burton. I loved Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and even Mars Attacks. But I hate this movie. The costume drama scenes in the beginning were the sort of poorly done, stodgy things that used to plague historical drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the head-cutting scenes, which just left me cold, and that's the sort of thing that ought to mean something, I would think. Yes, there were some nice bare trees and foggy evenings and the horseman jumping out of the tree was a nice special effect, but on the whole the movie was just boring and pointless.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Depp is policeman/amateur pathologist (yes, suspend any sense of reality right now!) Ichabod Crane who is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to solve the mystery of murders in which people are decapitated.Without spoiling the plot there's the compulsory love interest (Ricci), the wonderful Miranda Richardson as her step mother and plenty of gore and blood with the special effects of heads being removed at source.It was fun though, and does justice to one of the more famous scary stories you read as you were growing up.

A wonderfully atmospheric film,"I have never seen some of the so-called classics that The Hammer films produced, nor have I seen many of the classic horror films that Lugosi and Lee and Price have made.  But from what I have read and heard, those films were very atmospheric and had many shots of murky graveyards, dark streets with only dimly lit lights and monsters that seemed unstoppable to the average human being.  And it may be true that it has been about 40 years since those kinds of films graced our screens, but I think Tim Burton has produced a film that is a throw back to those types of films.  I have never been a huge fan of Burton's work but I must say that this film is as atmospheric and entertaining as I could imagine it to be.What makes this film so well done is the fact that the time frame allows for many of the abnormal shots and situations.  The year is 1899 and this is before electricity and cars and automatic weapons.  This is a time when light is shed by candle, people get around on horses and the weapon of choice for most is still the sword.  Thus the possibilities are endless with what you can do.  Tim Burton wisely gives us much to marvel at.  The opening sequence that has one of the townfolk decapitated is so well done that you are almost afraid that the rest of the film can't possibly follow in the footsteps of the brilliant first ten minutes.  But it does and it does it consistently.  There are many scenes with dense fog and dark nights, and that is the real strength of the film.The film also contains some rather humorous parts with Depp, as Ichabod Crane, using his new scientific methods of detective work much to the awe and sometimes chagrin of the town folk.  In one rather funny scene, Crane arrives at the scene of a decapitated body.  He inspects it and as he does so, he knows the body has been moved.  ""Have you moved the body?"" he asks the confused man.  ""Yes, I did."" he replies.  ""You should never move the body at the scene of a murder."" Crane tells him angrily.  And then with a confused tone and bewildered eyes, the man responds, ""Why not?""  And then Crane pauses for a minute and then says hesitantly, ""Because, you just shouldn't.""  It is a perfect scene.  Crane is just discovering many of his scientific theories and he knows that you shouldn't do something but not really why.  His confusion is humorous to us, the audience and many other scenes are played for laughs in the same way.But let's face it, we didn't go to this film to be humoured, we went to be at least mildly frightened.  And I have to say that fright was not something that I experienced watching the film.  The headless horseman is a vicious villian and he is relentless in his pursuit of heads, but he is not really scary.  That is not to say that the film is poor because of this, it is just to say that scares are few and far between in the film.  The rest of the experience is a positive one and I honestly have to say that the decapitation scenes are a wonder.  I understand that they can do much with computer animation now, but the cut from live action to computer animation is so subtle that you cannot even remotely tell what is real and what is a CGI.  Similarily, if anyone remembers the first Friday the 13th film when Kevin Bacon dies, he gets a spear through the throat and they had to do that by cutting from one angle to the next and then put   a replica of his body under the covers.  As the spear came through the bedsprings and the mattress and into his throat it had the appearance that it was really going through his body when in reality his head was nowhere near the fake body.  They then added some coloured chocolate syrup to make it look real.  But you can tell that there was a deliberate cut in angles to complete the affect.  In Sleepy Hollow there is no change in camera angles, it really is quite impressive.Sleepy Hollow is a fun film, it is not great but it is worth the ten dollars that you will spend at the theater to watch it.  Christopher Walken is priceless as the Horseman and even though he has no spoken dialogue he is one of the more entertaining actors and charcters in the film.  Depp is good and so is Ricci.  Principal Ed Rooney is also quite good in his small role. And some of the British actors are perfect in creating the atmosphere that you need to pull a film off like this.  One in particular I think I recognize from Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, he was Duncan, the man who gets his eyes removed.  At least he looks like the same actor.All around, this is a good film and anyone who likes atmosphere will surely enjoy it.  It is also nice to see Francis Coppola in the producers chair again.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A blood-drenched gothic adaptation!,"The Tale Of The Headless Horseman wonderfully realised! Washington Irving's original story follows Ichabod Crane (here played by Johnny Depp) a teacher living in a private town named Sleepy Hollow. He learns of urban legend the Headless Horseman who rides at night, lopping the head off of anyone he comes across and bringing them back down to hell as the sun rises. Alone in the woods one night, he comes face to face with the horror! This adaptation turns Crane into a New York detective with a very squeamish side who is sent to the town to give a scientific conclusion to this urban legend and unravel the mystery of the increasing murders happening. The film is sumptuously designed with gorgeous gothic style and imagery which is a real visual and thematic treat! What may also surprise newcomers is that it's also really funny in places; Depp is again fantastic in the lead role and brings an innocent boyishness to it, providing a lot of the dark comedy. The romantic subplot is explored well with Katrina Van Tassel being portrayed well by Christina Ricci; Crane's love interest throughout. Ricci is beautifully cast in Burton's world along with a host of great supporting roles from Christopher Walken, Christopher Lee and Lisa Marie as Crane's mother. If you are squeamish, there are sequences here that will be hard to watch including autopsies of decapitated bodies and a certain bloody kiss that Ichabod himself would find difficult to stomach! A fantastically moody Elfman score weaves throughout and there are certain horrific images that will stay in your head for some time; also beautiful ones such as the twisted Tree of the Dead. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lunezki drapes the visuals in luscious gothic mastery making it feel very much like a silent horror movie. Although the mystery is resolved a little too neatly at the end of the film, it's still a very well adapted piece of gothic cinema with a biting edge and one that I remember really well from watching it as a kid",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Well Executed, but not spectacular","I always believed that movie critics accentuated too much on the negative aspects of movies.  Therefore I want to acknowledge the good aspects of this movie.  First is Tim Burton's direction.  He is able to create the perfect mood for the movie, frightening and simultaneously ridiculous.  It is beautifully photographed.  The ensemble actors suit the time period so well, they appear to be oil paintings instead of people.  Danny Elfman's beautifully dark and complex score is a perfect match to the action at all times.  However, Depp carries this movie on his charismatic shoulders.  His driven yet cowardly Ichabod Crane is strangely riveting.  Ricci also flashes her acting talent as well as her haunting eyes to create a vulnerable and curious character.But there are many flaws in this movie.  The plot is interesting, but the dialogue is subpar and the love interest between Katrina and Ichabod has no basis.  We are supposed to believe that they fall in love, ""Just Because"". Many major plot elements are thrown in simply to create mood, such as the story of Ichabod's mother.  Some other elements are simply unnecessary gore and disturbing material.  I will not even touch upon the total ignorance of Washington Irving's original short story.  Let us say that it was changed enough that if Irving were alive today, they could have skipped out on the royalties.  However this is an above average movie, and has many scary moments.  Bottom Line, it's worth $7.50 if you just want to see a movie, but don't go out of your way.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A perfect movie to watch on a chilly october evening!,"Tim Burton knows how to create an amazing atmosphere and this is one of the examples. You can almost feel the chilly autumn air and hear the leaves rustle in the wind, the foggy village of Sleepy hollow and the creepy Western Woods look and feel perfect. It's that fine line between funny and scary that this movie walks, sometimes almost falling to one side, then the other! Depp is in fine form as the mumbling, but ultimately heroic detective and the rest of the cast does a good job too. The Horseman is both cool and intimidating. Has atmospheric horror, violent and gory horror and also some psychological horror! A very good supernatural gothic horror flick!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Another Impressive Collaboration Between Tim Burton & Johnny Depp!,"Marking the third collaboration between a filmmaker who's always been fascinated by dark, Gothic tales & an actor who has a penchant for playing eccentric characters, Sleepy Hollow is a terrific blend of horror & comedy that plays to the strength of both Tim Burton & Johnny Depp and is further improved by its stunning visual design, clever casting & eerie ambiance.Set at the turn of the 19th century, Sleepy Hollow tells the story of a police constable who favours forensic techniques over traditional methods when it comes to solving a case and accepts the alternative to imprisonment which requires him to travel to the village of Sleepy Hollow in order to investigate a series of murders, believed to be carried out by the mythic Headless Horseman.Directed by Tim Burton, Sleepy Hollow packs in one of those stories that this director likes to translate on the silver screen and he does a really good job here. Its aptly twisted story exhibits the look n feel of a dark & disturbing horror but in actuality is far more light-hearted than expected. The technical aspects are expertly executed for the most part, with its visual design being an impressive highlight.Production design team does a stellar job with the set pieces and even the timeline this film is set in is nicely recreated on the film canvas. Cinematography is truly bewitching and the use of smokes, minimal lights & monochromatic colour tones provide a highly Gothic feel to the whole picture. Editing could've been better for there were a few segments it could have done without while Danny Elfman's score brings an energy of its own.Coming to the acting department, Sleepy Hollow features a splendid cast in Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Christopher Walken, Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson & others with Depp impressing the most. Getting under the skin of his character from the get go, he is very much in command here and his magnetic screen presence further helps his role while Ricci & others provide good supporting performances in their given roles.On an overall scale, Sleepy Hollow is an incessantly Gothic chiller that's brilliantly directed, finely written, gorgeously photographed, faithfully scored & nicely performed and presents both Burton & Depp in superb form. The scare factor is very much diminished by its quirky humour & comical effects but the ghostly atmosphere nonetheless plays an important role in sustaining its ominous vibe throughout its runtime. Delightfully recommended.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
it's time for everything to go in one direction,"Everyone knows ""The Tale of Sleepy Hollow"". Well, here Tim Burton has tweaked it a little. In this case, Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a New York City constable in 1799 who is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate some bizarre decapitations. In the process, he not only gets interested in Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), but he also discovers a small-scale conspiracy relating to a bloodthirsty Hessian soldier (Christopher Walken) who was beheaded during the Revolutionary War.As usual, Tim Burton puts an interesting spin on everything. Maybe some parts are a bit overdone, mainly Johnny Depp's overacting, but the whole movie will definitely have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Sumptuous horror classic,"-31 Days Of Horror: Day 2Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is an unapologetically gory spook fest that although has genuinely scary moments, is mostly energized by a vibe of pure rollicking fun. Even the violence is a joy to behold, as countless heads are severed and fly about the landscape all throughout the film. Burton takes a rare dip into R rated waters here, and really goes for it. It's almost a throwback to the Hammer horror films of the past (Christopher Lee even makes a nice little cameo), wearing it's influences proudly on its sleeve and thrumming with a baroque, grand old atmosphere of misty grey and earthy brown, punctuated by frequent and ample gallons of crimson blood. Johnny Depp nervously plays Inspector Ichabod Crane, a twitchy detective sent from New York to rural upstate town of Sleepy Hollow, where someone is murdering people in the night, and taking their heads. There he finds intrigue, romance, unimaginable horror, and a bunch of townspeople who are less than exactly helpful, and have secrets of their own. Legend has it that the killer is a Headless Horseman, which Crane finds to be all too true when he digs deeper. The Horseman is played by, you guessed it, a demonic Christopher Walken (there's really no other choice when you think about it) looking like something that walked out of Where The Wild Things Are. Dumbledo- I mean Michael Gambon plays the mayor, Miranda Richardson is a standout as his conniving wife. There's also fine work from Jeffrey Jones, a ghostly Michael Gough looking like he's got one foot in the grave, Martin Landau, Vernon Dursle- I mean Richard Griffiths, Caspar Van Dien, Lisa Marie and Darth Sideo- I mean Ian Mcdiarmid. Christina Ricci is a vision as Katrina Von Tassel, the mysterious mayors daughter who Crane falls for. The film is one of the most absolutely gorgeous looking pieces of work I've ever seen, every frame a breathtaking storybook frame of wonder, menace and atmospheric Gothic horror. The plot becomes more complicated than initially implied, spinning a wheel of intrigue that gives each character something fun to do. And indeed, amid the bloody chaos and suffering, the film never loses its sense of fun, allowing moments of comedy and ironic edges to the violence. Burton beckons us into the haunted house he's so painstakingly created, and he doesn't let us down. It's my favourite of his films, and one hell of a ride.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"A well-made, entertaining horror film","Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a wonderfully enjoyable film, complete with top-notch acting and first-rate direction. Burton solidifies his position as one of the premiere visual filmmakers in Hollywood. Johnny Depp stars as Ichabod Crane, a constable (in this version, anyway) who is sent up from New York by his frustrated superiors to solve a series of spooky murders.Depp is superb as Crane. He plays the constable not as the generic fast-thinking gun-slinging detective; instead, he paints Crane as an intelligent romantic with a slight touch of cowardice. It's fun to see such a smart, believable performance. Christina Ricci has a nice supporting turn as Katrina Van Tassel, Crane's young love interest. And then there's the always watchable Jeffrey Jones, who, in my mind, will always be known as the principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.Burton's use of the camera is masterful. He creates a haunting, eerie mood not seen in a horror movie since Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula in 1992. The dark tone of the cinematography combines well with Danny Elfman's score, producing a remarkably engrossing effect.Sleepy Hollow loses steam late, and its ending, although satisfactory, is not incredible. The screenplay jumps around a little too much, and one character is sort of tossed in at the end and is in need of more development. Unlike the far superior Dracula, which had several excellent supporting roles to beef up the film, Sleepy Hollow is pretty much one-dimensional. But this movie isn't supposed to be a cerebral masterpiece but a visual one, and it certainly is that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
One of Burton's & Depp's best...,"Ichabod Crane (Depp) is sent to Sleepy Hollow by his superiors in New York to uncover the mysterious decapitation murders which have recently plagued the eerie town. Katrina (Ricci) is immediately drawn to Crane, whom serves as her love interest, while he searches for answers with his unusual techniques.While many of the minor roles are done by big names, this film is really Depp, Ricci and Walken (despite him being mostly headless). Ian McDiarmid, Christopher Lee, Richard Griffiths, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gough and Michael Gambon all put their personal touch on their characters while still being recognizable.I may not be the biggest Tim Burton fan, but he does have his good days. Sleepy Hollow is an example of one of his best. Tim Burton's influence is felt from the very first frame. That's not a bad thing, however, as the film needs a creepy tone to it. Disney's animated film was always one of my favourites as a child and this film serves the purpose of bringing the story to life completely.Sleepy Hollow is able to live on as a masterpiece of live-action. It's not great when it comes to the action sequences or when you look at the deaths in the film like you would in a '90s slasher flick. But the essence is in the plot and the characters that bring this story to life. That's where the true greatness of the film lies.Depp doesn't have to be the unsung hero in the film to win over audiences. Despite the good looks of Depp and Crane not really known to be attractive, Depp's portrayal is top-notch due to the mannerisms. He nailed the eccentric qualities, the squeamishness, the clumsy nature of Crane where you can believe that at any moment Crane will bite the dust too. Ricci is the audiences' reliable character for the expositions and for whom we can follow to know how the story progresses.With the limited special effects done by Star Wars' Industrial Light & Magic, an original set created and fantastic costume design, Sleepy Hollow hits a homerun on the first pitch. It's a fantastic film and must see for all since its truly one of the best films from the '90s and on the resumes of Burton, Depp, and Ricci.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

A few bumps but will please any Burton fan,"Ichabod Crane (Depp) ventures to Sleepy Hollow, a place of frequent murders by the apparent legend of the Headless Horseman and soon Crane finds himself deeper than his intention.The visionary director of darkness Tim Burton delivers another darkly stunning stroke of a creepy legend that sees Johnny Depp star as a detective investigating the strange happenings at the uncomfortable settings of Sleepy Hollow.Based on Washington Irving's story, Burton's 1999 take is dark and grizzly with his typical dark styling any fan would love. The design and shots of the Hollow are typically haunting and exudes the moment in the script to be sharp and interesting, giving audiences the occasional jump along with awe at the accomplishment of the idea of a mass murderer in Burton's wonderland.Since he launched on our screens in the 1980's the director has certainly created a vivid depiction of happy is sad and sad is happy with a florescent wave of dark semiotics and appreciation of the story, Edward Scissorhands and Beetle juice stand outs.Here, with the story arguably one of the darkest he has ever tackled bar Sweeney Todd, we see him take up a more action orientated agenda. Chases in woods on horseback, spooky magic connotations and deathly sword swipes give a strong vibe of excitement and bliss to fill the room with engaged faces.There are a few drawbacks to this motive, particularly given the story's intentions. For one, the opening stages with Crane in court and then riding towards the Hollow is all very formal and rather drab and then encoding spurts of action in the story's moment doesn't feel quite right. One example would be when in the forest and Crane goes inside the tree trunk and the bizarre happenings in there feel disorientated in the plot's motive to suss out the villain.Marginally Burton salvages these with the wonderfully shot action moments anyway but the feeling of the story is never quite right in its overall intention as a crime and with horror to justify, there was too much ambition intended.Depp, like in From Hell, puts on a brave accent that, whilst articulate, doesn't get away from his character being incredibly frustrating to watch. The nervous and confused detective is often misbalanced through dissecting a body then crying over a spider that won't give any edgy viewers confidence.Not that there are too many frights anyway, which given the story of a headless serial killer, is a shame.The supporting cast of Ricci, Gambon and Richardson do the necessities of back filling historical foundation well enough and Danny Elfman's score once more is inch perfect.Given the promise it is a slight let down but regardless Burton carves up glorious set design and action that will please his army of fans.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Visual But Very Gory Delight,"""Sleepy Hollow"" was a visual delight--though I had to frequently turn away from the gory and very frequent decapitations and other bloody detail (which the teen boys in the audience thought were ""awesome"") making it hard to keep eating my popcorn.I thought it odd that in a Dutch colonial town everyone spoke with a Brit accent (I guess Christina Ricci being younger was more Americanized), but I enjoyed seeing so many Masterpiece Theater grads, as it was shot on a London sound stage.Director Tim Burton switches from serious to camp and back, but the knowing script references defuse the gore, with a lot of tips-of-the-hat to ""The X Files,"" and Johnny Depp's coward-alternating-with-hero is refreshing, borrowing a lot more from Edgar Allen Poe, the inventor of the detective novel, than Washington Irving.I think this could give young kids nightmares.(originally written 11/21/1999)",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

"Not perfect, but a hell of a lot of fun!","Tim Burton's output has been a bit hit and miss, but he is always stylish and interesting, and 'Sleepy Hollow' is certainly both.

I must say it also looks MUCH better after his 'Planet Of The Apes' debacle!This is one sumptuous looking movie which oozes atmosphere. Burton has gone on record as being a major fan of Mario Bava, and this movie homages him on more than a few occasions. Johnny Depp gives a mannered, campy performance that doesn't (for the most part) irritate too much, Christina Ricci looks lovely and mysterious, and the two are supported by a smashing cast of first rate actors, including Michael Gambon ('The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover'), Miranda Richardson ('The Crying Game'), Michael Gough (the Batman series), and Burton semi-regular Jeffrey Jones ('Ravenous'), plus cameos from horror legend Christopher Lee, Martin Landau, and a well cast, wordless Christopher Walken.A very enjoyable romp with wit, chills, and more gore than you would expect.

Starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones and Christopher Walken.

Both him and Christina Ricci do well in this stylistic period thriller, which is successful, because its original, fresh, and despite the dialogue which is heavy, its still entertaining throughout. The acting and atmosphere is what sets it apart from mediocre films of its kind.This movie is suspenseful because the music, cinematography and acting all contribute to keep it frightening, yet compelling. Another solid Johnny Depp performance and film. At times it seemed a bit long, but the third act picks up the pace and does well to finish off strong.

Great Atmosphere and Style but Suffering Story,"Tim Burton was perfect for this, so was the cast, and what really brought this film to life was the atmosphere. Burton pulled off a dark moody 1700s landscape complete with fog and mist right out of the 50s-60s horror movie classics and it works well. Most of the characters look almost created by Burton himself having certain personalities that make the parts absent of the headless horseman enjoyable. When the headless horseman does appear it is pulled off very well partly do to good special effects and Ray Park (Darth Maul from Episode One). What confused me was the story. The story tries to weave the old tale of sleepy hollow into a mystery while providing a action gore fest for those who couldn't keep up with the whole plot. The reason for this being the background of the characters and their names which still remain distant to me (except those from the Disney cartoon). I liked the dark humor Burton usually tries to thrown in and Depp along with Ricci played good roles as they usually do. I would see this movie as I did, at a matinee. Its a beautiful film scarred by a dull who-done-it mystery story.

"Good, but not typical Burton","I had an odd reaction to Sleepy Hollow: the acting, particularly by Johnny Depp, was excellent; the plot was much more clever than the original story; and Burton produces some eerie moments and the movie looks uniformly dreamy.  But . . . for some reason it all left me unaffected.  I would give the film a ""thumbs up"" and recommend it, but maybe I've come to expect more from the man who created Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas. Maybe the plot was a little TOO clever, too convoluted to quite buy into. Maybe the scenes of the Horseman doing his thing were a little too realistic and unimaginative.  I admired the film's craft, but the whole thing failed to connect on an emotional level.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Burton's best film; a masterpiece,"POSITIVES:1) Most of Burton's films get annoying by how much of an outsider they make the lead character, and how the villain is always society for brandishing the lead as an outsider, but in this film Burton is much more restrained and this adds to the validity of the film
2) The film still has all the great Burton elements, including the gothic production design and the front and centre score from Danny Elfman
3) The dynamic that Crane is a man ahead of his time, with far more advanced methods of detective work than what was normal in 1799, adds a very interesting dynamic to the film
4) I could wax lyrical about this film but I'll stop thereNEGATIVES:1) I can understand why people would see some negatives in the film, especially people who don't enjoy the dramatic tendencies of Burton, but I would be lying if I said that I wasn't completely swept up in the film to the point that there was no obvious negatives for me",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Good until last 1/3,"It seems strange that I would be a Tim Burton fan, I think, because I've seen little of the movies which influenced him as a kid(the old-style horror and science-fiction movies) and am more of a fan of narrative fiction than he is(I can't remember if I've included this story or not, but here goes; I read an interview where Daniel Waters, one of the writers on BATMAN RETURNS, talked about how he looked forward to writing Burton's first coherent narrative, only to be turned around by Burton being the equivalent of Obi-Wan Kenobi telling Luke, ""Use the force!"").  But I think he's funny, visually inventive, and has surprising depth.  I think he was the wrong person to do the BATMAN movies, but I've enjoyed all of his other movies, especially EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and ED WOOD, which, by coincidence, both happen to be the movies starring Johnny Depp.  So it follows I was eagerly looking forward to SLEEPY HOLLOW, their latest collaboration.For about 2/3 of the way, this was good.  The look, as usual, was stunning, and he does a good job of creating tension, menace, and atmosphere.  The five character actors playing the town's leading citizens(including Burton favorite Jeffrey Jones, who appeared in BEETLEJUICE and ED WOOD) add to that menace.  The sound of the sword alone was scary.  Christina Ricci doesn't get a lot to do, but she does look lovely, and looks appropriate to the period and the town.  As for Depp, this is a parody of sorts from him; he's applying the Ichabod Crane of the original story and playing him as if he really were a police constable(If he had played it straight, the movie would have felt wrong from the beginning).  This is most apparent in the scene where he's using gadgets to explain what is already obvious to the rest of the town.The problem, however, comes when it's time to wrap things up.  One of the screenwriters here is Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote SEVEN.  That was a serial killer movie with a difference, which didn't follow a traditional formula, but was disturbing and original.  Here, however, we get the feeling that he felt, despite Burton's attachment and the story's horror roots, this was in essence a serial killer movie, and gave it a conventional ending.  In retrospect, without giving anything away, the ending is logical, but it hangs on a couple of details which are barely  on-screen, and is handled so flatly that the movie bogs down, just when it's supposed to excite us most. Also, some of the characters involved are so sketchy, the explanations about them feel last-minute to cover up weak parts of the story.  If someone had found a less literal-minded ending, I think that would have worked better. As it is, it's a good film, but it's Burton's first non-BATMAN film I've had problems with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

A great story with a nice twist.,"I have watched all of Tim Burton's films, and this one did not disappoint. Burton lives in an obscure world of his own and you can see that in his work. Not only in the typed of movies that he does, but also in the style of the sets. Sleepy Hallow is an age old tale, but Burton puts his own flavor in the way the film is made. Even though Christopher Doesn't really have any lines in the film, other that a hush and a few screams, he put on a nice and eerie performance. Crane was in town investigating these mysterious murders, but there was a more underlying sinister backstory. This is where the twist comes in. In this movie, you as the viewer are trying to pin point what is really going on, but, things aren't always what they seen. I suggest that you pay close attention to the plot and to each character.

Burton Once Again Delivers a Fantastic Looking Film,"Tim Burton's latest is a highly polished film visually, with very convincing gloomy sets awash in fog and shallow lighting.  The audience certainly never needs to question believability of the dreary setting.Both music and sound effects are put to good use in this, as well as a couple of highly effective implemenations of off-screen space to terrify without explicitly smacking one in the face with an image (although the film certainly has its fair share of decapitations). Be sure to look for the color red as a free visual motif...Although the film looks terrific, the narrative is weak at points.  In particular, Burton's choice of falling back on the annoying situation in which the antagonist proceeds into a five minute monologue near the end of the film in which all of the prior plot events are reviewed and all of the ambiguities are cleared up, is unfortunate and really ruins the pace of the film. On top of that, the love story between Depp and Ricci was thin and unconvincing.However, Burton's macabre sense of humor really shines in this film, and much of the dialogue involving Depp is very tongue-in-cheek and very amusing (unfortunately, I think many people mistook Burton's sense of humor as either bad scripting or bad acting).In all, I found this film to be both frightening and humorous, and all-around entertaining.  I just wish it would have been released around Halloween... Oh, and Christopher Walken is absolutely terrifying as the headless horseman!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Tim Burton's best movie,"I didn't feel that way at first, but in retrospect I really do think it's his best movie. The plot is secondary to the visuals, but it's done well. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci give thoughtful, romantic performances as a detective from New York City and the beautiful villager he falls for while investigating a series of gruesome murders the town believes is being executed by a faceless spectre riding on a horse. Whilst everything he knows as a scientist falls down around him, his love for her and her faith in him remain constant. And this is not the innocent Sleepy Hollow of Washington Irving's tale-- this is a farmtown overflowing with adultery, witchcraft, and murder. 	And THEN, there are the visuals. The film is filled with images that are vintage Burton: Ichabod (Depp) puts on investigating glasses, and the left lens is twice the size of the right; the staggering Tree of the Dead, whose branches twist in grotesque angles and stream with blood; and the Horseman himself, who lops off heads cleanly and with precision, has a decidedly otherwordly style. 	Overall, this is a gorgeous film brimming over with high comedy and winning romance. The identity of the person in cahoots with the Horseman is no big surprise, but getting there is the fun in this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Inside Tim Burton's strange, nightmare, Gothic world","While watching ""Sleepy Hollow"" I was struck by certain similarities between Tim Burton's work and some of Terry Gilliam's films such as ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" and ""The Brothers Grimm"". Both directors have a vivid visual imagination and a good eye for a striking image. Both are fascinated by myth and legend and by the clash between Classical reason and the Romantic imagination. It is noteworthy that ""Sleepy Hollow"" takes place in 1799/1800, just as the eighteenth century, the Age of Reason, is giving way to the nineteenth, the Age of Romanticism.The film is very loosely based upon Washington Irving's story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"". New York police constable Ichabod Crane is sent by his superiors to the upstate village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders in which the victims have been found decapitated. He is informed by the local people that the killings have been not been carried out by any flesh-and-blood human but by a mysterious Headless Horseman, believed to be the ghost of a Hessian soldier killed during the War of Independence. Ichabod dismisses such tales as mere superstition, as he is a rationalist with no belief in the supernatural and a great belief in modern, scientific methods of police investigation. He suspects that the village's richest citizen, Baltus van Tassel, might be behind the murders, which is unfortunate as he has fallen in love with Baltus's daughter Katrina. As his investigations continue, however, and several more killings take place, he is forced to conclude that something supernatural might be occurring, that the Headless Horseman is real and that someone might be controlling him.Despite the film's American setting, it was actually filmed in Britain, with numerous British actors such as Sir Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson and Richard Griffiths in the cast. (Like Gilliam, Burton appears to be something of an Anglophile). The strongest influences on the film were the horror films produced by Hammer Film Productions in the sixties and seventies; Christopher Lee, who starred in many of those films, has a cameo appearance here. The village of Sleepy Hollow, with its half-timbered houses, is more reminiscent of the sort of fantasy Mittel-Europa seen in Hammer films like ""Twins of Evil"" than it is of colonial America; this look may also have inspired the village seen in ""The Brothers Grimm"".The film has its weaknesses. The plot is little more than standard Hammer fare and the acting, at least in the leading roles, is not always of the highest quality. I have admired Christina Ricci in some of her other roles, such as ""The Opposite of Sex"" and ""Monster"" (a film I did not otherwise care for), but here, as Katrina, she seems too deadpan, never showing much emotion even when people, including members of her family, are killed in front of her. Johnny Depp always seemed too fey and effeminate. He stated that he always thought of Ichabod ""as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl"", but this characterisation makes it difficult to believe in Ichabod as a courageous action hero, which he develops into in the latter part of the film. This was the third film collaboration between Depp and Burton, but I must say that I preferred his performances in ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Ed Wood"".""Sleepy Hollow's"" greatest strength is its distinctive visual style. Although most Hammer films were made in lurid colour, Burton apparently contemplated shooting the film in black and white. This idea was later abandoned, but the look of the finished film is almost monochromatic with a colour scheme dominated by blacks and dark greys and few bright tones other than the red of the blood. (Len Wiseman was to attempt a similar look in ""Underworld""). The idea was to give the film an eerie, otherworldly, look, and Burton succeeds well in this aim. He takes us inside a strange, nightmare Gothic world, a world of headless horsemen, of trees of the dead and of haunted windmills, a world of graphic violence leavened by a certain grim humour. It is the sort of film where style is indeed more important than substance, and style is something it has in plenty. I would not, however, rate it as highly as Burton's best films, such as ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Big Fish"", where he combines his distinctive visual style with material of greater substance than anything in ""Sleepy Hollow"". 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Weird, kind of cheesy, but excellent cinematography","""Sleepy Hollow"" is one of those movies with the trailers that you've seen a thousand times, and that reveal a lot about the movie.  A lot of the best and most exciting scenes are given away in the commercials.  The actual movie has excellent cinematography, and very in-depth camera shots.  The mood of the movie that is set by the background, props, and cinematography is a dark, depressing, cold, and scary.  I would've liked this movie a lot less had it not been for the excellent art direction.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Tim Burton's worst by far,"A very weak movie. The special effect did not overcome the meandering plot. Also probably Johnny Depp's worst.  The most crassly commercial movie I have seen those two make. Not only did they include dream like flashbacks..which have almost nothing to do with the movie, they lift liberally from them in the trailers..so you get a very misleading idea of what the movie is about.

Lots of fun,"Just saw this movie again for Halloween.  It's a great littleHalloween movie.  It's lots and lots of fun.  There is a couple ofholes in the plot if one scrutinizes it too much.  Johnny Depp issuperb as usual.  Christian Ricci was good, too.  Christopher Leeshowed up in brief cameo but at least he showed up.  The actorwho plays the headless horseman with a head is the perfect actorfor the part.  Visually it is absolutely beautiful.  I loved the setdesign and cinematography.

"Gory, glossy and goofy.","This film had so much promise.  It had a wonderful cast and good director but it seems the story was not enough to sustain a movie of this length. The story meandered from character to character looking for a focus.  It was moodily photographed and had some great effects, head lopping never looked so real. It looked really nice but lacked substance.  Dreams sequences of Crane's Victoria Secret clad mother had to be added as filler.  They had nothing to do with the story.

A piece of art!,"When the first scenes of this magnificent piece of art started passing my eyes,my brain could not believe that it was a movie!Everything looked so artistic and exquisite, I felt like I was visiting an art exhibition and looking at some geniuses dream paintings! If we could converse one movie still into a painting, it's almost certain that art critics and historians would be having quite some job for many years!

The costume design and dialogue were terrific. The set up was beautiful with the dark woods and lights in the houses.

"This Movie is ""all together ooky""",I loved this movie.  The fact that it bears no resemblance to the short story by Washington Irving really didn't affect my opinion of it.  I think if Burton had approached it as just another chapter of Sleepy Hollow people would have been more accepting of it.  The biggest complaint I hear about it is that it isn't like the story.  Aside from that it's a great story and has some incredible effects. DVD really affords the viewer the luxury of watching the heads get whacked off in slow motion.

pretty but useless,"this film had a lot of potential - it's a great story and has the potential to be very creepy.  but of course tim burton doesn't really do creepy films, he does wacky cartoonish films.  and i usually like tim burton's stuff. but i thought this film was really weak.  the best thing about the film (and it is actually worth seeing just for this) was the art direction - the film has an amazing intangible quality to it.  the script was not good.  it was boring in parts and confusing in other parts, and there was no building of characters.  i never really cared that people were having their heads lopped off by a headless being.  i thought johnny depp had a good thing going with his approach to the character, but given that the script was weak he couldn't go too far with it - and i was very irritated by the attempts at a slight accent on his and christina ricci's parts.anyway, it is sadly not a great film and not worth seeing unless you are interested in the art direction.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Not the best Tim Burton movie,"Good story and superb settings (See New York in 1799 and the houses of the village). But it don't have that Tim Burton touch. There is not humor.

The Headless Horseman rides again,"Burton once again displays his amazing knack for atmosphere and makes us all thankful for his penchant for working with Danny Elfman.  SLEEPY HOLLOW is a definite must-see; a classic story with breathtaking special effects. Here, the special effects actually *add* to the story, as opposed to the movie being built around the special effects (Hear that, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2?). Thanks to the unforgettable visuals, nothing at all was changed about the Horseman's killing methods, and it's still far scarier than Freddy or Jason could ever be.  The production design is also to be raved about.  The town of Sleepy Hollow, and the surrounding area are at once familiar enough to call home, but spooky enough to make you want to stay the hell away.  This is what the magic of the movies are all about.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Dark and imaginative tale caught in genre trouble.,"Another addition to Tim Burton's series of dim-lit but very entertaining movies, `Sleepy Hollow' isn't a disappointment. The subject is a headless horseman in turn-of-the-century era New York outskirts. Burton's style is perceptible in the gloomy yet deeply moody atmosphere. But the film isn't perfect. The main problem is the lack of audience that this would appeal to. While it is a bloody horror, this seems as though it would appeal to the young male audience. But with the `Dangerous Liaison'-esque atmosphere and periodic settings, this seems like one for the cinematic elite.The film isn't a misfire and there are plenty of good things that stand. The costume designs and set pieces are very impressive and the visual effects are magnificent. But there are other things that decrease the positives. The dialogue is wooden and occasionally unconvincing. It works best as a horror and attempts at humour are laughably bad.But with a cast like this, you feel compelled to their every move, with Johnny Depp as the `Knight in shining armour'. Let's face it, he isn't suited to brawny action. In fact he must be the most effeminate superhero in the world. Unfortunately, he doesn't keep in with the audience and just doesn't cut it as the lead star. Luckily he is supported by a huge supporting cast, including Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Jeffrey Jones, Christopher Lee, Casper Van Dien, Martin Landau, Lisa Marie, Ian McDiarmuid, Michael Gambon, Michael Gough and Christopher Walken as the horseman himself. This endless amount of star-power well supports Johnny Depp in the lead and make the film all the more watchable.With so many positives, the negatives are almost completely erased. Yes the dialogue may be shamefully clunky, but Tim Burton could do much worse than this. So overall, `Sleepy Hollow' is a minor success. 6.3/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Decapitation has never been more fun,"One thing I liked about Tim Burton's update of the classic Legend of Sleepy Hollow, is that it's not stingy with the blood. Blood is poured all over the place, but not in a revolting sort of way, but in a way that you expect. The town is so dark and spooky, you welcome to grisly beheadings of the headless horseman.Johnny Depp, in his third Burton film, is a nice Ichabod Crane. He's such a wuss, yet he walks away with his skull intact. There's alot of Burton regulars like Jeffrey Jones and Christopher Walken. His girlfriend, Lisa Marie, plays a very bewitching spirit in the movie. But this is Christina Ricci's first outing in a Burton film, which is surprising since their personas are at the same dark level (she is like the new Winona Ryder in the new Tim Burton movies). Equally surprising is that she plays a sweet, innocent Katrina Van Tassel.But enough with the actors. The only time actors really mattered in a Burton film was ED WOOD.The headless horseman looks great in this movie, with or without his head. He goes right in with Burton's usual gorgeously dark background. But, also, he adds a little fairy tale flavor, which you get really into. Almost entrancing.The ending is the weak point of the film. Everything comes together too quickly, yet there's a chase scene climax that involves the horseman, and that's about when you look at your watch and realize you have to go to the bathroom.This is not Tim Burton's best movie, though the setting is marvelous, there's too many characters to keep up with and his usual cartoonish scares (like the one involving the witch) doesn't make you feel anything anymore.Maybe it's Andrew Kevin Walker's script, or at least the several revisions of it, which left the story muddled and uneven. It doesn't work for this movie, yet the decapitation scenes are loads of fun (who knew there were so many ways you could chop off a head!)",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Tremendous fun and great atmosphere.,"Director Tim Burton has added to his excellent and stylish body of work with a captivating adaption of Washington Irving's classic story. This film is marvelous; if there is any fault with ""Sleepy Hollow"" it is that it requires a viewer to pay attention to the plot - which is all the better for thinking adults. Movie-goers of any age will find something to love here, although be sure to keep the kiddies far away unless you want wet beds and sleepless nights: ""Sleepy Hollow"" gets off to a rousing start with two decapitations within the first few minutes.Instead of a timid skinny schoolteacher, Ichabod Crane is a New York City policeman in 1799 specializing in scientific ""detecting"" of crimes; he is soon sent to distant upstate New York in the heart of an isolated mostly old Dutch community - Sleepy Hollow - where murders by decapitation are occurring with distressing frequency. Crane, rather officious and slightly diffident in his own way, goes to the town that rises out of the misty smokey air in a hollow reminiscent of Brigadoon in the Scottish highlands.Crane soon discerns the conspiratorial nature of the leading townsmen, and that the Headless Horseman is indeed continuing his nighttime rides in search of heads. He is the incarnation of a bloodthirsty Hessian soldier from the Revolution killed by Americans in the woods that no one dares set foot in twenty years after he and his cut off head were buried there. The very logical Crane needed to see the town magistrate killed in front of him before he'd believe in the Headless Horseman.Soon Crane is striking up a bit of a romance with the daughter of a leading (and suspicious) citizen, Katrina. But there is more here than at first seems - much more. Clues of witchcraft use keep appearing and they point to her. A mystery begins to develop with many of the pieces discernible for the truly observant. The link between the conspiracy and the Horseman eventually gets pieced together, but only partially as a final twist leads to the climactic and heart-pounding conclusion.The plot holds together and develops very well. Fascinating clues and red herrings are sprinkled throughout the film; disjointed plot bits also all fuse together by the end with great effectiveness.  The art design and scenery is superlative and Burton knows masterfully how to create the right mood with his cinematography. The special effects are first rate, but Burton uses them judiciously merely to enhance the plot and emotion of the moment; this is thankfully not an ""effects"" movie.Depp is appropriately rather dazed and sometimes befuddled as Crane, although he rises to the occasion at the end. Ricci is vulnerable when needed, and the rest of the cast is effective too. Noteworthy is Christopher Walken in a non-speaking role as the Horseman and horror vet Michael Gough as a doomed notary.The movie ends with a beautiful snowy shot on Wall Street in January of 1800, and it is so accurate the original Federal Hall is on the right and the second Trinity Church is in the distance just across Broadway. The look of old New York is splendid. ""Sleepy Hollow"" is wonderful in every way, including such details that make one want to see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
beautifully done,"I can't think of anyone better than Tim Burton to do this movie.  No one can create moods and atmosphere in a rich, fantasy realm like Burton.All in all, Sleepy Hollow was a great film.  The set is exquisite.  Depp is lovable and hilarious as an intelligent, goofy, somewhat arrogant Ichabod. Altogether, everything comes together to make a great action/horror/comedy flick.Viewers should be advised, however, that the plot is actually quite thick. You have to really watch for details to keep up with the mystery plot. This can be difficult to do with so many other distractions in the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Sleepy Hollow,"Tim Burton reworks Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.Set in 1799, just before the dawn of a new century. Police constable, Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a fan of forensic science and new police methods. His views annoy his superiors and the local judge.They send him from New York to Sleepy Hollow, a small town upstate. Several prominent members of the community have had their heads chopped off.Whe Crane arrives, he is told of the legend of the Headless Horseman. Many families are interlinked but the deaths continue.Burton makes a modern Gothic horror. He combines this with a murder mystery with a hint of the supernatural. The presence of many British actors signifies that this is a nod to Hammer horror films.It is wonderful to look at on screen. The music is evocative. It does lose its way a little at the end. The chase scene with the horseman is difficult to take.The film also suffers with a lack of chemistry between Depp and Christina Ricci as the love interest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

A good nights sleep at the cinema..,"I was very disappointed with this film.. it would appear that the films distributors wanted to make as much money as possible from this film, therefore cutting a whole 9 minutes of action from the 18 rated US version and releasing it as a 15 certificate.The story could be concluded in a single line - a headless horseman has been killing people in a place called Sleepy Hollow.. and that was essentially it.  The film wandered around aimlessly trying to entice people with what will happen next, but it was all too obvious and predictable.  There were no surprises, maybe because they were cut from the English version.  The script was poor, and the actors were struggling to deliver to their true potential, partially because there wasn't enough of it to go at.As for directing, Tim Burton did a reasonable job, but I would not go as far as to say as I enjoyed this more than Batman, for example.  The special effects were reasonable and the cutting of heads was nicely done.  Although I'm sure there would have been more horror for if it were not cut itself onto the editors floor.I hope if Tim Burton reads this that he will restore the film to its full length and let it have its 18 Certificate it should have, maybe then I could enjoy it and not fall into a Sleepy Hollow when watching it.6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Tim Burton Scores Again,"Although I don't have much to say about this movie, I would recommend it.Guys might actually like this movie,(compared to most of the other reviews I have written so far =P) what with all the spears going through people and heads getting chopped off.The movie had some (in my opinion) unnecessary parts, and while it may be in the book, I would have to use the example of Crane having flashbacks of his mother, and where he got the scars on his hand, as an example of an unnecessary part.The whole bit about the symbol under Crane's bed, and what it really was about, was quite predictable.The movie kept me guessing/trying to figure out what the heck was going on, almost to the very end, and overall is a suspense/action/somewhat-horror-though not really all that scary- movie that is worth the time it takes to watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Good Reimagining,"In a rare turn of events, Sleepy Hollow is a succesful reimagining of a classic tale. If theres one to do it its Tim Burton who's style and sensibilities are just what this film needs, providing it with the perfect mood and atmosphere. Button regular, Johnny Depp, stars as Ichabod Crane who's swapped out from his original cowardly teacher to a idiosyncratic (after all its Depp) detective investigating the murders in the town.

Not for the squeamish but good supernatural suspense.,"The headless horseman galloping through the countryside lopping heads clean off their respective bodies, a late 18th century ""rationalist"" detective, a superstitious village community and Christina Ricci as well (the best person to develop from child acting).Brilliant!! This is an excellent and absorbing story.As I have not read Washington Irvings story I did not really know what to expect. It became clear very early in the movie that there was indeed a supernatural cause behind the series of deaths (i.e. there was no faking the phenomenon by an errant villager for instance). The film does not however then plunge into a mass of pointless special effects and gore (although these were present in a significant way). It does in fact manage to blend a whodunit into the supernatural stew and a very tasty stew it is too. Despite the early knowledge that the immediate cause was supernatural there remained the mystery about who raised the horseman and who pulled his strings.The film is not for the squeamish but is highly recommended to fans of supernatural suspense.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"The story is not the best, but the style and look make it a must see...","I am a fan of Tim Burton.  His new film, Sleepy Hollow, is another in a line of quirky, and eerie, worlds that this director is fond of creating.Using equally quirky and talented actors, Johnny Depp, and Christina Ricci, he creates another beautifully dark, yet rich textured landscape upon which to tell his tale.Though not adhering to the tale by Washington Irivng strictly, he uses the elements from that story to weave a more dark and sinister story of our famous ""Headless Horseman"".  Depp plays Icabod Crane, and Ricci plays the love interest, Katrina Van Tassle.I thought that Burton smartly created a very moody and very effective canvas on which to paint.  The story, or the actors aren't necessarily the stars here.  What you ""see"" on screen is the star.  No house seems to have a right angle, no sunlight seems to ever shine, in the town you feel dread, outside of town, it looks like a painting.  Rich texture and some neatly made computer graphics create quite a world.If you are a fan of Burton, see the movie, it is worth it.  If you are not, I still think it is worth a look.

A not very legendary adaptation,"I am a great fan of Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice and Mars Attacks, so I looked forward to seeing what dark, creepy bent Tim Burton could put on this American literary classic. Well, dark and creepy it certainly is, but absorbing and powerful it unfortunately is not.This film promises a lot from the beginning, but it sadly fails to convert all the elements into a cohesive whole. The plot is tangled and clumsy and hardly does justice to the elegant legend of Ichabod Crane and his headless Nemesis. In the end it is scarcely of interest who inherits what and who is trying to bop off whom.The characters, apart from the very interesting' Ichabod Crane, played with just the right amount of self-parody by Johnny Depp, are dull and sloppily drawn and the film needs a good juicy villain to spice things up a bit and balance the ensemble. Depp is an inspired piece of casting and really makes this film almost worth seeing, although he limits his facial expressions to the fingers of one hand. This is however five more than those managed by Christina Ricci, who struggles both with her character and the period setting throughout and really looks totally out of place. The other characters are unremarkable.I am sure Tim Burton could have pulled something special off here, but he has a poor script to work with, and somewhere in this production he realizes it and loses faith. Even the themes of science vs magic, city versus country, reason over emotion, are introduced but never developed properly and the whole thing just peters out about halfway through. The film felt long even though it was well under two hours.The photography and the production design save it from total disaster, though. Both these are terrific, and the effects are gruesome but appropriate. Such a pity that the story and characters do not live up to the setting. As they say, fifty percent script, thirty percent casting, and then there's the rest. Well, the rest isn't enough here.Could have been, but isn't . . .",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Top stuff...,"I must say, I was absolutely gagging to see this film. I had heard so many bad reviews for it, and with this being a Tim Burton film, I got me wondering how a fabulous director like him could have got something wrong. So I went to see it with an open mind. The first thing I must comment on, is whether you liked the film or not, I'm sure no-one could have failed to like the look of the whole thing. The film should certainly win an award for best cinematography because every single frame was beautifully composed. The atmosphere was brilliant, and it definitely had the name 'Tim Burton' written all over it. I must give top marks to Johnny Depp for the portrayal of his character. It was not always convincing, but he really threw himself into his role, and carried it off well. Not too sure about Christina Ricci, though, maybe it was because we did not see very much of her, but I didn't find her very believable. Unfortunately, to me, she is still Wednesday Addams, but I hope to catch up on her most recent films, because I know that she is a fine actress. I have to hand it to her, though, she looked stunning in 'Sleepy Hollow.' One final critism. I don't know what everybody else thought, but I didn't sense any electricity between Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. If this film was to be a romance, then I think more should have been made of their relationship.Anyway, criticisms aside, I thought that 'Sleepy Hollow' definitely sparkled with polish, and it has obviously been carefully crafted. All I can say now is that I can't wait until it comes out on video!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Burton's best-looking film,"Dark, stylish, disturbing. Tim Burton lives to make movies according to these adjectives. However, Sleepy Hollow seems to be his masterpiece. The legend surrounding the Headless Horseman is the perfect tale for Burton's oddball, surreal direction. As with all his films, the setting is an indispensable character. Whether it's the Gothic underworld of Gotham City or the pastel-colored, surbubia found in Edward Scissorhands; Burton creates a world that lingers in the mind of viewers long after the film is over.Longtime Burton collaborator Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci shine as Constable Ichabod Crane and Katrina Van Tessel, even while delivering dated, kitschy lines. However, Depp's perfomance is an ingenious blend of childishness and stoicism, of comedy and terror that shines and fits Burton's puerile nightmare perfectly. In a movie that stretches from Batman's cartoon-like violence to scenes of decapitation, animal mutilation and medieval torture, by far Burton's darkest, there is still a sense of mystical fantasy of childlike wonder which keeps even the most horrific scenes from becoming too offensive.The only negative criticism I have to offer about this movie is some of the cornball dialogue uttered by the main characters, and the contrived story that seems to fall together all too quickly at the end. It's as though Burton tries his hand at a Hercule Poirot mystery without letting the audience in on it. Thus, the conclusion seems to come and go without stopping to be understood.However, if nothing else, the profound production design is more than worth the price of admission and is guaranteed to hold you prisoner under its hypnotic spell. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
will restore your faith in horror movies,"I am NOT a big fan of scary movies.  Well, I'm not a big fan of anything scary.  My best friend, however, is not scared of any movies or haunted houses.

She had tried to get me to watch Carrie a while back and, of course, I chickened out.  Now, the only scary movies I'd seen before Sleepy Hollow were Scream 2 and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.  So believe me I was a bit skeptical when I walked into the theater Thursday night.  But whatever small amounts of enthusiasm for horror flicks I had obtained through haunted houses and cheap horror flicks were greatly increased when I saw Sleepy Hollow.

A highly unusual film by Tim Burton,"Sleepy Hollow is a great example of an entertaining film which takes us all back into past times where it was absolutely impossible to provide a rational explanation regarding certain obscure,occult events. This film is set in a time when murders were a common event and it was practically impossible to get hold of the criminal.It must be stated that it is a pure coincidence that this Tim Burton film shares a lot of stylistic similarities with a famous yet not so well known French film ""Un Roi Sans Divertissement"" directed by François Leterrier.It is difficult to say which of the two films is better but due to the advent of huge media publicity,it can rightly be assumed that Tim Burton's film made in 1999 appealed to more people then that of François Leterrier's film made in 1963.Sleepy Hollow would turn out to be an important film for all the admirers of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton as it will give them a good idea of how both of them prepared for their future individual endeavors ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"".A must for all the lovers of Jean Giono and Washington Irving",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Gothic Horror at it's best!,"Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, what a great team!, never yet failed to please, this is one of my favourite films of all time, Johnny Depp is a great anti-hero, not the usual run of the mill Hollywood bore!, I laughed out loud in the cinema when the headless horseman beheaded the running man who kept on running even after he was beheaded!, there is at least one moment in he film that they cut out of the video, the bit near the start where the bloke has a metal plate covering his heart, I won't say anymore so as not to spoil it, I would definitely recommend seeing it at the cinema as opposed to the video, the sound and big screen was very effective! I just cant wait for Tim and Johnny's next huge collaboration!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Campy fun, dude","Not the best storytelling, and at times even cheesy, but you have to think a talent as smart as Burton meant it that way. What the movie lacks in story is countered well with Burton's flair with visuals. The town of Sleepy Hollow is breathtakingly realized, as well as the countless, grisly beheadings. Incidentally, stunt man Ray Park plays the year's two best villains: Darth Maul of The Phantom Menace, and, when it's not Christopher Walken, the Headless Horseman.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"A Decent Effort, More Visual Fun than anything else","Wonderfully atmospheric, and with some great work from Burton and Depp as always, Sleepy Hollow is far from perfect, and can be dull at times, but for the most part, it proves to be as enjoyable as you would expect it to be. I enjoyed the film for what it was, but I couldn't help but feel like it could have been a lot better- especially with the promise and charm it seems to deliver at the beginning of the film. The beginning is not only charming, but quite funny at times, and it truly brings you into this collective grim world that all the characters on screen share. About halfway through, however, the film starts to loose its steam, and you begin to loose focus on why you cared about the events you are watching in the first place. It can be entertaining, but it has more than its fair share of dull moments. The cinematography is excellent and deeply gothic, but provides little more than something to look at, as the events on screen don't seem to have any great significance. Johnny Depp is fantastic in his role, and he truly brings his all as always, although the writing of his character can seem a bit repetitive at times. Christina Ricci also provides for a rather good performance, as well as a decent supporting cast, but no one besides the two truly stick out. In the end, Sleepy Hollow has its fair share of issues, but it is often a beautiful gothic work from Burton, and though it isn't always entertaining, you do always have something to keep your eye on. It isn't as good as its potential leads to believe, but through Burton's vision and Depp's performance as the lead, you are bound to have a good time more than not.

The Scariest Movie I Have Ever Seen,"I caught a sneak preview of this movie last night. Tim Burton has made a masterpiece. I have never been one to be scared by a movie, but this movie had me shaking in my seat. The Headless Horseman is a more terrifying villain than Darth Vader, Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lecter rolled into one. The entire movie is beautiful and so is Christina Ricci. This is Depp's best work since Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas. And this is definatley Tim Burton's most memorable film.

"Interesting mix of horror, mystery and comedy","""Sleepy Hollow"" is another score for Tim Burton.  The eerie, surreal style of uniquely Burton.  The film has a good storybook quality to it.  Nobody should take the film too seriously, as it isn't meant to be a realistic period piece.  As Burton mentions in the commentary, ""I never thought one day I'd be directing a movie where people would be dressed up like George Washington.""  The blood looks like red paint and the sets are obviously stylized.  Simply look at it as a dark fantasy, and you should have a good time.  The performances are great all-around.  Johnny Depp never disappoints, as he brings much dimension to the character of Ichabod Crane. The film has a good sense of humor, and Depp uses the humor to his advantage.  Character roles like this are tailor-made for Depp.  The creepy Danny Elfman score nicely sets the tone.  And I enjoyed the final plot twist.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Burton tried too hard,"Positives: Visually stunning- beautiful scenery and photograpy; unbelievable special effects; well played- for the melodramatic way it was presented; humorous moments along with the scary; and well...it's Johnny Depp!! Negatives: Actually, every not so great moment in the film can be wrapped in the shroud of ""trying too hard"". As a huge fan of suspense, but not gore, I think Burton went way too far trying to shock with gallons of blood instead of brain. Other than the name ""Ichabod Crane"", there is very little in the movie which resembles the original-and far scarier-Washington Irving story. It seemed that the goal of the show was to make the audience go, ""EEWWW!"", instead of hold its breath in fright. I realize some people are into gore...if that is the case then this is one you shouldn't miss. As for me, as a Depp fan- one viewing all the way through was enough. But I do pop in the DVD occasionally and skip through the spewing and squishing to Johnny's clever, sensitive, melodramatic Ichabod. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Creepy Hollow,The first time I saw it some years ago on DVD I thought oh this one I have to see again but after I have seen it again it was boring. I mean it's not a story where I can say this is one of those I will keep in my collection cause here you see and that's it. It's definitely not a must see but if you like horror visual effects this is for you. There were many bloody and violent scenes with rolling heads. I have to admit that the setting place was wonderfully built and created so the needed mysterious atmosphere. The special effects were real good especially the horse scenes with the rider and the soundtrack from Danny Elfmann was as usual great. The running time of the movie is just okay. I think this legend is more interesting to read in the book than to be translated in a creepy horror show. That's perhaps why there was no place for suspense and thrilling moments and this should be for me the most important elements for a big successful ride. For these reasons it deserves not more than 4/10. Too overrated on IMDb.,4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Good movie with a great score,"Saw Sleepy Hollow at a press screening last night at Paramount.  In light of the trailer (which I thought was ho-hum), my impression that Burton films generally are overacted and border on cartoonish or comic book-ish, and (especially) the cheesy ""heads will roll"" tagline, I was expecting a pretty mediocre show.  In the end, though, I thought it was good.  There is a little bit of silliness (e.g., head spinning around after being cut off) and one or two too-cartoonish effects (to mention would be to spoil), but overall I think the movie stays away from such things -- which for me is a good thing.  Generally, I think it was well acted too.  My rave for this movie, though, is the Danny Elfman score, which is awesome.  The sound effects were also very good and, as always, Burton does an incredible job of providing a dark and dreary backdrop to a story.  I'm not too sure about some of the character development (or lack thereof), particularly with regard to the characters played by Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson, but in the end I didn't really mind.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A successful Hollywood remake,"A very daring hollywood remake on one of the first American fairy tales. The cinematography of Sleepy Hollow, captivates the audience, and portrays just the right mood for this horror, thriller, comedy. Kudos to Johnny's over the top performance of the forensics scientist Ichabod even though the acting may falter in some scenes (esp. the fainting). An all-star cast from both Europe and America, very talented.  This seems like Tim Burton's ode to the classic Black Sunday by Mario Bava on terms of mood and setting. Some jumpy scenes and an awesome headless horseman makes this movie a winner.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Beautiful film,"This is one of the most amazingly beautiful films I have ever seen. The costumes, the cinematography, the production design, the two leads (Depp and Ricci) et cetera. It is worth it to watch this film just to experience the dark beauty of it. However, the film is quite good in its own right. It's a nice mix of horror and beheadings and a little comedy as well. Depp is brilliant as Ichabod Crane -- he does a lot of swooning while trying to remain calm. But hey, if a headless Christopher Walken on a black horse was coming after you set to separate your head from your body with a long sword, wouldn't you swoon at least once as well? :-) ""Sleepy Hollow"" definitely got that dark Tim Burton-feel over it, while it is not as strange as some of his other films, and there's some comic relief as well and thank god for that because otherwise all those beheadings would have been insufferable.

Not Horror but a Gothic Fairy Tale,"Perhaps you have to be a Burton fan to like this stuff. The scenery, the characters, the humor; it is all Burton.I loved this one. The atmosphere that it is breathing, the lack of color, the darkness and the surrounding. It all contributes to the big picture. A dark mysterious tale of an insecure policeman and the tale of a legendary ghost: The Headless Horseman.Johnny Depp plays his part superbly. He is Ichabod Crane, the sometimes clumsy scientific N.Y. policeman. I even thought Ricci was terrific. By holding back her emotions and even act a little ""cold"" you could understand why Crane in the end has his doubts about her. But the greatest pleasure I took out of the part of the Horseman himself. Christopher Walken (the man who once said:'There is no such thing as a small role, only small actors') proofs that with just a few movie-minutes you can steel an entire picture. He is one scary horseman!I read that some people didn't like the combination of humor, horror and what more. I think it makes it a better picture. Other people felt this wasn't a good horror movie. Well they are right because it is not. I like to think of it as a gothic fairy tale. If you want to compare it to horror, I think it will remind people to the seventies hammer horror. This, for example, also was a studio film.Well I didn't read the story of the legend of Sleepy Hollow, but I can imagine that, for his own convenience, Burton did not stick to the original. And for this picture it may have been better so. I mean if Tim Burton has an idea about something you should let him go his own way and something beautiful will come out of it, just like this one.The Art Direction on this picture was great and therefore deserved the Oscar (Although I still think that during the last couple of years the Academy Award is the less serious film-award of them all).This was the third Burton/Depp movie, Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands were the other two, but I wouldn't mind if they made a fourth, fifth or even sixth movie together. If the outcome would be as great as this one (or the other two)it would certainly be a reason to visit the cinema again. Therefore this one got the highest score from me.

A Visually Stunning Tale with Tim Burton's Signature Quirk,"Tim Burton's 1999 adaptation of ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a film that, while not reaching the heights of some of his other works, delivers a unique blend of gothic horror, dark comedy, and visual flair. It earns a solid 7 out of 10 stars.Based loosely on Washington Irving's classic tale, ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"" Burton and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker take significant liberties with the original story. They craft a darker, more violent, and mysterious narrative that follows Ichabod Crane, transformed from a schoolteacher into a constable with modern investigative techniques. Ichabod arrives in Sleepy Hollow to solve a series of macabre decapitations.While the story occasionally feels like it's trying to juggle too many elements-mystery, romance, horror, and historical drama-it mostly holds together thanks to Burton's unique storytelling.Johnny Depp stars as Ichabod Crane, bringing his characteristic oddball charm to the role. His performance is engaging, though it occasionally veers into over-the-top territory. Christina Ricci as Katrina Van Tassel provides a strong counterpoint with her blend of innocence and determination. The supporting cast, including Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, and Christopher Walken as the menacing Headless Horseman, all contribute to the town's eerie atmosphere.But where ""Sleepy Hollow"" truly shines is in its visuals. Burton's world is a visual feast of fog-laden forests, cobbled streets, and gothic architecture, all rendered with a color palette that feels like it's been pulled from an old, dark fairy tale. The film's production design, costumes, and cinematography are masterclasses in creating a mood that's both beautiful and bleak.""Sleepy Hollow,"" a Tim Burton masterpiece, captivates with its atmospheric horror, rather than relying solely on jump scares. The Headless Horseman, a terrifying presence, is portrayed with a stylized, almost balletic flair, enhancing the film's macabre charm without resorting to gratuitous gore.However, the film's narrative consistency suffers. Some character motivations feel underdeveloped, and the abrupt shift towards supernatural elements towards the end may disappoint those seeking a more grounded mystery. While Burton's dark humor is a signature element, it might not resonate with everyone, occasionally clashing with the film's darker tones.In conclusion, ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a cinematic experience best appreciated for its visual storytelling and atmospheric horror. While it showcases Burton's visual inventiveness, it falls short in terms of narrative consistency. For fans of Burton's style or those who enjoy gothic tales with a touch of the bizarre, ""Sleepy Hollow"" is undoubtedly worth watching, offering a memorable and enchanting cinematic journey.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
One of the best films of 1999,"Sleepy Hollow combines having fun and seeing a intelligent film. After all, it's a Tim Burton film. It is really a beautiful film(every image looks like a painting). Also, It is wonderfully acted(Johnny Depp is excellent). The story, although simple, is still very well written. I think that this movie almost has it all. The only problem might be in the ending. It is not bad, but you want to know more. This is a feeling that I get after seeing almost every Tim Burton film. Maybe it's because I love them sssooo much. If you have read my Batman reviews, you may have a feeling of déjà-vu in the following lines. This director made the most stylish movies of this decade.

Burton's great comeback,"Tim Burton is not my favorite director, but is certainly one of I most admire. His dark style, present in a great part of his films, is just amazing and magical. Talking about magic, he is able to pass it to the audience in each of his films. In ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"", he adapted very well the story of the man of shadows in Gotham City, what didn't happen in the two Joel Schumacher films. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is one of the most magical and sweet films of the '90s. In ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", Burton did an inventive and weird animated movie. In ""Ed Wood"", maybe his best film to date, he could do a biographical story at the same time controversial and hilarious. And ""Mars Attacks""... Well... It's his weakest film, but still that rather enjoyable. To repair this small mistake, he wonderfully adapted an old American tale- ""Sleepy Hollow""- and did his great comeback.""Sleepy Hollow"" tells the story of Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a New York detective who believes only in what he sees. He goes to a small village in order to investigate some strange decapitation murders. The inhabitants claim that they were commited by a weird creature who is part of the folk of the place- the 'headless horseman'. Crane, of course, doesn't believe in anything at first, but a childhood trauma and a romance can help him with his mission. I won't tell more things about the plot, because I don't want to spoil your surprises, and so that the film gets more enjoyable and intriguing to watch.It is difficult to say if ""Sleepy Hollow"" is Tim Burton's best. It doesn't have the sweetness of ""Edward Scissorhands"", or the ingenuity of ""Ed Wood"", but it is a very special film. It is original, dark, with a strange black humor and sometimes scary. If I had to define the genre of this movie, it would be fantasy. More than comedy, horror, mystery. Because, in the deep, it is beautiful- and don't forget there is a romance!The acting is fabulous, specially Depp and Christina Ricci- one of the greatest promises of Hollywood for the future. Its dark, wonderful cinematography is definetely Oscar-worthy, and so are the costumes, the art direction, the special effects and the make-up effects.""Sleepy Hollow"" can be not of the 10 year's best, but it is one of the most enjoyable, exciting and entertaining films of last year.So prepare for some scares, much fun and a great twist in the end.

Burton was made for Sleepy Hollow.,"Tim Burton's entire career has been based on films that provide the paradox of a hauntingly magical style. I believe that Sleepy Hollow can be described as the perfect Tim Burton picture in the sense that it captures everything that comes to mind when you think of the man. The Gothic style, haunting ambiance, bizarre and wickedly charismatic humor and a sense that you're living in a dark fairy tale for a few hours. It stays morbidly entertaining all the way throughout and never fails at keeping you on the edge of your seat. Burton crafts another phenomenal work that utterly defines his unique style.Everyone knows the story of the Headless Horseman from their childhood, but this takes a much darker and necessary tone to the tale than seen before. The technical aspects of the feature certainly help to achieve this and create wonders for the eye to behold. The sets are vast and glorious, creating that perfectly Gothic ambiance and almost Wicker Man-esquire eeriness. In fact the entire film has a lot of similarities with The Wicker Man from the supernatural ideals to the suspense of knowing that something is going on that is much bigger than what we believe. The cinematography, costumes and visuals all add to create a poetically dreary experience that is sure to please in every element.Burton also shows his strong ability in the casting category. The choice of Depp for the leading role of Ichabod Crane (a character who was portrayed as brutally unattractive in the story) is an odd one at first glance, but the decision to show his flaws through personality made Depp the perfect man to nail this one. I've always thought that the contrast between Ichabod and the Horseman is an interesting one; Crane is a man who lives inside his head and seems bizarre to society, Horseman is a man with no head and strikes fear into society, and Depp certainly captures the quirky eccentricities and creates one of my favorite performances of his. Burton also showed his sense of humor through the casting, by picking out wildly charismatic men to play the leaders of the community (Michael Gambon and Richard Griffiths being the two best examples). Miranda Richardson also delivers a fantastic performance and almost steals the show. All in all, a wickedly entertaining picture that is sure to delight through and through.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Just be glad you're not a chicken,"That was the best movie I've seen in a long time.  I loved it.

It was so good because it made you want to read it all the time until the end and I finished the book in 3 days. (not constantly reading of course, I'm not that slow of a reader)  It described the gory details so vividly that I thought the movie was going to be really gross and disgusting with blood.  And then I found out it was.  Well, not really.  My imagination made the book good. But I absolutely fell in love with the movie.  I think everyone loved Johnny Depp's portrayal of Icabod Crane.  I know I did. (tee hee)  His acting was so good because of his facial expressions and the fact that Icabod is so timid and meek that he faints every time something graphic happens.

Ichabod Crane vs. the Headless Horseman,"""Ichabod Crane"" (Johnny Depp) is a police constable from New York City who is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the murder of three people. Although he isn't superstitious and doesn't believe in ghosts or demons, he is surprised to find that all of the residents in Sleepy Hollow attribute the slayings to a ""headless horseman"" who appears at night and systematically selects his victims without feeling or remorse. Needless to say, being a man of science Ichabod pays little heed to their warnings and seeks out the killer with only a teenage boy named ""Young Masbath"" to help him out. Unfortunately, he is totally unprepared for what he finds. Now, rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie wasn't too bad overall. I liked the acting of Johnny Depp and I thought the director (Tim Burton) did an excellent job capturing the spooky autumn night effect so essential for this particular story. On the other hand, I wasn't especially impressed with the acting of Christina Ricci (as ""Katrina Van Tassel"") or the use of action in lieu of suspense and horror.

The Best Film of the Year,"Sleepy Hollow proves once again that Tim Burton is one the greatest directors alive today. This should be considered a true masterpiece not only for him but for the history of film. If he doesn't get any recognition for this movie i will be really shocked.Sleepy Hollow is a more gorier re-telling of the story of the Headless Horsemen. Icabod Crane(Johnny Deph) is sent to the town of Sleppy Hollow to find a killer who severes his victims heads and takes them. At first icabod doesn't believe in the horse-man until he sees him for hisself. He also meets a young girl named Katrina(Christina Ricci) who he becomes very attracted to. A lot of things follow and this becomes one of the best movies i have seen in a long while.The acting is really superb in this film. Johnny Deph is my favorite actor as of now. He is the most versatile actor in recent memory and he is always willing to take chances. he should really get something for this film because he trully brings icabod to life. Christina Ricci is also good as the innocent Katrina. She is one of the best younger actresses in hollywood and this is one of her best performances.Tim Burton again, i bow in your prescence. He is a true visonary and fora lack of a better word a cinematic genius.The Music is also superb.

"""Sleepy Hollow"" is by far one of Tim Burton's greatest films.","""Heads Will Roll!!"" was the tagline for the Tim Burton take on the ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" which tells the tale of a lowly school teacher who must face his greatest fear and become a man. The Washington Irving classic will always be remembered as the ""headless horseman"" tale with flaming pumpkins and an idiot hero. In the 1999 adaptation the hero, Icabod Crane is now a bumbling New York Detective who seems to know more about forensics then his fellow man of that time. As a joke the New York police department sends him to ""Sleepy Hollow"" to uncover the ""decapitating murderer"". What Crane finds shocks and changes our hero slowly into a man. ""Sleepy Hollow"" is by far one of Tim Burton's greatest films. Ever since he captivated the world by bringing the ""real"" Batman to the big screen, ten years ago, he has always been flirting with making a great gothic horror film. Every film he has touched has been enchanted with gothic charisma. From ""Edward Scissorhands"" to ""Mars Attacks"" they have all been laced in his immersion of horror and fairytale. In ""Sleepy Hollow"" he finds his true calling as he delivers us into his gothic mystique. As he did in the first two Batman films, the camera stands back and then swoops into the great city of New York. Showing the dark and moody world he is trying to capture. As this panoramic tour continues the audience is pulled harder and harder in. This is Tim Burton at his best.The film then drops into Icabod's world where he seems to be the outsider who doesn't quite fit in. The film focuses upon the face of Johnny Depp who is quite pale and wide eyed. In two other Tim Burton films Johnny Depp has opened us to the world of Burton much like Richard Dreyfuss did in early Steven Spielberg films. Depp's portrayal of bumbling Icabod is remnant of ""Edward Scissorhands"" but even more human. An outsider trying to see past the town's folktale and uncover a real murder. I imagined Icabod to be sort of what happened if Sherlock Holmes stumbled in on Dracula himself. I think even a great detective like Holmes would be bumbling on a case like that.As Icabod explores the town to Sleepy Hollow we are treasured by the presence of other Tim Burton vets like Michael Gough, Jeffery Jones, Christopher Walken and Martin Landau. Icabod upon his arrival falls in love with the damsel Katrina Van Tassel played by Christina Ricci who seems to have something in common with Icabod's past. As we uncover the mysterious damsel Burton seems to let his film talk about what exactly is witchcraft and why skeptics don't understand it. This tugs at Icabod's dreams and his heart strings. Ricci's Katrina is not exactly a damsel in distress but a delightful addition to her growing repertoire of strong women roles. She has come along way from being Wednesday Addams. When the film finally hits it stride with the first encounter with the horseman we are already engulfed in the dark magic of Sleepy Hollow and the bewilderment of Icabod. Sleepy Hollow will be remembered as one of Tim Burton's masterpieces. (5 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Tim Burton's darkest film,"If I ever had to choose what film would be one of Tim Burton's darkest, I'd have to say ""Sleepy Hollow."" It's beautifully made in his style...as the way he would direct it, and it's also the goriest, but it still manages to have some appropriately silly humor along with it. The setting is perfect as a gloomy, foggy kind of town in 1799. The whole movie reminds me of ""From Hell"" which also has Johnny Depp in it only this isn't as freaky. They both are but you can't compare the two except for the violence and the settings because they aren't very different.Without a doubt, it is still up there as one of my favorite Tim Burton movies. I give it 9 and a half out of 10 stars for the darkness and the acting and whatever else is beautiful about this kind of film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A thriller with a Great Romance,"I saw this spectacular movie just two days ago, and it has just ""stuck"" with me ever since.  It has done this not because of the great acting or the awesome visual effects, but because of the romance. With Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci they will make any movie good. And when they are romantically involved it just makes me feel as if I were in the movie with them.

Gothic Splendor,"Event movies are hyped and promoted regularly, and, when the film is finally released it often proves to be a big disapointment.  Sleepy Hollow is not such a case.The film is going to be enjoyed greater by those who are Burton fans, like myself, but there is plenty here for even the layman to enjoy.Sleepy Hollow is aboslutely gorgeous, and should definately win an Oscar for cinematography.  The setting is dark and wonderfully Gothic, with that wonderful Burton skewed view we've come to know and love. The fighting scenes are exciting and well done.  The Headless Horsemen is an imposing figure, and Burton continously adds new ways for the ghost to claim his victims.Danny Elfman again provides a remarkable score that is appropriately brooding and moody.  Hardly the bombastic fair of Batman or etheral complacence of Edward Scissorhands, though moments of the score do recall those.The real draw to the film is Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ichabod Crane. Crane is refreshingly wimpy and not the gung-ho type so common to today's genre films.  Crane is funny and touching and will instantly become an audience favorite.  Christina Ricci is also good in the film, and some of the best moments  are she and Depp's romantic scenes which are peppered with some wonderfully (intentionally) over the top dialogue.To paraphrase Ichabod, I believe there is a bit of witch in this film, for it has bewitched me. ***1/2",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Burton's Best--Stunning!,"When you see Sleepy Hollow, it's quite apparent that this is a Tim Burton film. It is visually stunning, with each detail in the frame carefully seen to. While the plot differs dramatically with Irving's original story, I personally like this version better. While Christina Ricci brings a fresh, cool take on Katrina Van Tassel, her performance can be slightly flat at times. However, I don't feel this detracts from the film at all. The true jewel in this movie is Johnny Depp. His fine performance as the slightly cowardly-yet-intelligent Ichabod Crane drives the film, bringing a complexity and real-worldness to the character. Ichabod is not your typical action hero facing down a bloodthirsty ghost--what other movie hero do you know that responds to danger by pulling the nearest child in front of him for protection, or jumps onto a chair at the mere sight of a spider? Depp pulls this off marvelously, and his facial expressions masterfully convey terror, queasiness, embarrassment, and confusion throughout the film. Mr. Depp should be proud of his performance. Sleepy Hollow is a film I highly recommend; Depp makes up for weaknesses in Ricci's acting and the plot line, as well as the weaknesses in the character of Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson). In short, see this film--Burton, Depp, and the film's composer, Danny Elfman, deserve high praise for their work on it. I highly recommend the soundtrack as well--it is Elfman's best!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
For the 90s audience,"Washington Irving's story could have been a perfect vehicle for Burton's talents. However, Irving's atmospheric classic was updated into a serial killer movie which is very 90s-like: loud, over-the-top and weak on characterization and plot. At first, it looks gorgeous but as the story gets increasingly thin and predictable, the movie's gorgeous look can't save it. By the end the movie reminds something like The Terminator rather than a gothic story as it should be.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
One of the most atmospheric movies of all times,"I have seen this movie 11 years ago in the cinema. I loved it back then, and became a huge Tim Burton fan. I wasn't sure if I'd still like it 10 years later - but I do. It's one of the most atmospheric movies of all time. While the story can't be taken serious, it is very entertaining and keeps you interested. Actors are amazing, everyone fit perfectly in their role. The set was beautiful. For the eye, there hasn't been the slightest flaw. (But some Computer - effects that can't hold up to todays standards.)I can't see any real flaw in this movie.

"An Original Piece, Despite the Title","I am a die hard fan of Washington Irving's story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. This is based on that story but just barely. I would call it an original story with the same names and some of the same back stories. If you want to see an exact adaptation of the story, you will be sadly disappointed but if you're looking for a great horror film from Tim Burton, there is no way you will have any problem with this. I would say it's one of his best films.Ichabod Crane(Johnny Depp), an investigator sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow where a number of bizarre deaths involving decapitation have taken place, comes across Katrina Van Tassel(Christina Ricci), Baltus Van Tassel(Michael Gambon) and The Headless Horseman(Christopher Walken). As you can see, the cast is awesome and there are many more awesome stars other than the ones I have mentioned. The story is very creepy and intense the entire way through. There are also some great special effects and the gore is absolutely spot on. Tim Burton has become one of my all time favorite directors and this is definitely one of the movies that put him in that spot for me. His direction is amazing.As I said earlier, you're going to hate this film if you want it to follow the original story. However, it is a great movie on its own and that's exactly the way it should be watched. The Horseman comes, and tonight, he comes for you!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Great Film!,"I just watched Sleepy Hollow last night at a preview screening and I have to say that I was not disappointed! I have always been impressed with Tim Burton's work, and with this film he has lived up to expectations once again. Visually, it was typical Tim Burton, dark and mysterious with a fantasy/fairy tale feel, carried out through the spectacular sets, dark costumes and deathly make-up. Johnny Depp was brilliant as the straight-laced, cowardly Ichabod Crane, prone to fainting spells. Also to be applauded were the performances by Christina Ricci, Christopher Walken, and Miranda Richardson. I also particularly enjoyed the performance by Ichabod's young sidekick, who's name, unfortunately, escapes me.  :(Story wise, the film can get a little campy with some rather mechanical lines, but I was personally willing to forgive them in exchange for some of Burton's typically dark humor, causing many audience members, including myself, to both laugh and groan at the same time. One word of caution though, for those who are planning to watch this movie with children. Believe the tagline to the movie, ""Heads Will Roll,"" because it's true. Heads are rolling everywhere in this movie, blood is splashing, and it can get rather gory. When I think Tim Burton, I think of ""Nightmare before Christmas"" and ""Beetlejuice"", filled with dark humor, but nothing that will ""scar"" kids. Not so with this movie. Beware the faint of heart! The beheadings (among other several other scenes) can look quite real in action and might be disturbing to young viewers, so make sure whomever you bring to watch this movie will be able to handle it.But if you don't mind the blood and gore, and you have a sense of humor and a taste for the fantastic, be sure to put this movie at the top of your list!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
I so wanted to like this movie,"Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, in a modern remake or a classic tale. But somehow, this movie just fails at all levels. I never cared about one thing that happened to any of the characters. I didn't feel sucked into the setting, or any rising tension.They used obvious cardboard cutout backgrounds, perhaps to add a certain theatrical charm to the film...but this seemed like a cardboard cutout movie. Just a bunch of scenes strung together, lacking in all intagibles.I liked the Actors, and the story of Sleepy Hallow, but this movie was a flat liner as far as I'm concerned.

This is easily the most sensuously beautiful movie I have seen in a very long time. Certainly the Tree of the Dead is a haunting image, although the Horseman himself becomes less scary as the movie progresses simply because we see so much of him that he becomes more mundane. The ""surprise"" ending is tipped by an obvious bit of casting, but overall this movie is still a vibrant experience, and I can't wait to see those lush images again.

Wonderful rendition of an Old Story,"I am not a fan or ""horror"" movies and seeing this movie was a relief to me because it isn't one. It is much more. This is a brilliantly done retelling of an old tale, masterfully told and beautifully presented.The original Washington Irving story is still there but with some new twists. For example, Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp, was a schoolmaster in the original and he's a detective here, but it works.Christopher Walken is appropriately menacing as the Hessian Cavalryman who becomes the horseman and Richardson is tinged with just enough evil to be interesting. Christina Ricci is fetching and mysterious as a young lady interested in Crane. Her portrayal is as outstanding as she is beautiful. The remainder of the characters are excellently cast. The casts performances are tight and true to the story throughout. Casper Van Dien as Brom Van Brunt is surprisingly good as well. Van Dien has a fight scene with the horseman and Crane (Depp) that is a striking and outstanding example of action and how it should be executed for maximum effect. I have to say here that I went into the theater expecting to be disappointed with the special effects after seeing the trailers. I was wrong. This film came alive in this telling and the effects were flawless.My favorite aspect of the film, however, was the sets, lighting and the overall mood Burton and Emmanuel Lubezki, as cinematographer, accomplished here - it really mesmerized me. This is done as a brilliant film noir-esque piece.Even the gore was in context.This is a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Why?  Simply. Johnny Depp is very very funny... where did he get THAT accent?  Didn't realise he had such good comic timing!

A stunning masterpiece to an American classic!,"One of the most influential films of all time to me is Tim Burton's stylish, stunning masterpiece ""Sleepy Hollow"", a truly deserving film to an American classic tale. Tim Burton uses such amazing touches of dark lore and gothic to create a film so wrapped up in storyline and ideas, it will bring you back for a seconed time...and a third time, maybe, even a forth time (For me it made me buy the video and then later the DVD as well). I was so influenced by the film that I took a vacation to the real Sleepy Hollow, New York during the autumn season. But anyway back to the film. This film, based upon the old Washington Irving tale is done up to a 21st century realism, complete with a stylish story so puzzling yet so astonishing, I still cannot completely understand (Don't get me wrong, the films plot has many surfaces, you'll understand the first layer naturally but look closer a few more times and more will be revealed, *that's a true technique to a classic). Having worked with Tim Burton before with ""Ed Wood"", Johnny Depp is reunited again with Burton to play the role of Icabod Crane, not a simple school-teacher like in the ol' folk tale, but now a New York City investegator sent to the county of Sleepy Hollow in order to investigate the mysterious murders of a supposed ""Headless Horsemen"" (The horsemen without his head was played by Ray Park (Known by millions as Darth Maul of Star Wars: Episode I). Christina Ricci plays the mysterious Katrina Van Tassel, who plays mixed emotions with magic and love to Icabod's head. The supporting cast goes on and on, and I will say that Burton is a master at casting people. I see no one at all as talented as Depp to play Icabod. Christina? Well...she could possibly replaced, but she knows what she's doing since she has a background for dark films (""Casper"" and ""The Adams' Family"" are both in relation to horror even though their family related films). I tried to sum it as best as I could, but basiclly, I wrote this review in 2003, and to this day have not seen a film that matches it in style (The closet film to match it is 2001's ""From Hell"" starring...Johnny Depp!). So, simple reviews: Burton's best, Depp's best, Ricii's Better, A True American Classic, An Essential for any film fan. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a big favor and run (Don't walk) to your local video store to see it!Fun facts: -Ray Park plays the horsemen, but people know him better as Darth Maul (SW:Ep. 1) -The film was shot oddly, not in Sleepy Hollow, but in England. -The town was built from the ground up. -The Western Woods was completely built on a sound stage. -Martin Landau (Who played Bela Lugosi in ""Ed Wood"") makes a brief biref appearence then sadly dies (Try and guess how). -Not that it matters but Depp played a similar character to Icabod in 2001's ""From Hell"" which was about the Jack the Ripper story in which he played the investegator of the crimes (His character was like Icabod in 100 years from Sleepy Hollow (Sleepy Hollow takes place in 1799, From Hell is like 1910's, or maybe 1890's...I forget) and also heavily into drugs. *It's like the twisted evil side of Icabod)",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A Masterpeice in my Mind,"I have seen the Jeff Goldblum/Meg Tilly version of the Sleepy Hollow story and it looks like a high school play compared to this one.Burton's direction and style convinces me that I've been trapped in the story itself.The imagery,the sets,the style and the costuming all convinces me that I were almost thrust back into time.Although,this movie does remind me of Allison Hayes in ""The Undead"" for the way Ricci's and Lisa Marie's breasts look as if they are about to explode from their bodices.Played against Irving's original story,but then even the Goldblum movie took its own liberties,this movie is a murder mystery wrapped in a ghost movie and a horror movie wrapped in an action film.The stagecoach flight-and-fight had me on the edge of my seat.I don't get the critics bashing Ricci for her accent in this movie; she does play with a limited range but who wants to nit-pick in a movie of this size,scope and magnitude.I give it ten stars!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

wonderfully Burton,"Sleepy Hollow is a town in the late 1800's, at the turn of the century. Ichabod Crane is sent from New York to investigate a series of murders that have happen. All the murders are connected to the myth of the headless horseman, who cuts off all the victims heads.Once Ichabod arrives at Sleepy Hollow, you know there is more happening under the surface than just headless murderer. With red herrings thrown over the place, the mystery of the headless horseman and his murders becomes quite thick and entangled.If you are very accustom to Tim Burton films than you know what to expect. Like all of Burton's films, this is just visually stunning. The seedy greys create such a bleak and miserable atmosphere to great extent, giving the town and woods a very claustrophobic feeling. Burton's direction is flawless as usual, he is a master of his craft.Johnny Depp has created a great partnership with Burton, always giving a great performance. Depp handles the flaky yet over eager Crane with great fun. Ricci is perfect as the love interest, never overacting in places of danger. Gambon, Jones, Griffiths, McDiarmid, Gough all do well as the town elders.This is one movie where i didn't solve the ending. From the great script and plotting, this gives you clues, but never spoils the surprise. Which a find a welcome surprise. Most others you can figure it out before the end.

A headless horseman brings mystery and gore.,"Did Washington Irving intend for this treatment of his classic story? Maybe in his nightmares! This is an ultra-violent telling of the tale about a headless horseman who rides through the countryside, chopping people's heads off at will. You get involved with the mystery that Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp)tries to unravel. At times you will be on the edge of your seat. Squirming is allowed and plenty of chances to do so. And once in a while you fight off a snicker or two. Tim Burton does his job so well. Special effects seemed real. This is probably not for small children.

"""One heck of a real scary film""","Being from New York myself, I found ""Sleepy Hollow"" a real horrifying film. The writers' idea of making ""Ichabod Crane"" as a scientific policeman instead of a wimpy schoolteacher was brilliant. Johnny Depp was sensational as Crane. Christina Ricci has come far since her days as Wednesday Addams. Here she is, at 19, playing a good romantic role as Katrina Van Tassel, leading the constable on a roller coaster ride of ""she loves me, she loves me not"". Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson are magnificent as Lord and Lady Van Tassel. Jeffrey Jones is as menacing as ever. Ian McDiarmid (Senator Palpatine of ""Star Wars: Episode 1"") delivers a fine role as the town doctor. Casper Van Dien comes across again as a romantic figure in the form of the town smithy (unfortunately, he shoes no horses). Young Marc Pickering is a talented youngster and will probably prove himself to be a fine actor in the future. An unbilled but recognizable Martin Landau gives a great, but all too short and silent, portrayal of Peter Van Garrett, one of the Hessian's first victims. ""X-Men""s Ray Park delivers one heck of a performance as the Hessian (sans head) as does Christopher Walken (with bright blue eyes and saber-teeth), even though he does little more than growl and snarl. It was also a change of pace seeing Christopher Lee playing someone other than Dracula.

Burton's best to date!,"I've seen several Tim Burton films, but this one is by far my favorite. It's a good old ghost story with ample doses of comedy and thrills -- and a wonderful performance by Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane who comes to Sleepy Hollow to prove that the supernatural goings on have a basis in scientific fact.  Depp is marvelous, as he is in all of the films he's done with Burton.  The two of them bring out the best in each other and create cinema magic.  The sets are eerie and atmospheric, filled with fog and mists that build tension and a feel for the late 18th century countryside.  I really can't say enough about the set direction.  I tip my hat to whoever did it. Christina Ricci provides more than adequate love interest and she looks lovely in her costumes.  Christopher Walken looks like he had a marvelous time with his fake teeth, snarling at everyone like a maniac.

Burton's Instant Classic of Horror,"Without a doubt, Tim Burton is an artist. He has proved that when he brought us Batman (1989) and Edward Scissorhands. This time he outdoes himself with Sleepy Hollow. He brings back that Gothic horror from the Hammer Films, but with a fairy tale fell to it. Sleepy Hollow is set in the 1800 and tells the story of Ichabod Crane (played by Jonny Depp), an odd, open minded New York constable who is sent to investigate mysterious murders in a small village known as Sleepy Hollow. Crane relies on weird gadgets and sometimes odd theories to solve crimes, but this time he will face a supernatural force he had never come across, The Dreaded Headless Horseman. This movie is a master piece and has one of the most beautiful set designs I have ever seen. Christopher Walken and Ray Park (Darth Maul) give life to the Headless Horseman. Also, Christopher Lee makes a guest appearance at the beginning of the movie. The plot is great, the cast is phenomenal, and the photography is gorgeous.

"A dark, twisted, and fun tale!",Sleep Hollow is one of 3 Rated R movies ever Directed by Tim Burton. Let's just say he really earns that R rating here with multiple grisly killings on screen here. Sleepy Hollow is a very dark/horror like film but also has room for some comedy that we are accustomed to from a Tim Burton film. The ensemble here is very talented and Johnny Depp puts on a good performance. What I enjoyed about this film is it could have been very paper thin like but instead Tim Burton keeps us guessing with every scene. Even though most of the scenes take place in the dark everything is stil very well lit so you can see the action. Sleepy Hollow is a perfect example of when Tim Burton is at his best. Sleepy Hollow gets a solid 8 stars out of 10 from me.,8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Keep your head on,"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and the Headless Horseman is a timeless one; everyone knows it. So how better to re-tell this story in an interesting and innovative fashion which will appeal to today's audiences than to hire quirky filmmaker Tim Burton, whose eccentric sets and expertise at mood building are a fair guarantee that the film will be interesting, if nothing else.Burton lives up to his reputation here; Sleepy Hollow may prove to be his most atmospheric film yet. The sets of the town Sleepy Hollow are marvelously strange, (and very Burton-esq for any fans) perfectly capturing the feel of this shady, timewarped town. There's also a constant feel that something isn't right, as if dark forces could strike out at any moment. (aided by Danny Elfman's triumphant score, which I enjoyed, but found too intrusive at times: when the tension should have been built slowly and sickeningly to draw the viewer in further, Elfman sometimes brings it to a crashing climax far too quickly) It helps of course, that the village residents have the grizzled look of having stepped out of a child's fairy tale book, especially Burton favorite Michael Gough, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDarmid and Jeffrey Jones as some of the town elders. Burton even manages to sneak in a brief role from another favorite of his, Christopher Lee, who manages to be typically imposing and commanding, standing out even though he was in only a single short scene.Of course, Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to watch, and he manages to make the role of Ichabod Crane his own, filled with twitchy mannerisms and girlish squeaks. Crane may not be the typical action hero, but he is delightfully personified, and just quirky enough to work. Christina Ricci also gives a strong performance as Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of Baltus (Michael Gambon) and Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) unofficial leaders of the town. Katrina appears to be the only innocent and pure character, yet with some undisclosed dark secrets of her own. Ricci pulls off the character believably, though she struggles with her accent at times. However it is great to see such classy actors as Gambon and Richardson as the mysterious unofficial magistrates. Both turn out excellent and dignified performances, though both graze the line of going over the top during some of the more dramatic scenes. Even Casper Van Dien gives a satisfying performance as a highly suspicious village resident. And of course, it's great to see Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman during a flashback sequence with his head on - Walken proves that he is truly one of the greatest actors still around as he manages to make his role utterly terrifying without speaking a single word. (although to be fair, his makeup does help add to the effect, but it's easy to believe he could have been equally frightening without it)The strong performances from the cast help the film hold strong during some of the weaker sequences, and really help make the film a success. Although, another major draw will be Burton's unique and creative set design and trait for really giving the sense of immersing the audience into a complete other world. If you are willing to forgive the occasional weak plot point, Sleepy Hollow is an excellent way to spend an evening, immersing yourself into Burton's dark world and profound imagination. This truly does seem to be the movie he was born to make.-8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Memorable,"I saw this film three years ago when it was in theaters.  It is excellent and memorable.  I still remember some of the nuances of Johnny Depp's performance, even after all of this time.  I liked the way he grimaced at things like the sight of blood, which was ironic since he was a policeman who investigated homicides.  That little touch made me laugh at the time, and injected a slight tongue-in-cheek effect to the whole film.Also, Christopher Walken is wonderfully ghoulish as the Headless Horseman. This is worth seeing, if you like films of this genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
An unbiased view from a huge Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fan,"Okay, I'm being facetious. I am very strongly biased toward both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. Keep that in mind as you read on...This movie is vintage Tim Burton from the stark forest to the skewed buildings in the village to the light snowfall at the end. As in most of his movies, the imagery and background are just important as the characters. If you've enjoyed Edward Scissorhands, Batman (and Batman Returns), and Ed Wood, you will almost certainly enjoy this.As expected, I thoroughly enjoyed Johnny Depp's performance. His confident, yet cowardly Crane adds another notch to an already impressive belt. Other Burton mainstays include Jeffrey Jones (slightly under-used here) and Michael Gough, both on their third Burton film.A couple of other bonuses: - Including Christopher Lee was a minor stroke of genius - The Headless Horseman is one of the coolest characters I've seen on film this year - Danny Elfman, an excellent film composer in his own right, creates his finest work for Tim Burton and this film is no exception.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Another Tim Burton Masterpiece.,"Sleepy Hollow is probably my favorite Tim Burton movie.Johnny Depp fit the Ichabod Crane role the best and Christina Ricci was pretty good to this movie has everything story,gore,acting,special effects etc.Everything that makes a Tim Burton movie a Tim Burton movie.Grade:A+See this movie you will not be disapointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
all i can say is OUCH..,"Alas, the day of the fall of Burton has come. We all knew it had to come, as with other legendaries before him (such as Raimi - For Love of the Game? Bleech!). It seemed this film would have been much less painful to watch if the complicated-to-the-point-of-jargon script was abandoned and the entire movie consisted of the Headless Horseman doing his own thing. No point to ANY of the characters...ANY! Why did Casper van Dien bother gaining 30 lbs for a 30-second role??? Danny Elfman seems to have lost all ability to compose his classically haunting scores. At least i agree with the title - the writer must have been both SLEEPY and HOLLOW at the time.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

summery of sleepy hollow,"Sleepy Hollow is one of the favourite Johnny Depp films. He plays the sweet, yet kinda geeky character ichabod crane. In the story his character is supposed to be ugly and not very nice looking, but, Johnny Depp being an extremely gorgeous, changed this all though he tried his hardest! He is of course an amazing actor and he proves that dramatically in this performance, being the inspector on the case of the brutel head decaportations, not believing in ghosts or any sort of spirit, scared of spiders and has a tendency to faint a lot, i think he pulls it off well!

Delicious pitch black atmosphere and a camp plot make this flick a winner!,"This film is often compared to the classic Hammer Horror films, and for good reason. Aside from utilising a few of the studio's regular cast members, Tim Burton's film has the fun, innocent edge that most Hammer films enjoyed - while also putting much of the focus on the plot rather than the characters or any other finer details. Also like Hammer, the film has it's own distinct style; but instead of the bright colourful sets that Hammer so often used, Burton's film is dripping in pitch black atmosphere as thick as blood, and it is this that gives the film it's main claim to greatness. Many of Burton's films enjoy this same atmosphere, but he never used it as well as it's used here. The film feels like a dark, twisted fairytale throughout and although this can, at times, take away from the serious horror edge; there's enough blood and guts on offer to keep any horror fan happy. Props such as styled pumpkins and scarecrows help to keep this atmosphere going, and when combined with Burton's assured direction - the film is a stylish visual treat. Nearly every scene in the film is excellently staged, and shots that see things such as a beheaded mother state at her son through the floorboards show that the director has a real flair for horror.The plot follows the legend of the headless horseman. This legend hasn't been done on film many times. In fact, I can't think of a single other film that tackles it head on...although I'm not denying the existence of one. Anyway, we follow Ichabod Crane; a policeman sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of strange murders, apparently committed by a headless horseman. He doesn't believe it at first...but ""seeing is believing"", and it's not long before he's tackling the legend head on! Sleepy Hollow benefits from a plethora of great performances. Burton's frequent muse, Johnny Depp, heads the cast and he is joined by Christina Ricci, along with a whole host of great actors including Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, and Christopher Walken, who is superb in the role of the headless horseman. The nineties didn't offer much in the way of great horror films; but Sleepy Hollow is near the top of the short list. For some reason, the film doesn't have as many fans as it should; but that doesn't change the fact that it's a great achievement, and one of Tim Burton's best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
stunning  story,"Story was great, along with the performances of the actors. It was all about revenge , love and witch-crafts.

His investigation because of his spirit which believed in logic , action and results, leads to covering a fact about van family.The viewer is bound to suspect many people as story revolves, but each time the point of suspicion keeps on moving and makes the plot interesting enough to hold your seat until yo finally come to know the unexpected villain, and the person who was behind all those murder !",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Burton's Best Film Ever... 10+ (5 stars),"Tim Burton made some alteration from Irvings version of Sleepy Hollow, but it still was a GREAT movie. For instance...Ichabod Crane was a teacher in Irving's version...Burton's - he was a constable. The movie had spectacular special effects and I'm not just saying that because I love special effects. I liked how Burton incorporated his own touch in the first scene..where VanGarett ran into the corn field and turned around and saw the scare crow with the pumpkin head...The pumpkin head face design looked very similar to Burton's character in ""The Nightmare before Christmas.""

Headless Horseman goes camping.,"A new twist to an old tale.  And yet Another unusual Tim Burton film. The special effects were great and aside from some scenes of splashing blood, very real. It seemed Tim couldn't decide how he wanted Johny to portray the main character.  One minute decisive and specific. The next he's a wimpering, scared indecisive child. He figured it all out but getting there was a stretch.  You wonder how he could be a NY Constable. Christina was beautiful, well spoken and fit her part.Christopher Walken was as always a first class wildman. Most scenes I don't think he was really swinging the weapons but some looked like a real swordsman was and others seemed like graphic effects.

Tim Burton Back on Form,"After the pretty variable Mars Attack, Tim Burton returns to what we know he does best, dark Gothic movies. The cast of Sleepy Hollow includes some actors that have worked with Burton in Johnny Depp, Michael Gough and Jeffrey Jones. Most of the rest of the cast is British. The story is that a number of murders have been taking place in the isolated New York village of Sleepy Hollow. The village think that is the infamous Headless horseman, who was beheaded near to the village, and who was risen from the grave. Constable Icabod Crane is sent to investigate the murder. He initial thinks that it is the work of one of the local offical. But after discovering the horseman at work on night, he finds the evil deeds are at work within the village.It good to see a film that doesn't take itself too seriously. There is lots of black humour, especially from Depp who play Crane as a sort of Early Sherlock Holmes. The sets are beautifully gothic, and darkly and help to draw you into the film. George Lucas take note! The horseman himself is a pretty mean with a sword, as could be expected as he is played by the stuntman who played Darth Maul. The English cast is very good especially Ian McDiarmid, Miranda Richardson and Michael Gambon.To conclude the best film I have seen since the Sixth sense, and miles better than End of Days.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Perfect! Marvelous in every way!,"This movie was one of the best horror pictures that I have ever seen. It is very good that this movie won the Academy Award for art direction. Everything really looks like how it would have looked back in the 18th century. I thought that sky looked really cool. It was all gloomy and gray and kinda foreshadowed what would happen. Creepy stuff. Johnny Depp plays young Constable Ichabod Crane, an unbelieving skeptic who believes that for every murder, there is someone of flesh and blood behind it. But, this time, he may be wrong. People are being decapitated in the small woodsy town of Sleepy Hollow that the townspeople believe to be the handiwork of a legendary Headless Horseman. Now, Johnny Depp gave us one of the best performances of his career here. This was a great movie that wouldn't have been the same without him. I really like his wimpy accent that he puts on. It really sounds authentic. Christina Ricci is also great as Katrina Van Tassel, a young girl with secrets to hide. The Horseman really looked cool. In the flashback scenes, we have Christopher Walken playing the horseman in an uncredited role. And the only words that he ever really says are ""Ungh"" and ""shhh"". There is also some really graphic violence. Beheadings galore. If you are one with a weak stomach, then maybe you should hold off on this one just a little while longer. But if you don't have a weak stomach and still haven't seen this movie- SEE IT NOW! And after you are done with this film and still want something more, then check out FROM HELL. That movie is a little similar and is also played by Johnny Depp. I also liked Casper Van Dien in this movie. He is a great actor that we don't see enough of. The opening sequence is cool, where we see a Pumpkin-headed scarecrow looking in on an unsuspecting man. SLEEPY HOLLOW is one of the best movies of its genre ever. If you haven't yet seen it, go see it now. You won't ne disappointed......5/5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Beautiful.,"Sleepy Hollow is the most visually stimulating movie that I've ever seen. I would compare Tim Burton to the likes of Monet or Van Gogh. Every single scene was like an individual painting. Tim Burton has a way of taking something that is fantasy or dreamlike, and conveying that picture onto film like no other. This can also be seen in Batman or Edward Scissorhands. Artistically, aspects like the contrast of the red blood on Johnny Depp's white face just blew me away. Johnny Depp did an outstanding performance also. He totally brought new life to the character of Ichabod Crane. This film definitely stands out as a film which defines artistic filmmaking and places Tim Burton in a class of his own.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Tim Burton's Visually Stunning Masterpiece,"As far as adaptations of old American novels go, Tim Burton's visually rich, tightly composed, resplendent version of Washington Irving's 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' ranks in the top echelon. The script for the screen is the work of Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker and while it takes some liberties from Irving's story, the resulting dialogue and action pacing are so wholly in keeping with Burton's vision that it feels like an original story.Much of the magnificence of this film is due to the atmospheric set design by Rick Heinrichs (with art direction by Ken Court, John Dexter, and Andy Nicholson with set decoration by Peter Young) and Colleen Atwood's extraordinary costumes. It is not usual to credit these artists when reviewing a film, but their contributions are an integral part of the success of the movie.As far as acting, Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane shines in a fully nuanced character portrayal complete with paraphernalia and ticks and mild madness. He is ably supported by Christina Ricci (in one of her finest moments), and a troupe of brilliant actors that includes Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Christopher Lee, and Ian McDiarmid. They appear as though they are daguerreotypes, so perfectly in keeping with the time and period and mannerisms of Irving's novel. The musical score by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki are synchronous with Tim Burton's brilliant direction. This is a treasure of a film. Highly recommended.

It's a headless horseman! I saw him! 9 of 10.,"This is the movie that shows why Tim Burton is the master of the Gothic horror genre. He gives a classic story a new make-up and creates a wonderful atmosphere by adding to the fantastic set all the right colours, textures and music. His attention to detail and ritual make this a magical experience, a dark fairy tale. The cast are all superb, but it is Burton's screen alter ego, Johnny Depp, whose mesmerizing presence steals every scene. Let's admit it, the back of his hand is more expressive than some other actors' faces. His Ichabod Crane is not only endearing and intelligent, he is also involuntarily funny much of the time. And it is this sense of humour that lifts this movie above even the good ones of the genre. The moment when Crane finally meets the Headless Horseman face to... er... missing head, and faints, and afterwards, when he regains consciousness and tries to convince everybody of the existence of the demon - that's just pure brilliance. This is Tim Burton at his best, with a film that firmly belongs in my Top Ten.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

His like for darker things helps this movie be as good as it is.  This time Crane is a detective who goes to Sleepy Hollow to investigate some murders.  The atmosphere and Burton's use of colors really enhance this movie.  I also like the change in the story, as a detective is just more interesting than a schoolteacher.  Johnny Depp is great as Crane and the rest of the cast is good as well.  There is even brief appearance by Christopher Walken and horror legend Christopher Lee.

It just did not match what was happening on screen.I also expected this to be a spooky, maybe even scary movie and was vastly disappointed that not once was I put on the edge of my seat. This was mainly due to the music not setting up the mood, but also certain parts of the movie felt like the story was being rushed along.The final problem I felt was that Burton let the audience know what was going on to early.

A Highly Recommended Horror Film,"TITLE: Sleepy HollowRATING: ***1/2 (out of ****)A Review by BroncoWe've probably all read the classic tale ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" by Washington Irving. If you're expecting a movie out of that story, look elsewhere. The plot is completely different and the only thing similar are the character's names. But this is definitely not a bad thing because this is a very good movie.Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is an 18th century constable and uses forensic science. So a magistrate (Christopher Lee) sends him to Sleepy Hollow to solve murders where the victims were beheaded. So in Sleepy Hollow, he meets Baltus Van Tessel (Michael Gambon), his wife Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson), the daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci) and a bunch of other people.So they tell him about the headless horseman (Christopher Walken), a hessian who loved to slice people's heads off. At first, Ichabod doesn't believe it until he sees the horseman himself and Ichabod's investigations go a little furthur and he has the help of young Masbath (Marc Pickering) and Katrina. Ichabod also happens to be haunted by visions of his childhood when his mother was killed by his father.This movie is very entertaining and will scare a lot of people. All the performances were done well but I thought Christina Ricci was a little miscast. Don't get me wrong, she did an excellent job but I just thought she was miscast but this is just a minor gripe. The beheadings all look very real and not phony. This is the first film that Tim Burton went full-blown horror and he did an excellent job.This was probably definitely one of the most entertaining films of 1999 (it was definitely the best horror film of 1999). I really enjoyed it, almost everything was done above average. The only major gripe I had was the miscasting of Ricci but that's minor. A very good horror film that horror fans should definitely see if they haven't already.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Gothic Horror From Tim Burton,"The tale of Ichabod Crane comes to life as never before, in this richly textured and detailed offering of the timeless legend, `Sleepy Hollow,' directed by Tim Burton.  In this dark and vividly imaginative, definitive version, Johnny Depp plays Crane, a New York City Police Constable at the end of the Eighteenth Century, who is dispatched northward by his superiors to the hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, to investigate the grisly murders of three of it's citizens.  Crane has been chosen, not because he is considered a man of vision for employing the latest scientific techniques in his investigations, but rather because his methods are looked upon askance by his colleagues, and they welcome the chance to be rid of him.  He is, they feel, something of an embarrassment to their community, and therefore better relegated to a small, out-of-the-way township of diminutive significance, whereupon his arrival he learns that the murders all share a common thread: In each case, the head has been severed from the body, and carried off.  And so, equipped with the latest and most sophisticated wherewithal science has to offer (many instruments of which are of his own design), Constable Crane begins his investigation. 	Working from a terrific screenplay by Kevin Yagher (adapted from the story by Washington Irving), Burton makes use of magnificent sets and the talents of an exemplary cast to bring his tale to life.  He creates an atmosphere of darkness and foreboding that permeates the drama and captures that same sense of menace and disquietude evoked by the classic horror films of the 30's and 40's, such as `Frankenstein,' `Dracula,' `The Wolf Man,' and the like, and infuses it with some rather graphic, yet stylishly presented and realistic decapitations and various other bloodlettings, all enhanced and delivered with cutting-edge special F/X.  All of which, for the fan of true gothic horror, becomes a bona fide cauldron of unspeakable delights.  It must be noted that none of this is presented in a fashion anywhere near to what could be considered a `gore-fest' by any stretch of the imagination; Burton maintains the gothic aspects of the story, visually and dramatically, and renders it all with a touch of real class.  Never does he sink to casting about for a gross visual, or attempt to manipulate a situation for the sake of some cheap thrills.  It's a matter of integrity-- artistic and otherwise-- and Burton has it; it also demonstrates that he has a respect for his audience, for which he is to be commended, as he works in an industry in which that attitude of consideration does not necessarily prevail. 	Depp gives an exceptional performance as Crane, affecting a style reminiscent of Colin Clive in the original `Frankenstein,' or Basil Rathbone in `Son Of Frankenstein,' which fits so nicely with all that Burton is attempting (successfully) to do with this film.  It signals that rare rapport between actor and director wherein a concurrent vision is realized, for all of these attributes of the classical actor that Depp brings to the character are exactly what Burton needed from his star to make the film work so well; the aspect it lends to the final product evinces the same difference as that between a fiddle and a Stradivarius.  In a similar vein, in a supporting role, Michael Gambon gives a performance as Baltus Van Tassel that is akin to that of Depp's in adding to the overall ambience of the film, as does Richard Griffiths as Magistrate Samuel Philipse. 	The leading ladies also answer Burton's exacting call, especially Christina Ricci as Katrina Anne Van Tassel, and Miranda Richardson, who casts a spell as Lady Van Tassel.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Lisa Marie (Lady Crane), Casper Van Dien (Brom Van Brunt), Jeffrey Jones (Reverend Steenwyck), Ian McDiarmid (Dr. Lancaster), Michael Gough (Notary Hardenbrook), Mark Pickering (Young Masbath) and, especially menacing in a pivotal role, Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman.  As he did before with such films as `Edward Scissorhands' and `The Nightmare Before Christmas,' Tim Burton, with `Sleepy Hollow,' has given us yet another entertaining and exciting film that veritably carves out a singular niche for itself in the genre of the unique.  It's a quality film that deserves a special place in every DVD or video collection.  Truly one to be appreciated and savored.  I rate this one 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Funny, Thrilling and Visually Stunning","This DVD is worth the purchase just for the striking cinematography and visual imagery of this macabre film. Tim Burton uses all of his best elements in this supernatural thriller, the result being a slightly over the top but exceptional comedy horror fest.Johnny Depp is Ichabod Crane, a young, fidgety and eccentric forensics expert who is sent to the small secluded village of Sleepy Hollow to uncover its nasty secrets. At night, a cloaked figure on a massive black horse is stalking and murdering a seemingly random string of the town's residents, and clearly has no intention of stopping unless Crane can solve the mystery.The town is a series of stunning old fashioned architectures and is shot in a gloomy, dense fog. All in supreme Tim Burton fashion, the visuals and special effects especially stand out in ""Hollow"". Another intriguing aspect is Christina Ricci as the pale, beautiful girl Katrina Von Tassel, who aids Ichabod in his quest for the truth- and survival.Although it all sounds dark and it is, with loads of blood splattered over it (tastefully), the whole film has a heavy undertone of black humor and it never takes itself too seriously. When the horseman cuts off heads, they spin around before hitting the ground. How seriously can you take it?

Tim Burton's take on the classic Washington Irving story,"I have a knack for literary movies. Even films based on the classic horror novels with literature's famous monsters: Count Dracula, The Frankenstein Monster, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, The Phantom of the Opera, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and... The Headless Horseman. I love Tim Burton's films; I have a few of them. Of the two versions of this classic Washington Irving story, I love both the Disney animated version narrated (and sung) by Bing Crosby and this gruesome, Gothic film version starring two of my favourite actors, Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci.In this version, Ichabod Crane is a constable from New York in 1799 who is most concerned with all the new scientific gadgets that will allow him to do his job better. However, he is quite squeamish about his latest assignment: travelling to the town of Sleepy Hollow, where there have been a series of murders involving people whose heads have been cut off. When he arrives, the four town elders inform him that the three victims were killed on open ground and that the heads had vanished, allegedly taken by a headless ghost. Ichabod is unconvinced of this, but learns more about the ghostly horseman. It is the ghost of a vicious Hessian sent to aid the British during the Revolutionary War, and he was caught by revolutionaries and decapitated with his own sword. When Ichabod sees the ghost kill one of the town council members, his skepticism evaporates. And then, he soon discovers that the horseman's ghost has an unholy connection to Baltus Van Tassel, a wealthy farmer, whose daughter (Katrina) he is falling in love with.Overall, this is an awesome film. Johnny gives it wit, humor, and charm. This film is also great for October, especially close to Halloween, or any month.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Very good movie.,"After I read other peoples' reviews, it seems either people like the movie, or they hate it. I particularly liked this movie. It is a must-see for every gothic/morbid person.Many people said the story was poor, and there was little development of the characters. The story was very good. It was somewhat complicated, but not over-the-top, with both humorous and serious dialog. The story combined comedy with horror in a perfect blend to satisfy the comedian or the gothic person. The script and plot were very well-written, with a unique story, that was very much improved from the original Legend of Sleepy Hollow.Tim Burton is under-appreciated as a director. The sets were dream-like with a nice gothic feel. The movie, except for the dream sequences, have a black-and-white appeal with well-blended periodic additions of color during Ichabod's dreams. But it's never too dark or foggy to see what's going on, which is rare for a movie like this.This movie was, in my opinion, better than the Disney version. It is much bloodier, the special effects are fantastic. There is no gore and very little sexuality, and I think the movie deserved a PG 13 rating, definitely. R is just too high a rating, it wasn't that bad with typical R-movie characteristics. The blood and decapitation never goes over the top.The horseman scenes were dramatic and well shot, also. And the horseman isn't what you always are looking forward to seeing.I highly recommend this movie. Much better than what I expected. I roll my eyes at people who say it was horrible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Best movie of the 1990s. No ifs, ands or buts.","I saw the preview for `Sleepy Hollow,' where the main character is a forensics expert/detective, a week before its release when I went to see the tepid `Bone Collector,' which, ironically, also dealt with a forensics expert as the main character.  The preview was well done, but when I discovered who was starring and directing, it became an afterthought. Then, something inexplicable must've happened because I relented and decided to see SH after all when it was released.Well, what followed were 22 viewings in 39 days until it was pulled from my local theater.  Now, a film has to be pretty damn good to warrant such a hot streak. I simply haven't seen anything this awesome in years.  SH has everything: great plot (I'm sorry, but anyone who calls this a `Scooby Doo' mystery didn't pay much attention to the story), colorful characters, incredible visuals  was I the only one who liked Ichabod's dream sequences?  and phenomenal production design.  This is the first film that's commanded my attention through every frame; no scene ever lags or gets boring.  Heck, this movie has more Vans than U-Haul (as in 3 Tassels, 2 Garretts, a Brunt played by a Dien, and a Ripper), and more faints than a Backstreet Boys concert. What's not to like here?I won't delve into the plot since everybody knows it by now, but I will say that transforming Ichabod Crane from the lanky schoolteacher into a constable (a word I will always associate with `Mary Poppins') was a terrific idea, and since I am a huge fan of police/detective stories, this was right up my alley. The special effects fit like an old shoe; that's how natural they looked.  Granted, SH is hardly scary but it puts any modern bunk like the insipid `Scream' series, which go for blatant blood and guts rather than an actual plot to scare viewers, to shame.Every performance in SH is beyond my reproach, especially Johnny Depp's, and I don't count myself among his fans. This blows away his previous top effort, `Donnie Brasco,' because it takes more talent to pull off an Ichabod Crane than a Joe Pistone.  His Crane, deeply committed to his occupation, is perhaps the most believable action hero, as opposed to the usual muscleheads usually seen in the action/detective genre (ahem, Arnie). He is a perfect combination of Sherlock Holmes and Inspector Clouseau as he has no problem performing autopsies yet freaks out at the sights of blood, spiders and horseback riders without heads, like any of us would.  He may also be the most nonviolent hero in recent memory: he never raised a hand to or threatened anyone, he played peacemaker (or tried to, anyway) on several occasions, didn't swear or spout any misogynistic lines, and for all the times he pulled his gun, he fired only once while trying to protect his two charges from the Horseman. His grand speech in the notary's office was simply amazing.Christina Ricci is equally impressive as Katrina Van Tassel, though I was disappointed at how she downplayed her character. `I play the stereotypical damsel in distress,' she says.  To me, she was the opposite.  Rather than a sexpot stagnating on the sidelines, she was part of the action: assisting Ichabod in his investigation (an early version of the script had her helping Ichabod dig out a grave), leaping onto a horse from a speeding carriage and jumping from a flaming windmill.  Some have complained about their `romance,' yet I instead considered it a very genuine friendship.  Her delivery was excellent as she goes to market with this role.  There is a particularly touching moment with her and Young Masbath (awesome Marc Pickering, who is everything Macaulay Culkin should have been) in the Western Woods. Her singing `Pickety Witch' made my blood run cold. Never mind Depp being nearly twice her age, it doesn't hinder their relationship. She just might be the first case of a miscast character that instead has a positive effect on a movie.The supporting cast stood out well with the lead players; they fit into the film nicely and no role was overshadowed.  All  the Van Tassels and the town elders (1799's version of Grumpy Old Men), among others (including much-maligned Casper Van Dien as Brom  give the guy a break already, folks), were fun to watch, particularly Michael Gough as the notary, but with his body language, notably his plodding like a rusty Tin Man from a funeral.Who better than Chris Walken to play the fanged, pre-headless Hessian? Let's face it, it would've killed the spooky, maniacal aura of his character if he had any spoken lines. Seeing Christopher Lee (who was an absolute steal for 1997's terrific `The Odyssey,' also produced by Francis Coppola) was a nice treat as well.Some of my favorite performances were also by the Killian family (Steven Waddington, Claire Skinner and Sean Stephens). The line `Don't pick your teeth, you teach Thomas bad habits!' always made me smile.However, I'd be lying if I said SH was a perfect movie. I thought the characters of Lady Van Tassel and Brom were somewhat underdeveloped. I was disappointed with the ending only that I had expected it to have the oomph `Seven' did (considering who wrote the screenplay), but this is merely small potatoes as the climax formidably holds its own anyway.  The runaway carriage scene left me slack-jawed; this is what today's lackluster car chases should take notes from.  The Headless Horseman leaves Darth Maul from last May's disappointing `Phantom Menace' and any other horror villains in the dust. Incredible swordplay, especially in the fight under the famous covered bridge.Go see this right away, you won't be disappointed.  This was the final film I saw for the millennium...perfect. If SH does not garner any Oscar nominations in the technical categories, then I'll make someone tie me up with telephone wire and watch `The Postman' for 24 hours straight. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Disappointing but watchable,"Just goes to show that assembling a cast of well known actors under a (normally) good director does not always result in a good film.The sets, effects and atmosphere were wonderfully created but... It didn't engage you like 6th sense.  Gory yes.  Scary no.  Hammer House of Horror did it better.Shame, could have been a good film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Wonderful!,"Sleepy Hollow was a fantastic film, a story that could only have been made truly enjoyable (for me at least) by Tim Burton. When I was little, the cartoon freaked me out...but I've never really been able to understand Ichabod in most interpretations. Either you pity or despise him, you think 'well it's a shame what happened...but he was stupid' or 'I'm glad he died...the money grubbing jerk!' In reality, this just made the character deeper, not to mention the fantastic costumes...gels...scenes. It has an artistic flare, obviously...being a Tim Burton film (as I've mentioned.) The characters are deeper and more understandable. This is one of the very few mysteries that took me until the end to figure out the killer. Even then I was still surprised.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Just a good flick.,"I just saw Sleepy Hollow last night and I have to say, it was not what I expected but, it was great nonetheless. It was far less scary than I thought it would be, all the beheading scenes being quite funny. Tim Burton did a wonderful job, it really is a feast for your eyes. Christina Ricci was not so good, at least thats what I thought. It seemed like she couldn't shake her 1990sness, because she speaks just like most of her other characters. That leaves Johnny Depp. How cool is this guy? He rocks as usual. A good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Another amazing movie from Burton,"Well, Tim Burton does it again. Nobody does it like Burton! He's a genius. This movie is a proof of his talent. This film is scary, exciting, beautiful and thrilling. It is well made and the make up, the clothes, and the sound and visual effects are really good.Its script mixes action, fun, thriller and horror situations, and that makes the film absolutely great. It has it moments, some of them really funny. Some of the are also very scary.""Sleepy Hollow"" tells the story of an American constable called Ichabod Crane who is sent by his boss to Sleepy Hollow, an isolated village, where he must investigate a series of murders committed by a supposed headless horseman.This film is very well acted. That's because his great cast, starring Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, Christina Ricci as Katrina Van Tassel, Miranda Richardson as her stepmother Mary Van Tassel, Michael Gamobn as Katrina's father,Baltus and Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman. But the cast is not complete; it is completed by Jeffrey Jones, Lisa Marie, Casper Van Dien, Michael Gough, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDiarmid and Christopher Lee. This cast is absolutely great.The music in the film is very interesting and wonderful. Created by Burton's friend Danny Elfman, this soundtrack is good and dark. I want Tim Burton to keep working with the great Elfman.Tim Burton should keep making films like this one, like this type of films, because they're all really amazing and beautiful. I'll always trust in you, Burton.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Beautifully crafted and gory film,"Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a well crafted and beautifully designed horror/fantasy film. Depp's performance gives the film a bit of comic relief at just the right moments. Don't take your kids to see this one based on the classic Sleepy Hollow tale. When they said heads will roll, they meant it. This film is one of the goriest I've seen in a while. I give it 8/10 only because the story could have been better. On visuals this one gets a 10/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Not a purist,"Even though I am an English teacher, I did not find myself at all bothered by the fact that Burton took enormous liberties with Irving's short story. The atmosphere of Gothic mystery that he created was astounding and he familiarized a new generations with a classic American writer. But what I loved about this film was the production values; I saw it on the big screen and thought that every single frame could have been made into a wonderful, individual picture. Now with the pause on DVD my theory has been proved correct. This is one of the most beautifully photographed, almost heart-breakingly gorgeous productions I've ever seen. Did anyone noticed the paint peeling on the window sashes when Icabod first arrives? Such attention to detail! I just wish the film wasn't rated R. This would be so perfect to show to my critical viewing class as an example of first rate production design, but we are not allowed to show any R's. I really don't think it should be rated R; it's not really that gory and the one sex scene is tame indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Burton outdoes Irving by a country mile (or maybe two)...,"At the risk of sounding somewhat heretical to the purists who decry adaptations as inferior product, I cannot claim much affection for Washington Irving. As I was talking to a friend of mine who is a literature major, we both agreed that Irving had a lot of good ideas, BUT his execution of them sucked. I've always found him too wordy, too meandering, and too coma-inducing to be considered interesting (and I've read more classics in the last five years than I did the entire time I went to high school). So, this said, it would have to be Tim Burton who would get Irving's most famous tale right.While I'm not a fanatical Burton follower, I do have a great deal of respect for his craft and films that many of his detractors lack and I think that I can safely say that this is probably the most serious film of his that I have ever seen. That may sound strange considering the fantastical elements of this story, but unlike previous Burton efforts (and I include the original Batman on this list), Sleepy Hollow feels more grounded in reality, even if more than a few historical liberties were taken. The mystery of the decaptations, which I expected would be rather quickly resolved (after all, practically everybody in America knows who did it, right?), surprisingly turned out to be central to the plot, which I felt was a good move to give the story a solid backbone. However, it is not a mystery in the traditional sense that the audience can figure out the clues with the detective. Burton does drop a few subtle hints that you're likely to miss because THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS YOU TO DO. It seemed to me as though he wanted the audience to follow Ichabod's thinking, deductions, and conclusions rather than veer off on their own, thereby adding to the shock when the real culprit is revealed. Such a style requires subtle, painstaking work and it's to Burton's credit that, in my case at least, he succeeded.For all it's decaptations, blood, and somber atmosphere, the story does take a few Burtonesque touchs of humor that you can't help but at least smile at. My favorite has to be during the flashback to the Horseman's death (played with over-the-top relish by Christopher Walken). The Horseman makes a shushing sound to the two little blonds he runs into. One of them promptly snaps a branch to get his pursuers' attention. You have to see it to believe it. Another good one is when Nesmith asks Ichabod, ""Is he dead?"" Ichabod's logical but funny reply: ""That's the trouble. He was dead to begin with."" There are a lot of others but I won't reveal any more. Rest assured, though, they are there.Now as to the main cast, what can I say about Johnny Depp (positive or negative) that hasn't been said before? I will say that he is one of my favorite off-beat film actors (still love his stuff in ""Ed Wood) and his portrayal of Constable Ichabod Crane (no, you haven't wandered into the wrong movie; that's one of the changes that was added on early) is perhaps one of the most unlikely anti-heroes ever shot on film. A prim and proper shell of a man driven by reason and science, burnt by anguish over a very nasty childhood, Crane brings to mind Sherlock Holmes minus the nerves of steel (his teaming with young Nesmith would seem to verify this observation). This has to be the only movie that I've ever seen where the hero faints more often than the heroine. Speaking of said heroine, Christini Ricci admittedly does not have much to work with, but she infuses what she has with commendable skill. Perhaps one of the reasons for the minimalist screen time/performance was to increase the uncertainty about her true nature. As to what that might be...I'm not going to tell you. Though his name isn't mentioned often, I honestly feel that Casper Van Dien, considering what I have seen of his mediocre acting skills, was born to play the part of the brave but brainless Bram Bones. His best moment has to be his fight with the Horseman (a piece of macabre comedy that Buster Keaton could have admired).The only other thing I've left to add about the film is that it is best that you pay attention to every detail, major or minor, during the movie. The biggest suprise of the whole film for me was how all the little pieces scattered here and there fit together at the film's climax. It'll be most interesting to see what Burton will pull next from his magic bag of tricks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Good fun,"Sorry to see this movie is being picked on so much already. Maybe some people forget you go see Tim Burton's movies to have FUN, already! This is a beautifully stylish movie, I could not get enough of seeing that hellish figure flying on the back of his demon-horse, cloak flying and sword flailing. Fantastic! The town itself was a wonderful presence, with old covered bridges and wicked looking trees. Johnny Depp was of course fabulous, he looked as if he genuinely enjoyed himself while making this movie. A shame for an actor of such range to be so underappreciated. He seems to suffer from the ""Ralph Fiennes Syndrome"", where actors with tremendous talent are snubbed because they are simply too good looking. (They got the face, so they must not need the award, or some odd reasoning. Perhaps it's envy...?) ""Sleepy Hollow"" is not scary, but then very few horror films truly are. It is more like a horror-themed ride at an amusement park, a very expensive amusement park. There are some laughs, not big ones but chuckles, and a sense of good-humor throughout. If I had to choose a weak point it would be Christina Ricci, which pains me because I loved her in the ""Addams Family"" movies, but here she sleepwalks through her role, many of her lines of dialogue sounding much flat, as if she were reciting them for a boring grade-school report. But it did not matter enough to me to affect my overall opinion of ""Sleepy Hollow"", which is that it was good fun. And Christopher Walken as the Hessian- of course!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"A Visually Well-Done Film, With Minor Flaws","Sleepy Hollow is a visually well-produced film, with an interesting plot, and good-enough acting that leaves us with memorable characters.Burton's visuals are, as usual, very good. Visuals of snow reminded me of the snow in Edward Scissorhands, and the warped landscape reminded me very much of the sets in Beetlejuice. His attention to detail, while not perfect (the ""millennium"" did not arrive in 1800, as Crane expects) was still impressive. The wig hairstyles looked authentic to the time - especially the one on Ferris Bueller's principal's head! - and the Dutch architecture in Sleepy Hollow is appropriate for a Dutch-settled state. The costumes looked elaborate and well-done.However, the strongly anti-religious tone was a turn off, and inaccurate, since the Puritan manner and doctrine of the town's religious leaders reflect a 1699 view of life, rather than that of 1799. Given how religion is handled, though, the open practice of witchcraft by nearly all of the town's womenfolk is simply not believable, and reeks of P.C..Otherwise, the plot, though certainly not what Washington Irving wrote, was exciting and a clever interpretation. The dialogue in the beginning scenes of his dealings with the legal system in NYC was poorly written and overly preachy, but did set up Ichabod's visit to Sleepy Hollow.Depp's acting was very stilted, but that's just what the character requires, and his formal manner was right for the time period of the film. He even brings some humor to the character that I really enjoyed.The film was not very gory, but did shock me a couple of times, which was good, for this type of film! I would recommend this film to anyone who likes Burton's style of film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Of course, being a Tim Burton movie, it also has quite a bit of dark humor, and while I loved it, some might not get the joke.Visually, Sleepy Hollow is fantastic.  Burton has completely recreated 1799 Sleepy Hollow.  The Horseman effects are top notch and there are some very exciting action sequences.

The villagers look as you would expect them - few handsome people, most look really awful - and the village don't look like Hollywood at all.The special effects are really great - the headless horseman is really convincing.

A Fun and Visually Fantastic Homage to Hammer,"Written around the time of the film's release in Philadelphia, PA,  my senior year of high school.About two weeks before Tim Burton's latest film, Sleepy Hollow, was released, my friend, Dan (SJP '99), informed me that he had four free passes to a sneak preview and asked if I'd like to go.  Having greatly anticipated this film since I had heard rumors of it almost a year before I had no trouble deciding whether or not I wanted to go.  So one Thursday night, a week before its actual release, I sat in the theater and enjoyed the cinematic feast that was set before my eyes.Sleepy Hollow is very loosely based on the Washington Irving short story, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.  Instead of being a meek and somewhat dim school teacher, Ichabod Crane is now a wimpy constable from New York City, sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of beheadings.  The story itself is more complex, offering us insight into the history of the infamous Headless Horseman, introducing new characters, and incorporating a mystery involving scandal and witchcraft.  Despite it being so far fetched from the original masterwork, however, I still managed to enjoy the story for what it was rather than focusing on the changes made.As one would expect from a Tim Burton film, the visuals are astoundingly rich with fantastic detail and from the ""painted"" backdrops to the windmill scene nearing the end of the film, one can clearly see how he tried to model his film after the famous Hammer horror films of the 60s and 70s.  Hammer Studios, a company based in Great Britain,  was known for making horror films rich in artistic detail and mostly excellent performances (such as The Horror of Dracula and The Vampire Lovers).  They were not, however, acknowledged for finely wrought plots, satisfying character development, and brilliant scripts.  Burton succeeds in paying homage to Hammer in these aspects as well, though not, surprisingly, to negative effect.Upon seeing previews for Sleepy Hollow, one would reasonably assumed that it is a very serious horror film, but in actuality it is almost completely tongue-in cheek and has a wonderfully dark sense of humor.  Adding to this somewhat campy effect is the apparent glee Burton took in beheading the film's characters.  As the tagline goes, heads certainly do roll and there is plenty of excessive gore to show it.  It is all in good fun, though, as the blood is sometimes so ridiculously unnecessary that it can hardly be taken seriously (which was certainly the director's intended effect).  It seemed that the dialogue was, at times, purposefully over-dramatic, and probably with the same reasoning in mind.The performances fit right in with the rest of the film, which is not to say that they were bad.  Johnny Depp, as the uptight, ""man of reason"" version of Ichabod, gives another excellent performance, as do the rest of the case (including Burton veterans Jeffrey Jones, as the town minister, and Christopher Walken, as, in a brilliant bit of casting, the Headless Horseman).  Christina Ricci, in her role as love interest, Katrina Van Tassel,  seems to stand out as part of Burton's cinematic nod to the Hammer Horror company.  In those films, they would often employ beautiful, blonde women to act as the female leads.  The only problem with them was that they were usually Swedish or, in one case, Polish, and had to learn a British accent for the film they were in, thus explaining their less than flawless British voices.  Hopefully, this is a good explanation for why Ms. Ricci's accent got progressively better throughout the course of the film.  On an extra note, the great Hammer staple, Christopher Lee, appears in a cameo as the judge that sends Ichabod to Sleepy Hollow.Overall, the only two disappointments in the film were the score and the lack of character development.  The score itself was fine and suited the film well, but having heard what Danny Elfman is capable of (just listen to his scores for Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands), it seemed very generic. Every once and a while you do hear some bizarre moments of tense strings suited perfectly to the film's off-beat tone, but they are few and far between.  In terms of character development, Ichabod is the focus of the film from beginning to end, and since action is such a key element to the film, there is little time for anyone else to make an impression.Tim Burton's latest work is certainly a masterpiece in terms of visuals and entertainment value, and its dream-like tone, filled with the brilliant Gothic imagery we have all come to expect does not disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Christopher Walken ROCKS!!,"This movie is definitely a 10.  The set is amazing, the story is original (it's not even close to Washington Irving), and, like I mentioned in the title of this message, Christopher Walken ROCKS!!

A Masterpiece of Dark Comedy and Suspense.,"I have to take my hat off AGAIN to Tim Burton.  Sleepy Hollow was a superior piece of work that blended dark scenery, dark humor that only true Burton fans appreciate, and a web of betrayal, deceit, and true mayhem and murder (not to mention some fantastic martial arts work by former Sith Lord turned Headless Horseman, Ray Park.)

Tongue in Cheek Horror,"I thought this was a brilliant movie! i saw it a few years back when it first came out and i thought it was terrifying but i watched it recently and its possibly the best horror film I've seen!The gruesome-ness of some of the scenes (decapitiaton etc etc) are great to watch, and when watching it now it still scares me now but makes me chuckle a bit also!Johnny Depps performance is great! he really hadpulled out everything to pull off the scaredy cat Icabod Crane, though its not his best performance (Edward Scissorhands is his best performance) he perfects the character more than anyone else could.This film is Burton at his most Gothic and horrific! he takes out his usual doses of fantasy and replaces it with decapitiatons etc etc! and pulls it off brilliantly!

An absolutely brilliant film,"Love this film, it's the best out there among the dross that is out at the moment in the UK.  It's not really a typical horror and not even supposed to be a comedy (although there are a bit too many laughs than normal) but it has a great plot that is played excellently.  Christopher Walken is excellent as the Headless Horseman, once again showing that he is one of a few band of actors that can play bad guys really convincingly.

Awesome movie even though it is totally different from the book!,"Johnny Depp does a really good job at portraying Ichabod Crane, and like someone else mentioned even though Washington Irving did not write a sequel to The Legend of Sleepy Hollow I do hope that Tim Burton continues the story of Sleepy Hollow. Cristina Ricci did a fine job of portraying Katrina Van Tassel but she didn't really seem like she was interested in what was going on in the movie.

"Different, But Good","Anyone who goes to see this movie with the idea that it's going to be just like the original story is in for a surprise, but not a bad one, as far as I'm concerned.  It's got the same basic story, but several added dimensions that I believe really benefit the film.  Some people may be mad about these changes, but honestly, what's the point of seeing the exact same story over and over again? It was really well made, and there are a lot of exciting scenes and an engaging mystery plot.  I recommend it (to anyone over 13).",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Bad writing decapitates ambitious effort,"Tim Burton's adaptation can't quite settle on a course to take to achieve it's ends: Either he'd picked which special effects he wanted to use and let his screenwriters wind their way through a plot to use them, or he simply let the script rest in the hands of two incompetents, hoping the flashy substance would make up for it. Unfortunately, it does not. The film can't settle on being a spoof of itself or a truly shocking film or even a serious detective story, and while Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci try to figure out which way to act it, we get bored waiting...",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Not very good,"The film got good reviews and I cant believe I watched it. The castlooked good but they were all given pathetic cameo's.

What's going tohappen next? etc. But suddenly It was revealed and a silly 'Se7en'like film kicks in with the horse man killing people not randomlybut specific people at specific times. Hence, Depp's job becominga lot more easier and the film getting way out of breath.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Already Overrated,"Although the film has many positive points including of course the amazing production design, cinematography, and Mr. Depp's fine performance; it is marred by Tim Burton's lack of storytelling ability and serious script problems. Although I am a fan of Mr. Burton's film style, I cannot stress enough how constantly disappointed I am with his inability to create compelling and moving films. As he excels at the visual arts, Burton lacks the talent to create films that move you in the slightest way. Sleepy Hollow, as well as many of his other films, does not leave the viewer with a feeling of anything throughout its proceeding as well as after the film is over. Literally, it is washed from your palette as soon as you leave the theater. Completely forgettable. The film does not amply supply scares, excitement, humor, romance, drama, surprises, any emotion. A good film does not need all of the previous characteristics but it should provide at least one in good supply or a clever balancing of many. Sleepy Hollow is not boring but never is it actually interesting. The Disney cartoon made many years ago was more compelling. Mr. Burton is no doubt a very talented visionary but he does not move his viewers. I like movies that compel me to watch them a second time, Sleepy Hollow makes me sad that I even watched it once. 5 out of 10. PS- Ms. Ricci's acting severely lacked something to be desired.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Don't really know what to say (long),"As usual Tim Burton has made himself a fine, worthy movie, let me just start off with that. Visually stunning, representing just what the late 1700s looked like (if it were always dark and gloomy ;)). The acting was very good and Depp did a great job in playing between the boundries of the original Crane character in that, not really a bad guy but overall just a kindof cultured sissy-boy (that's NOT a generalisation) who is just as scared as you or I but knows he has to rise to the occasion eventually anyway. In the book, Crane was always a wimp for the most part.The only thing that bugged me was that the plot as it finally really developed in the end was a bit over-dramatic, maybe too fantastic, not to the point of making it bad, I just think it drew away from an otherwise dark, disturbing and even scarier than I'd presumed, movie would be when I first saw the trailer. I liked the movie, (8/10) and then again I didn't like it for one sole reason.  If you take the movie as what it is, the movie in itself, in that, lets presume there was never the original story, then I liked it quite a lot. But me, I must admit, I'm too retentive to not be annoyed at the drastic changes between what Burton envisioned and the ""real"" story by Irving. Outside of the character names, location and their being a horseman, this movie and the original story are quite quite different.  Not a big deal really as it doesn't make this a BAD movie, again, the movie in itself I enjoyed quite a bit, but I couldn't get over, and its just my pet peeve, the differences.  Things like this always bug me so while I vent please bare with me that its just my opinion. I've never liked it when adaptations change the original story even the slightest bit, though, I can understand sometimes its done due to time, money, and dramatic effect.  I still don't like it :P, but I can understand it and I TRY not to let that ruin my enjoyment of the MOVIE.  I try to take them as two seperate entities.  But the seemingly ""needless to change"" things like the Horseman's origin (how he became headless that is), things like this bug me even more making me wonder, ""I know why the other stuff was changed but why THIS?"".  I don't know, I just don't like it when the original story is changed. But don't let that ruin the movie for you, just forget the original story, enjoy the movie, and if you can do that, you WILL enjoy the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
FOLLOW THE CHARACTERS!!!,"I've read every submitted review about this movie, and it seems the biggest quarrel everyone has is with the plot, the script, and the monologue near the end... I'm writing this in defense of all three, and hopefully giving everyone some tips on watching this cinematic masterpiece.DO NOT go into this movie thinking you can watch it passively.  It's about as complex as Cris Carter's alien conspiracy from the X-Files.  It may be as brilliant and stunning as Burton's previous movies (of which I DO include Mars Attacks, which I loved), but the line between good and evil isn't as clear-cut and it doesn't have the ""get the bad guy"" plot of his two installments of Batman.  If you quickly forget faces and names, you will get lost with ""Sleepy Hollow"" and may need the near-the-end monologue to rescue you.  If, however, you closely follow the characters and start ACTIVELY watching by trying to piece together the puzzle from the given clues, the monologue takes on a different purpose.  Listen closely to the early dialogues between Ricci and Depp about the townspeople, then watch for the similarities between Depp's flashback scenes and pieces of Ricci's childhood, and the reasoning behind the Horseman's killings should be obvious.  Then comes the monologue... and it will rip to pieces everything you were thinking.  This is sheer brilliance.  This is something of which few writers are capable.  This is the stuff of which Tim Burton movies are made.  This turnaround is what makes movies like ""Sixth Sense"", ""Diabolique"" and ""Se7en"" so good.  However, where those movies turned things around visually, ""Sleepy Hollow"" does it verbally, showing you that while Burton may have some visually stunning effects and sets, he doesn't rely on them to move the movie along.  The monologue turns the movie from what could be a tidy little Hollywood storyline into the realm of the downright twisted.So as for the reviews that dog this movie for having no plot or script, pay no attention to them.  Both elements ARE there if you're truly watching. This kind of subtelty and twisting of events is what makes for good moviemaking, and this movie is the perfect blend of excellent writing and visual effects.  But remember... FOLLOW THE CHARACTERS CLOSELY!!!  Don't forget their relation to the other characters or the story in general, and be sure to soak in EVERYTHING that is said and seen.  If you do, you'll see it is easily the best movie of the year.  10/10 stars! -Eric",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
One of Burton's Finest Works,"The more I see it, the more I like it.""Sleepy Hollow"" is one of the most visually beautiful (and bloodiest for Burton) films that I have seen this year.  It's dark, moody look almost seems like a black and white film that only has a few splashes (which in some ways, ""splashes"" is very accurate) of color throughout.  Danny Elfman has provided yet another wonderful score, and sets the tone of the film perfectly.Without a doubt, Johnny Depp's performance makes the movie.  He's arrogant, eccentric, intelligent... and a bit cowardly and squeamish.  He's not the typical ""hero"" that you find in so many films (although he does fall into the definition a few times), and his performance is both comical and memorable.  Great uses of humor through the film to counteract the scary scenes.A great cast rounds out this film with plenty of cameos from Burton's past films to his own personal favorites.  Initially, I wasn't sure what to think of Casper Van Dien, because every time I see him, all I think of is ""Starship Troopers"".  Regardless, he pulled off the character of Brom well.I liked the mystery of this.  A lot of reviews have criticized the story as being weak, but the mystery was large, and all of the loose ends were resolved.  It's actually pretty impressive despite the complex plot twists thrown about.Tim Burton's movies always have that ring of nostalgia or high camp.  The references to the Disney short were undeniable, as was the seeming ""bat wings"" behind Christopher Lee.  Burton is so underappreciated as a director.This is an excellent ""Burton fan"" film, or for anyone who likes a good horror story.  For Burton, it ranks up with my personal favorites such as ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" or ""Edward Scissorhands"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"""Crafted with passion.""","Tim Burton really is one of the most important fantasy film makers of our time. He crafts his films with a passion that is absent from most other contemporary directors. Many modern day movies are addled with special effects and little else, but Burton has shown in films such as Ed Wood and in Sleepy Hollow that he is a good old-fashioned story teller who loves his art.Sleepy Hollow (based on the story by Washington Irving) is set in New York in 1799 and tales the story of the forward thinking Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) who is sneered at by his colleagues because of his advanced techniques in detecting how a person died by performing autopsies. Don't forget that back then when a doctor cut up a body in search of the truth, they were seen as sorcerers!. Crane is sent by the Burgomaster (Christopher Lee) to the small village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of killings in which the victims have all been ritually beheaded by what the superstitious locals believe to have been committed by a headless horseman. During the course of his investigations, Crane stumbles upon sexual deviances, old rivalries and witchcraft.Sleepy Hollow is very much in the style of the earlier Hammer films not only because it features two of Hammer's veterans in the cast, Christopher Lee as the Burgomaster and Michael Gough as Notary James Hardenbrook, but the set design by Rick Heinrichs and the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki bare all the style of that studios best films. Of course the violence is more graphic here because times have moved on since Hammer were the kings of horror. However, there is echoes of the style and poetry which make them great to watch forty years on here. There have been many rumours of Hammer making a comeback and if that did ever materialise, I think Tim Burton would make the perfect substitute for Terence Fisher as he displays some of that film makers qualities. Good characterisations, atmosphere and a welcome touch of intelligence to what in other film makers hands would of been pure sensationalist material.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
BURTON AT HIS BEST!,"SLEEPY HOLLOW is one of the most gorgous films ever...well filmed.  Using a grey for most of the film greatly sets the mood of the pic, most of it being at night.  There are several flashbacks to Ichabod Crain's childhood, and those are shot in a contrasting brighter than life colors.  Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci are magnificant, both greatly complimenting each other. the story flows very easily, and you are involved at each moment the movie runs. You are brought into the mystery of the Headless Horseman, and ultimately a quest to find out just who controls him, and to stop that person.  As soon as you decide that you know who controls him, another surprise.  this happens again and again.  the movie never stops making you think.  and you enjoy every thought.  This is definately a film that i'll be seeing again and again.  I encourage everybody to go see this film.  you will not leave disappointed.  Scary, funny, and...well it's a Burton film, so you know you are in for a treat. Burton at his best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Gothic fairytale,"If someone would ask me a good movie to introduce himself on the works of Tim Burton I would suggest him either 'Edward Sciccorhands' or this, because they both have so similar atmosphere and they show Burton doing something he's good at: Gothic fairytale for adults.'Sleepy Hollow' is stylish Gothic tale of a young inspector Ichiabod Crane (who else than Johnny Depp), who is sent to a remote village of Sleepy Hollow to find a culprit, who has decapitated 4 of the god fearing towns folk. When he arrives he learns, that the villagers believe the murderer to be no else than the Hessian Horsman (Chirstopher Walken), whose headless ghost has rose from the Hell to claim the heads of all who foolishly happen on his path. Crane's modern thinking is put to test after he learns that the case is in fact so and together with a son of one the victims Masbath (Marc Pickering) and lovely Katrina (Christina Ricci) he begins the search of the one, who has summoned the horrid hell spawn.'Sleepy Hollow' is from the better side of Tim Burtons movies: it's visually stunning, the music by his court composer Danny Elfman fits in and brings out incredible atmosphere and the actors are doing their parts all around nicely. But if you want to pick something, then the take the script, as it does indeed leave some room for improvement and there are some minor plot holes, but then again this movie isn't meant to be looked so seriously from that direction, as the plot does work in the scale it is meant to work: a fantastic, grim fairytale.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A head-chopping good time,"If a viewer goes into this movie looking for a good scare, he might be disappointed. Because the cartoony head-chopping isn't exactly scary. But if you go into it just expecting to have fun, you won't be disappointed at all. Aside from just being fun, Tim Burton makes this the coolest looking movie of the year by far.  He's come up with some great looking landscapes. Johnny Depp is at his best.  And the headless horseman is the best bad guy of the year, forget Darth Maul.  You wouldn't expect there to be much investigating for Depp's Ichabod Crane to do. I mean, it's obvious some headless dude is chopping people's heads off, but the story manages to be quite an entertaining ""Who done it?"" I'd give something away if I elaborated, so I'll leave it at that.  Burton obviously has fond feelings toward the old Disney cartoon ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"" because he throws in all kinds of little nods to the classic cartoon. He even uses frog noises that sound like ""Ichabod.""  If you like the old cartoon at all - and who doesn't ? - you need to see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Still an amazing film, though. Could be the best looking Burton film - the cinematography is beautiful and the production design is without equal. Love the way the Headless Horseman was realized - simply a perfect representation - and love the inspired casting of Christopher Walken. The story could be a bit better, but the dialogue's great with just the right amount of morbid humour and the mystery element is welcome. Add in an expected solid performance from Depp, a great ensemble cast, and a terrific Elfman score, and you've got one of Burton's top three films.

This is what Depp is trying to find out while the murders still continue.Excellent support provided by Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken who is outstanding yet again.The whole film is brilliantly made with some breathtaking cinematography, and an authentic gothic atmosphere.Although there is a lot of heads rolling the film is not very violent as it manages to keep a comic-horror look in everything.Easily the best film Burton made in years and the kind of films that only he can do.Hugely enjoyable and not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
a word from a guy who doesn't enjoy horror movies,"once again, i have travelled to the mystic world of tim burton. his creations are unique works of art, that deserve their attention, and more.sleepy hollow was in many ways the best horror film i've seen, and i was quite surprised the rating wasn't higher. note, i do not enjoy horror movies in general, because they are always about senseless violence.in 'sleepy hollow', the evil IS really evil and scary as hell, but it's more. it's a great detective murder mystery, a love story and most of all great art.the costuming, effects and cinematography are breathtaking, and burtion keeps it all together quite enjoyably indeed. oh, and not to forget the great, haunting musical score danny elfman created for the occasion.johnny depp (my favorite actor) is splended as the scary little man ichabod crane who finds surprising courage to face evil but he is nr. 2 in this movie since another great actor christopher walken is just AMAZING as the headless horseman, hats off gentlemen. walken's best performance ever. maybe because he isn't talking in this one. ;)the thing in burton's movies is, always has been and hopefully always will be, is the magic that as ichabod crane said in the movie 'has bewitched me'. the fascinating, gothic worlds burton creates are something unique, where light and dark always has tremendous difference, but they can still be upside down, not always as the viewer would expect.if you want to look for something negative about 'sleepy hollow', it's miranda richardson's not so good performance and, if there is one, i would be most interested to see the director's cut. i was left with a feeling that the movie fast forwarded to the end, which might please some of the viewers, but i wouldn't have minded a little more character developement and detective work of crane.in conclusion, a very very good magical atmospheric old school horror story. me likes!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
"Tim Burton's finest pasty skinned, overblown, Gothic moment.","I only realised that since Beetlejuice in 1988 I have seen every single full length film Tim Burton has made, but scrolling down the IMDb page today I can't say that aside from this film I found any of them especially memorable.Granted Burton has undeniable visual flair and his movies POP out of the screen, also inarguable is his willingness to experiment and try new things, I mean who else has a musical, a big budget comic book adaptation, and stop motion animation films on their resume. So while I've admired his output and will continue to check out his films he has never made anything that resonated with me like Sleepy Hollow does – and besides some of the more obvious reasons I can't explain why I like it so muchWhen Constable Icabod Crane (Burton muse Johnny Depp) is reposted (but really shuffled out of the way) to use his advanced investigation and new fangled means in detection to ascertain why the average height of the locals is reducing he obeys only as it is his duty.Upon arriving in the small town and meeting with the locals he is sat down and sombrely informed that the 3 recent victims who no longer have use for nice hats were allegedly abbreviated by a serial killer who is similarly headless, only this one rides an undead steed and tops his victims with swords, axes and scythes. The Horseman is essentially dead, so bullets and swords do little damage, he also looks a lot like Christopher Walken (in a wicked cameo) when his bonce is perched on the shoulders, and his teeth are filed into fangs for a more imposing and unnerving appearance.Now Icabod is above all a creature of logic and reasoning and all this sounds too far fetched, so his takes his Lil Sherlock bag filled with self made tools and looks into things, vowing science and analysis will do the trick.When his initial findings bring up little of substance Icabod turns to the locals and commences questioning those that might know, it seems that everyone in the quiet town has secrets and everyone is somehow related in some way by blood or marriage, but ultimately like the recently deceased he comes up short.The more senior town officials – namely the men who requested police assistance in the first place – are particularly cagy and there is much muttering and conspiring behind closed doors.Icabod is quartered in the loft of a well-to-do farmer Baltus Van Tassell and his wife Lady Van Tassell and daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci). Icabod and Katrina have a spark between them, (which seems logical, after all one is 21 Jump St and the other the only young chick in town and also someone who wears a dress so tight her cleavage is up around her ears!).When still another victim is taken Icabod takes on the newly orphaned son as his apprentice and dogsbody – and the two continue the case, often with young Katrina alongside.Before I cut descriptions of the plot short – so to speak – I must say that at one point Icabod indeed learns that the Headless Horseman is not only possible but he is perpetrating the crimes – though possibly with the guidance of others.Through the remainder of this excellent film Icabod is given cryptic messages and gradually his investigation and interpretation leads him to the truth which involves witchcraft and deeply buried local secrets.He not only discovers where the Headless Horseman ""resides"" but how he came to be in his current state, and more importantly how he selects his next victims.I believe that Sleepy Hollow was predominantly shot on one massive sound stage, which is amazing considering just how many scenes occur outdoors, including horse-and-buggy chases.The sets and costumes are all grayish and pale and the countryside forever coated in light mist – is that why Johnny Depp has such flawless skin? – all the better to highlight the garish unnatural looking red of the blood that frequently spurts and gushes, often onto Icabod himself.Being a Tim Burton film there are constant Gothic touches, odd imagery and the afore-mentioned blood, this is undoubtedly his most violent film too (Sweeney Todd is runner-up), aside from the frequent and graphic decapitations citizens are impaled and severed in half.As I mentioned earlier Sleepy Hollow has all the base elements that make up a Tim Burton film so we know it will at least be interesting and a visual treat, but Sleepy Hollow goes a couple steps beyond the normal Burton effort, as well as the everpresent Johnny Depp, the formal sounding dialogue, the amazing visuals and the attention to detail this one has a reasonably effective plot even with an undead assassin and witchery.It is the story that often gets set aside in Burton's flicks to make room for more odd antics and intricate visuals, Sleepy Hollow though has a plot that keeps you interested in more than what you are seeing, so even if this looked banal and flat it would still be worth watching – the fact that the story is aligned with a Burton production elevates Sleepy Hollow above all other Tim Burton efforts.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. The stars finally align for Tim Burton, at last a film that looks great but is backed up by performances and plot comparable to the backdrop.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
It's Tim Burton allright!!!!!,"This is a creepy, dark, yet strange fantasy / horror flick in the likes of well Tim Burton. Only he could make this the creepy fairytale it has become.

By the way, another comment on Ricci, I like what she does, always playing unusual female characters.The supporting cast is good too, as is the music the decoration, the blood, the story and of course the Headless Horseman (note: THE HEADLESS ONE).

"Gruesome, Atmospheric, and Darkly Comic.","I saw this film a few Thanksgivings back, and I thought it was an excellent piece of cinema. After recently rewatching it, my feelings are still the same. ""Sleepy Hollow"" revolves around the quirky Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), who is sent to the small secluded village of Sleepy Hollow, New York, that is living in fear after a series of brutal slayings by a supposed supernatural figure, the Headless Horseman. An investigator and attorney, Ichabod is skeptical about the horseman. When arriving at the small colonial village, he stays with the wealthiest family in town - the Van Tassels, who have a lengthy legacy behind them. He is soon 'bewitched' by the Van Tassels daughter, Katrina (Christina Ricci), and begins to have his own experiences with the headless horseman - convincing him that the horseman is no myth, and is actually the one responsible for the series of beheadings. But there is a little more to the Horseman than the townspeople know of, and it's up to him to find out.The strongest element of this film by a long shot is the beautiful imagery. The small village, the woods surrounding it, and all the scenery is breathtaking - it looks like it came straight out of a fairytale. The village is dark and foggy, and the woods are very desolate with twisted, leaf-less trees. This sets up a very strong atmosphere, and the film takes place during the Thanksgiving/fall season, so that is another addition to film's overall feel. The special effects are also great, the supernatural Headless Horseman is very creepy, and the beheadings and deaths in the film are both convincing and grim. Everything Tim Burton does is with style, and he shows it off a lot in this movie. The plot is derived from ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" by Washington Irving, a classic American tale. Those who are familiar with the old Disney cartoon version of the ""Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman"" will want to beware of this film, because it is much more violent and gruesome than the tame, children's cartoon, and there are some very neat spins put on the story to make it a much more dark, evil-themed film.The performances in the film are perfect - Johnny Depp plays the squeamish Ichabod with both seriousness and comedy. In fact, the film does include a lot of comic undertones and some flat-out funny scenes involving his character, that contrast with the bloody carnage that is taking place. Christina Ricci plays Katrina very well herself, she's innocent but mysterious, and has good chemistry with the Ichabod character. Behind the two leads are Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson, playing the Van Tassels, Casper Van Dien as Brom - a macho guy who is trying to woo Katrina, and Christopher Walken as the Headless horseman, in life of course.Bottom line - ""Sleepy Hollow"" is an excellent film. It's both scary and darkly comic at the same time, with a very well-written story and good performances. If you're considering seeing this film, do. If not for the story itself, the imagery and scenery are reason enough. But expect something much more grim and violent than the Disney cartoon. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
It's a good one!,"Well, I finally got to see ""Sleepy Hollow"" after being so excited to see it for so long, and I wasn't disappointed.  Okay, so I figured I was going to get scared, and I wasn't, but it was still a ton of fun and very exciting. And how about those crazy decapitations?!  Tim Burton is an amazing visual storyteller, and this movie is perfect for him.  Nobody could do Sleepy Hollow better than him, and Johnny Depp was just great.  This is going to have to become a Thanksgiving tradition!  What a good time at the movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Amazing!!,I loved this movie!  Johnny Depp was incredible as usual. The visual effects were astounding as was the movie itself.  Tim Burton did wonders with this by putting a new twist to the tale!  See it if you haven't already!,10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Not bad at all...,"With the credit ""Directed by Tim Burton"" on the film, its easy for it to get much hype. I myself bought into the hype, and to say that I wasn't a little disappointed would be a lie.But nevertheless, this was by no means a bad movie. I was, in fact, everything it was meant to be: FUN. And fun it was.From the very beginning to the very end, you will witness heads spinning, rolling, and flying through the air with the whif of the horseman's sword. Tim Burton definately has fun with this, and really does a good job of turning it into some pretty horrific scenes.The film also had great cinematography, incredible set design, an amazing musical score, and...oh yeah...some pretty freakin' cool special effects. The acting was so so, as Johnny Depp doesn't really know how to make his character a hero, Christina Ricci was good, and so was everyone else. That also includes Christopher Walken, who plays the horseman with a head. He has no lines but just by looking at him he really puts the fear of god in your heart.So Tim Burton does it again. His goriest, weirdest, goriest, action-filled, goriest, scariest, and goriest movie to date. Did I mention that it was pretty gory? Oh, well, that's okay. If you're not of the faint of heart. So if you're not, and Tim Burton is your kind style, go see this movie and have fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"

Simply a masterpiece,"Tim Burton has gone and done it. He's gone and retold one of the most famous pieces of American folklore ever written. This was an amazing undertaking, and Burton pulls it off Oscar worthy. this is Burton{a personal fav of mine}'s most amazing piece of work film wise. He has turned the world of Sleepy Hollow into a dream world with the use of amazing sets and fog and everything. Washington Irving would disagree with the plot, but he will have trouble denying that Burton has created the look for Sleepy Hollow he envisioned when he wrote it. The film will win the cinematography award. Plot-wise and everything wise, this film ranks up with Burton's other masterpiece, Batman. Not many directors can have 2 masterpieces in their life time. Burton has a t least 2. No one could have handled this film and done it justice. Burton has done it with flying colors. Bravo. Give us more, Tim.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Burton's best{tying with Batman},"Not many directors can hit the Masterpiece mark more then once in their career. Not many hit it at all. So its even more amazing that a director hits it more then once. Burton has done that with this film. It is the most atmospheric and beautifully filmed movie I've ever seen. And the plot, while very confusing, is still understandable as long as one pays attention. Many have called the plot swiss cheese. Those tend to be those who can't understand. Sleepy Hollow, like Burton's other best{Batman and Edward Scissorhands} captures the imagination more effectively then most other directors. Burton is the Steven Spielberg of the macabre and unusual. He's a director of such brilliance. He knows exactly how it should look sound, and how it will work on a audience. Burton's look for Sleepy Hollow is as close to perfection as possible.Washington Irving may argue with the plot, but he can't deny that Burton has created the most eerie and amazing vision of Sleepy Hollow possible. Johnny Depp is excellent here. He gives Ichabod Crane so many levels that one really can't predict where he's going next. Christina Ricci is quite good as well. Casper Van Dien is actually quite good, of course he doesn't talk that much. His accent isn't bad. If you haven't heard who plays the Horsemen with a head, then I am not going to reveal it here. I will say this:It's quite an excellent choice, even if its kind of under done at times. This film is excellent. Honestly, its joined my top ten, tying with Batman as Burton's best 10/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
This Movie is HORRIBLE,"I didn't find this movie creepy, funny, exciting, or really that entertaining.  The acting in my opinion wasn't that good, the story was boring at times, and the movie wasn't creepy or scary at all.  I simply did not find this movie very entertaining.  And was I the only person who was under the impression that this was supposed to be a scary movie?  One of the only saving graces of this movie was its cinematography, which I thought was done extremely well.  But it wasn't enough to raise my vote too much, 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Visually stunning,"Tim Burton has weaved a nightmarish film out of the old Sleepy Hollow tale. Dead trees reaching toward a eternally grey sky.  A fog that hangs around the town like a shroud, and a population that keeps their secrets.   Into this macarbe atmosphere comes Ichabod Crane, dispatched from New York to find out who is behind the slayings of three towns people. Ichabod thinks the murders to be committed by a human, but he soon learns otherwise when the Horseman comes.  The Headless Horseman is a nightmare vision himself. Dressed in dark clothes and riding a horse of the same color, he charges at his victims with lightning speed and with one well placed cut: off comes their heads!   Burton keeps the gore to a minimum, but raises the intensity level of the film so that your heart will quicken.  Of course, a Tim Burton film isn't complete without a Danny Elfman score and we get a fast, furious and ethereal score to compliment the images on screen.  Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Ichabod, and Christina Ricci is the ray of light in this gloomy little town.   Heads do roll in this film.  Beware.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
The face of horror,"Has anyone else noticed, or is it just me ? Horror movies or movies where ""things go bump in the dark"" are becoming the best comedy movies. Perhaps, this modern phenomenon dates back to Evil Dead but Tim Burton understands the genre perfectly. The movie is crafted as clinically as the Headless Horseman's precision in decapitations and with such aplomb. Thud !The casting is perfect from the New York flatfoot, Johnny Depp to the cameo role of the Horseman's early victim, Martin Landau. Set in 1799, nice millennial touch, New York and New England are fantastically portrayed. And the woods of Sleepy Hollow are not the kind of place where anyone would want to go for a picnic.So who or what is the Headless Horseman, who will be the next victim, what is the conspiracy, can the Horseman be stopped ? These are questions put to the audience and it is a great fun finding out the answers of this exciting Gothic mystery.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Spooky!,"I've just seen this movie,and recommend it to anyone who likes Tim Burton's films - with their Gothic character (Mars Attacks!;Batman, Batman Returns, etc).Johnny Depp is ideal as young Ichabod Crane, cast here as a police constable, with great faith in use of reason and detection; wavering with moments of terror, but brave overall.The Headless (Hessian) Horseman is played by Christopher Walken (with head)and by Ray Park (without head) to great effect.The whole movie is well-acted and has a sinister, gloomy atmosphere which is quite impressive; a blend of science and supernatural.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
Not Irving's Story,"I am a great fan of Washington Irving's classic scary story, but I was surprised to see that it was being made into a full-length movie, because the actual book is under 150 pages. Watching it, I expected to see a timid, superstitious schoolmaster named Ichabod Crane. However, I am displeased to find it is a constable sent from New York to investigate murders. This is simply laughable. Johnny Depp's performance was mediocre; it was simply Jack Sparrow in 17th century New York. However, this movie did have some good parts. First off, the setting and set creation was extraordinary. The eerily creepy Sleepy Hollow was exactly the way Washington Irving imagined it. The costumes were great. And although I do hate Kevin Yagher for ruining the plot of the story, the dialogue was believable and well-written. Tim Burton did not disappoint with his direction, although some scenes could have been better. All in all, if you are a fan of the book, you will not be seeing the original story. Just a terrible rip-off involving a legendary character, the Headless Horseman (who looked incredible).",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
A True Tim Burton Experience,"The moment I heard about this film when it began production I was thrilled. In my opinion Tim Burton is one of the most creative filmmakers ever.  I wasn't sure if this was going to be like the Disney cartoon or a real horror picture.  Well, horror film it is, and what a beautiful one too. Everything was impressive: the actors, the editing, the art direction, the soundetc.  What impressed me the most was the cinematography work by Emmanuel Lubezki, who also did ""A Little Princess"".  With his work and the dark, dreary art direction topped of with Danny Elfman's impressive score, you have a classic horror film.  Tim Burton really showed off his usual trademark of graves, decaying buildings and misty forests.  I won't give anything away but probably my favorite scenes are the nightmares that Ichabob Crane keeps having.  Those were truly frightnening.  Tim Burton you've done it again, and I can't wait for your next film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
The Best Horror Movie Ever!!!,"Lately, there has been no good horror movies. All the so called horror movies have had basicly no story, and bad teenage caracters who really suck at acting. OK, watching one or two of them might be ok but after a while they are all the same. So as I walked around the video store I looked at movie after movie but there was nothing that really appealed to me. But then on the top shelf there was Sleepy Hollow, it looked different from all the other horror movies so i hired it. That Day I sat doun to watch it and it keept me intrigued the whole movie. Even though it probley wasnt the most realistic movie, I didnt laugh or comment onece that there was somthing stupid or unrealistic about this movie. Thats because the movie was so wel l made that it made you belive that there could be a headless horseman for that houre and a half when you watch this movieWell any way the movie starts of when Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to Sleepy hollow to investigate three murders that have occurred over the last fortnight all three victoms were decapitated. When he gets there more people get decapitated and the people in the toun belive it is the headless horseman. But Constable Ichabod Crane dose not belive them untill he sees the horseman with his own eyes. Now with the help of Katrina Anne Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) and Young Masbath (Marc Pickering) he must find out who controls the headless horseman and in what significant order the horsman is killing in!You may ask me why I think this is the best horror movie ever, well because it has a great story line, its got great actors and its the most intriguing horror movie I have seen. Overall I'll give it 10/10!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
I've seen the Hollow! ...and I like it!,"Tim Burton = Genius!Although I wouldn't call this the best film of all time, there ought to be a special Oscar award for Burton alone! Every film he directs is like a peak into his mind... and what a wonderfully warped mind it is!1. It's visually enchanting. You can't help but be drawn into the fantastic realm of the Headless Horseman. Is he real? see the movie!2. The story-line seemed somewhat disjointed at times, but the pace of action justified every innuendo. It all came together in the end. Remember folks, this is fantasy! Let loose!3. I was impressed with Christina Ricci's performance. I actually expected her over do the part; but she does quite the reverse. I sensed a constant downplaying of her character. Whether that was intended on her part, or the director's... or Depp's... I don't really care. She was convincing enough for me to conclude that she's honing her skills for better roles. Johnny Depp has a unique way of taking on odd roles. His portrayal of ""Constable"" Ichabod Crane seemed to be a combination of characters from Edward Scissor Hands, Ed Wood, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and 21 Jump Street. I wouldn't call it an Oscar performance either, but he's certainly entertaining to watch. I think he will one day receive an Oscar for a serious performance, but this isn't it. The supporting actors are quite interesting to look at... many of them are Burton contemporaries. If you're a fan of the psychoactive monsieur Tim, you're bound to recognised many of the cast. (Martin Landau; Christopher Lee; Miranda Richardson [excellent]; Jeffrey Jones; and Christopher Walken to name a few) For all the Star Wars buffs, I should add that Ray Park (Darth Maul) is one of the stuntmen for the headless Hessian!Verdict: I would recommend this film to anyone who doesn't mind a little bit of gore (lopping heads), a great deal of visual fantasia, and enough artistic license to create a sense of freshness to the original tale. (Many respects to Washington Irving) I will purchase this film when it's released on VHS or DVD format!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
I liked Disney's version better,"I'm a fan of Tim Burton's.  I really enjoyed his work in ""Ed Wood"" (a very underrated film) ""Edward Scissorhands"" and most of his others.  While I liked this film, I don't think it was his best work.The same goes for Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, whom I feel to be two of the most talented actors in film today.  (Note:  Ricci has really become a very beautiful woman).The gore was a little thick in this movie and the strays from the original masterpiece work of Irving were too many.  The volume in the theatre was also a little loud for me (but that's not Burton's fault).I did get a number of chuckles, though.  If you watch this film, go into it expecting to laugh more than anything.  It is a very wicked black comedy.But I'd take the animated Disney masterpiece over this one if you're interested in seeing a good retelling of ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
BURTON DOES IT AGAIN!,"Sleepy Hollow rocked!  I think that Christina Ricci did a wonderful job as Katrina Van Tassel.  I also think that Johnny Deep made a good constible Crane, but his character was kind of a scardy cat so to speak (but I guess that it's important to stick to Washington Irving's tale as well as possible).  All in all I think that Sleepy Hollow deserves at least a 9 for a rating!",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Horror, Mystery"
