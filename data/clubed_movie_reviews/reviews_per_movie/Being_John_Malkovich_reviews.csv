Wildly Imaginative Surreal Masterwork That Pushes The Limits Of Storytelling,"Charlie Kaufman (script) and Spike Jonze (director) burst on the scene together with their collaboration on this crazy masterpiece. 'Being John Malkovich' pushes the limits of storytelling; this wildly imaginative film shows that even the most surreal storyline can still be made entertaining if a filmmaker doesn't care about conventions and knows just what the medium is capable of. Perhaps the most original release in a year that had several very original releases ('Fight Club' and 'The Matrix' were both also released in '99), the film's playful creative energy had an effect on screenwriters, directors, actors and producers that can hardly be overstated. There had simply never been anything like it - and one only has to look at a contemporary TV show like 'Legion' to see what a mark this film left. Groundbreaking and simply inspired. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
strange and compelling,"Unemployed puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) and animal lover Lotte Schwartz (Cameron Diaz) are in a loveless marriage. Craig gets a job on the low ceiling 7½ floor of a Manhattan office building. He falls for alluring fellow worker Maxine Lund (Catherine Keener) who doesn't return the feelings. He finds a doorway in his office that leads into the mind of John Malkovich. After 15 minutes, the person is ejected into a ditch on the New Jersey Turnpike. Maxine decides to sell tickets at $200 a pop. Lotte is completely changed by the experience and thinks she's a transsexual. Craig's boss Dr. Lester is obsessed with Malkovich.This is one of the strangest and most compelling ideas ever put on the screen written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze. It is exciting that everything and everyone is a little off in this movie. Cameron Diaz is ugly. John Cusack is disheveled. Catherine Keener is a sex goddess. The whole movie is off its axis and so much the better for it. It's so weird that it's a lot of fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Three who deserved one another,"I give my nine points for originality and the quality of production though, not the likeability of the characters. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz play Craig and Lotte Schwartz, a married couple that are going through the motions and don't seem to realize it. Cameron Diaz is made up to be so dowdy looking that she is initially not even recognizable. They live in a basement apartment crowded with animals (Lotte is an animal lover who works at a pet shop). Craig is a puppeteer who cannot find work in his chosen field and even gets beat up on the street for staging what one beefy dad thinks is a sacrilegious puppet show.At the suggestion of his wife, Craig goes looking for a regular job, and due to his fast hands he gets a job as a file clerk at LesterCorp. There he meets Maxine, a pretty but sociopathic young woman who, fortunately for society, seems to have no violent impulses, because if she did believe me she would follow them. Craig falls for her. Lotte falls for her. And they both make a play for her simultaneously when she comes over for dinner one night. She rejects them both.Maxine made it clear from the beginning she considered Craig a pathetic loser, but she needs him to exploit something that Craig discovered - a door that leads to a portal in which anybody who enters gets to ""become"" John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. At the end of the fifteen minutes the person is spit out on the side of the road at the entry to the New Jersey Turnpike. As a team they reopen Lestercorp at night and charge people 200 dollars apiece to ""become John Malkovich"". Neither of them knows what this portal is doing there behind a file cabinet and why it leads to Malkovich, but they initially don't care past its monetary value.It is part drama, part comedy, and even part horror and completely weird. And what the portal is doing there is all wrapped up in Dr. Lester, owner of Lestercorp, who is the only likeable character in the film, and even he has more than a bit of a Dr. Frankenstein/God complex.Also featuring Mary Kay Place as the object of Dr. Lester's lust who has convinced him he has a terrible speech impediment - he does not, John Malkovich as himself, and Charlie Sheen as himself and Malkovich's friend. It is great seeing Charlie Sheen when he was still healthy.Very highly recommended. But the plot is so weird you just have to let go of your reason and go with it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I want to be John Malkovich.,"This film was absolutely incredible. Attempting to explain the plot in any way that would do it justice would be an excercise in futility, but let it be said that I see many, many movies, and in my lifetime, I have never seen a movie such as Being John Malkovitch.The acting is completely brilliant .. Cameron Diaz is nearly unrecognizable, both in behavior and appearance, as is John Cusack. John Malkovich was presented with an interesting opportunity in playing himself, and he seems to have seized the opportunity with relish.  He is most definitely not being himself in front of the camera, but instead creates this wonderful character of John Malkovich the vessel.I've admired Spike Jonez's work for a good long time, and I'm pleased to say that in his first full length feature as a director, he succeeds with flying colors in creating an original, beautiful, humorous, and good natured picture.See Being John Malkovich, because come Oscar time, you're going to want to know why its winning!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Meet you in Malkovich in one hour""","Being John Malkovich (1999), the Spike Jonze's directorial debut, is an amazing film - hip, inventive, delightfully weird, incredibly funny and disturbingly serious with the gleefully absurd plot twists. Let's face it, that was a stroke of genius - to throw together the tragic medieval lovers, Abelard and Heloise in the street show created by a talented puppeteer Craig Scwartzh (John Cusack) with the nimble fingers but out of work in ""today's wintry economic climate"", Elijah the Chimp with the mental problems that go back to his childhood, the surreal office that is located on the 7 1/2 store of a New York City office building and a floor is four feet high. Add Cameron Diaz (Craig's animals loving wife Lotte), completely unrecognizable, aging and balding Charlie Sheen, cynical and practical Maxine (Catherine Keener), who had an unique experience of having two people looked at her ""with complete lust and devotion, through the same pair of eyes"", and send them all to the wild ride inside the famous and respectable actor John Malkovich's brain to see what he sees and to feel what he feels, to the trip that would last 15 minutes and end up in a ditch on the side of New Jersey Turnpike.This is just the beginning...Oh, and what John Horatio Malkovich feels with all the travelers in his head and what he sees when he enters the portal to his own brain, you have to find out for yourself! What drug were Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze on?! Not even two hours long, the movie never ceases to surprise and entertain. ""Being John Malkovich"" is a fascinating and truly original film which I love and always enjoy watching even if there were never a connection with any of its characters (with the exception of Abelard and Heloise and Elijah the Chimp).",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A gem resulting of an unexpected mix of Twilight zone and The Monty Python,"This film is excellently made and based on an imaginative, intelligent and wacky script: a depressive puppeteer discovers by chance a mysterious portal in his five-foot tall office located on the 7,5th floor of a Manhattan office building, leading within the head of the movie star John Malkovich. The cast is excellent and the actors co-exist in perfect symbiosis, literally as well as figuratively. The quintet John Cusack + Cameron Diaz + Orson Bean + Catherine Keener + John Malkovich is awesome.A not exhaustive list of my favorite quotes: Meet you in Malkovich in one hour. The truth is for suckers, Johnny boy. Let's have sex on his table and then make him eat an omelette off of it. I comes before U. You don't know how lucky you are being a monkey, because consciousness is a terrible curse. There is truth, and there are lies, and art always tells the truth, even when it's lying. She's got her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. It's the idea of being inside someone else's skin and seeing what they see and feeling what they feel.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
'Consciousness is a terrible curse'...,"... but without it you'd be unconscious or you wouldn't be you, or are you, you? Exploring identity, appearance, choice and fame in the most original and entertaining of ways, this esoterically amusing vision of what makes us who we are manages to keep you engaged and amused while encouraging a little self reflection upon completion - that is if it is you doing the reflecting, pulling your own strings, grinding your own organ, dancing to your own tune.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Being John Malkovich is a Wild Ride,"This has been a great year for alternate realities at the movies. Films like The Matrix, Sixth Sense, Blair Witch Project, Thirteenth Floor, and Run, Lola, Run have all, in different ways, played with the line that separates past from present, reality from simulation, and truth from fiction. Being John Malkovich can be added to this list of innovative films that a recent issue of Entertainment Weekly described as the first films of the 21st century.There is little in this film that is formula. John Cusack plays a gifted puppeteer who aspires to be one of the world's great puppeteers. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of job openings for puppeteers so he is reduced to street theater where he is clearly underappreciated. An almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz plays Cusack's wife, a pet lover who is just a little quirky. When Cusack decides to take a job as a file clerk on floor 7.5 of an office building, life becomes even weirder. Cusack discovers an opening behind a file cabinet, a little door that leads into a tunnel. Like the characters in C.S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, (or Alice Through the Looking Glass), Cusack jumps in and finds himself in an alternative universe. Instead of Narnia or Wonderland, Cusack finds himself on a 15-minute ride inside actor John Malkovich (played quite capably by . . . John Malkovich).Cusack joins forces with a co-worker to create a business. For $200 people can spend 15 minutes inside of John Malkovich's head, seeing the world through his eyes. Since this is even better than Real World or a WebCam show, people come in droves. Eventually, Malkovich himself discovers what's going on and jumps the line to go inside of his own mind. This leads to what has to be one of the more unique scenes in the history of film. 
The story takes on an even more interesting twist when Cusack finds a unique way to fulfill his lifelong dream of being the world's greatest puppeteer.This is one weird film--and I've left out some of the weird. This is also one of the most creative films I have seen, and the film raises interesting questions about consciousness, identity, love and meaning. There are great performances here by Cusack, Diaz, Malkovich, and Catherine Keener (Cusack's co-worker and eventual love interest). The real star of the show, however, is the story itself. First-time screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has crafted an interesting and innovative story. First-time director Spike Jonze handles the material extremely well. This is clearly not a film for all tastes, and the language and sexual scenes may well offend. This is, however, something that is very rare, in Hollywood--innovative, creative, and thought provoking. Watch for this film during the Oscar nominations. If this doesn't get nominated for screenplay--at least--I will hang up my trophy.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Weird and original does not make for a great film,"This is one film that has me completely torn.  On the one hand there is so much to admire about Being John Malkovich.  The film is rich with great performances, it is directed very well by a new comer, it is a wonderfully original idea and seeing John Malcovich have the guts to portray himself, or to parody himself is quite amazing.  But on the other hand there is much to critisize about this movie.  It is slow, it doesn't really have a point and the only metaphors that I can get from the film are not clear or really that mind blowing, and the last half an hour of the film is plain and simply-----bad.  I really think that this is the type of film that cannot fail critically, critics are too afraid to tell it like it is when it comes to an ""arty"" film like this one.  It is safe and obvious to critisize a film like Armageddon or Bone Collector but admitting that you didn't really enjoy a film such as this is tricky as a critic because you may look foolish to your cronies so naturally all of them come out and tell you how wonderful and amazing and great and ya da ya da ya da this film is.  But the one thing that I noticed when I read all of the reviews before I saw the film is that not one review really told me why this film is all that they say it is, and that is because it isn't.  As I said, there is much to ""admire"" about Being John Malkovich, just not a lot to like.  But I will tell you what is good before I tell you what isn't.The performances are incredible.  John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Katherine Keener and John Malkovich turn in stellar portrayals of who they are. Cusack is the eccentric puppeteer that can't seem to get a break in life, Diaz is his repressed wife that perhaps only a few years ago would have been not just smart but down right gorgeous.  Now she doesn't care about herself, only her animals that she cares for which includes a repressed monkey.  She goes through one of the biggest awakenings.  Keener plays Maxine, a sexy bitch that Cusack falls in lust for and then love.  She is a bit of an enigma yet she is very self assured.  And of course Malkovich plays a version of himself, perhaps a version that we, the public think he is.  All four of these performances are rich and deeply layered.  The story is also good in the sense that it is different than anything I have seen.  It is fresh and nice at times to see a movie that is different than anything you have seen before.  This is one of those movies, and I enjoyed it for that reason.  But that is where my praise ends.  That is all that I can really say is good about the film.  While the film has it's moments of comedy and of interesting observations about life ( the big one being not to live vicariously through someone else or you may lose your identity ) it just didn't keep me interested or entertained for the majority of the film and especially for the last half hour.  And for me to really enjoy a film and to think it is worth recommending to others, there has to be something to keep my interest.  This film just moves along and seems to go nowhere.  It doesn't have anything really great to say and it doesn't really take you anywhere.  As I said, sure it is different, but that does not make it good. I do have a feeling that this film is going to get a rediculous amount of mention at Oscar time, but that is not fair.  There are at least five films that I think are worthy of Oscar mention before this one, and other bound to be great films haven't even come out yet ( The Green Mile just to name one ).I think perhaps this is a film that should be seen once because maybe what I get or didn't get out of it is completely different than what someone else will.  After all there are many positive reviews in this very forum and perhaps that is saying something, but I personally don't like the film all that much and I think there are many films at the theater that are worth your time more than this one is.  If you see it, don't say you haven't been warned.  This is one film that I think the general public is wrong about and the longer it stays out, the more people will have a chance to see it and then people will realize that weird and original does make it great.  It deserves kudos for being like that but not praise.  There is a difference.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"One of the most unique, imaginative movies ever made. **** out of ****","BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (1999) ****Starring: John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Orson Bean, Catherine Keener, John Malkovich, and Charlie Sheen Director: Spike Jonze   Running Time: 113 minutes   Rated R (for sexuality and language)By Blake French:It is not every day that I use words in my movie reviews such as unique, creative, inventive, imaginative, original, fresh, mesmerizing, and unmatched. Under the circumstances of ""Being John Malkovich,"" a wonderfully hilarious presentation of an incomprehensible idea, I find myself using every one of those phrases and then some more being deserved. Everything about it is labyrinthine, intriguing, and very funny. It is one of the years best films, and should be well presented come Academy Award time.""Being John Malkovich"" details the relationship between Craig and Lotte Schwartz. They basically live an old fashioned life in a small apartment with a miniature zoo of pets and a puppet factory inside. Lotte is a typical, unattractive homemaker while Craig holds that unusual occupation of being a professional puppeteer. Desperately searching for employment, Craig soon visits a business for an interview as a filer when he discovers for some odd reason the construction of the office floor is all but several feet tall, forcing all employees to bend over backwards just to walk around.One of those employees is named Maxine, a highly seductive co-worker of Craig's. When he asks her out for a beer one night, Craig experiences lustful thoughts about her, and nearly begins an affair as his seemingly loving wife wonders around her happy little apartment all by herself.As you can see, the household isn't exactly a joyful situation. All things change, from blossoming sexual confusion to inner self-esteem, when Craig uncovers a small door behind a filing cabinet in his office. It is tucked away, hidden acutely well in a dark corner, which is found mysteriously by accident when Craig droops a paper behind the cabinet. After Craig explores this deep miniature, seemingly endless hallway, he discovers this secret door leads to the brain of actor John Malkovich for fifteen minutes, then spits you out along the roadside afterwards.Wow, sounds like ""Alice in Wonderland,"" doesn't it...well, sort of.  Craig first tells his co-worker about his discovery, who continues to think he's nuts. Then, after explaining and showing this portal to his wife, who is hysterical, Maxine begins to believe Craig, and concoct a devilish idea. To sell tickets allowing a pedestrian to enter the mind of a famous celebrity. The tagline: Ever wanted to be someone else? Now you can.It is very intriguing how the narrative point of view is juggled between Craig and then Lotte after the problem is introduced and then solved: the couples dead-end lives are lifted in glory. This creates a second conflict moving us smoothly into the second act. Perfect internal problems are created with the two female leads; Lotte and Maxine find themselves physically attracted to each other in unbelievable character twists. The two end up having a femininity sexual relationship while one is entrapped in the mind of Malkovich, and the other experiences the actual Malkovich. It is a beautifully crafted structure, with act breaks so clear and complications so faultless it is no wonder while this is such an effective picture.Also first rate here are the performances. Although the film offers strange types of roles for these actors to indulge themselves in, they do a wonderfully energetic job. Cameron Diaz is flawlessly cast as Craig's sexually and mentally uncoordinated wife, and delivers us a comically riotous character. John Cusack as Craig himself is superior and believable as a down on his luck puppeteer, and possesses a perfect blend of humor and unpredictable qualities with his character. Also quite good here, John Malkovich, who has much more of a difficult role than one would think. He has some hard scenes where Craig controls him while inside his mind, which requires great skill to perform.However, better than any performance, and more amazing then any flawless characters or plot, is the concept of a human being thinking up such an absurd idea as the imagination behind the beauty of ""Being John Malkovich."" With such a penetrating, magical atmosphere to it, it is kind of a shame that the filmmakers created this film in the form of a black comedy instead of something more harrowing. Although comedy is simply the most logical choice to categorize this type of film, wouldn't it have been interesting to see this movie as a drama, or perhaps as a spiritual awakening picture.Regardless, the film still has an oddly powerful message to it, which I will not, nor do I ever directly reveal in any of my reviews. You see, since different individuals come from different backgrounds, and thus see things differently. It is because of this that I do not allow my personal take on a message persuade another filmgoer whose idea of a moral may be much different than my own. But I will say that ""Being John Malkovich"" might not overtake the box office, but for appreciative movie patrons, this one is sure to be treasured for a long time to come.Brought to you by Gramercy Pictures.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Highly original concept, though a bit formulaic at the end","This is definitely one of the more bizarre films I've seen.  You probably know the story by now.  A bland, unimportant man with a passion for puppets (Craig) finds himself lusting for a selfish cynical female coworker(Maxine), who pays him no mind until he finds something she thinks can be of use to her:  a door which takes people into the mind of John Malkovich.  For fifteen minutes,  someone can see, hear, smell, taste, and most importantly feel everything the actor experiences.  Problems arise,  however,  when Craig's wife (Lotte) becomes addicted to the experience,  and the way it allows her to actualize her desire to have the same woman her husband wants, even if only while being John Malkovich.The atmosphere is bleak,  but befitting what ends up being such a bleak tale.  The movie presents the surreal and supernatural as existing rather matter of factly and characters never seem to question the existence or plausibility of the portal.  But, this isn't a movie trying to pass itself off as reality anyway.  It becomes a somewhat intense character study early on,  and the director chose (wisely I think) not to waste time trying to validate the existence of the door into Malkovich's head.  The characters all give excellent and convincing portrayals of highly dysfunctional people. John Malkovich,  while he spends very little time onscreen as himself,  is fascinating to watch being controlled and manipulated by others.  In the end,  he is someone nobody ultimately is concerned with.  Everyone simply wants to take what it is they desire for themselves through the use of him regardless of his own feelings.  And, in that way,  everyone displays a strange obliviousness to being John Malkovich.My biggest complaint with the film is that rather than making some obvious philosophical statements on the nature of being and consciousness which could have easily been put forth by the existence of the portal,  it instead seems to concentrate on merely relating the tale of the most bizarre love triangle you'll ever witness.  That it does very well and in an engaging manner,  but the possibilities of the portal still seem strangely unexplored in the end.  Perhaps,  however,  whatever message is trying to be conveyed is wrapped up in the story itself.  I am certain the movie is full of symbolic imagery and actions that will take some time to digest.If you want to experience an almost surreal movie that will stick with you for some time, this is probably a good pick.  If you don't like movies where the implausible and fantastic is accepted without question,  however,  it's probably not going to appeal to you.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's Out And There's Nothing Like It,"Being John Malkovich leaves you astounded. What happened in that dark theater? Twist and turn, one thing more fantastical than the next, this movie is 100 % UNIQUE. Even the introduction and the setting of the film are outlandish to say the least. The movie develops quickly, plummetting viewers into the warped world it creates; while the surroundings are strange, they are presented without leaving the audience convinced and I found that my questions about Malkovich's mysterious portal, such as ""What happens if John Malkovich goes into his own portal?"", were answered.The directoral work in John Malkovich is quite interested at times as well. Seeing the world through John Malkovich's eyes is not an easy feat to accomplish, but is done tactfully.However, it is the interactions between the characters that fortifies this film. Cuscack, completely smitten by Catherine Keener's character, finds that his love is unrequited. There are more twists in this story, but that's for you to find out, now isn't it?

Surrealistic Truman Show with absurd humor,"People either rate it as a masterpiece or a garbage. So I'll give you a more useful review that's not tainted with too much emotion.This movie is an absurd comedy. And absurd comedy is like grapefruit - if you're expecting the taste of orange, you will be disappointed. But if you come with an open mind and no expectations then you'll have a chance to enjoy this odd flavor. Just like that office on the 7 1/2th floor that has absurdly low ceiling where staff go on about their daily work all hunched, not betting an eye about the absurdity of it all.The characters in the movie are odd and bizarre. They feel like they lack depth and they are hard to empathize or relate to. At first I blamed it on acting but then I realized this was deliberate. They are part of that bizarre, surreal world. And John Malcovic is the only normal person who finds himself in this bizarre world surrounded by twisted characters that act without morals and common sense. And this is when you're reminded of Truman Show.It's worth watching but it's not for everyone. It won't become my next favorite movie but I've enjoyed being taken on a different, non-conventional, twisted journey where I found myself laughing many times.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Insanely brilliant and brilliantly insane.,"All hail Spike Jonze for he is a genius. Not content with being the undisputed king of music videos, he's set his sights on full-length-feature-films. One might imagine that the often surreal, always innovative humour of his short music promos might not transfer across to a much longer production  like hell. Being John Malkovich' is a fresh exciting stroke of genius.John Cusack is Craig Schwartz, an unemployed puppeteer looser guy. In order to earn a living he is forced to find himself a regular job, only it soon becomes apparent that regular it is not. Working as a filing clerk on floor seven and a half, Craig stumbles across a portal into John Malkovich's head. No, really, that's what happens. Anyway, he turns this into a business venture with help from the beautiful Maxine (Catherine Keener), whom he lusts after. Maxine is more interested, however, in his wife, Lotte (Diaz, like you've never seen her before) but only when she's being John Malkovich.Don't worry if this all sounds a little strange to you, it should do, it's probably the most surreal film ever made. I obviously can't give all the credit for this to director Spike Jonze; Charlie Kaufman is the genius that wrote this insanity. He's the most acutely imaginative and ingenious man of our time.With such a fantastic cast the acting is of course superb; everyone's brilliant, especially Malkovich himself. Well obviously, you say, he's playing himself  yes, but he's also playing himself being played by an increasingly psychotic puppeteer.Monkey flash backs and a restaurant full of Malkoviches are highlights of the insanely brilliant and brilliantly insane movie. If you thought that Spike Jonez could never top the Daft Punk talking dog video, you have never been so wrong in your life.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Brilliant, Unique Film","What does it feel like to be inside someone else's skin?  Some people find out in the highly imaginative `Being John Malkovich,' directed with style by Spike Jonze, and starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.  When out of work puppeteer Craig Schwartz (Cusack) gets a job as a file clerk on the `7 1/2' floor of an office building, it's the beginning of a bizarre interlude that will ultimately take him, and a few others as well, into a realm beyond the known.  One day he discovers a small doorway hidden behind a filing cabinet; curious, he ventures into the dark beyond and is suddenly sucked into the mind of actor John Malkovich.  After fifteen minutes of seeing through Malkovich's eyes, and experiencing what the actor is experiencing, Craig is just as suddenly and inexplicably dropped into a ditch beside the New Jersey Turnpike.  Unable to contain himself, he confides what has happened to him to Maxine (Catherine Keener), a woman who also works on 7 1/2.  Immediately, she sees money in the prospect of having a portal into the mind of John Malkovich, and she convinces Craig that they should start a business:  `J.M. Inc.'  For two hundred dollars a pop, people can have the experience of a lifetime.Jonze has taken a unique screenplay that is clever, witty, humorous and totally engrossing, and turned it into one of the most ingenious films to come our way in a long, long time.  In fact, there's never been anything quite like it.  It is distinct and filled with nuance and subtle shades of humor, sometimes dark, sometimes hilarious, but riveting throughout.  And the performances are absolutely first rate all around.  Keener deservedly got the Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress, but Cusack, Diaz and Bean are also exemplary here.  Cusack comes through with one of the best characters he's ever done; there's an edgy, quiet intelligence to Craig, a Bohemian at heart, with a wife, Lotte (Diaz), and an apartment full of pets (snakes, birds and a chimp).  He's reserved, generally takes things as they come, and exudes a certain boyish charm when he becomes smitten with Maxine.  Diaz, taking on a decidedly unglamorous role, is terrific as Lotte, the somewhat unremarkable pet shop clerk who comes alive after experiencing the `portal.' It's a great character part, and Diaz plays it for all it's worth, connecting with the audience while ably conveying Lotte's sense of confusion and repressed yearnings.  And Orson Bean nearly steals the show as Dr. Lester, Craig's boss, the hundred-and-five year old man with a secret that holds the key to the portal.  It's a memorable performance filled with nuance and subtle humor; the scene in which he interviews job-applicant Craig is classic.  Malkovich (as himself) is the icing on the cake; he plays it straight, with a finesse and distinction that makes the unbelievable somehow credible, while lending an easy, natural flow to the innate humor of the story.  The `Malkovich, Malkovich,' sequence, and his rendition of the puppet's dance are unforgettable scenes.The supporting cast includes Mary Kay Place (Floris), Charlie Sheen (Charlie), Carlos Jacott (Larry), Willie Garson (Guy in restaurant) and Byrne Piven (Captain Mertin).  Written by Charlie kaufman, `Being John Malkovich' is a movie that is an experience in itself.  And Jonze and his entire cast should be given a standing ovation for bringing this one to life, for making it breathe.  It's the kind of film you wait for to come along, but rarely does, and it demands to be seen more than once.  Like Lotte, once you've been through the portal, you have to do it again; once you've tasted the nectar, there's no turning back.   10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Absolutely sublime modern classic,"Originality is one thing that I very much admire in cinema, and it's also the reason I rate Being John Malkovich so highly. Charlie Kaufman has taken an amazingly weird premise and twisted round a suitably offbeat story to create a movie that is as bizarre as it is as it is compelling, and it's definitely a major highlight of American cinema in the 1990's. Charlie Kaufman may have scripted his most acclaimed film in 2004 with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but if you want to see his best work - you need look no further than his first feature. Quite how anyone could have thought of this premise remains a mystery, but I'm certainly glad that Kaufman did. The story revolves around a portal that leads directly into the head of the actor, John Malkovich. After discovering this portal, puppeteer Craig Schwartz shares it with his colleague and crush, the beautiful Maxine Lund. Things start to get complicated when Craig's wife, Lottie, becomes involved and it turns out that Craig's not the only one with a crush on Maxine.The usually presentable John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are completely unrecognisable as this film's leading couple and both give career highlight performances. Catherine Keener fleshes out a threesome of leads. She is seductively sexy, and delivers a performance that reflects the quality of this film on the whole. And, of course, John Malkovich stars also. The fact that it's John Malkovich who is the title actor is what really makes this film. Had the film have been, say, 'Being Tom Cruise'; it wouldn't have had nearly the same impact. Malkovich is a big actor, but he's not THAT big and the fact that it's him takes the film away from the mainstream and allows it's offbeat indie roots to stay intact. Kaufman ensures that the story works by constantly adding new and weird events into the plot, and this in turn ensures that we never know what's coming next. Of course, this is exactly what you want from any film. The elements of the story aren't bound tightly enough to really make a lasting impression where substance is concerned; but it hardly matters, as there's enough offbeat invention in this film to more than adequately mask that fact It's easy to call this movie pretentious or silly; but it's also pointless.

Movie starts with a promising premise, but starts to drag after first 40 minutes and is just plain boring towards the end. Characters have no actual depth and so does the script. I must say that i was delighted by the reptile attitude of Catherine Keener (Maxine) and John Malkovich´s subtle, self-aware acting. It´s an original and strange movie, but that´s not enough to make it either a good movie, nor a pleasant experience. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Without a doubt the weirdest movie ever,"This movie takes the most absurd premise : What would happen if there was a tunnel that lead to John Malkovitch's brain. The film's quality resides in its confidence. The confidence to stick to whatever weird premise it itself has set up and to run it. And when you think the film could not get any more absurd, well the movie does it again and doubles down on the weirdness. It does it twice.John Cusack is Craig: a pathetic talented puppeteer that is down his luck. Oh and he is a pervert. Everybody in this film is a sexual deviant (in an ironic twist the only character who did not surprise me was Charlie Sheen playing restrained Charlie Sheen). His wife Lotte is an employee at a pet-store. They are both unhappy and locked in their miserable lives. Cusack and Diaz steal the show in the first act, and like the weirdness, I thought the acting could not be topped.
Craig finds a new job and meets the stunning Maxine, who is as evil and cunning as she is beautiful. Craig is obsessed by Maxine, who rejects him. The film itself suggest that Maxine might be a witch but that might be the case, I found her to be the most unpleasant woman ever. Which is on purpose because that is exactly the kind of nihilism that the film engages with.
At his new job, which already abounds of weirdness and absurdity, Craig finds one day, behind a filing cabinet, a tunnel that lead to ""inside"" John Malkovitch, the actor.
Craig is enticed by Maxine to profit from the situation and they start selling tickets to the mind of John Malkovitch. However, Craig lets his wife try the tunnel one night. Lotte is in Malkovitch's head, at the same time that Maxine goes out on a date with him.
Lotte falls for Maxine, and declares she wants a sex-change. Maxine falls for Lotte and manipulates Malkovitch in order to have sex with her. Craig is left out and excluded so he locks-up is wife and takes control of Malkovitch with the help of his puppeteering skills.At that point, I thought the movie was the weirdest, but it became weirder. Craig becomes Malkovitch full time and Craig-Malkovitch starts to resemble Craig, he stops being an actor, he becomes a world-renown puppeteer, and he grow his hair longer and marries Maxine. This is where John Malkovitch becomes the star(and the focus of the story) and gives an amazing performance. The movie stops and plays out as a gossip-documentary on the life of John Malkovitch.Then the film becomes even weirder. There is a conspiracy plot, which involves the now excluded Lotte. Lotte chases Maxine to murder her through the painful memories of the legit John Malkovitch. They end up in a lesbian couple.
The film is the most absurd. The strangeness is reinforced by the fact that there are no jokes. The movie plays the subject matter so straight-faced. It is rather dark and sad. But it is unique.On the technical level everything is perfect: the camera-work, the lighting, the music, the sets. It is a very visual movie. There is absolute mastery of all these elements. However, they are all at the service of the weirdest story ever.
I do not really know what to make of it, and I guess that was the point. The nihilism of the film is it's shell, but also it's substance.
There are no proper themes at play. You could argue that there is a criticism of celebrity-worship and a reflexion on 90s existential angst (same as in American Beauty, the Matrix, Office Space, Fight Club). But it is too subtle and submerged by the absurdity.1999 is regarded as the last good year in American Cinema. And while this movie might not be what people had in mind; it certainly is a pinnacle of absurdity that has not been topped since.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Endlessly imaginative...,"I'm surprised so many viewers enjoyed this film--it goes so far out on a limb that it threatens to be potentially alienating to an audience. This is a ticklish joy-ride, full of sheer ridiculousness, yet it all comes together smoothly, managing to be completely free of any cinematic inhibitions. John Cusack plays a puppeteer (with beautiful puppets) who gets an office job in a very odd building (on the 7 1/2 floor!), where the term 'low overhead' is literal. The movie does get convoluted in its final stretch, but it never fails to be engaging and wildly clever. The acting by Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and John Malkovich is superb. Fanciful, original and amusing ideas come from left and right. Credit writer Charles Kaufman with a screenplay that is never pretentious or cynical, and director Spike Jones for never losing sight of his characters, all mad romantics. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's my head!!!!,"Though I had liked the few Spike Jonze music videos I've seen(Weezer's ""Buddy Holly"" and the Beastie Boys one), I was hesitant about whether he could make the jump to movies, for, as we know, for every good MTV raised director(David Fincher), there are several bad ones(Michael Bay).  And this is truly a concept which could have gone either way.  But this is one of the most original, funny, and enjoyable movie experiences I've had this year. Every idea pays off in ways you don't expect, all four main actors do well cast against type, and it's awfully hard to pick who's the best(though I suspect John Malkovich will be remembered at Oscar time), the dialogue is great(""Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man!"" may be the best line of the year), and I can't think of another way to describe this except go see it now.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

What the?,"""Being John Malkovich"". This is one of those odd little films that is near impossible to critique. A fantasy of sorts about a struggling puppeteer (John Cusack) who takes a job at a strange office where he starts to work with an odd 105-year-old boss (Orson Bean) and a beautiful, but heartless co-worker (Oscar-nominee Catherine Keener). The office itself has six-foot ceilings and is located on the seven and a half floor. The weirdness does not stop when Cusack goes home as his wife, an almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz, is struggling working with her animals as a type of researcher and questions her own sexuality and dreams of perhaps having a sex change one day. Still with me? Cusack becomes disenchanted with Diaz and falls for the cold Keener. Meanwhile he finds a passage-way which leads to the mind of John Malkovich through the office. He tells Diaz and Keener and more confusion ensues. Diaz now is even more sexually confused and Keener comes up with a plan to make money off the discovery by charging admission to all comers who wish to see what Malkovich sees for 15 minutes. Keener falls in love with the body of Malkovich, Diaz falls in love with the possibility of being Malkovich all the time, and Cusack wants Keener at all costs. Malkovich learns of what is going on, but what can he do? Cusack discovers how he can get Keener: go into Malkovich and stay there forever. This will also launch the career in puppeteering that he so desperately wants. However, boss Orson Bean and some of his other ridiculously elderly friends have had plans the whole time to take over Malkovich's body and live forever, but Cusack's plans have gotten in the way. Now they will do whatever possible to jump into Malkovich to keep from dying. There are so many oddball situations that the viewer's head may be spinning trying to keep it all straight. There are undertones aplenty in this film. Medical cloning, lesbianism, sexual obsession, sex-change operations, sexual threesomes, the question of mind-control, physical attractions, mental deficiencies, the rights of individuals, the mad world of media, the exploration of quick money-making schemes, the exploration of relationships in the workplace, and the general disdain of individuals in the workplace are all somewhat explored subjects in ""Being John Malkovich"". Some subjects are subtle while others slap you in the face. In all the film is a fantasy for the 1999 crowd. The only difference is that it deals with subjects that have been or could be more prevalent to the real world. Spike Jonze shows real potential here with his direction. This was far from a easy film to put together. Charlie Kaufman must also be given kudos for a creative screenplay. It is not quite a great script, but it is definitely interesting and unique. The performers are also good. John Malkovich does well with a strange role. John Cusack continues to show real versatility. Cameron Diaz does her best, but seems a bit out-of-place in a film like this at times. Catherine Keener is the bolt of lightning that keeps everyone on their toes. Her Oscar nomination was well-deserved. There are also cameos galore (big surprise). Sean Penn and Charlie Sheen are among those who make token appearances throughout the film. Many have said that ""Being John Malkovich"" is a film that will mean more in the future. I am not sure about this. I doubt that it will be as trail-blazing as say ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". This is a unique experience that is a curiosity. The fact that it will have so many tireless imitations will not help its case either. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

We are lucky to have a screenwriter like Charlie Kaufman among us.,"This is the kind of movies that I have been looking for all my life, a metaphysical, surreal and philosophical journey that explores different issues of human nature, this film has docile dyes of comedy, but has all the potential of being a dark and grotesque thriller, nevertheless that is what gives the touch of originality to this film released in 1999, that year all the films wanted to look like Seven, the theaters were mined of dark thrillers, both good and ridiculous, Being John Malkovich does not need to be dark and Grotesque to talk about complex and deep issues.The story is so difficult to explain with words that I'm going to skip that part of the reviews and go straight to the point, Being John Malkovich is about of people's desire to be someone else, the feeling of not feeling comfortable with them himself and this film portrays a society that does not feel comfortable in their bodies, a society in search of satisfaction that cannot be achieved by being themselves, people who need attention, most of us want to be a movie star or at least live a life so.The central issue of the film is the loss of identity of people, we realize in a moment of the film that there is a long line of people wanting to be John Malkovich, wanting to forget who they are for 15 minutes, but that does not mean That is the only thing that this movie is about, since it is a gallery of topics related to the human mind, there is even a chimpanzee that takes its own identity and even seems to be aware, Craig in an early scene of the movie he say that animals don't have conscience, this is one of the dialogues of the movie that caught me the most.Curiously Maxime is the only character that does not enter the head of John Malkovich, she does not want to be John Malkovich, it is because she is the strongest and controlling character in history, all who enter John Malkovich end up losing their minds, Maxime He only takes advantage of the characters throughout the story, even at the end when he confesses to Lotte that the son he expects is from her, a certain tone of manipulation can be noticed in her, perhaps she lied only to get away with it.Being John Malkovich is a story with the most notable features of Charlie Kaufman; Depressive characters and an existentialist vision of the world, we are lucky to have a screenwriter like Charlie Kaufman among us.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent peice of creativity and cinema,"Being Jhon Malkovich is Borderline Arthouse-SciFi-Fantasy movie which brings out really great questions about identity and soul at the same time mocking the main character for doing this.

It mocks all those movies which are so called Arthouse and DEEEEP , so arthousy that one can't simply enjoys it. This movie itself belongs to arthouse genre but somehow it is a very very enjoyable movie. Thanks to charlie kaufman for writing such a creative movie in 1999. The concept is great although the mechanics of portal weren't explained properly and captain mertin backstory must be given more screentime.I mean come on ! Be bold some times , make a 3 hour movies some times but execution and direction is excellent!. This movie deserve similar love the matrix is getting nowadays.

The Best Film I Have Seen in a Decade.,"""Being John Malkovich"" has it all.  Comedy, drama, romance, and a whole lot more.  But more importantly it is original.  And when I mean original I mean this film is the most original piece of work I've seen in decades.  Nothing like this has ever been made, and seeing how it's original, nothing like it will ever be made again.  And this is for three reasons:1: The acting, which is some of the best of the year and then some.  John Cusack in a warped role as the odd puppeteer, Cameron Diaz as his pet store working wife, Katherine Keener as the devilish office worker, and as himself in his best role ever, John Malkovich as the only person he could perfectly play- himself.2: The script, which is the most original funny and odd one in years to come around.  Who could've ever thought of a normal person going into the brain of an famous (Oscar nominated) actor- and coming out on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike?!  And when Malkovich goes inside the portal into his own brain, he finds a whole restaurant full of himselfs.  I think that is weirder than anything you could see in you're entire life (when not on drugs)and 3: The Director, Spike Jonze.  This is Spike Jonze's first adventure into feature films (he was and still is and actor and music video director) and it is probably what he will be most remembered for.  Unlike some other directors, Spike doesn't take a scene and go on to another, he actually expands on his ideas and works with them to their maximum potential.Along with a funny script, a surprise at every turn, and a hilarious cameo with Charlie Sheen, this film is definitely in my top ten of the year and the decade.

A great premise squandered,"I remember when I first heard the premise for this movie, I wanted to just get up and cheer - it sounded so great! A guy discovers a secret portal into the head of John Malkovich, allowing people to experience what it is like to be the famous (but not too famous) actor for 15 minutes at a clip, before being dumped out onto the New Jersey turnpike. Bizarre, surreal, and totally original. Which is why it's such a shame that the movie ends up using this device in service of a rather lame romantic triangle between John Cusack, Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz, none of whom create a very interesting or likable character to begin with. The movie could have explored the nature of celebrity, or the psychological need people have to ""get inside"" someone else's head, or to live vicariously through others. All these things are touched on to some extent, but they take a backseat to what becomes essentially a boring sex romp.Still, there are some wonderful things here. The 7 1/2th floor is an invention of Monty Pythonesque lunacy, and it provides the film with a hilarious visual motif. The actual scenes of entering the portal and being inside Malkovich's head are shot with great deadpan brilliance. And Malkovich himself is totally amazing - wonderfully droll as ""himself"" and then suitably off the wall as his body becomes overtaken by forces beyond his control. He truly deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor this year (just think how great the acceptance speech would be!)Of course, the fact that in a movie entitled ""Being John Malkovich,"" John Malkovich himself could be considered only a *supporting* actor is entirely the problem. I wanted more of him, and less of the dippy trio mentioned above. The movie frustrated me - it could have been so good, and settled for being ordinary. Ultimately, the things that are good about it do make it worth seeing, but just barely. And don't expect any comic masterpiece; all the critics that hailed it as such were talking about what the film could have been, not what it is.Rating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The classic 'man chases manic pixie dream girl', now with body-snatching!","First of all, I want to say I like the concept, as well as Malkovich and Diaz's acting.Now let's get into it. The concept is certainly unique, but at its core the plot is disappointingly familiar; a self-insert beta male pursues a manic pixie dream girl. The characters are undeveloped, one-dimensional tropes. Their dialogue and behaviour is so jarringly unnatural that it is impossible to relate to them or understand their motives.The film throws in a lot of 'quirks' to amuse the viewer, which are ultimately irrelevant to the plot: the 'half-office', the mishearing secretary, the emotionally scarred chimpanzee. It could be said that these things were added to create a surreal atmosphere, but I argue that it would be better to create this atmosphere with good writing.I was disappointed to be mislead by all these high ratings, but this is sadly another example of an artsy film praised by pseudo-intellectuals.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Eraserhead for rationalists / Postmodern-Lite,"Being John Malkovich is an odd little dark comedy which is slightly open to interpretation, but deals with themes like identity, manipulation, sex, and neuroses. The acting is excellent - but nothing less should have been expected from this cast. The screenplay is also very good, as is the direction and editing. The film moves along at a comfortable pace, relying more on the somewhat obscure messages embedded in the intriguing plot than on characters, plot-line, action, or intellect.John Cusack plays a control freak whose obsession manifests itself in his choice of an unsuccessful career - as a puppeteer. Cameron Diaz plays his wife, a passive woman with little self-determination and a very big heart. Catherine Keener plays a shallow jet-setter Cusack, and later Diaz, becomes obsessed with. John Malkovich plays John Malkovich.... sort of.One of the challenging aspects of this film is that none of these characters, with the exception of Malkovich himself, are very likable. They all do drugs, obsess on their own fantasies and have rather warped self-concepts. Of the three principals, I chose to like Diaz' character most simply because she loved animals so much.In any case, the plot is basically a bit of post-modern twilight zone sci-fi, with a somewhat more linear and conventional story line than some of the more challenging material in post-modern cinema (i.e. Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive). The success of this film is probably largely due to its inherent rationality - like Memento, it feels weird and moody, but is really based on a pretty simple, if somewhat silly, concept.By entering a tiny tunnel in an office on the 7.5th floor of an office building where Cusack and keener work, you can become John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. Unless you are a puppet-master, in which case you can possess the legendary actor for the remainder of his life. To reveal any more of the plot would require a spoiler, so I will stop here. However, I want to write a little about the general themes the film comments on.*BJM points out a relationship between puppetry and acting. Though clever and cleverly portrayed, this connection is really rather superficial and pedantic.*BJM has a queer concept of morality and control. While the question of what happens to Malkovich throughout the film is hardly asked at all, the film seems to say that overtly attempting to control others is a bad thing, while doing so passively is really quite OK.*BJM definitely has a drug-induced flavor to it. I haven't smoked dope in many years, but this film is the sort of thing I used to write while high. From the amount of pot-smoking references in the film, I also got the feeling that at least the writer considered it a major part of his life.This is a really neat little surrealism-lite film. It's far from a masterpiece, but definitely worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""You don't know how lucky you are being a monkey.  Because consciousness is a terrible curse.""","This film has a densely layered plot with plenty of insight into the human mind. John Malkovich is a vessel literally and metaphorically. The discovery of the portal amplifies the true nature of each character. Craig, the puppeteer, craves the acceptance of the public for his talent. Lotte, his wife, lives to care for her animals but ultimately wants a child. Maxine, the woman both Lotte and Craig claim to love, believes her beauty is worth the status she lacks. Malkovich is the means by which they believe happiness is possible.Being John Malkovich is very applicable to this digital age of live celebrity updates and involvement with the public. Many wish they were someone who had more freedom to do whatever they wanted in their relationships, profession, and overall life. Craig, Lotte, and Maxine are all out for themselves: seeing Malkovich as an opportunity and not a human being.

Another Kaufman gem!,"Being John Malkovich is yet another Kaufman gem. Initially, the premise sounded a bit like a one-note joke, and I was reluctant. Little did I know that the film has various different story lines interwoven from one simple premise. In fact, not many screenwriters could be able to successfully blend in all of these different plots, but Kaufman does so brilliantly.I'm still amazed by the turns the film makes. Last night I watched Adaptation, and it was also a great film with equally creative and ambitious ideas. This one though feels much different. It's comedy is blended in sort of funnier and also sadder moments. The fate of one of the leads in the end is also pretty sad in itself. All of the different ideas of identity from Kaufman have never been better explored.Overall, another great film from Jonze and Kaufman. Based on the four films I have seen Kaufman write (Eternal Sunshine, Synecdoche, New York, Adaptation, and this) it's true that no one writes outrageous and creative, yet also investing, comedy-dramas like him.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Just because you haven't seen its like before, does not make it great","A prime example of just because you have not seen anything like it before, does not make it a cinematic masterpiece.  Scuzzy puppeteer John Cusack and snide co-worker Catherine Keener discover a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich (playing himself) in their bizarre office and decide to profit from it.  Marketed as a comedy, the film is inventive, most definitely original, but the laughs virtually dry up after the first 40 minutes.  The strange plot takes one bizarre turn after another, incorporating lesbianism, spousal abuse and cults into the mix.  Events become more and more sinister, disturbing and serious during the running time.  Unfortunately, the main characters, including an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz as Cusack's frumpy wife, are so odious that it becomes impossible to identify with them, and by the climax one really does not care what is done to whom.  Keener is initially terrific as the reprehensible profiteer, but she is given limited notes to play.  Malkovich may be a good sport, but he is a pretty dull character as envisioned here.  It is hard to recall Cusack ever being this unappealing.  Director Spike Jonze has definite potential, but his ambition spins out of control far too quickly on this project.  Even the look of the film, with everything in drab blues and greys, is a downer.  For all of the hype, the film is an amazingly empty experience.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The screenplay is a little screwy...,"And I don't mean that the movie is weird. I like that. Everyone should appreciate the freshness of this movie. What I mean is that the screenplay is a little uneven. When I first saw this film (on opening day, luckily), I liked it a lot but felt that there was a major problem. It took me months to figure out why I felt this way, but I did finally figure it out, and I have confirmed it on subsequent viewings.The first half hour or so, all the screen time before the portal is found, contains an entirely different humor than the rest of the picture. And this humor is mostly childish and unfunny. The secretary and the joke about her being an expert on speaking disabilities was very unfunny. I feel embarrassed when I watch it it's so bad. The video about why the 7 1/2 floor exists is also extremely unfunny, as well as the 7 1/2 floor itself. I didn't find any of these things funny, and there were even more than that. I did like the puppet show that Craig gave on the street corner, I did like Dr. Lester's sexual rantings (although dirty old men jokes are really commonplace), and I laughed a lot when Craig was guessing Maxine's name.Fortunately, when the portal is found, the childish humor pretty much completely vanishes. The rest of this movie is very intelligent. Every joke hits. There are no misses like there are in the first half hour.But what is really special about this film is how smoothly it becomes a compelling drama and character study. It is so well filmed. Watch how the Craig, Lottie, and Maxine dolls are used all through the film. I really felt it when Maxine was covering up the Lottie puppet. I actually teared up during the chase through Malkovich's subconscious, which I think is probably the single best scene that appeared in a film in 1999. And I also wept at the very, very, very beautiful ending. The second time I saw this in a theater, they cut out the beginning of the credit sequence where Emily was swimming, and I absolutely screamed, telling everyone in the theater about the sham that had been pulled. And I found the ending even more startling on the third viewing because I hadn't realized what actually happened to Craig at the end on my first and second viewings.I love this movie, so I am very hurt by the childish humor in the first half hour. It does embarrass me. It detracts from the whole film. Overall, I have to give it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great for thinking. LOTS of fun.,"Bizarre. That's the first word that came to my mind as I reflected on this film. Indeed the most common muttering that I heard among my friends with whom I was watching the film (who, I admit, had no idea what they were going to be watching and had never heard of the film) was: ""what the f**k??!!"" I kept my incredulity to myself, but I largely shared their sentiment.It's a film about being John Malkovich (surprising, huh?). A man struggling to make ends meet as a puppeteer finds a job filing things on floor 7 ½ of a building which happens to be half a floor where everything is miniaturized, and all the people working there have to stoop. He discovers a small door that leads directly to the inside of John Malkovich, where you can be him for 15 minutes, after which you fall from the sky onto a spot pleasantly situated next to the New Jersey turnpike. Soon the puppeteer and a coworker (with whom he is in love, although he is married) start charging admission to regular schmoes who want to be someone else for fifteen minutes.A bizarre love triangle develops between the puppeteer, his wife, and the coworker, and somehow John Malkovich is worked in there as the puppeteer and his wife vie for time being him, so that they can then be with the coworker. Now before this plot gets any more convoluted and confusing to the unknowing reader, I'm going to forgo the growing plot and I'm going to jump to the meaning and the profundity of the film (which is actually the most fun part!).This film tackles one of the most existentially challenging and profoundly interesting and intense enigmas of humanity. What is the essence of self? Is it possible to see the world through someone else's eyes, and yet remain oneself? If you are someone else for a time, then what are you replacing, and what happens to that whom you've replaced? And what happens to your body if you've left yourself, to be someone else? Strangely enough, this film seems to answer all these questions, in as strange a manner as any other answer could possibly be. It puts forth a logical (well, almost) system in which one can be someone else, and it provides for any question the viewer could have about the process. It even raised a question that I had not even thought of, and answered it itself. What happens when a person is himself? That is, what happens when John Malkovich goes through the door to himself? Well, suffice it to say that the result blew my mind, and was hysterical at the same time. It was a very bizarre answer, but as good an answer as any other!This film is like nothing I've been exposed to before. I keep repeating at the ends of my reviews that if a film doesn't make you think, it's not worth your time. That still holds true for this film, perhaps even more than any other, but not like any other I've seen before. Other films have messages about life. They teach the viewer something about life, or some way to live, or something the director or writer has learned that he wants to impart unto the viewer. This film does that as well, and more. It does blatantly warn of the troubles involved with wanting to be someone else. The whole concept of being another person is simply impossible, and only a dream, as evidenced by the dream-like setting of the little door: a floor half the normal size. However this film was more than a life lesson. It simply makes you think. And that's fun. It proposes a philosophical puzzle, and proposes a genuinely entertaining solution. However attacking a philosophical puzzle such as this one is seemingly impossible to do on film, short of showing three older men in smoking jackets amiably discussing the issue over sherry in front of a blazing fire. Therein lies evidence of the immense skill involved in making this film.Another remark that I heard from a friend as we watched the film was ""what kind of a person thinks of this stuff?"" The answer is: a genius. Truly, only a person of extraordinary thought and inventiveness could imagine such a film. Furthermore, great film-making was employed as well. I still can't figure out how they filmed things through Malkovich's eyes. I suppose they could've taped a camera to his head. But that doesn't explain how Malkovich looked at himself in the mirror, with no place for a camera to hide. Regardless, it was pretty fancy camera work. In fact the camera work was quite masterful for much of the film, as things became mentally tumultuous.However the crowning jewel of this film, as I've mentioned before, is the writing: both the story/plot and the dialogue. The characters are so odd, the story so strange and the dialogue so out there, that one can't help but enjoy this film! It is meant to be a comedy, and it certainly is one. The oddness and awkwardness just make you laugh. I nearly forgot to mention the fascinating performances by all the actors in the film. Particularly the awkward puppeteer played masterfully by John Cusack, and his eccentric wife, played surprisingly well by Cameron Diaz. And how could I forget John Malkovich himself, who does an exemplary job playing himself, and playing well, himself, but possessed by another. This is really a fun movie to watch, to think about, and discuss. The makers, especially Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman, and the entire cast and crew deserve a firm pat on the back, and all those who haven't seen it deserve a firm word of encouragement. Go see this film, and be prepared to exclaim ""what the f**k??!!"" And remember, if it doesn't make you think, it's not worth your time.-Michael",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Rarity in American Cinema...Groundbreaking Originality,"BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is a zany and uncompromisingly brilliant black comedy that boasts something very few American films can claim...originality. Charlie Kaufman's imaginative, Oscar-worthy screenplay centers around an unemployed puppeteer named Craig (John Cusack, in a delightfully unhinged turn), who gets a job as a file clerk at a company called Lestercorp, which is lodged between the 7th and 8th floors of an office building. Craig discovers a hole in the wall of his office which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich, which allows those who enter to view the world from Malkovich's mind for 15 minutes, at which time they are then deposited at the side of the road on the New Jersey Turnpike. To reveal anymore of the story would be wrong for the uninitiated, but suffice it to say that director Spike Jonz has mounted a quirky and unpredictable roller coaster ride which keeps the viewer constantly guessing and consistently entertained. Cusack receives solid support from Catherine Keener, smart and vivacious in her Oscar-nominated turn as Maxine, Craig's partner-in-crime with whom he falls in love, Cameron Diaz as Craig's dizzy wife, Lottie, and, of course,Malkovich himself, who deserves major kudos for allowing us to laugh along with him, at himself and his image. A once in a lifetime cinematic experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Unusual, interesting but also a bit tedious",I watched this movie on DVD last night. Unusual story and very good acting throughout but a little slow - especially the first half of the movie. The problem is that not a great deal happens in the movie - and some of the interesting strands aren't developed (like the way that everyone kisses Malkovich's ass - but the shallowness of people is skimmed over). But definitely original. Good performances from the main players - and that woman (Catherine Keener) is an absolute stunner! There are better sci-fi movies (The Matrix) and better insights into human nature (American Beauty). I gave it 6/10.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A complex of fundamental social desires put in a kafkaesque setting,"'Being John Malkovich' outlines fundamental desires and problems that our modern society is dealing with, catching out the observer by confronting him with moral taboos. Main difficulties are regarding voyeurism, immortality, identity and sexual covetousness. The whole movie is an evolution starting with voyeurism in general to voyeurism in its strongest occurrence concerning real prominent persons in particular. It then raises questions of identity, who we want to be and how we can achieve what we desire, just to open out and close with the deep human wish of immortality paired with its negative side of endlessness. Along the way 'Being John Malkovich' puts this in a surreal and kafkaesque setting. This excelling movie is often underrated by the audience, while still being above the ordinary. The high potential rooted in the plot takes time to emerge and therefore needs to be watched at least twice.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Being John Malkovich"": A Surreal Exploration of Identity and Desire","""Being John Malkovich"" is a **bizarre and thought-provoking** film that defies conventional storytelling. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, its unique premise and existential themes make it a memorable cinematic experience.**Plot Summary:**
The movie follows Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), a struggling puppeteer who stumbles upon a mysterious portal hidden behind a filing cabinet. This portal allows people to enter the mind of actor John Malkovich (played by himself) for a limited time. As Craig becomes obsessed with this strange phenomenon, he grapples with questions of identity, desire, and the blurred boundaries between reality and fantasy.**What Works:****Surreal Creativity**: Director Spike Jonze crafts a world where the absurd becomes commonplace. The idea of inhabiting someone else's mind is both fascinating and unsettling.**John Malkovich's Meta Role**: Malkovich's portrayal of himself adds layers of complexity. Is he the actor or the character? The film blurs these distinctions brilliantly.**Existential Musings**: The movie invites viewers to ponder existential questions: Who are we? Can we escape our own lives? What defines our identity?**Maxine's Complexity**: Catherine Keener's Maxine is both alluring and manipulative. Her character embodies desire and curiosity.**What Doesn't Work:****Weirdness Overload**: The film's quirkiness can be overwhelming. Some viewers may find it too offbeat to fully engage with.**Craig's Fate**: Craig's decision to live inside Malkovich permanently is both tragic and perplexing. It leaves us with more questions than answers.**Maxine's Ambiguity**: Maxine's motivations remain elusive. Is she heartless or merely pragmatic?**Final Thoughts:**
""Being John Malkovich"" is an acquired taste. If you appreciate unconventional cinema and enjoy pondering the mysteries of existence, it's worth a watch. While Maxine's character may not resonate with everyone, her presence adds to the film's enigmatic allure. Ultimately, the movie's main theme-that we all yearn for escape and transformation-is what lingers long after the credits roll.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Everyone is Searching for Who They Are and Who They Want to Be,"What makes Being John Malkovich provoke so deeply is that it is not simply an oddball flight of fancy but an exploration of Charlie Kaufman's deeply realized questions and thoughts explored through the story. However, the film is certainly pathological in its exploration of themes and modus operandi in ways that are not done in American movies. Its romantic plot strands, its ending, the subplot of revitalizing the art of puppeteering, and the nonchalance of the characters' workplace having low ceilings because of being placed between two normal floors are all either far-reachingly hilarious eccentric ideas much like ones one may conjure when half asleep yet still conscious and visions and even scenarios bleed into your actual environments, or they are aggressively resentful of pat plot tunes.Cusack very comfortably plays a character created by forces not afraid of a hero who's blunderingly unsuccessful with women or not very socially popular. A dark territory where ego has to reach a little bit to get a hold, Cusack, Kaufman, and director Jonze knew that more people would identify with him much more intensely and honestly than a confident, clever, attractive man. He's the id of the creators of the traditional leading man and consequently the men who've grown up latently emulating them. Cameron Diaz has the same attitude towards her role, the personification of the basic drives, feelings, and impulses of the most head-turning social women. Kaufman's characters are amoral and egocentric, ruled just by pleasure and pain.Like all films, there is the love interest, and subsequently the love triangle, but it's not there to fill in any blanks. The female characters are not decoration but very invigorating and thought-provoking characters. Catherine Keener, owner of the most beautiful smile ever captured on film, eats up the screen, just as I would like her to do with me, as a cruelly unattainable object of desire, rejecting not as a reaction but as a first move.Jonze was wise not to employ the safety net of the inventive and meticulously coordinated style of the fascinating music videos he has directed, and instead trusts the effect of Kaufman's inspiring script to stand alone without disaffecting visual technique lathered on top. This film is a highly admirable and important onslaught that hopefully by now has hemorrhaged its influence into the much expressed overcommercialization and underused creativity and exploration of American cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Did they think of any other actors for the title first?,"Being John Malkovich was quite an interesting ride. Through most of the movie, I kept thinking, ""wow, this would be great if we were stoned or tripping"", but since I don't do that anymore, I had to settle on my own boggled mind. I saw this movie without knowing who the actors or director were, or anything about it, for that matter. I was pleasantly surprised when I figured out that it was John Cusak and Cameron Diaz! Wow! They CAN get out of their cookie-cutter roles, and they DID! Diaz, as the pathetic Lotte Schwartz was both sad and amusing. Cusak, as her husband Craig, was disturbing at times, but also so sincere about how he feels about life. Catherine Keener, who plays love interest Maxine, is somewhat charming and always downright rude! She was great! Now, Malkovich himself... hmm... I have to wonder if there were any other actors on the title before him. His appearance throughout the movie was just so BLAH, except for ONE certain scene in which he ""branches out"" (if you know what I mean, you've seen the movie). I was very disappointed in his performance, so maybe it's a good thing he's a stage actor as well.My final words: Definitely rent it, but don't own it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I don't get it,"At first this movie seems great. I actually thought for a while that this might be a Terry Gilliam film, with its bizarre sets, odd characters and dystopian set designs and aesthetics. It was not, but it seemed like it, and the first third of the film was immensely enjoyable as we slowly get to know this strange world.And then they went nowhere with it. Sure, there is a portal that leads into John Malkovich's head. But what they do with it is the least imaginable thing. And why even John Malkovich? The writer Charlie Kaufman has said that Malkovich was always his first and only choice, but I just don't see why. He certainly stands out because of his looks, and he has the acting skills to play the different people inhabiting his head, but aside from that there's nothing interesting about him shown in this film. He lives in an apartment, tries out for roles and that's it.Plus the fact that the main character is a puppeteer. Okay, at first that's interesting. It's out there, not something we see in every movie and jives well with the whole bizarre first third the movie has. But then it is stretched way out of proportion, with much of the running length dedicated to odes to puppetry. Why? Sure, there's the joke about the ultimate puppet, but there needs to be more than that. Now it barely connects with anything.Then there are the romance subplots, which are passable, though boring, and mainly there to move the plot along. The final truth about the portal is also pretty lame. It's pretty much what you would guess if you sat and thought for a minute.All in all Being John Malkovich was a huge disappointment for me. If you have a story about a portal that allows you to control a real life Hollywood star, go all out. Don't give us this halfway there balderdash. Be Terry Gilliam. Make it as weird as possible. Attempting to put logic and cohesive narrative into it only waters it down.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I was so caught up in this film that when it was over, I literally could not find my way out of the theater! That is the degree to which I became immersed and altered! There are only three or four films that have ever done that to me. I cannot seem to find any flaws to this film which left me completely surprised at each twist and turn.

Don't be mislead, this is a VERY funny film, but it's also quite dramatic, full of fascinating complexity and beautiful imagery.  From Craig's dialog's through his puppet's, the visions and feelings experianced through Malkovich, the (in the very literal sense) low-ceiling workplace, the absolutely priceless chase through Malkovich's subconscious, it all comes together with a very sad, strange, and appropriate ending to create a work of art.

Being John Malkovitch,"So much has been written - I will just add that the scene where Malkovitch ""becomes"" Malkovitch may be the funniest scene in film history. This is one of those movies that is not possible to understand the first viewing. Both John Cusack and John Malkovich are on my favorite actor short-list. Some of the little details are hilarious - just for example - when Cusack ties up Cameron Diaz, the chimp is kissing her, and you can just make out her kissing the chimp back, underneath the tape. Malkovich's depiction of having Cusack speak, within him, is classic, along with his physical comedy. It's a triumph for him. There are so many little tidbits like this, that it would take hours to detail them all. The Malkovich being Malkovich just seems so well-done, with the midget-Malkovich, the child-Malkovich, the Maitre'd Malkovich, the women Malkoviches, the gay Malkovich....what a scene!

How did he manage it?,"Only the best writers can come up with such a dazzlingly unbelievable storyline, yet engross the audience so thoroughly that they hang off every word from every contrapuntal character and each bizarre concept. I believe Kaufmann has achieved this glorified omnipotence with Being John Malkovich. I wonder, does he intend to play with the audience's mind, or did he simply say to himself: I will think of some ridiculously comical situations, and attempt to weave a story with some veracity behind each phrase? Whichever way the cookie crumbled, he gave us this masterpiece. Also, I would like to praise Cameron Diaz, for undertaking such a drastic overhaul of her career. We are all too familiar with the Barbra Steisand's of hollywood, ie. image is gospel and I will behave like child because my money and attention somehow retarded any emotional or mental maturity that may once have occurred. Diaz has startled me into thinking that some tall, blonde, gorgeous actresses actually don't mind looking less than their best if it means playing an interesting, multidimensional character. The dialogue is exquisite. My advice: listen to every word that is said. From the boss with crystal clear pronounciation and a sorry-about-my-speech-impediment complex to Charlie Sheen's disturbing bald appearance where he drools over lesbian witches whilst Malkovich desperately attempts to express his fear, the conversation that arises (somehow) from these weirdly colourful characters is almost Shakespeare in its rhythm and beauty. Finally, the scene in the restaurant has, to my knowledge, never been attempted before in a mainstream picture and for that I applaud it. I can't reveal too much, but the Malkovich overload is all too apparent. See it for yourself and enjoy the most original movie out in ages.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Are we, honestly, so obsessed with not being ourselves that we could stoop to stealing the identities of others -- FOR REAL?  Maybe so, but should film be about dictating what life IS or what life could be?I honestly have no pity nor sympathy for any of the characters in this film, perhaps not even Malkovich himself as he falls for the manipulative witch played by Keener.  It is a puppet show of dark humour, and we the unsuspecting children are engaged to watch it.The ending truly is the final straw, being absolutely disgusting.Let's face it, though.  It is popular to tell society that we are all perverted at heart, in some form or another.  Most of us already know this fact.

Yes, the title is `Being John Malkovich' but it's more about  being reborn into another person and therefore living forever.

"It's clever, witty, dark and, most importantly, unwaveringly bizarre.","Spike Jonze's wittily-written, incredibly acted comedy drama about a disgruntled but ambitious puppeteer who to his amazement finds a peculiar, mystical portal into the mind of John Malkovich, is a brilliantly surreal and mind boggling experience. It's profoundly original dream-like narrative exploring humanities selfishness and one's desire to be something else makes it constantly entertaining and builds up to an utterly unforgettable cinematic experience. Charlie Kaufman's clever yet non self-indulgent script creates some very awkward but hilarious situations for the characters and flawlessly disguises the insane feebleness and fantasy of the story and it's characters infinitely believable. He went on to work with director Michel Gondry and wrote his masterpiece; Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, which I think is one of the best films ever made. He is arguably one of the most talented art-house writers out there today and although he makes very few films the one's that he does work on are always brilliant. In the interesting case of Being John Malkovich, performance-wise it is perfect, Cameron Diaz and John Cusack advertise some fantastic chemistry, but the greatest stand-out is easily John Malkovich who is just perfect and undeniably engaging at being/playing John Malkovich. Catherine Keener is also great as the bitterly inhuman anti-hero, and Jonze's outstanding direction nails the film as a landmark. I think it's one of the best directorial debuts of all time, and if your not laughing at it, or being moved by it, you'll certainly be admiring it.

You Were Great in That Jewel Thief Movie,"First, let's just say this was so much better than I expected -- and I already had high hopes. John Cusack? John Malkovich? What more could you want? Now, I would have been hesitant if I had known Cameron Diaz was going to show up, but she was a minor part of the film and handled herself well. One or two more good films and I might finally forgive her for ""Vanilla Sky"".The story is very absurd: a young puppeteer finds a door in his office that goes in side John Malkovich's mind. That's strange enough, but it gets so much wackier from there (but I won't ruin it for you). You have Malkovich in the primary role, who is by far one of the greatest actors in history. And you have Cusack as the secondary role, who is also a great actor - one might even say more versatile (his costume in this film makes him almost unrecognizable as Cusack).What more can I say without giving this away? First, the film is really deep (existential) but also very funny. When Cusack first tells his co-worker about the portal, she asked ""who is John Malkovich?"" which I find hilarious - both because I wondered the same thing when the film first came out, and also because it begins a long string of self-deprecating Malkovich moments.The only other thing you need to know if you're not already sold: this film is a Charlie Kaufman creation. Who's Kaufman? The guy who made ""Adaptation"". And if you haven't seen that, you really ought to (I'd even say it a better film than this classic). There you go: I just suggested a double feature.

Being John Malkovich: 6/10,"In Spike Jonze's overrated but fine movie Being John Malkovich, John Cusack is Craig Schwartz, a struggling puppeteer. He lives with his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz), who is an animal lover, but we never find out her job. Craig needs a job so he gets a job on the 7½ floor of an office building. Soon he discovers a portal into the head of actor John Malkovich (John Malkovich). Weirdness ensues.Cusack is unrecognizable, and so is Diaz, but not Catherine Keener, who plays Maxine, someone else who works on the 7½ floor. I found that the quasi-romantic quality between Cusack and Keener was one-sided. Keener's acting was rather stiff; I was disappointed. Cusack was quite good, if a little forced at times; it seems like he was forced into doing this movie. Diaz was okay, but nothing remarkable. As I said before, Keener's acting was flat. Malkovich actually was good, I was pleasantly surprised.The story is unusually mellow, going for a lot of the movie without music. It would make more sense to bring out the mood of the piece. I also felt like Jonze underplayed the fantasy element. Sure, I liked the 7½ floor and the portal, but if they had used more special effects (imagine a day where someone would say that) it would have been more believable, not that this concept is one that happens every day. The ending, which includes Craig's boss Dr. Lester (Orson Bean), seemed too out there and out of the blue. Many times, we were expected to think `Oh, of course!' because they rarely explained anything. I did find it amusing at first, but after awhile it got annoying.At the beginning there were lots of laughs, but they soon became sporadic and smaller. Of course, this isn't a film where everyone is telling one-liners, but if they had, as I've said before, put in special effects, maybe humorous ones, it would have made the movie more enjoyable. It was very entertaining and imaginative, though. Only Jonze could think of something this twisted. I had no idea where this roller coaster was going to stop or if I'd just be stuck in the loop-the-loop for 105 minutes.To me, it looks like Jonze is a puppet fan, glamorizing puppets all throughout the movie. I didn't like the `first ending', where everything slows down, but the last one I did like a lot. That doesn't make any sense, right?

The Wildest Weirdest Movie I've Seen!,"I've surely seen a dozen, maybe two dozens of really weird and original screenplays/films but Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze left me in awe here. I don't know who will read this review but I'm telling you : you gotta see this movie just for the sake of the script and the main idea, 'cause it's pure gold!I still have to ponder about what I've just seen. I had a good laugh, that's for sure, and maybe sometimes it felt so absurd I could hardly connect to the dramatic part but I'm 100% sure I'm going to re-watch the movie several times during my life. I know this sounds a bit crazy but if I could have invented a genre for this movie I'd have invented one called ''Philosody'' - a mix between a Philosophical exercise and a Comedy.A 9,70 out of 10 from me.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Definitely not a classic.,"I have seen the movie yesterday. It is entertaining with imagination, lots of twists and characters, lesbianism, lustrous love, lusts etc.The story line was confused with sci-fi, black comedy and psychological intermingling of characterization. So none of them scored to their max.And is it original? Somehow I remembered the 'brainstorm' that came in the late eighties. Brainstorm was a sci-fi but dwelt into the story line idea. Same point-of-view shots. And brainstorm thrilled me at the end with a philosophical touch into the nothing.When Craig explains about the John Malkovich portal to keener I thought there the story would go into the deeper dive. But it just afloat-ed with men and women living for centuries would still constantly linger for sex as like that of teenagers.The John Malkovich-turned-top-puppeteer part documentary was a nice piece and the induction part. About the casting: John Cusack and Cameron Diaz were unrecognizable transformations into perfect roles of the story.At the beginning of the story there was a dialog by Craig 'consciousness is a curse..'. I expected similar ones throughout the movie but none has come. Remember 'American Beauty'. That surely is a classic. And 'Magnolia'. But Being John Malkovich misses here.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutely Garbage,"I can't think of a whole lot I can say about this movie other than the fact that it is humorless, boring, and in one word, tripe.

The truly disturbing fact is that this movie was rated #50 on the top 250 of IMDB. This lessens my faith in mankind.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What the Heck?,"It is wonderful when a movie comes out that sets new parameters. This is so far fetched, yet so ingratiating, I loved it. There are so many things that struck me that I can't begin to list them all. To start with the crazy living conditions of John Cusack and Cameron Diaz (almost unrecognizable). Cusack is the morose puppeteer who puts all of his angst into his shows, making them most unpalatable. He is frequently struck by people on the street for doing things like Heloise and Abelard in a sexually suggestive manner. Then there's the office complex on the floor between floors which brings every sight gag imaginable. I could go on and will leave the real reviews to others. I just want to recommend this to anyone who wants to see a movie that on the surface sounds ridiculous, but will have you hurting afterward. Malkovich gives his best performance playing a caricature of himself and showing himself to be a great sport.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the Most Wildly Inventive American Movies Shows Film-making Brio and Genuine Heart,"If anything, I enjoy the audacity and manic creativity of this 1999 black comedy more now than when it was first released. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, who sends up the creative block he experienced after writing the film's script in 2002's ""Adaptation"", plainly refuses to use any accepted cinematic convention to tell the wildly eccentric story of Craig Schwartz, a downtrodden puppeteer who has a must-be-seen-to-be-believed adventure. An uncompromising artiste who cannot find work within his craft, he decides to accept a job as a file clerk to please his frumpy, animal-loving wife, Lotte. Things immediately go awry when he sees his place of employment is on the dwarf-sized 7 1/2th floor of a Manhattan office building. He becomes drawn to an ice-cold co-worker, an apparent femme fatale named Maxine, but the story really escalates into high gear when he discovers a secret passageway that turns out to be the consciousness of actor John Malkovich.The plot convolutions only get weirder yet strangely more resonant as Craig and others get to experience ""being John Malkovich"", including the actor himself. What subsequently happens is constantly off-kilter, but Kaufman brings perceptive insight into all the major characters in ways that are completely unpredictable. The beauty is that repeated viewings only bring out plot nuances that were not as apparent the previous times. Director (and sometime actor) Spike Jonze is an inspired choice to lead the proceedings since he lends an almost verité-style to the film making the lunacy seem human-sized. Casting is pure gold with a bedraggled-looking John Cusack appropriately awestruck as Craig, a cast-against-type Cameron Diaz energized by her curiosity as Lotte and Catherine Keener sharply feline as Maxine. Orson Bean brings out all the eccentricities of Craig's oddly deranged boss, and no one is better cast than Malkovich as a wildly narcissistic version of himself, especially as the plot spins further into a Freudian fantasy of monstrous proportions.This is wildly inventive film-making that may alienate several viewers, but it really should be embraced as the kind of bold experimentation that mainstream Hollywood rarely attempts. The 2002 DVD extras are also pure gold, including an interview with Jones conducted under mock-stress; a brief featurette, ""An Intimate Portrait of the Art of Puppeteering,"" that spotlights the behind-the-scenes work performed by puppet master Phil Huber; and a short called ""Intimate Portrait of the Art of Background Driving"", which purportedly documents the experiences of extras driving cars in the New Jersey Turnpike scenes where all of the Malkovich travelers end up. Along with the original theatrical trailer and several TV promotional spots, there are also two played-straight videos, excerpts of which are shown in the film - one the ""7 ½ Floor Orientation"" and the other the vaunted pseudo-documentary, ""American Arts and Culture Presents: John Horatio Malkovich, Dance of Despair and Disillusionment"". A genuinely entertaining package overall.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"This film is completely odd, but also refreshing and innovative.","I was curious to watch this movie since I read its plot synopsis, but I never thought it would be so good, I mean, this film is great! Some people say it's a just shameful auto-promotion by John Malkovich, but who cares?! If it's so, just let it be, because I don't care if the title is ""Being John Malkovich"" or ""Being Cameron Diaz"" or even ""Being the Pope"" (!); what really matters here is the movie's concept, its original idea and its message to the viewer! And about that I must say you something: it's really fantastic, one of the best movies I've seen latterly by Hollywood!The plot is original, fresh, and really different from what I've seen so far. At the beginning I just felt oddness, because the story was completely senseless, out of any possible and reasonable logic, and to increase even more this feeling of strangeness it had an alternative kind of humor, which passed too many times from the hilarity to the absurdity. But it was great either! (I can remember that scene when Lotte, Cameron Diaz's character says: ""I think it's kind of sexy that John Malkovich has a portal, you know, it's sort like he has a vagina! It's sort of vaginal, like he has a penis and a vagina!"" LOL! That's crazy stuff, man!). But if the first part of the movie is completely strange and out of any logic, the second part start giving us some answers, a bit crazy too, but at least with a little logicThe performances of the four main actors are great too: John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine keener and John Malkovich did excellent acting.This film was really refreshing and innovative. It's good to see Hollywood making alternative and excellent movies again",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Why John Malkovich?,"If you haven't seen Being John Malkovich and you are under the impression that this film is going to be completly weird you might be a little dissapointed when you watch this. Ok it is strange but in a silly way not in an arty way which is sad. Why John Malkovich agreed to star in this or even let the film go ahead is a mystery to me. Now if the film was called"" Being Bradd Pitt"" or ""Being Madonna"" in other words more interesting people this might have been better. There are some good parts of the film,the first half hour for instance when he first goes to his place of work , the seventh and half floor, it has you gripped and is funny in part but ,like the portal in craig's office it goes down hill from there. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"AVOID ""BEING JOHN MALKOVICH"" LIKE IT IS THE PLAGUE","Strong reviews, a great cast, and an interesting premise made me rent this movie; an un-funny, demented, and just plain bad film made me wish I had never been born. How this movie can be lauded as a classic is beyond me. Quite frankly, the fact that it is such a cult classic makes me wonder if the end of western civilization is near.Is it original? Yes. Is it creative? Yes. But is it GOOD?? A big NO. I must have looked at the clock every 2 minutes, just waiting for this.THING.in front of me to be over with. Just because a movie is new and original does not mean that it is good. I hate to generalize, but I certainly can see this garbage being a favorite of pseudo-intellectual, java sipping art house gurus, due to its bizarreness and originality. For most normal people, however, this movie will be nothing but a miserable experience. I've never seen a comedy that was less funny. The plot went from mildly interesting to surreal, the acting was stiff, the characters weren't compelling or endearing (how can one like a movie if the characters aren't likable, or, at the very least, interesting?), and, oh yeah, it was NOT funny at all. It will take a court order (and 10 stout men to enforce it) to ever get me to watch this horrid movie again. In fact, it'll take something extraordinary for me to ever see a Spike Jonze movie again. Yup, it was THAT bad.I've probably seen worse movies, but you'd have to give me a day or two to think of one.AVOID BEING JOHN MALKOVICH LIKE IT IS THE PLAGUE and thank me later.

One of a kind,"I've been wanting to see Charlie Kaufman's work for a long time. He's a screenwriter that I've heard so much about so I decided to watch the first ever screenplay he's written. I have to say there is no film like Being John Malkovich.Being John Malkovich tells the story of a failed puppeteer that gets a job in an office. One day, in his work area, he finds a portal which leads directly into John Malkovich's head.I don't want to give out any more details as I want people to watch it immediately and recognise the talent and creativity of Charlie Kaufman. This is his FIRST screenplay and it's amazing how he came up with such a unique and surreal idea. I'm surprised it even got made. Surely producers were reluctant to give money at a project that's as wacky as Being John Malkovich.What surprises me the most is how well executed it is. This was Spike Jonze's directorial debut and he did such a good job. He did it so well that he actually got a Best Director nomination for it. That's very impressive especially considering how it's his first film. The main credit goes to Charlie Kaufman without a doubt. This film conveys his creativity and uniqueness which sets him apart from other screenwriters. It's not just the uniqueness that make this film good but also the deeper meaning it presents to the audience. Through its weird and crazy story, Kaufman explores many themes such as the desire to become someone else, love, consciousness and identity allowing Being John Malkovich to stay etched into your mind.The performances are absolutely brilliant. This is the best I've seen John Cusack and I hope to see him in more unorthodox films like this. Cameron Diaz is almost unrecognisable here and she was terrific. Catherine Keener won the Oscar for her work in this and I cannot deny how good she was here. It must have been very strange for John Malkovich to do this film but he shines in every scene he's in.Being John Malkovich is a one of a kind film. It may not be for everyone due to its weird and surreal experience but I still implore everyone to give it a watch and marvel at its imaginative nature.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Somebody's Gotta Hate This Movie ...,"Not that I actually hated it so much as I was annoyed by it. Annoyed by the whiny, self-absorbed characters, particularly the uber-Woody-Allen-ish puppeteer played by John Cusack. Annoyed by the idea of a ""seventh-and-a-half"" floor of an office building where all the employees must stoop (ho-ho-ho). Annoyed by the secretary who mis-hears everything that's said to her (har-de-har-har). And, finally, annoyed by that damned portal into John Malcovich's head! Where the hell did this idea spring from? And why choose the New Jersey turnpike for characters to land in after they've been ejected from ... from ... where do they fly from, anyway?Okay, okay, there were numerous moments in this film that were very funny. And the idea of John Malcovich playing a parody of himself - or, rather, a parody of what the public thinks he's like - is great. As it happens, Mr. Malcovich handled his ""part"" beautifully. But it only served to remind me how much more this film would have lived up to it's title if it had been about, say, a struggling thespian or fan who is so enamored of John Malcovich that he tries to emulate him or stalk him or something like that. At least, that's what I thought the film was gonna be about till I read the reviews!I'm sorry, folks. I love innovations and it's always refreshing to see even an unsuccessful attempt to break away from the usual crop of action/smack-shion/horny teenager malarky (believe me, I'll take this puppy any day over ""The Bachelor!""). But innovative should not necessarily be confused with great. An orange with a peanut butter filling may be innovative, but that doesn't mean it's gonna taste good.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Strangely complexly simple.,"Spike Jonze has in his hands a complicated script by Charlie Kaufman, and it's amazing how it transforms this complex script, different, silly and seemingly almost infilmável in a complete audio visual work (in narrative terms), but somehow the work not me handle, it is not the fault of the film, all Spike Jonzen movies are great, but none captivates me emotionally, and this is no different, as I said before, it seems something silly, which turns into a beautiful romance (outside the traditional ), but I can not untie that premise ""Boba"" with the rest of the film, maybe Spike should use more sound resource, since this film is missing a soundtrack at times, although the sound mixing is impeccable, photography, the characters and even the extras in the scene are emblematic, some characters have only one speaks in history, but realize their great personalities, and amazing scenery, remember the Schwartz couple's home or surrealistic company that Craig (John Cusack) works, the film also has a philosophy to present, we are stuck in our bodies, our lives are miserable, we are ambition of slaves (yes, remember Fight Club), which we would not give to be someone else even for fifteen minutes? Our lives are so bad that? I do not know, or Spike will know, because it only displays the question and does not delve into it.

"Impressive and original, no doubt.","'Being John Malkovich' sure is quite something! Despite not knowing the type of movie that it is, I'm always wanted to get this one watched purely because of the title. Now I've seen it, I'm pleased I've done so. It's strange on the surface, though by the end it's... almost normal?Based on the opening and the genre it's listed under on Wikipedia, I was expecting more of an artsy sorta thing. Pleasantly, it isn't that. Of course it has deeper meaning and I'm not saying I got 100% of it, though in the end it's relatively simple. But impressive and original, no doubt.I love that John Malkovich agreed to do this, I now read that he was apparently ""half intrigued and half horrified"" when he first read the script - I can see why! John Cusack, Cameron Diaz (took me a while to recognise her) and Catherine Keener are all great behind (inside?) JM.My only criticism is that it didn't keep the humour that it shows when Craig first meets Lester, the 'Airplane!'-esque nature of it fitted so well. Sure, there is plenty of humour in there, but the deadpan delivery of Lester (and Floris, of course) is the most amusing.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fiercely original film from the mind of Charlie Kaufman,"""Being John Malkovich"" is a difficult film to describe. In it, a puppeteer-turned-office-worker discovers a door in his office that leads into the mind of actor John Malkovich. From that launching pad, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman takes us on a ride that is nothing if not original.The cast turns out to be a pretty good one even though I'm usually not much of a fan of John Cusack or Cameron Diaz. Catherine Keener is the real standout, though, as her Oscar nomination shows. John Malkovich is also a good sport in the role he was born to play.I've mentioned the film's striking originality. This proves to be a double-edged sword. While the bizarre premise makes this a film like no other the equally bizarre romances that result are somewhat difficult to relate to. So, while it's entertaining to watch there's a certain amount of emotional detachment which, for me, knocks the film down a notch.It's worth noting that Charlie Kaufman nabbed the first of (so far) three Oscar nominations for his screenplay. Director Spike Jonze was also honored with an Oscar nomination though I don't think that I would have singled him out. The film is generally well made, though, with a mostly dreary look that suits the material but is unlikely to turn any heads.If you're looking for something truly original, this film fits the bill. It certainly won't be to everybody's taste but it's worth watching to find out if it suits yours.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Whimsical and Imaginative, Nothing Else Like it,","Being John Malkovich is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a really talented cast. There is nothing else like it, as is anything from Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze, two individual film makers who are not one bit afraid to take risks, which they did here to a significant degree. It certainly does not sound good on paper, two co-workers discover a portal to the mind of John Malkovich in their office building, but everything in it really works, the story will warp your mind in a way that you will enjoy. The only problem I had was that they glossed over Dr. Lester, who is beautifully portrayed by Orson Bean, his story, a very complicated one, could have been developed much more. The film has a surprisingly sweet and inspiring message, to be true to yourself, the person you want to be, to pursue your dreams and not to hold back on what you would like to achieve, you may find it strange how a story such as that could have such a powerful methapor to it, you will have to see for yourself. The cast is outstanding and are well able to handle the film's weirdness, John Cusack and Cameron Diaz deliver one of the best performances of their careers as two damaged soles, with an obsession with Catherine Keener, a mean, manipulative, deceiving woman you can not help but love. However, Malkovich is without a doubt the star of the show, portraying a very exaggerated version of himself, I would assume, being forced to change personalities and identities throughout for certain reasons, doing it all to full effect. Weird, whimsical and somewhat inspiring, Being John Malkovich is a movie that will leave you feeling a range of different emotions, all which you will enjoy, a must watch comedy drama.When a puppeteer is forced to take a job in an office building, he soon discovers a portal that takes him in to the mind of actor John Malkovich.Best Performance: John Malkovich",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Unforgettable and it set the bar high for dark comedy,"I have seen this movie multiple times. I thought I had already reviewed it, but as I looked back over my reviews on IMDb, realized, I had been silent on my favorite dark comedy. A failure I must amend immediately.What made me think of this movie today is Catherine Keener in Get Out, the 2017 gem created by Jordan Peele, which I had to praise after watching it last night on HBO. I think it was a really smart choice for Peele to cast her. I will never forget her, since seeing her in Being John Malkovich.What I love about this movie is, well, everything--no, let me take away 1 star and give it 9, because as I recall, the ending did get a little too drawn out and overstayed its welcome. The ending did remind me of a lesson learned at UCLA Screenwriting taught by Professor Richard Walter, about beginnings and endings and when to exit the scene, and examples of sometimes when directors can't get off the stage. But it wasn't too bad, the ending, it didn't spoil the whole movie, it just went on beyond what felt like a good ending.As for the 9 stars I give it--everything, from the moment the story begins, drew me into this deliciously weird world, and it was as funny as it was mesmerizing!Every time I mention this movie to someone, I feel the urge to watch it again. And every time I have watched it again, I fall in love with its weirdness and humor all over again. So it should definitely be on the watch list of anyone who has not seen it, who likes dark comedy.

A Malkovichian Experience That Can Never Be Replicated,"A film like this has some great ideas in its head. What if you could go inside the head of one of the most underrated actors of all time, John Malkovich? That's a question that you've probably never thought of but wish you did after seeing one of the best films of the 20th century, Being John Malkovich. Easily a movie that could only be written by the one and only genius madman himself Charlie Kaufman and directed by the other genius madman Spike Jonze. The genius of this film is the subtext surrounding itself. Being John Malkovich is a film about identity, longing, the complexities of the mind and what we really want out of life.The film starts with Craig Schwartz, played by John Cusack, using a marionette puppet destroying his property around him. The puppet looks strikingly like Schwartz and in that one scene we see the complexities and possessiveness of Cusack's character in just one scene. Being John Malkovich is about said puppeteer, Craig Schwartz, who gets work at office 7 ½ discovers a doorway in his office that when entering inside of it allows you to be in the mind of John Malkovich. But as the film progresses Schwartz is finding out more and more about the people he loves as he delves in more into the psyche of Malkovich. The wonderfully original script by Charlie Kaufman who has written some of my favorite movies, Adaptation, Anomalisa, and my personal favorite of his Synecdoche, New York. It's funny how I have just found the time to watch what has now just become, in the matter of a few hours, one of my favorite films of all time. It's mix of drama and comedy makes this a standout of any film that will ever exist. Being John Malkovich is a triumph to the world in saying that crazy can make the world a better more brighter place for film.Spike Jonze has impressed me ever since I saw his marvelous romance film, Her, and by seeing his directorial debut it shows me that Jonze has never lost that spark of creativity or brilliance that was shown to the world in 1999. It's shocking to realize that this was his first feature film and has topped many people's favorite films of all time. I can see a bit of what Kaufman and Jonze would bring to the world in the next decade. In a way Jonze and Kaufman is making us the audience Craig Schwartz. By letting us infer on what they want to show us and what the characters in their movie are trying to express but can't with the possessiveness of Schwartz. It's truly fantastic that a movie can let us feel what we want to feel rather than how we feel. I haven't gotten into this as much but Being John Malkovich is one of the funniest dark comedies I have ever seen in my life. It has a great mesh of it and isn't always hilariously goofy or always grimly dark but a good mixture of the two that will never be replicated. Much like the performances in this that will never be replicated.This movie is filled with career bests for everyone in the cast. John Cusack, Catherine Keener, Cameron Diaz, and the one and only John Malkovich give mind boggling prowess to their roles. As mentioned previously Cusack can easily bring a complexity to a character that you should hate but you don't because of his empatheticness and possessiveness. He bends the ways of how the audience sees him to try to paint a false idol of what he wants to be but isn't. Sadly he explores the part in us humans that we can never escape from, not getting what we think we deserve. Schwartz goes crazy mad when he spills his heart and guts for a woman that couldn't care less about him. Diaz has the best performance of her career in this film. She brings the side of humanity of trying to find out who we are and are we actually being honest to ourselves or are we just trying to change ourselves so that we can be the best for other and not what's best for us. But the standout of this is the titular actor/character himself, John Malkovich. Malkovich brings the side of humanity that is quite fascinating to me. Are our thoughts actually our thought? Are we thinking what we want to think or is an outside source just making us think the things they want us to think. I'm honestly surprised that I have written this much about only 3 characters in this film. But isn't that what shows the beauty of this film? That I can dissect it and think about it at this level of depth and still be mesmerized by it and want to go back and rewatch it as soon as possible! I think so.Being John Malkovich is the greatest gift the 1990s ever left on us and shows that we don't need to follow the same norms that the Hollywood industry has put on us as audience members and we can see actual bright ideas that don't follow the normalcy of what we put up with throughout the year. A grandeur of the surreal and a favorite of mine that I want to rewatch over and over and over. Being John Malkovich is that times a thousand.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Seamless Fusion of Fantasy In A Real World Environment.,"Exciting, intriguing & incredibly original, Being John Malkovich is a seamless fusion of fantasy in a real world environment and presents an interesting theory of a portal that leads into the body of a different person. The screenplay is freshly imagined & smartly scripted by Charlie Kaufman and is stunningly presented on the screen by director Spike Jonze. The point of view shots are nicely carried out, editing never lets the excitement run out for the entire runtime & the performances by everyone is pretty much up to the mark.John Cusack stars as Craig Schwartz; an unsuccessful puppeteer who discovers the portal into John Malkovich's mind, Cameron Diaz is Lotte Shwartz; Craig's pet-obsessed wife & finally we have Katherine Keener as Maxine; Craig's co-worker who decides to exploit the portal in order to make some bucks. John Malkovich plays himself in this film & his performance among the cast was the bravest & most impressive. The film also includes cameos from Charlie Sheen, Sean Penn & others playing a fictional version of themselves.On an overall scale, Spike Jonze's directional debut feature is one of those films which you mustn't miss out. You have to really see it to believe how amazing its concept is & how much sense its themes make in the real world atmosphere. The less you know about it, the better will be the experience. So, stop reading more about this film & just go watch it if you still haven't. In a sentence, Being John Malkovich is one of the finest films of the 90s.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Neither Fiche nor Foul (Well, maybe a little)","BEING JOHN MALKOVICH opens brilliantly, an unbelievably beautiful demonstration of puppeteering, which introduces us to Craig Schwartz (John Cusak), a tormented artist, far more capable of communicating his passions and angst via his puppets than directly to his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz). Not too surprising, since Lotte is a fairly gross and dirty human being, who kisses and shares her beverages with her chimpanzee. In fact, the most unbelievable line in the movie is Lotte asking Craig to let her ""take a shower."") Lotte doesn't strike me a person whom would ever want one.  Perhaps due to this, Craig becomes immediately smitten when he meets Maxine (Christine Keener), a slightly slutty, fairly attractive gold digger, when he answers an ad for a ""man with fast hands to do filing"" at Dr. Lester's (Orson Bean).  What Dr. Lester does is not all that clear, but the business apparently involves handling files for other companies. Interesting, because the offices are tiny, and not just because the place has ""low overhead,"" being the 7 1/2 floor.  Anyway, while filing, Craig discovers an opening behind one of the cabinets.  Entering it, he discovers a portal into actor John Malcovich's psche.  Up to this point the movie is a brilliant existentialist comedy (the best since BRAZIL).  However, about two thirds of the way through the film, too much information is revealed, turning the film into fantasy/sci fi. Sorry, this movie doesn't have the budget for it.  It makes an old OUTER LIMITS episode look like STAR WARS EPISODE 1 by comparison.  It also calls into question everything which has proceeded.  Fantasy/sci fi must be grounded in some form of plausibility.  Companies which keep files either have huge climate controlled storage, use disks or, at least microfiche. Dirty or not, Diaz is still too desirable to make Craig's obsession with Maxine (Catherine Keener) all that convincing. Diaz is good in the part, but her casting throws the film way off.  Either the producers should have cast Ellen DeGeneres in the part, or have cast Michelle Pfieffer as Maxine.Ultimately, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is a fairly amusing disappointment, much better in concept than execution.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fantastical, Absurd, Brilliant","Few films have earned their own wholly unique space in the Pantheon as has the nearly unimaginable ""Being John Malkovich."" Part comedy and part acid trip gone awry, this is a maniacally sidesplitting meisterwerk of the first order, and one that somehow projects as both deviously plotted and joyously unrestrained.By night, dead-end puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is mired in a futile marriage to pet-centric wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz). By day, he's a clerk for New York's deceptively plain-wrappered LesterCorp, where he toils on the low-ceilinged 7-½ floor. Craig gets the hots for coworker Maxine Lund (Catherine Keener), who flatly can't be bothered. He soon finds a small door behind a filing cabinet, and into it - and into the mind of legendary thespian actor John Malkovich - he crawls. For fifteen minutes per session, Craig can see the world through Malkovich's eyes before being unceremoniously dumped roadside at the Jersey Turnpike. He can't help but share the portal with Maxine, and together, they monetize the Malkovich experience like that of a $200 amusement park ride.Malkovich himself is plainly stunning in his straight-faced repurposing of his real-life self. And despite the onslaught of elite work that followed, director Spike Jonze has never been as magical as he is in his feature film debut. Yet above all else, ""Being John Malkovich"" is a master class in writing - both in its wildly unshackled conception and throughout its methodically brilliant execution - and only the great Charlie Kaufman can be held responsible. This is the film you present to aspiring scribes as screenwriting at its most aspirational. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!)

An original idea and that's about it,"Why this movie is so overrated eludes me. If it's just a pleasant light romantic comedy that's okay.

Not Quite as Original As You May Think...,"Well, first of I want to make clear that I am a person who is not put off by out there concepts nor am I intellectually devoid. I only point this out as many people seem to think they could be the only reasons why a person could not enjoy this 'masterpiece'. I'm not going to say this film's awful, but I will say it's over rated. All the cast put in a good performance and I particularly enjoyed John Cusack as I usually do yet I felt cheated by this film. Firstly, the concept of delving into someone elses mind in some kind of voyeuristic power trip is nothing new, it has been explored in novels before today, and even video games i.e. Body Rides by Richard Laymon and the game Psychic Detective. I state this to show that the idea behind this film isn't so revolutionary as some may think. In Laymon's Body Rides a bracelet is used to go in the mind of others and, coincidentally, the main character in the story ultimately uses the bracelet to jump into somebody elses mind to escape death. And in Psychic Detective the main character can do the same merely by though. I'm not saying the stories are identical but they do share common ideas. Secondly, I just couldn't relate to the characters, I know they were supposed to be obnoxious but I ended up almost not giving a damn about them as a result of this. However, at this point, I must point out something that did touch me in this film, it was Cusack's character (Craig) who's fate was somewhat undeserved and I felt sympathy for him, his act showing that he did indeed love Maxine, and I also found the thought of Malkovich's daughter becoming the next vessel disturbing as, in essence, Lester/Malkovich/etc was stealing somebody's life. To sum up as a whole, the film did have points where I chuckled or felt something but I ultimately felt denied and I think people should allow other people to think that this film isn't as good as it has been made out to be. In my opinion, if a friend has it, borrow it and see for yourself but don't waste your money on a rental or a DVD, it's just not worth it. Even if you enjoy fringe cinema as I do, you will find no substance in this film to satisfy you, only a huge hollow space around which there is a thinly woven plot.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Being on top of it!!!,"First things first, Lets all applaud Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman for creating such an incredible and original piece of film.

Laughs that are not over the top to the point of stupidity, all though there are times where it is appropriate, but laughs that are still laugh out loud funny.

They did not take a sci-fi approach and hook the 'visitors' to electrodes in order to transport them into Malkovich. This was done in The Cell. The portal in an office building made this movie believable. I hardly recognized Camreon Diaz until the end. She should have received an Oscar for her performance but it was Hilary Swank's year.

Incredibly interesting. This is one of the most unique films I have ever seen!,"I have heard non stop about how awesome Being John Malkovich is, basically I think that's why I had stayed clear of this film. I thought it might not live up to my expectations, due to the fact that I absolutely love the actor John Malkovich, I was afraid that this film might damage his name for me. But I decided to give this film a chance when my mom said that she liked it very much and to give it a shot, so I watched it with an ""open mind""... lol... get it? Eh, well, I got a pleasant surprise when I watched this film, it was fantastic. It was the perfect cast, amazing settings, incredible camera work, and not to mention a very unique story that was so interesting to watch.Craig and Lotte Schwartz are a ratty looking married couple. Craig is a struggling puppeteer and Lotte takes care of sick animals at their house. She asks Craig to get a real job, he ends up getting one, in this building as a filer where the ceiling is less than 6 feet tall. Everyone acts very strange, but he meets a beautiful young woman, Maxine, a player of her league. He becomes obsessed with her, well, everyone seems to naturally love her. Craig one day finds a portal that leads to the mind of actor John Malkovich and exploits it with Maxine. But Lotte becomes more obsessed with the portal and discovers a deeper side with it followed by a group of people.Being John Malkovich I would have to agree that it is one of those movies you just have to see. It's so strange but works on so many levels. The cast was just beyond perfect, I mean, you can barely recognize some of them, especially Cameron Diaz, what a role breaker. Her and John Cusack were absolutely great in the scene where they are fighting over Maxine and who truly loves her more. Well, the whole cast was great and I would highly recommend this film, it's great entertainment.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pretty awful,"I do not understand what all the fuss is about and why this movie received such a high rating by many viewers.

Unfortunately the execution of the idea is terrible.

But on further reflection I realized that that's what was wrong with it; they were trying so hard to be clever.  It didn't have that innate cleverness that comes from someone who's original and inventive; it was that labored cleverness that makes you uncomfortable and want to turn away and not watch.The main characters (Craig, Lotte, and Maxine) were all completely repellent.

But even if the above makes absolutely no sense to you, there's still a good chance you'll like the film.The idea of shared and/or exchanged consciousness is not new - I have no idea how far back it goes in literature (my degree being not in literature, but in biochemistry from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio; so I cracked up very early in the film when Dr. Lester remarks that Floris has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western - no such degree program exists currently;). In the past few decades I can think of a few Star Trek episodes that dealt with the situation and a short story (""Human Is"") by Philip K. Dick.I'm sure there were a lot of little quips in the film that had either multiple meanings or just single ones that slipped me by. The film was so whimsical that there were very few times that the general good humor was overwhelmed by the more serious incidents. The 7 1/2th floor concept had the audience I was in chuckling for an enormous period of time.But the frivolity is underlaid with some interesting philosophical concepts, which Craig (John Cusack) mentions several times in the film.

Malkovich is marvelous,"A bizarre and deliciously inventive comedy. Cusack is excellent as a puppeteer who stumbles into a portal that leads to the head of John Malkovich. Keener is a delight as a woman that Cusack and wife Diaz are both attracted to. TV veterans Bean and Place provide good support. And nobody plays John Malkovich better than John Malkovich. His is a masterfully controlled performance that does not lapse into caricature. Like screenwriter Kaufman's ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Minde,"" this film is based on a far-fetched premise, but, whereas those two films fall apart after promising starts, the brilliance is sustained here. A good deal of the credit for that goes to Jonze.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Malkovich mind warp,"Cusack plays a creatively frustrated puppeteer who must take a desk job to make ends meet and subsequently discovers a secret portal into the mind's-eye of John Malkovich between two floors in the building in which he works. Though married, he becomes enamoured by the sultry co-worker (Keener) and, eager to impress her, uses the secret portal as his hook prompting the entrepreneurial vixen to devise a plan to sell experiences (ranging from the mundane - like eating breakfast - to more cultural immersions like POV of the beast with two backs) through the portal to rake a profit. Matters become complicated when both Cusack and Keener compete for the power over Malkovich's sub-consciousness, causing jealousy to emerge.It's the sort of movie you'll either appreciate or dismiss as a self-indulgent abstraction and while the concept is occasionally difficult to absorb, the plot is much easier to digest. The puppetry featured in this movie is exceptional; even if you don't possess an interest in the art, the dexterity with which the puppeteer (Phillip Huber) makes his marionette 'performers' interact is magical.Keener is a seductive and ultimately brash characterisation and should fog up your face furniture (particularly one scene with Malkovich), while Cusack plays his ubiquitous alter-ego, the intellectual man-child, consumed by neuroticism, urban paranoia, struggling to define himself amongst the masses; another watchable, if somewhat familiar portrayal. Malkovich makes a typically arrogant namesake, but as always, his enigmatic, eccentric appeal makes for a quirky, offbeat but entertaining picture unlikely to reach the masses, but a boldly interesting subject just the same for those who'd dare.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Has to be seen to be believed,"'Being John Malkovich' had to be one of the hardest films to get made. I can't imagine how the sales pitch must have gone. I figure writer (and possible madman?!) Charlie Kaufman must have used words like 'portal, puppets, low ceilings' and 'multitude of over-s3xed old people piling into the mind of a Hollywood actor.' Yes, all those things happen.You could simply describe the film as 'weird,' but that would probably do the film a great disservice. It's simply a masterpiece and possibly has to be seen to be believed. It's so bizarre and off-the-wall that you enter a world where anything can happen, but at the same time, seems somehow relatable and 'real.'I won't go into the plot in too much detail. First of all I would never want to spoil such a classic. Once you get into it you'll soon realise that the story could literally go anywhere and you'll only get the one chance at watching it without knowing how it will all end up. Secondly, if I gave a detailed plot synopsis you probably would think I'm making it up. It sort of centres around Craig (John Cusack) and his desire to be a puppeteer which isn't really making him or his wife (Cameron Diaz) any money. So he takes a filming job where he meets a sultry co-worker, Maxine (Katherine Keener) who he immediately falls for. However, what starts off as what could just potentially could be yet another love triangle soon goes off the rails when the trio discover a small tunnel in Craig's office which leads directly into John Malkovich's head. From there, things really get weird.All four of the central protagonists are brilliant and memorable in their own right (the fourth main cast member being of course - Malkovich - playing a warped version of himself as he struggles to figure out what's going on inside his head. There are a few peripheral characters too who also play their part and whose kookiness all help add to the surreal madness.For all 'Being John Malkovich's' brilliance, it's probably not a film you can have on in the background and fully appreciate. It's something you have to invest a couple of hours into to get the most out of it. And, if you do, I think you'll find a film that is just as good (and a damn sight more novel) than 99% of what comes out of Hollywood these days. However, if you're looking for a 'negative take,' I was once discussing this film with my friend and he didn't like it. I couldn't believe anyone could hate this film and, when I asked him what he found so bad, he simply said that the whole premise was too 'unrealistic.' What does he know, eh?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Cute, zany, absurd, and fun . . . but deep?  Uh, no.","I had seen this one about a couple years back.  My recollection of it was that it was a fun, witty, pretty original comedy, but not especially deep, moving, or inventive.  I do have to think that if this is what passes for deep and challenging (or even ""BRILLIANT!""), audiences may really be that dumbed down.  If you're interested in the philosophical questions this raised (and I say this as a student of philosophy), then go delve into the relevant philosophical texts and you'll find out how superficial a treatment of the subject this is.The most poignant philosophical question involved is whether one person could *be* another.  Does John Malkovich really exist any more as the person he was once a Craig Schwartz takes over?  The answer is: Craig Schwartz was being Craig Schwartz, using (what was previously) John Malkovich's body. John M.'s identity is effectively annihilated.  And then . . . what?  It does raise some serious questions, but the movie didn't point toward any answer because it would have ruined the comic effect of it all.  It's not intended to make sense, obviously, but the effect of this, in this movie anyway, isn't intellectual but comic -- that is, because it doesn't really bring any intellectual tools to answer or even really address any of these hard questions.  See it as a zany, absurd, light-weird comedy, not as some intellectually engaging masterpiece.  It just doesn't deserve to be taken that seriously, and the film's authors seem to agree.That was my original opinion of the movie, and my second viewing of it in the last couple days left my opinion virtually unchanged.This site's database tells me that I had registered a vote of 6/10 for this movie.  (For me, I try grading on a real curve, so a 6/10 is above-average.) My second viewing of it led me to think either a 6 or a 7 out of 10, and seeing as my previous rating is a 6, my heart isn't in raising it to a 7. 6.5 out of 10 if half-points apply.One of the more overrated movies on the site, but it seems to have been slowly sliding downward, and rightfully so -- like a number of other overrated flicks from 1999, I might add.

Incomparably Inventive and Uniquely Funny,"""Being John Malkovich"" is a laugh out loud, creative hoot.It is incomparably inventive.With Kaufman writing the script particularly with the titular actor in mind it's hard to think of what other actor's persona would fit in as well, as Malkovich's protean roles leaning toward the bad guys makes for an effective back-story that say another wouldn't work as well.It was like a Monty Python cartoon come to life -- completely unpredictable and creative in every scene and in every angle and detail.I think director Spike Jonze put in a bunch of references to music videos that also have an absurdist touch - such as the last scene looking like Nirvana's ""In Utero"" cover?(originally written 11/14/1999)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good stuff - only just misses out on being first-rate,"The story could easily have been published in `The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction', or (this is less of a compliment but certainly not a criticism) `Asimov's'.  Anyone who liked the movie should certainly look through these publications, and others like them.  Both magazines are still very much alive and it's a pity they're not read more.  But for maximum pleasure, do try to find some copies of `Fantasy and Science Fiction' from its glory days of the 1950s and 1960s.  (Please don't do this if you live in Australia, because I'm trying to track down old copies myself.)Indeed, the story would probably have reached its ideal type in literary form, so it's a pity Kaufman DIDN'T submit it to the magazines - they wouldn't have paid as much, but he could always have made a screenplay out of the idea later.  Some aspects (like the thirteenth-and-a-halfth floor, and the puppetry) are well suited to cinema, but the central conceit would be better served by the written word.  How does one SHOW, visually, that Craig is receiving all the sensory information that John Malkovich is receiving?  I don't thing Kaufman and Jonze quite solve this problem.There are people out there who think that good plots, intelligent dialogue, consistency and cleverness are all purely literary virtues, of no particular value in the cinema.  This is a silly view.  Any work of art that has a plot can be judged according to the quality of its plot; any work of art capable of manifesting intelligence can be judged according to how intelligent it is.  Speaking of which, I do have one quibble ...As everyone knows, there's this tunnel; and when one gets to the end of the tunnel, one experiences whatever John Malkovich is experiencing.  What happens when John Malkovich himself enters the tunnel?  The film offers an answer, and it's pretty lame.  Not that I know myself what would happen.  I guess it's under-determined.  But here's a thought: suppose there's a time-delay, so that a person in the tunnel experiences whatever Malkovich experienced, say, 0.01 seconds earlier.  THEN John Malkovich entering the tunnel would experience 0.01 seconds of John Malkovich entering the tunnel, again and again, and maybe each copy of the experience would be more degraded than the last.I can't think of anything wrong with the details of the story.  It's because of the story that `Being John Malkovich' is so good, if not the masterpiece everyone seems to think it is.  The cinematic prose could do with a bit of a re-write.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Remarkable presentation.,"I'm leaving many stones unturned in this review as I watch this film a lot and will review it each time I watch it. I don't want to use too many talking points in any one review of a film I know I'll be watching again in the near future.All of these actors give their best performances here. I usually don't enjoy John Cusack, Cameron Diaz oe even John Malkovich himself, but as I said they're all fantastic. A lot of this is down to the look of each of these characters, this point doesn't apply to John Malkovich but everyone else is almost unrecognisable. My favourite performance is Katherine Keener's and her character is also my favourite, she's really complex and I relate to her a lot.The presentation is something that really stuck out to me on this most recent viewing as well, the presentation of the sex scenes in particular. They're really funny but they're also quite emotional at the same time. I thought one of these scenes involving Cameron Diaz' character Lotte was genuinely powerful.Anyway this movie's pretty good, you should watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Excellence in Imagination,"I first saw this film while in college. I wasn't much of a critic then(perhaps not now either) and was mostly in to the action flicks where acting and content fell second, or third. This film struck me as an oddity of anything I had previously seen. And most of that is not due to the concept and plot, but the original execution. Different is good. Thought provoking is good. The idea of Being John Malcovich, or anyone else; celebrity or not, is of course no new idea to anyone. The execution this film has to offer; the acting, the philosophical, theological, and idealogical inferences(both divulged in the diologue and those indirect) allows the viewer for much conversation after the film ends.THIS film practically changed my film genre preference. For myself, its one of those films that I show to friends for their personal reactions and as stated, provides good some good post film conversation.

Creativity masks glaring flaws,"Completely original, but blatantly violating the basic laws of film making, 'Being John Malkovich is a movie that invites you to laugh at its absurdity. i have no complaints with the plot. In fact, it comes along as refreshing and arouses anticipation of anyone who bothers to read the movie synopsis before watching a film. A surreal concept, which a portal to someone's brain is, requires that similar treatment in the movie. Yet, the portal is almost dismissed in the movie as being nothing more than commonplace and mundane. To see the director overlooking the essence of fantasy and instead weave a story on its fringe is sad because as viewers you are left salivating for the meaty substance that never comes. The acting is mediocre, and the scenes are patched together many times instead of a coherent narrative. The film expects to sell on novelty, but so many of natural consequences arising from an imaginative plot. The film is humorous at times, but overall feels like the director felt like he had a great idea and decided to sell that instead of making a film around it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Disappointed -- still a good film though,"I wish I could never expect things from films, before I have seen them. In fact, I wish films would be released in Sweden at the same time as in the USA. I have come to the conclusion (after having seen ""Being John Malkovich"") that *no* film could ever live up to the high expectations I had when I walked into the cinema today. I actually had this feeling of unreality when I sat down at my seat, I was like: ""I can't believe I'm actually going to watch this film!"" The reason for me thinking that is 1) that I have longed to see it for so long and 2) that I live in a small town (population: 95,000) in Sweden where it wasn't even certain that ""Being John Malkovich"" would be shown. So, of course, I was hugely disappointed. Let me tell you right away, though, that I liked the film. The premise is totally bizarre and very fascinating, the acting is brilliant (especially Catherine Keener and John Malkovich), and it was rather entertaining. However, it is also about twenty minutes too long, and I think the original story was taken too far. In the end, it wasn't very funny anymore, only sad since you realize that none of the people in the film are likeable at all, with the exception of poor John Malkovich, who is being used and abused in the worst way, :-).

One hell of a head spinner,"Have you ever felt like there was more too life than simply what's available. That sense of emptiness you feel, it's indescribable and you can't seem to find a way to fulfill that void. Many of us make that exact claim every single waking day. Whether we're held back by physical obstacles or by our own minds. It's these restrictions that we often try to rationalize that keeps us from exceeding our expectations. But what if you can erase those limitations, start over again, with a helping hand? That is what ""Being John Malkovich"" effectively demonstrates.""Being John Malkovich"" is truly an awe-inspiring film that desperately tries to define the blurred lines between fantasy and reality. Craig Schwartz, played by John Cusack, is a talented puppeteer who vicariously lives through his dolls, until he is forced into the redundant lifestyle of the generic work culture. However, Schwartz finds something to look forward to, a female co-worker that hooks him and infests his mind and soul. I'll skip forward to not spoil anything, but, Schwartz comes across a worm-hole that allows him to peak through the eyes of actor John Malkovich. Realizing the possibilities that the worm-hole possesses, Schwartz takes his opportunity to hijack Malkovich and become him.The film flies by at around 2 hours and does a consistent job at balancing the fine lines of fantasy, comedy, romance and drama. Overall ""Being John Malkovich"" is a head spinning, self-reflecting piece of art that will peak your fascinations. I came away asking more questions than I intended and that's what makes the film riveting. Although it may not be for everyone it righteously earns it's cult praise and film achievements.

"Jonze certainly has talent, but ""Being John Malkovich"" is not his best","This movie has a truly bizarre premise. Let's just get that out of the way off the bat. Before I started watching, I was already excited to see how such a bizarre idea could function on screen. But, a lot of movies don't live up to their premise, and this is one of them.It isn't just the premise that is bizarre: the characters are even more wacky. In a strange and unfamiliar world, I expect a movie to have a strong protagonist with whom I can identify. This movie had no such thing. The protagonist is so strange and illogical that the viewer feels like an outsider looking in for the entirety of the film. When everyone on screen is a weirdo, I'm not too invested in their interpersonal drama.""Weird"" and ""deep"" are not one in the same. Jonze puts a cast of weird characters on screen but he gives them no depth. Catherine Keener's character is the supreme example of this: she is supposed to be confident, sexy, and complex, but she comes off as random, illogical, and weird. She doesn't act like a real person, she acts like a poorly written character in a film that's trying too hard to be artsy.Nonetheless, the movie packs some laughs. Appearances from celebrities playing themselves is always good for a smile from the audience, and this film does it in an amusing way. There are also two short mockumentaries within the film that are pretty much gold.If you are drawn to the premise like I was, or you like Jonze's other work, you're probably going to watch this movie. I still can't recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The characters quickly engage in deviant behavior so far fetched, it is neither relatable nor enjoyable to watch. Rent something else.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing; not engaging,"It certainly is one of the most unique and original movies you'll have seen in a while. I just feel it can't be termed a GREAT movie because it appeals far more to the intellect than your emotions, and I think a great movie has to have some emotional resonance - whether it stirs sympathy/empathy, or loathing. All the characters in BJM are essentially dislikable or pitiable, but their characterization/motivation is based in a fantastic situation and so far removed from life-like experience that you end up emotionally detached from the goings on.What it has going for it: Unlike anything you've seen - a trippily absurd fantasy of a movie; a great comic performance by Malkovich himself, and a strong and sassy turn by Keener; some amazing cinematography, especially where the puppetry is involved; fun cameos; some truly hilarious moments - the falling bodies cracked me up every time, and I loved the street puppeteering sequence w/the lusting nun/monk.What it has against it: Cusack's role, though competently acted, just doesn't fill the center of the movie. Granted that has much to do with his character (a puppeteer whose puppets are his outward expression of soul) - so in a way it's a testament to his good acting; it just feels a little weightless. The closest ""empty"" character I can think of is Chauncey Gardner in ""Being There"" (must be that ""Being"" thing)... a fine film/novel (Jerzy Kosinzski) about a shut-in simpleton whose only exposure to the outside world is via television, who is unwittingly thrust onto the streets and into the public eye - where his idiocy is mistaken for profundity.As noted by other people, the whole concept of being thrust into someone else's consciousness could be made more interesting than the psycho-sexual drama that serves for the main plot in the second half of BJM.Well ... that's my movie criticism for the day. Well worth renting - just doesn't quite live up to its potential, and is more intellectually stimulating than involving.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An imaginative masterpiece with the most bizarre, yet profoundly intelligent, feeling ...","""Being John Malkovich"", what a title! I really didn't know what to expect exactly  an introspective film, some kind of intellectual drama essentially trying to capture the existential issues of the titular actor's tormented mind, I didn't think of a fantasy anyway, and certainly didn't anticipate this piece of cinematic creativity and visual awesomeness my mind would endure for less than two hours. ""Being John Malkovich"" is not only one of the most creative movies of the last 20 years, but certainly one of the cleverest and most mind-bending and twisted scripts ever concocted from a newcomer, his name is Charlie Kauffman, and this is definitely one of these reviews that must start by a thunder of verbal applauds for the writing.Though the movie is not the most quotable of all, like ""Network"" or ""Chinatown"", it features more similarities with scripts à la ""Rashomon"" or ""The Usual Suspects"", these intricate puzzles where you have to assemble each piece until the end, but in the case of ""Being John Malkovich"", it's less about a resolution or a revelation than how far a movie can exploit an inventive concept, how long it can hook the audiences' minds with an ingenious plot device. This is why the script is actually closer to movies like ""Back to the Future"" and ""Groundhog Day"". And when the plot consists on having people being in someone else's body, let alone John Malkovich, well, besides the thrills, besides the laughs, the movie should feature a necessary level of depth. Indeed, when you have such a goldmine for plot twists, you must handle them carefully and on that level, Charlie Kauffman did it with a remarkable craftsmanship. And even if you expect to be surprised, it's nothing compared to the exhilarating cinematic experience of the first viewing.The symbolism that structures the whole narrative is highlighted during the opening credits where you discover a marvelous puppet's number directed by Greg Schwartz, John Cusack whose appearance immediately labels him in the antihero 'slash' loser category. Greg is so devoured by his own passion that he's totally neglecting his couple. And despite the apparent love between Greg and his wife Lotte, there's the strong feeling that both belong to two different worlds, he works in the basement, taking care of his puppets with the delicacy of a God-like figure caring about his creations, while Lotte, live with her animals on the top, creating a touching mini-zoo in the house. The only similarity between the two is their looks, by the way, only after the first half hour, I realized it was Cameron Diaz below that huge afro. Even though she's not the most feminine cinematic character, she genuinely wants children, but Greg seems reluctant because of his unemployment, which Lotte understands  the film doesn't waste its time with these two wannabe-anything and quickly gets to the point, when Greg replies to a job offer.Greg's skillful hands get him the job in a peculiar and mysterious 'filling' company set, in the 7th and half floor, probably the lowest roof from any work place. Go figure why Kauffman decided to insert an element that wouldn't have changed much the plot. I guess this is the difference between talented and great directors, the low roof element created a bit of visual jokes to distract us before the third element of the future love triangle makes her entrance, Catherine Keener as Maxine, Greg's ambitious, sexy co-worker, she talks straightforwardly and doesn't embarrass herself with social hypocrisy. For a man who lives with a girl like Lotte, now I understand why Cameron Diaz had to look anything but sexy, he naturally falls in love with the scene-stealing Maxine, but she's not interested. Now, all the pieces are ready and the game can start when Greg accidentally discovers a strange tunnel that leads to John Malkovich's body. Why Malkovich? How does it work? Why fifteen minutes in his body? That's the charm, did you really want to know why the Groundhog Day was repeating itself?I was so delighted by the premise I couldn't wait to see where this would get, until the intelligence's highlight of the film was reached when Lotte was John Malkovich and when what followed set a whole new psychoanalytical mood. The film is not about being John Malkovich, but becoming another person. Greg discovers the ultimate puppetry, as a man who brings life to objects, now he can insufflate life to a human being, dictating his gestures, his thoughts, his sexual impulses, being God in a pervert sort of way. Is his fantasy the sublime allegory of puppetry's beauty or is puppetry the incarnation of a sordid and lusty desire? Maxine doesn't need the experience because she's naturally a controlling woman, and her desire is to control John Malkovich while he's controlled by either Greg or Lotte. And for Lotte, it's the epiphany, the flash of realization that she's not trapped in John Malkovich, but in her own body, discovering finally the sensation of being a man. Lotte loves animals, she loves life, it's all about the sensation of living again, while Greg uses people as objects to satisfy his personal impulses. Maxine is simply torn between these two approaches, which might explain why she appealed to both Greg and Lotte.The movie reveals our deepest fantasies or sexual torments, the desire to be the same person in another body, sometimes from a different sex, to have one person we love in another body  in both cases it's about the distinction between the mind and the body as a source of discomfort or satisfaction, and John Malkovich's body is the humble setting of a mind-blowing experimentation highlighting our conditions as clumsy puppets directed by our consciences whose strings are pulled by our subconscious or by other persons or by sex, by God, you name them. A anyway, the result is an existential masterpiece questioning our own control on our lives!Malkovich!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Being pleasantly entertained.,"This was my first time with this movie. I had no idea it was this funny. I loved the idea of the 7th Floor. Orson Bean gives a classic performance as the old-guy boss at Cusack's job. He gives a very Leslie Nielson-esque performance. This is definitely a great one for Cusack. His character was fantastic too! The best one in the film actually. Charlie Sheen as Charlie Sheen was a nice touch too. Directed by Spike Jonze who was Conrad in Three Kings.The last half of the film, however, starts to get a little silly. A love story between two of the characters starts to ruin the film and a gun-chase scene just derails things a bit. Malkovich was amazing, but I think his character enters into a key element in the film too earlier. That hurt too. But, the troubles that befall the second half of the film are no match for the excellent performances, other wonderful characters (along with Malkovich, except for that one part) and again, it had some great laughs in it too.8.3 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The director and actors of ""Being John Malkovich"" are having this dream, and to them it makes sense, but to the audience, it doesn't, because we are watching the dream from the outside - and that i","Being John MalkovichSome films released nowadays strive to be essentially original and in no way interesting. While ""Being John Malkovich"" is both original and interesting - to a certain degree - it is in no way a great movie.John Cusack plays a puppeteer named Craig, whom is married to a frizzle-haired woman named Lotte (Cameron Diaz). They live in a small apartment with exotic animals, including iguanas, parrots, and a chimp named Elijah, which has a repressed mental problem.Cusack's character gets a job in the classifieds as filer for a company with small overhead. (Literally!) He lusts after a fellow worker, named Maxine (Catherine Keener), but she ignores him.One day while he's working, a file drops behind a cabinet and when he goes to retrieve it, he finds a small door leading into a dark vessel. (Much like the rabbit hole in ""Alice in Wonderland."")After crawling through the hole-in-the-wall, Craig finds that it leads into John Malkovich's head. Yes, that's right, John Malkovich's head. Anyone who enters can see out of Malkovich's head for fifteen minutes.and maybe longer.After telling Lotte and his fellow associate Maxine about his wonderful and exuberating experience, Craig is lured into opening a small business centered entirely on the hole in the wall, and soon people from all over are entering John Malkovich's head for a large fee.But pretty soon, chaos ensues, and Diaz's character is entering Malkovich's head so she can be with other women. And as all this happens, Malkovich begins to suspect that something is going on - he is losing control over his own body. But why - and how?The film really has no sense of reality. It starts out with an odd feeling, but it is enjoyable. Everything is symbolic, and the surroundings bring out emotions in the characters. It's a bit like the beginning of ""Joe versus the Volcano,"" where Hanks practically lives in that stuffy office. Remember how dark and dank the office was? That's what John Cusack's office in the film is like - everyone must crouch over as to not hit the ceiling. But much like ""Joe versus the Volcano,"" the movie begins to withdraw itself into just plain crazy. Nothing makes sense at all, and the film starts to achieve a sick sense of reality. (Diaz turns into a lesbian, for one thing, and the film treats it like it is normal.)For example, when Diaz is having an affair with Keener, and Cusack's character knows about it, he doesn't seem to care a whole lot about the fact that his wife is cheating on him. It just doesn't make sense, really.But I'll give the film the fact that it is strangely original and startlingly provocative. I mean, really, who ever thought about making a film where someone enters John Malkovich's head? And what about all the stuff later in the film? It is more than original - it is just plain.weird!John Cusack does a great job as Craig. He looks like a sixties hippy with his long, greasy hair and geeky countenance.Cameron Diaz is completely dissolved in her character. She looks so ugly and different in this film that you think, is that REALLY her?Catherine Keener, who was just in ""S1m0ne"" with Al Pacino, definitely got her career kick-started out of this film. I don't recall seeing her in many things before this movie.And John Malkovich is.well.John Malkovich.Director Spike Jonze does a good thing with the idea he is given, and the film uses so many ideas that they could fill at least ten movies themselves. Unfortunately, because of the way the film turns out to be, I didn't enjoy it that much.Maybe I didn't love it because I expected so much, and because it lost me half way through. I followed it in the beginning, and understood how everything was symbolic, but after the halfway point the film starts to not really make any sense and just gets weird. In one scene we see some individuals running through Malkovich's subconscious - what a weird scene!You know those dreams that you have sometimes - the kind of dreams that make absolutely no sense at all? But while you're having the dream, everything seems normal? That's what `Being John Malkovich' is - one of those weird dreams that make no sense but seem like they make perfect sense while you're dreaming them. Almost.Unfortunately, while the filmmakers treated the film like it made absolute sense while filming it, the audience can tell it doesn't make sense while they watch it - it is such that the audience is a bystander of the filmmakers' dream.The director and actors of ""Being John Malkovich"" are having this dream, and to them it makes sense, but to the audience, it doesn't, because we are watching the dream from the outside - and that is perhaps the biggest fault of the film.But it is, nevertheless, one of the strangest movies I have ever seen, and I have to give it some kind of credit for that.

I've always viewed him as a slightly overrated actor.  Kind of self-important.  It's refreshing that he must see this as well.  The other actors are just as charismatic.  They must have known that no one has ever done a movie like this before (at least that I've seen in my years).

All the way through the movie I kept thinking it would have to get good, how could so many movie reviewers be wrong?  But it never got good.  The monitor just continued spewing the same garbage off the screen.  I lost respect for a lot of movie critics while watching this movie.  How can so many people believe that this is a good movie?

Acting SkillI'll admit that the acting wasn't THAT bad in this movie, but the plot was down-right awful! The directing was basic at best, and I saw no sign of literary devices.  And there was absolutely no intelligence! Before I saw this movie I still had respect for Cameron Diaz.  Now whenever I watch ""Something About Mary"" (not a GREAT film, but fairly good) I can't stop thinking about her role in this lousy movie.

An odd twist of the usual structure,"There are many strange films out there that push the idea of what narrative can be, but of those that I have seen few can compare with the strangely original story of ""Being John Malkovich"". Putting together several bizarre events and story elements, it takes the usual linear narrative structure and confuses it by jumping through time and frequently changing the positions of characters to keep the ending so distinctly uncertain it's hard to imagine what one is waiting for while watching the film. Brilliantly suspenseful, oddly funny, and strangely philosophical (though what this particular philosophy might be is as obscure as anything else in the film) this movie is an odd twist of the typical linear structure of narrative. Rather than reinventing narrative style to find its unique feel, it confuses audience expectations and makes the plot as confusing as the most oddly told stories, but in the most inventive and interesting way.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I can't say that I came out disappointed, but the film was to say the least, surprising. I guess the film's main pitfall is that it's not very enjoyable. The films gradual descent into insanity is probably too surreal for all tastes.The acting is good for the most part. John Cusack gives an un-formulaic but ultimately convincing performance. Cameron Diaz was the most impressive out of the actors and gives her best performance yet. I don't think that Catherine Keener deserved the Oscar nomination she received. She was above standard in her role but certainly not amazing. I'm surprised that John Malkovich would even agree to star in this film but he does a good job of playing himself, Cameron Diaz and John Cusack (don't ask).Towards the end film gets much too inventive for its own good. But one must admire the film's strange and unique style, slick direction and braveness to attempt such a strange concept.Its not as good as those other films films with daring concepts (The Truman Show etc.) but it's a nice try for what its worth and that's good enough.

A lesson in Plato hidden in a spectacular movie.,"This movie is a spectacular portrayal of Charlie Kaufman's imaginative subject about what it would be like to be in someone else's head, and eventually someone else's body.  Ultimately the movie asks us who we are and tries to urge us to enjoy who we are, regardless of our outer appearance. Whether it be gender or simple shame of one's appearance, the movie gives us examples of people who aren't happy with their physical bodes (ironically, the two people are married) and shows us that no matter who we try to be, ultimately we must be ourselves, and that this truth is inescapable.  In a way, the movie shows us that self-reliance is paramount.  The film shows an especially good contrast between a man who allows his passions to control his actions and another who uses reason to decide the fate of his life and in actuality the length of his life.  This theme is almost Platonic, because the movie shows us which course of action is more moral; and luckily, although perhaps not realistically, in this movie morality wins out.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Frail Psyche, Frail God and Oh Heck, wasn't that bit funny","I personally love all films that go beyond into the depths of surrealism, (personally because i think film is the best medium for portraying such a movement - think David Lynch or Michael Gondry) but this one called out at a personal time of thinking about the idea of self and habitual existence (but that is the most pointless thing to talk about whilst talking about a film), and this film stepped from being quirky Sundance gumption to a deep exploration of Freudian psychology (for example, look at Lotte's naive realisation of her lesbianism whilst experiencing the male psyche, which is a classic Freudian ideal, if in a surreal and weird way) and how our mind is our self (personally, I think this is Kaufman's argument against God rather than for it; we do not have predetermined personalities, thus ruling out some possibilities for God's power in itself, Thus Sprache Zarathustra and all that.)So it is a deep film in that respect.But God, is it HILARIOUS!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad. Bad. Bad. I can smell this movie all the way from the video store--this movie is so bad.,"Bad. Bad. Bad. I can smell this movie all the way from the video store--this movie is so bad. I was so disappointed in this movie that it cannot be put into words. I like John Cusack, I like John Malkovich, I even like Jackass (another product of the director), but I hate this movie.To see a movie with the promise of such creative introspection be blown to crap by such worthless writing and story development pangs my soul. Just the title of this movie has so much potential. The writers and director could have done so much with the idea of seeing the world through someone else's eyes, or knowing someone else's responsibilities for a day, but noooo. This movie glorifies everything that makes ours the sick culture that it can be. In the end the most selfish characters in the film are rewarded with bliss and happiness, the one person with any artistic vision is doomed to a life of torture and agony, and one of my favorite actors looses his marbles to the voice of The Hobbit (look it up).If you ever wanted to add more hours to your day, simply skip seeing any part of this poor excuse of capitalizing on a pre-established name. There--now you have the 112 minutes of my day, I flushed down the toilet by watching this movie.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Couldn't follow through.,"This movie started out with a great idea. Imagine being able to climb into a famous person's head and live their life with them for a few hours! But herein lies the problem: I'd rather be anyone besides John Malkovich. Who really wants to be John Malkovich? How about Being Jackie Chan, or Harrison Ford, Clint Eastwood, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Mel Gibson? Why not someone other than an actor, like George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, or Oliver Stone? Why not a world leader like Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Jiang Zemin, Gerhard Schroeder or Kim Dae-jung? Why not a woman? Why someone white? Could we find SOMEONE more interesting than John Malkovich?This movie started out as a funny movie. The poor puppeteer can't find a job as a puppeteer, so he goes to an office located in between floors in something akin to a finished crawlspace, built ostensibly for midgets and only accessible by stopping the elevator between floors and prying open the doors with a crowbar. Serious dialogue is incredibly funny when one is hunched over bumping his head on the ceiling and talking over the ringing bell of the elevator while delivering it.The movie gets tedious quickly, however. A bizarre love-triangle/square develops and that drags the movie, along with a few other suspension-of-belief-rupturing developments into the zone of the bizarre and boring. Had this movie shied away from the totally demented and stayed closer to the humorous, it would have been, in my opinion, a much better movie.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Delicatessan meets Monty Python,"Being John Malkovich is one of the oddest, and most brilliantly original, comedies ever made.  John Cusack, brilliant as the anti-hero, is a depressed puppeteer who takes a job as a filing clerk in a very strange office.  The surreal detail, yet consistent atmospherics, of Cusack's life, are bleakly rendered in a sublimely low-key fashion. Then he discovers the strangest thing of all, a portal into the head of actor John Malkovich.  The rest of the film is more silly than truly surreal, and the tone more farcical, but it never rests on its premise, instead developing ever more layers, and finally delivers an appropriately nightmarish finale.In the vividness of its portrait of a grotesque world, the film resembles Delicatessan (and not just because of the monkey!).  For sheer insane originality, it brings to mind Monty Python (the original sketch shows, not the over-rated movies which lack the coherence and depth of Jonze's effort). In terms of plot, it resembles nothing.  Full marks to Malkovich for staring in the film for which he surely now will ever after be known by.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Watching this movie was a great way to do what I like to do best when I go to a movie - escape.  The only reason I didn't vote it higher is because it's not a movie I'll pick up again and again; seeing it for one good viewing is the perfect way to do it.

"""Cocoon"" meets ""Altered States"" meets ""Alice in Wonderland"" meets David Lynch?","I spend so much time bashing today's movies for being empty and imagination-starved, that I'm a little shocked when something like this comes along. ""Being John Malkovich"" is breathtakingly original, wonderfully warped and it sustains its demented tone all the way through, rather than casting it aside at some convenient point to focus on another lame good vs. evil showdown. (As so many other initially intriguing films do, with a good example being ""Dark City"".)The cast here is superb, especially John Cusack's lonely, lovestruck puppeteer and Catherine Keener's emotionally unavailable, ruthlessly unreachable object of seemingly everyone's desire.  (The movie really belongs to her; she's created one of the most fascinatingly inscrutable characters that I can recall.) And what wacky, refreshingly blunt dialogue. It has a cartoonish feel to it, like their words are frying pans to conk each other on the head with. From Keener's ""I am dubious"" when Cusack corners her for a date, to her ""Craig! I don't find you attractive!"" when he, and his wife, both attempt to seduce her at the same time. Or Cusack's wife (Cameron Diaz) brutally telling him ""Don't crowd me, Craig"", or Charlie Sheen, in a funny cameo as himself, explaining to a distraught Malkovich that ""The truth is for suckers."" Or a lukewarm fan telling Malkovich ""You were really great in that movie where you played the retard."" And finally, in one of the funniest lines I can remember, Malkovich, after his reality has been severely tampered with, screaming at some guy in a bar ""I am not John Malkovich!"" then attacking him.The movie careens off in all sorts of unanticipated directions, while always remaining faithful to character and premise. It explores notions of identity, celebrity, mortality and finality in a very unique way. But at its core it's really about the pain of loneliness and the inability to connect. And it all climaxes with a truly ingenious and exciting chase scene. What a gloriously nutty, seductively sullen vision. It will leave you a little dizzy when it's done.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of a Kind,"This is quite possible the most blissfully unique and weird film ever made this side of the Atlantic ocean. Even if this head trip ultimately leaves you confused and bewildered how can you not have been entertained by a movie where the main character is a neurotic puppeteer, people work at an office on the 7th 1/2 floor (the ceilings and overhead are really low!), people who travel through John Malcovich's head are unceremoniously dropped on the side of the New Jersey turnpike, we meet a chimp with post traumatic stress disorder, and a woman with a PhD in psycholinguistics who can't understand a word anybody says? This film also gets kudos for the most creative use of a quasi-lesbian subplot ever conceived for film. And don't worry, this isn't just weird for weirdness' sake (and neither is the other Jones/Kaufman collaboration, ""Adaptation"" a far more serious look at the horrors of imagination, the creative process, and the Hollywood studio system).

Some things which I cannot believe,"First, that this film is in the Top #250.Second, that this film is viewed as ground breaking in any significant way.Third, that the US film industry is so devoid of truly good films that this film would be so well-received by American audiences.****Regarding my first statement of disbelief, great works like ""Bronenosets Potyomkin"" and ""Rashomon"" are relegated to lower portions of the Top #250 and other greats, for vastly divergent reasons, like ""Horí, má panenko,"" ""Bittere Ernte,"" ""Mephisto"" and ""Le salaire de la peur"" aren't even among the Top #250.  How can this film, which breaks precious new ground be classed above the first two films, which have been monumentally important for the development of cinema throughout the whole world?  How can this film be called a great social critique when compared to ""Horí, má panenko"" and ""Mephisto""?  How can it compare to the study of deeply flawed characters found in films like ""Bittere Ernte"" and ""Le salaire de la peur""?  The answer to all three questions is that it recall can't.Regarding my second point, how is this film ground breaking, cutting edge, whatever?  Movies from music video directors aren't that rare.  Obsession with celebrity and the horrors wrought by greed are topics that have been covered extensively in the last fifty years.  Heck, even issues of sexual identity have been covered much better than this.  Perhaps the only thing that is truly cutting edge in this movie is the fact that it manages to incorporate so many ideas, and yet never really fully nurture any of them. Instead, it just rushes away on the next interesting point.Regarding my final point, what have these people been watching?  I regularly watch old and new imports from around the world and a whole heckuva lot of them are much better than this.  Do these people watch nothing but cynical American TV shows and movies where people don't care at all for each other or anyone (Just like this movie.  You doubt me?  Well, then why are Orson Bean and crew not debating the moral ramifications of ramming themselves into another man's head for the rest of his life?"")?Regardless of these criticisms, it remains a good movie (7/10), but is definitely not Top 250 material.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Movie That Makes You Think ...,"First let me state that I just finished watching this movie an hour ago. I can't get it out of my mind!  A definate 10 out of 10.

If you loved ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Oh Lucky Man!"" and that genre, you'll love this.  Having John M. be the main person in this film is ingenious; he is not as a previous writer stated as popular as Brad Pitt or Madonna, and that's the point.  I will forever remember this movie whenever I see John M.   Why it didn't win every category at the Oscars is beyond me.  Trust me, what do you have to lose? $3 at Blockbuster??

A psychological journey through the mind as a road to happiness.,"Is it really needed to live through someone else's eyes, to live through someone else's body to understand that luck and love is inside the mind, and not on the outside? The main purpose of this movie for me is that it shows, that modern society makes people believe the outer of a human being is taking in a more important thing in life then a person's inner being. What we have: a depressed man (Cusack) who can't find a job...being a puppeteer is like being nobody, at least if u r a low-middle class average human-being like me and you reading this right now. You don't count in this society if u'r extraordinairy and not cool in someone else's mind. This is the way Swartch lives... He meets a girl who he gets in love with, he likes her, but she doesnt' show much interest because he's extraordinary, not cool, He's ugly, he's a nobody. Then he escapes his own body, and becomes another person (John Malkovich) for 15 minutes. He gets back to his own state and feels great, great to feel what it is to be famous, to be known, to have a supposed ""great life"".....movie goes on......skipping parts....... He uses this to reach the inner mind of Maximes through another person's body. Now he succeeds to get her attention, although maxime doesn't know it's him in John but still thinks it's Lotte. The character of Maxime shows well the way people think these days. She loves the inner of Craig Schwartz, and she loves the outer of John Malkovich. She is out to richness, wealth, fame, all the things that make you supposingly happy these days, without taking in regard that true happiness is inside, and not on the outside. A surrealistic film to think about, not a masterpiece though, more like a documentary how to live in a good way. To understand that it's NOT BETTER BEING SOMEONE ELSE, but it's better to be YOURSELF.

Great weird film!,"Being John Malkovich is really a one in a kind, never seen anything quite like it. But there are many strange films out there and that a film is different doesn't necessarily make it a good one. Being John Malkovich is very strange but it is also just as good.The story is like completely insane but manages to keep getting more and more interesting the longer it goes. Never knowing what is to come next. The plot is exciting at all time but what I found a strong point was the characters. All the actors are great in creating characters as unpredictable as the rest of the movie. I feel there is no one that is really a good guy and neither a big bad one. Not a bad thing like many movies with characters one can't relate too, because here the roles have such substance an the interest for seeing what will happen and what move they make next keeps me on the edge of my seat at all time. Eventough this is a film that interest in all it's weirdness I feel that is more a character driven picture. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are so greatly unpredictable, hard to fully get a hold of and Catherine Keener is really disturbing but in a good way for the film. John Malkovich himself is great in making himself feel even more awkward than the audience about what is going on, he is funny and one even comes to get some kind of bond to him. Brilliant dark comedy, it is funny and interesting in all it's weirdness and disturbing, sad and will somewhat mess with your head specially the psychological aspects delivered by the characters. Unlike many weird films Being John Malkovich manages to deliver much more than just awkwardness.

For a long  time I didn't see a movie so good,"Being John MalkovichWhile I was working at my animated project with my two characters of wood it happened. I started watching the movie "" Being John Malkovich "" attracted by the reality of the puppets and their movements. The strongest part of the movie, which I considered the best, was the part in which the puppet turns towards puppeteer, as a creation towards his creator. Another part of the movie that caught my eye was the show of human sized puppets. I don't really know if it was real or not, but it could be interesting to see a show with puppets and actors in which to be unable to make the difference between the real actor and puppet.It could be interesting. Another ideas which I considered genius are : the introduction of the seventh and half floor (a floor at half the size of an original floor), but also the hole which leads inside Malkovich's mind,part in which Malkovich enters inside his own mind entering inside of Malkovich world and also the pleasure with which the puppeteer plays with his own puppets (the fact that he was living through them,it was not an spectator,it was an accomplice to what was happening between puppets) . What I understood from this movie is that you need to be yourself .The way in which this was presented is genial ,for a long time I didn't see a movie so good,to be so impressed.On one discussion with my colleagues about movie, at my surprise, I found out that John Malkovich didn't write the script of this movie, but someone introduced it to him, and he was impressed of it and agreed to play in this movie about him.This seemed very strange,because many times,artists get upset when someone tries to characterise them or something like that...seems that Malkovich is special from this point of view.

The puppeteer was a great character, but there should have been more intriguing characters around him. The two women weren't that at all, and their acting was also quite poor. The story could have been built up much more interesting. For starters, the whole idea of being able to enter someone's mind, which the puppeteer finds out at some point, should not have been given away so easily and quickly to others. He tells it too soon, and the women believe it and find it out too soon. And the whole reaction is too calm. What would YOU think if you'd hear you could actually go inside someone's brain. Their reaction was more like ""Oh, aha, well, I see. Okay then..."" This movie cannot receive a high rating just because of an intriguing concept. It must also be worked out well.

More than we need to know?,"A frustrated puppeteer gets a new job in a building with a '7-1/2' floor, where the ceilings are too low and everyone has to stoop down. He finds a hidden entry hole in the wall and, crawling in, finds himself sucked into the head of actor John Malkovich (playing himself), feeling & hearing everything the actor does. After 15 minutes, the puppeteer is suddenly spat out on the side of a New Jersey road. You would think it can't get any weirder than that, but the story actually comes up with a plot to explain why all this is happening (which may or may not be good - I sorta liked the mystery behind this odd stuff). Soon, the puppeteer (Cusack), his strange wife, and a cold fish co-worker (Keener) hatch a plan to charge people $200 a pop for spending 15 minutes inside Malkovich's head (it always comes back to plain old capitalism, don't it?). The story progresses on for further twists until it reaches the stature of an odd mini-epic, despite obviously BEING low-budget (the lighting, in particular, stinks in places, tho this may be on purpose). I can understand why this almost won the Best Screenplay Oscar: the makers took the potential of the premise as far as it can go, but most 'mainstream' viewers, as I've read elsewhere, will find this baffling: What is the point? What is it really all about? Well, it may be worth the rental just to watch Malkovich hamming it up as a sideways version of himself, tripping on the twilight-zone-like nature of the story and reinventing himself for the camera.

"A puppeteer who is constantly misunderstood, finding solace in becoming other people and expressing their feelings, ironically portrayed and extended surreally when he discovers a means of actually BEING som","The puppeteer is isolated, and tired of his own life, like many of us, and nobody understands him at all; magnified in the filing secretary's constant  and absurd bewilderment at what he is saying. This is not a comedy or a fantasy. It is a drama which gives us insight into something most of us have thought about but found it hard to conceive; the thought of what it is like to be somebody else. Added to this is the puppeteers' skill in learning how to control the character Malkovich, actually becoming himself again but in a different body; all he wants is the name of a star to be able to continue his passion and means of escape. So the means of escape is not being somebody else, its having circumstances to pursue your dreams...we are all hampered in our dreams by achievable things, such as money, or gaining recognition, but we are easily discouraged. So the film is not about being someone else, it is about realizing your potential and achieving recognition.Malkovich comes across as dull and everyday; we see him, through the portal, doing everyday things; such as showering, reading the paper, dating...nothing special. It is only when the puppeteer is in control that we see Malkovich earning recognition...such as the TV report and the standing ovation. To Malkovich acting is just a job; he is nothing like the mysterious, sinister, witty character we often see him playing...when he was asked why he liked acting he gave a very bland, uninspiring reply.The world is full of souls who believe they have no satisfaction in life or creative outlet, unlike the puppeteer, for example those lining up to be somebody else for 15 minutes were looking for brief escape from themselves. Of course we would all like that from time to time, so another theme may be the human condition of being trapped in our own heads; but no magical escape for us. But why would we want to be someone else; even movie stars are basically like us, they simply have work that makes them well known...so the main character's aim is to use this notoriety to his own ends, his OWN. Initially it was a basic animal instinct to have sex with a woman he desired, but he soon realized what this Malkovich face could do for him. So I think the writer is advising us to forget about envying other people, it is not only impossible to be them but even if you were them you would not find fulfillment. Be happy with what God gave you and use what you have to the best of your advantage. The old people regenerating were a symbol of the pathos of wishing to live forever. Seize the day!

Like Craig the puppeteer, it wants to raise issues in its askew way. I see it as a meditation on selfishness, puppetry being a metaphor for one imposing their will upon another. Craig selfishly throws his wife over for another woman, his wife throws him over for the same woman, and that woman is more selfish than the two put together. Of course, none of them get what they want. Meanwhile, the selfishness of the old man and his friends is homicidal since it involves the obliteration of another human being mind and soul.Whatever the big idea, it is well-developed with help from a cast that includes John Cusack, Catherine Keener, and John Malkovich, who plays himself as well as Cusack's Craig Schwartz when the latter is inside of him. Malkovich doing Cusack doing Malkovich is some fine acting.While too high-concept to reach for its laughs, ""Being John Malkovich"" doesn't forget to be funny. The Mertin-Flemmer early-80s orientation film is as great a send-up of bad acting as ""Inside Amber Waves"" was in ""Boogie Nights."" In addition to Malkovich, who is complemented warmly on his performance as ""that retard,"" Charlie Sheen and Sean Penn have goofy cameos as themselves; Penn admitting he worries his own move into puppetry will be seen as slavish imitation of Malkovich. Brad Pitt throws in a single facial expression that slays me.It's also amusing how the film plays up the ordinariness of Malkovich's life. He doesn't do much more then eat toast and order periwinkle bathmats, yet as Craig sells people tickets inside Malkovich's mind his customers emerge invariably joyous at the significance they've experienced. When Craig completes his hostile takeover of Malkovich, he decides to remake the actor as a puppeteer, and thus we are treated to a People magazine cover of a brooding Malkovich and the headline: ""I will act no more forever."" Somehow I don't think that would happen in reality, but of course playing with reality is where the fun is here.Cameron Diaz is a real find in this film, as she plays the frowsy wife in a style akin to Louise Lasser's Mary Hartman. While Diaz's roles often play off her incredible beauty alone, ""Being John Malkovich"" is the one time she is called upon to really act, and she pulls it off, so much so it distracts from the fact her character is the most underwritten in the movie, more of a gag than anything else.The resolution of the story feels contrived as well, not as amusing or coherent as the rest of the film, though the ending itself is solid. Seeing Craig's state in the end is a nice comment on his chosen career, though he doesn't do as badly as poor John.One great thing about this movie is Orson Bean as the old man. Here's a guy I haven't seen in 20 years, and that was in a Q-Tip commercial, yet here he plays a central role and gets most of the laughs in a pretty funny film. ""I don't want to be your link to history, boy, I want to feel my naked thighs next to Floris."" ""Being John Malkovich"" is a big film about big ideas, but it draws some of its biggest light from the smallest stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing,"A truly original film. It boggles the mind how Kuafman came up with all of this. There is also real heart in this film. Struggle, belonging, feeling alive, hopes and dreams. It touches them in a close and personal way.For the first 30 minutes of this film I thought it was reaching depths of truth and shining a mirror up to us all in a beautifully strange way, and with humour and heart. If it had continued on that arc it would be a 10/10.I loved the tiny ceilings of Lester corp and the surreal office place set up. It nails what the culture of corporate america actually is, a strange compartmentalised faction of reality.The negative: I just didn't like the love triangle arc that it ended up taking - I don't know what it was trying to show. There was no growth of character there was no complex conclusion. You could think about the set up of the film as being an ingenious way to explore this being questions about what it is to be being human, but then it almost felt like the set up devices ended up taking away from the human questioning side. Plot stole form meaning.Still, a dazzling film and I feel a bit mean giving it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Good, Far From Great","This certainly was one of the most original movies to come down the pike in the last few years.  But while the idea of a portal into someone's mind is certainly interesting, Being John Malkovich contained virtually no character that I had any emotional connection to at all.  None of the main characters are likeable, and the movie really starts to go downhill after the novelty of the portal wears off.  The best acting performance, by far, is John Malkovich, and I like the fact that he was willing to poke fun at himself. But, overall, I just think this is a very detached movie and certainly not deserving of the top 50 all-time rating it has on here right now.  If you're looking for a unique film with some characters and situations to care about from 1999, check out Three Kings instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Potential is not enough to be considered innovative,"I found _Being John Malkovich_ to be an over-hyped one joke comedy/drama/story.  The film was logically inconsistent.  The problem is not simply its poor logic, but that that failed to tell a good or interesting story. If this film exemplifies innovation, then Hollywood is in serious trouble. The film demonstrates that Hollywood is bereft of good story tellers. A more interesting story might have been exploring the question of would we return to a single mind if, in travelling into a new body we could bring along friends.?  If many people can be in one body at a time and a host body can go into another host body, via the doorway, then an infinite or even several repetitions of this process will lead to a lot of people in one head.  If the film had explored the cosmological possibilities that the original mind was God or simply a teenager in Burbank, California, then the story might have been of interest. Think of a reversed _Truman Show_. If the film had explored schizophrenia, then it might have been interesting.  However, we would probably have been watching a poor take off on the television series _Herman's Head_. (It scares me that people think that _Being_ is an innovative film.)   If the doorway into another person's head had been explored, in the way that Kubrick tried to study male-female relationships through the film _Eyes Wide Shut_, or evolution in _2001_then the film might have been interesting.  Alas, Spike Jonz is no Kubrick.  Perhaps it is too much to ask, but why not?Another problem was character development. The character Maxine (Max), played by Catherine Keener (major babe), was under developed. A golden opportunity wasted.  Instead we are treated to the archetypical lives of John Cusack (Craig) and Cameron Diaz (Lotte). We see little of Max's life. Max was the most interesting character because she represented an edgier and grittier character than the gormless nearly amorphous characters played by Cusack and Diaz.  Their performances were mediocre in filling such formless characters. Cusack was better in _Say Anything_, as Lloyd Dobbler.  Diaz, while playing against type, was undeveloped.  She can act, but not in that role.  I think she was poorly cast because she was cast against type. Julie Hagerty would have made an interesting Lotte.The first puppet play, acts as an overture for the film and offers an intriguing start, but it goes downhill from there.  If the story had explored the question of identity with any integrity or focus, it could have been great.  The story could have explored what it is that makes us who we are.  Who is John Malkovich?Is there an original or are is he, are we, simply a collection of separate identities that emerge periodically? _Fight Club_, a shallow and pretentious film, explored this question with some effect. Unfortunately, _FC_ was a philosophically flawed film that never should have been made, but that is a subject for a different review.If _Being_ had been as gritty or as pseudo-honest as _FC_, we might have had a classic.  Instead, we are treated to a few laughs and conned into believing that we have been included in a sophisticated tour de force.The idea deserved a better script.  The film's sexual sub-plot was distracting.  The film tried to justify this by exploring the issue of sexual attraction.  The problem is not in its content, but that it is so trite and really there for shock effect rather than to be meaningfully explored.  Are screenwriters bereft of originality and ideas that they have to troll through Howard Stern programs?Was the plot really that innovative and daring? The film was about as innovative and daring as the script and dialogue for _Star Wars_. (To its credit SW never claimed or was spoken of as innovative in this way). The story was simplistic, trite, and overplayed its few scenes of humor. The receptionist story line, like the 71/2 floor was funny the first time.  After that, it dragged.  I wonder if the screenwriter was inspired by Monty Python stories but lacked the daring to bring off a similar farce.As for its main premise, that we, or anyone, would want to be John Malkovich, who cares?  I have enough trouble and fun trying to find out who I am and why. Are other people's lives so boring or so well understood that they have the time or the desire to be someone else?  If anything demonstrates the death of imagination, I suppose it would be this. The film's premise had potential which was its only saving grace. The film could have been great if it had  explored voyeurism.  I am not suggesting a crude expose like _Body Double_, or a more sophisticated understanding in _Sex, Lies, and Videotape_  or even the classic _Rear Window_ but one that could explore the soul of the entertainment industry.The film could explore an industry where appearance masks a hidden reality. An industry that has changed and distorted popular culture through its insistence on emphasizing the surface, or the look, over its content or its meaning. One can understand why modern art like film rarely possess a complex thought.  The result is that films and modern art simply pursue shock or the lowest common denominator: sex. If the film had explored the voyeuristic soul of popular culture instead of relying on the cheap and jejune titillation offered by the lesbian subplot, it might have been better. Think of _The Player_ crossed with _Being_.In the end, the film sputters and stumbles along ending with at best a whimper.  A perfect fin-de-siecle film with its near manic attempt to appear, fresh, innovative, and oh-so-fashionable but failing to mask the hidden desperation born of the realization that it possesses none of those qualities. Like the day after the Oscars, the film is a poor after image, a residue of the potentialities that it could have been.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An interesting idea, poorly handled","In the first couple of minutes of the movie you get the feeling that a very interesting and thought challenging movie is ahead. However as the movie progresses, the plot becomes rather boring. The concept of ""being into someone elses mind"" is handled in such a manner that you do not get the chance of associating any more ideas or feelings into this idea. A general theme in the movie is perhaps that the characters show no empathy against each other. This makes the movie dry and limits the scope of the movie.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Gem from 1999!'Being John Malkovich' Synopsis: A puppeteer discovers a portal that leads literally into the head of the movie star, John Malkovich.'Being John Malkovich' is Spike Jonze's finest film after the recent masterpiece 'Her'.

intelligent and lyrical,"According to the surrealistic background characters act absurd and logical in one; above all is a layer of cynical decadence with its own corresponding moral: By coincidence a nameless puppeteer finds a secret door into the brain of John Malkovich. So he leaves his wooden puppets behind and plays the human puppet ""Malkovich"". But he cannot keep the secret. More and more narrow-minded characters jump into the broadminded, deprived character ""Malkovich"", starting as stalkers and ending up somewhat different. This happens in rhythmic alteration, the whole process being slightly but not to much commercialized. A highlight is the man ""Malkovich"" multiplying himself by jumping into himself, after having found out what is going on within himself. ""Malkovich"" becomes ""well used"" and ""abused"": well used by the two women - one of them being in ""Malkovich"" for this purpose - to create a daughter; and abused by the puppeteer riding him and mutating the famous actor into the famous puppeteer ""Malkovich"". According to its own morality the movie comes to a corresponding happy end: The abuse of the brain ""Malkovich"" will be terminated finally, the nameless puppeteer will be forced to leave it. Instead ""Malkovich"" serves further on deliberately as a ""vessel brain"" for a circle of elder people, thus preventing them from death.

"An Innocently Adventurous Modern Fairy Tale, it's a True One-of-a-Kind","Alternating between quirky, drab, conceptual and surreal, this fantasy what-if doesn't even march to the beat of any drummer in the classical sense. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are unrecognizably pedestrian as a mismatched husband and wife at the end of their rope, both after the same thing in spite of one another. Their marriage, and the factors that lead to its quick, sad disintegration, may be the traditional center of the story, but along the way the plot jolts in so many wildly different directions that it's actually rendered secondary. Like a journey through the mind of a creative genius with serious ADD, it samples a dozen concepts strong enough to power their own film, then still finds a way to somehow marry them all into a single adventurous, mostly coherent, finale. Unclassifiable in the very best way, it's not something I could watch more than once every four or five years.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This is the strangest film that I have ever watched, such as a hole connecting to the inside of a famous actor and people who are about to advantage of such a hole. However, this film is a comedy, so I could enjoy it without thinking deeply. After watching it, I thought of what to do if I could become someone famous.

A bizarrely enveloping must see,"The only competition to American Beauty for best film of 1999, Being John Malkovich is acutely hilarious, visually stimulating and mind altering. The cast, without exception, is in top form led by an exceptional performance by the title character.  John Cusac harkens back to the acting brilliance shown in Grosse Point Blank and Cameron Diaz shows that she is not just attractive.The story builds upon a roux of disparate concepts - the 7-½ floor that is only 6 feet tall, a delicious transcendent sexual triumvirate and the hub of the story is on one of the most enigmatic actors of our generation.  What results is a satisfying gumbo of distinctive storytelling, sculpted imagery (some of the puppet shots Jonze came up with were amazing) and attention grabbing quirks (keep an eye out for cameos).Being John Malkovich provides a cinematic experience unlike anything you have seen before.

"Clever, original and always funny","Once I was involved in the story, I was so absorbed by the story and the characters, I forgot where I was...Where I was was Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center tonight, at the premiere of this extremely original and funny film.Seeing the trailer two weeks ago cracked me up so much I went to and watched it again and again.  And this morning, to my surprise, I read in the NY Times review that it would be playing tonight and tomorrow.Boy, am I glad I showed up early and hunted down a spare ticket (it was sold out) at the New York Film Festival.  Cusack, Malkovich and Keener perform wonderfully, as do Diaz and the supporting cast.You probably know what this film is about, and if you don't I won't spoil it, but whatever you've heard, take a chance and see it.  It is a winner and I predict a nomination for Best Original Screenplay Oscar, and possibly some acting awards for Keener, who turns in a first rate performance.A strange inner life takes over the story, and it truly challenges the viewer to think about the strangest and even profound questions of reality, love, existence and life and death.  But mostly it was goofy, surreal and very clever.What a treat it was to see the actors walk the red carpet, pose for the cameras and whisper to each other on the way in to the show.

Brilliant.,"""Being John Malkovich"" must surely rank as one of the most inventive, original, and yet daring films of the last ten years. A metaphysical journey about the desire to transform oneself involving identity, gender, and creativity. It's silly, unpredictable, and completely faithful to its distinctive, perverse vision. A brilliant premise written by the Charlie Kaufman, and masterfully directed by Spike Jonze. A truly an ingenious film and considered a modern day classic.Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is stuck in a frustrated rut in his life. His pet obsessed wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) seems more concerned with providing a decent home to various animals as opposed to satisfying his marriage needs. Also, money is drying up, Craig's dreams of becoming a world-famous puppeteer appear to be eroding, and he is pressured into finding a job. Because of his quick hands, a skill necessary for artful puppetry, Craig applies for a job as a filing clerk. His job requires him to work on the seventh and a half floor in a strange office block. His days are spent trying to persuade the object of his attention Maxine (Catherine Keener), into having an affair with him.While losing a file behind a storage cabinet one day, Craig discovers a strange and murky tunnel hidden behind the cabinet. Crawling inside, Craig finds the tunnel to actually be a portal, and the destination is inside the actor John Malkovich's head! Although Craig has no say with regards to Malkovich's actions, he can clearly witness and influence what the actor is doing. Fifteen minutes later, Craig is forced out of Malkovich's head, and dumped along side the New Jersey turnpike.Part of the pleasure in watching ""John Malkovich"" is seeing these actors at full creative throttle, and knowing how much they relished the insanity of the script. But it's clearly Malkovich who has the most fun here. Spoofing oneself is usually therapeutic, but for Malkovich whose reputation as an intellectual prima donna, must have been ecstatic at an incredibly unique opportunity.Without spoiling what follows, ""Being John Malkovich"" features a fine cast of dryly- comic actors who are very much in on the joke. That can even be said of Charlie Sheen, who turns up for some wicked self-parody in a film that also features cameo appearances by Sean Penn, Brad Pitt. ""Being John Malkovich"" doesn't bog down in allegories, while remaining tremendously entertaining and thought provoking, and definitely worthy of repeat viewings. Fantastic performances all around by the entire cast, but especially by Cusack and Malkovich. Nominated for three Academy Awards.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Crazy and funny,"Being John Malkovich: The attempt to portray the life of an internationally known actor, through the eyes of random people, makes this story unbelievingly funny. Even though I sense that the meaning of all this, might be: ""we should not interact into other peoples lives, or businesses"" , I therefore think that the movie itself made quite well. You should be someone accustomed into viewing, strange and bizarre stories. The start maybe what seems to be a typical drama regarding a looser puppeteer living with his wife and some animals. We actually get caught into their lives till one day our protagonist finds a secret portal to Being John Malkovich. Starts out to be a realistic movie but the deeper you get the stranger and surreal it gets.A very well written screenplay in which the information is passed onto us through different characters in different ways. Meaning: We know exactly as much as the protagonist, we know more the some characters and we certainly know way less then someone else.This brings me to the editing, which is good for it's purpose. It get's the story running, never makes you feel bored and has a good rhythm as well as some pretty interesting cuts.I would say the directors choice of using two different visual styles, depending on who he focused, makes the story much more understandable as well as funny, some, but far from being really innovative, the screenplay, again makes it so different.Acting wise great. Each actor knows exactly the character they have to be and how to make them believable.All in one, I'd give it a 7 out of 10, for being absurdly funny, unrealistically true and above all entertaining, leaving you a quite indescribable aftertaste after watching the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Wow! A mind-blowing cinematic debut from Jonze and Kaufman. A surreal, hilarious, thought provoking, genre-busting classic.","'Being John Malkovich' is simply one of the most stunningly original and inventive movies ever made. To think it is the movie debut of a video clip director (Spike Jonze) and an unknown TV sit-com writer (Charlie Kaufman) makes it an even more impressive achievement! If this brilliant movie is any indication of their talents the two are headed straight for the top of the heap. What I particularly admire about this movie is that in manages to pile strange situation on top of strange situation without being gimmicky, and the way it manages to discuss weighty topics like creativity and identity without losing sight of the fact that it is a comedy, and an extremely funny one at that. The three leads John Cusack ('High Fidelity'), Catherine Keener ('Johnny Suede') and Cameron Diaz ('There's Something About Mary') are all wonderful, especially the unexpected casting of the latter two actresses, the first of many, many surprises in this hugely enjoyable and mind-blowing trip. And what can you say about John Malkovich himself? The man is now a certifiable legend for even agreeing to participate in this movie, on top of that his performance is wonderful and multi-layered. The rest of the supporting cast led by veteran Orson Bean ('Innerspace') are all excellent, and there are several amusing cameos, especially a scene stealing turn from Charlie Sheen which more than makes up for his many hammy performances over the years.

Very Good but very f**ked up movie,"Being John Malkovich is the most original movie since Brazil.

This is a movie that could have gone over the 200 minute mark and probably still would have been interesting.

Witty Satire,"How would I describe Being John Malcovich? Strangely normal. However, given the same question regarding Jonze and Kaufman's work, I'd say the exact same thing. Having only just seen the film for a second time this evening I can't say that I fully understand the movie at this point but nevertheless can appreciate the work as a piece of film rather than interpretive art.I enjoyed almost everything about the film from its surreal plot, its dark humour and its gorgeous photography. The actors also give absolutely wonderful performances, injecting unforgettable energy into their characters, brining them to life effectively throughout. Perhaps what works best in the film's advantage is its originality and imagination, which combine right from the beginning to create a world that always feels familiar yet also remains fantastical.The only real problem I have with the film is its sometimes slow pace that gets the story caught up in unimportant scenes with little importance. Fortunately however, Being John Malcovich for the majority of the time, never lets the attention go and will have you in its grasp long after it ends.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Something surprisingly different!,I have watched Being John Malkovich and it was a very confusing experience. For the first time I saw a movie and couldn't figure out at any point what would happen next. Many times I tried to think - like a writer - how would I solve this next problem but the writers of BJM had came up with very surprising ideas.Movie concluded several puppet show scenes which described dreams of the characters in the film and I guess also our deepest ones too. There was something very scary when the puppetmaster made his puppet to watch submissively upwards to it's master... Is this how we live too? Are we also just puppets? Okay... I have to say that if you are not so interested in philosophical thinking you can still watch the movie because it really is funny!I was also very surprised that I found Cameron Diaz from the cast because I really didn't notice her appearance and her character actually was one of the main characters. I guess it was quite hard to recognize her in thick sweater and dark wig - she looks very much nothing like she is used to be seen. And she really is a good actor. John Cusack was also great and I just had to admire John Malkovich - he played so well himself.,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Clever idea but it descends to the ridiculous,"I enjoyed the first half of this film.  The character of the pupeteer is interesting and the pupet scenes are very moving.  I also liked floor 7.5 and its inhabitants and the access to the Malkovich mind is engrossing at first.  But then the plot development seems to lose its way.  Surely there is a better way to tie up this plot than the one chosen! The characters are generally interesting, except for that of the wife. I could not see the link between the animal menagery and her ultimate lesbianism. A good idea, imaginatively constructed but spoiled by the ridiculous extremes to which the plot goes toward the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very oddball - and clever,"Being John Malkovich is a clever film with a weird concept. If action flicks, or love stories are your thing, stay clear.If you however enjoy odd concepts, and quirky twists, it is a very clever little flick. The writer deserves credit (and possibly a phsycological evaluation) for turning out this idea, and John Malkovich himself has been very cool to take the film on.For me, a 7/10 film, as though the idea is clever it did not quite carry my enthusiasm all the way through.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An odd film with some forward-leaning LGBTQ themes.,"I have to blame Being John Malkovich (1999) for making me try more films written by Charlie Kaufman than I probably wanted to. While it is a quite peculiar film, it was strange in all the right ways. This movie was saying more than I could comprehend when it hooked me the first time I watched it, but now I can see its deeper meanings having been given the time to see it again with fresh eyes. And perhaps Being John Malkovich was more my introduction to Spike Jonze films, which has been a much better journey.Kaufman's writing is bizarre in ways that annoyed me in Synecdoche, New York (2008) and I'm Thinking of Ending Things (2020) but worked for movies like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Being John Malkovich (1999). Perhaps it's because the latter two in this list have actual plots. I can appreciate the meta nature of having John Malkovich play himself here, but the whole setup surrounding it is so weird that it might not work in any other context. I mean, a portal into his head that's hidden on a half-floor of an office building and spits you out on the side of the Jersey turnpike isn't something you see every day.What I didn't realize at first when I fell in love with this odd movie was how the ability for women to be inside a man's body translated to a trans experience that I wasn't ready to understand yet. For all its queer elements (i.e., peculiar design and story choices), I only now understand its queer elements (i.e., lesbian and transexual messages). And even if the ""straight white man pulling the strings"" bit seems a little on the nose now, I can appreciate what it was trying to accomplish at a time where these things weren't openly talked about.An odd film with some forward-leaning LGBTQ themes, I give Being John Malkovich 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just too boring!,"What should I say about this movie. At first, the appearances of the actors were brilliant, especially Cameron Diaz did very well as Lotti. The idea of the movie was also absolutely unique and strange, but I think the movie was not worth all that.

Perhaps I didn't get the meaning of this movie, if anyone did, please mail me.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just terrible,"Hailed as one of the best movies of the year and even by some as one of the best in the decade, ""Being John Malkovich"" feels more like it was barely given any effort at all.  The film begins somewhat quirky and almost promising, and the viewer knows it is in for something very different. The premise also has to be given credit for originality, dealing with people being transported into the mind of John Malkovich.  But it is all down hill after the first twenty minutes.  Ridiculous in it's pace, the film is trying to create a new genre, but fails miserably.  It also constantly dares the viewer to accept this bizarre land, and toys with their head.  It almost makes the viewer feel they have to like it, because if they don't then they aren't open-minded or intelligent enough to live.  When really the script is just stupid.  The premise goes nowhere and all the seemingly great ideas proposed fall flat and are dull.  Not to spoil, but the idea proposed of what would happen if Malkovich tried to enter his own head is the most disappointing of all.  And Jonze's direction is as flat and bland as sugar-less cotton candy.  The actor's are all forced to act like idiots, instead of molding and creating a character.  All of the stars are talented, but their time is wasted with Jonze who is just trying to be too hip for his own good.  So in the end,the viewer is left with a story that went no where and an almost acidic trip into nothingness. It seems today's critics are trying to appear on an elevated level, far more intelligent than the common man, by loving this film. While a dud like ""Drop Dead Fred"" had more charm than this garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just plain weird  but is clever and funny enough to last beyond the novelty value,"A street puppeteer, Craig, is down on his luck and gets a job in an office filing papers.  One day he discovers a small doorway behind one of the cabinets.  He goes in to find himself inside the head of actor John Malkovich  seeing and hearing from inside his head.  In an attempt to impress co-worker Maxine he shows her and they decide to rent the experience out to people.  However Maxine becomes obsessed with Malkovich and Craig tries to stay in Malkovich and work him like a puppet  despite the concerns of his girlfriend Lotte.It's hard to sell this movie without sounding nuts  in 40 years this film will be on the imdb message boards with people trying to work out if they dreamed it or if it was real!  Although the plot is insane it is actually a funny and moving film that is very clever.  The film has a moving desperation about it as each character longs to be someone else  the final shot is heartbreaking.  The plot may well be full of holes but it's so surreal you can't expect it all to make sense  even within it's own logic.Cusack is excellent and this was part of a very good run of films for him. He is delicate and weak, just as he's supposed to be.  Diaz is better than usual and is barely recognisable, Keener steals the show as Maxine giving an OTT sort of performance.  Malkovich himself is really good playing `himself'  he is the brunt of a few gags and he seems to love it.Overall this is worth watching simply because it is so very different to anything else you'll see in the multiplex.  Outside of the novelty value it still manages to be a moving, funny film.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's Surprising, Thought Provoking, and Original!","Craig, a puppeteer, takes a filing job in a low-ceilinged office in Manhattan. Although married to the slightly askew Lotte, he hits on a colleague, the sexually frank Maxine. She's bored but snaps awake when he finds a portal leading inside John Malkovich: for 15 minutes you see, hear, and feel whatever JM is doing, then you fall out by the New Jersey Turnpike.This movie is filled with originality.

Yeah, this won't be a mainstream film, but really, people, go see it! Watch something different from Charlie Kaufman's twisted mind!I liked the acting by John Cusack and Catherine Keener but Cameron Diaz a lot more because she acts really different and unrecognizable from the naked eye.

That crazy old Charlie,"It is very possible that cinema will never be able to find a writer like Charlie Kaufman again, and if it does, it will be someone too similar to him. Kaufman knows no limits, knows no endings (believe me, his scripts would never end if he could take that decision) and thinks, as a screenwriter, in creating material that at the end of the day is purely cinematographic. Luckily, he's always found apt directors to bring his words to life: Michel Gondry and Spike Jonze (sorry, George Clooney doesn't count because Kaufman's script for the actor/director's first film is adapted).In ""Being John Malkovich"", Kaufman's imagination takes flight and images go right along flying with it. It's not the writer's intention to arouse questions of philosophical, even metaphysical nature. There's a scene in which Craig (John Cusack), the film's main character, explains Maxine (Catherine Keener) about a portal he found that leads him to John Malkovich's head. He tells her he went into the portal with a piece of wood and came back without it and, because he's strangely in love with her, he tries to impress her by making a speech about how this may change his life.It is in that speech that Craig asks, one after another, philosophical questions that are a clear joke; fact that's evidently seen because Maxine is laughing at him. The poor guy, a puppeteer, hasn't been able to impress her and goes back home to make a puppet of himself and Maxine; only to recreate an impossible sexual encounter. At home Craig's awaited by his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz), some kind of veterinarian or pet lover who keeps a dog, a parrot, a chimp and who knows what else inside the house.Character development is perfect. Maxine is cold, disinterested, unimpressed and at the same time mysterious; an office femme fatale that Keener portrays perfectly. Craig is an insecure, depraved, depressive, almost sick artist; and his wife is very much like him (each Cusack and Diaz probably deliver their best performances). What Kaufman does is develop a classic, tragic love triangle an puts John Malkovich in the middle, as a the connection between the three players, a vehicle for the realization of their passions.It could have been any other person, but the fact that the actor is famous works as a plot device for something crucial, and that is people paying to be John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. So there's no philosophical meditation in ""Being John Malkovich"", just a gifted screenwriter messing with himself and automatically messing with our minds too. This means, of course, that there's a moment where everything kind of goes to hell; but we're able to accept it.If you would care to look for a subject though, it would be more 'psychological'. There's a lot in the film that Kaufman later took to each one of his scripts, things that mentioned separately are scarier than the amusing visual rides directors make us experience: sexual obsession, childhood memories and some other things that are hidden in the subconscious. It's delirious, but in one scene we even see a close up of a chimp that a second later is remembering the most tragic experience of his childhood.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Way Overrated,"I was very excited to watch this film, with overwhelming praise from sources I trusted.  I was very disappointed, as this movie turned out to be extremely overrated.  The jokes were few and just ok, Cusack I am vexed by and don't know why, though I like his movies.  I don't like the way it presents important philosophical concepts, and I didn't think the movie was so mind-blowingly original as people made it out to be.  It reminded me of how seemingly original artistic creations are initially when hyped up by an audience used to tired genres.  Well, see for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Goodnight everybody,"This has to be the best film I have ever been fortunate to see in a movie theater. I found its unique devices innovative and refreshing. Blah blah blah. Its all been said before and I agree with it all... But there were two things about this film that stood out for me that I have not yet seen touched upon. The first is the film's ability to manipulate me exactly they way it wanted to, and with out me realizing it at first. The biggest form of this being my newfound desire to actually be John Malkovich, if only for a few minutes. There we so many different types of characters and despite all their differences they all wanted to be this somewhat obscure character actor. I soon began to honestly want to shell out my $200 to experience what it would be like to experience what none of us can ever do, not even with those closest to us, get inside someone's head and truly see the world from their eyes. This ability the film had also worked very well with the character of Maxine. Let's face it folks, this girl is not terribly easy on the eyes. Her face has some witch like qualities to it (the long, crooked nose, the large teeth, that mole on her chin), she was skinny (not slender, skinny) and boney and no fit for the role of the temptress in any other movie. But by the end of this film, through shear personality alone, she became a slinky, velvety, sexy vivacious and desirable woman. I really, really wanted her, and I could see why everyone else wanted her too. She was almost worth killing for. In other words the film made me understand the motivations of the characters like no other. The second unique part of the film was Malkovich himself and the fact that he played himself. This is a rare treat in films that is very hard to make possible. It's also a very brave thing to do. Unlike movies like ""Private Parts"" where the main character plays the lead in his autobiography, ""Malkovich"" is not an egomaniacal device to prove something to the world. Instead we get little snippets of what could be real experiences of the actor, often in portions of his life require excruciating vulnerability. This goes from such small snippets as childhood photos to scenes like that of young Malkovich sitting in a dark basement chanting about what a bad boy he is, or being taunted on the school bus. You are left wondering if these are real experiences or not. Either way the actor is defining himself (as he is playing himself) in less than flattering ways that make the audience look at him very differently. I think John Malkovich deserves so much of the credit for making this movie extraordinary.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
In Two Minds,"I'm in two minds about this film. (Pun intended.)After the first ten minutes I wanted to switch it off because I couldn't get into it.  Puppets?  Who cares about puppets?  I hate puppets!And animals too!However, I stuck with it and I'm kind of glad I did.Why?Well, apart from Catherine Keener, who I thought was knockout in every way, the concept was really interesting and as soon as John Malkovich appeared on the screen in the flesh it became riveting.It's so good to see a major star being prepared to make fun of himself and his status (Charlie Sheen too -- loved the combover!), and I really wanted to know how the story would be resolved.However, I'm not sure I liked the way it developed. It became an uneasy mix of satire and science fiction, and I think one of those genres would have been better than two.I also like it when I can identify a theme in an art movie -- this one was presumably about identity and knowing who you are -- but the message got lost in the medium.  (But then didn't some producer like Sam Goldwyn say that if you want to send a message, use Western Union?)So like I say I'm in two minds about it.

A magical experience from inside of John Malkovich,"Did we really expect anything else from the collaboration of Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze? Seeing this script written down on a paper, you would laugh and think to yourself that there is no way possible this would be a successful film. Well, we see that this film is almost opposite of that. Instead we see a very imaginative story of a struggling puppeteer who happens to stumble upon a not so common ""portal"" to the body of the one and only, John Malkovich. Once Craig entered into the mind John Malkovich, life would never return to normalcy.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Let's do it strange,"The main themes of the film, puppets and life similitude, live the life of someone else, entering his brain is definitely interesting and easily creates a number of ideas brought to exasperation and paradoxical as the movie showed us, including love and sex. The seventh floor and a half, may be cute (not really meaning) as well as the film that subtly shows us that some artists are immediately rewarded for the merit of being already famous.That said, the rest of the movie and ideas, however, are too forced and uninteresting and especially not thrilling and really funny or hilarious as they could have been by not exaggerating in its contours and adding less absurdity and instead more comic comedy situations. Some moments make you smile (not laugh) as the loop by Malkovich in his mind and the situation of the actor bewildered itself, virtually almost involuntarily raped while, some others, are not really necessary or meaningful.Personally, I'm used to engaging and genial plots as those seen in some of Terry Gilliam's movies. Malkovich is talented as always, but as someone else commented, it is not enough just a brilliant idea to make of a unique film a masterpiece.I found some main ideas as absurd even brilliant, but the film, in the long run, rather boring and overrated.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What was this rubbish?,"Ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod.What the heck was this load of rubbish supposed to be? It has exactly TWO decent jokes in it that I could count.Okay, it's an interesting concept. Too bad no-one told Spike Jonze how to direct films (although he is good at music videos). The pacing for this film, for me, jumped about like a man high on E's. This is not good filmmaking.The characters are stilted in the extreme, and while normally this is a good thing and adds spice to a film, not in this case. EVERYONE seems to be fixated on just ONE thing. It's not funny or interesting, merely irritating.I pity the poor actors (especially John Malkovitch) for their roles from hell. How could they even try save a film with a dire script as this one had.It's not all bad however. The scene (stop reading now if you don't want it spoiled) where Malkovitch enters his own subconcious was ... weirdly interesting. The fact that they go into a tunnel in an office building and are unceremoniously dumped next to the New Jersey Turnpike was one of the two decent jokes in it.And now we get to the ending ... WHERE THE HECK WAS IT? I rewound and watched it twice and still couldn't find it. Yes there's some explanation for what happens, but we don't see it being achieved at ALL.

Tries too hard.,"This is a film which tries too hard to be a lot of things. It succeeds at being none of them. It tries to be clever. It tries to be original. It tries to be witty.Anyway, people will tell you that this film is original. They are wrong. Things which appear to be original are, in fact, stolen from science fiction stories which have a much higher level of quality. This seems to be a recurring theme in a lot of writer Charlie Kaufman's work, yet he continues to be praised for it. The only good thing that can be said for him is that he chooses excellent things to steal from.Yes, the main character is a puppeteer. We get it. The metaphor is really unnecessary. We also get the Andy Warhol reference. Ha-ha-ha. Too clever.Naming a poultric bird after a senator also? That's brilliant. Add to that the fact that the senator in question is slightly bird-like and you have something which is unparalleled in modern cinema, and something which is completely unnecessary. An effort to be political? Let's hope not.I've heard people say that the film is good because of Spike Jonze's direction of ""the mirror scene"" (for lack of a better term). One scene of questionable quality does not make a good film. I don't care how hard it was to do, I just want it to be good.Oh, and Cameron Diaz trying to show how good of an actress she is by wearing a wig and possibly a false nose? That seems to be one of the hallmarks of good acting these days: body accoutrements. Though they add nothing to the portrayal, they are lauded, even to the point of Oscar nomination and victory.Overall, a very overrated film you'd do well to steer clear of. Even if it wasn't overrated it'd still be a bad film.1 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Weird movie, but in a good way!","After seeing this film, the first word that came to my mind was ""weird."" This is a WEIRD movie. But! I mean that in a good way. For one thing, it's very original, and that's certainly something that's been lacking in Hollywood for a long time. It's about this talented, down-on-his-luck puppeteer (John Cusack)who accepts a meaningless job for a company that operates on the 7 1/2 floor (you have to see it to believe it, trust me) and discovers in his office a portal that takes him to the mind of actor John Malkovich. Not to Malkovich's HOUSE, mind you, not to his office, but into his actual mind. Yes folks, it's an existential conundrum of a movie. What's it like to be John Malkovich, you wonder? Watch and learn, Gentle Viewer, watch and learn. We see John in the morning, making himself some breakfast, we see him rehearsing at a local theater, we see him hitting on the ladies, and we see him commiserating with Charlie Sheen, of all people (I didn't even know they ran in the same circles!). But being in John Malkovich's head is only one of the issues at hand - how this all affects the puppeteer's girl (an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz) and his newfound partner (Catherine Keener) and how THEY interact is even more intriguing. This isn't a movie the likes of which you've seen before, you see. Just when you think you have stuff figured out and you can settle down and gnaw on some stale pretzels, something else weird happens to make you have to rethink it again.This is certainly not a movie for all tastes, just as ""Eraserhead"" wasn't a movie you'd recommend to everyone you know.

These actors put forth spectacular performances of brilliant characters, driven in part by Jonze's wonderful dialogue.All in all, this is a great film.  One of the best of the past decade.

An astonishing offering of perhaps the end of high-budget art films in the U.S.,"I will start by saying that the last time I saw this film was in about 2001 when I was 16 years old. I think it's safe to say, based off of my earlier 6/10 IMDb rating, which must have been one of the first IMDb ratings I ever left, that I did not understand quite what was gracing my mind. I remember it being really weird, but that was pretty much all I took from it - apparently I didn't like it much overall. Well, the tables have turned, my friends.This film is absolutely insane to watch now. To me it represents an era of film far gone, one which I'm not sure may ever return - and that's the last period in which the American film industry took chances on art films & gave them legit Hollywood budgets. This movie is so absurdist I can't believe it got nominated for 3 Oscars, let alone got the funding it did in the first place. It breaks every rule it wants to, it's sadistic, it's tragic, it's deathly hilarious in the most unique of ways...it's everything. I was cracking up through the entire first half hour - the laughs take a backseat to story arcs, surrealist concepts, and more dramatic plot twists through the body of the movie, but it's still full of absurdist humor scattered throughout.I kept saying that there's not a single movie I care about John Cusack in, but it turns out I was wrong. He is perfect in this. I don't need to lay out why - if you watch it, it's clear. This is easily one of Cameron Diaz's most outside-of-herself roles, and therefore one of my favorites, by default - she's perfect as well. Then, there's Catherine Keener, whom I did not know in 2001, nor did I understand what she brings to the table here - good Lord, she is pure fire - a ferocious fox - she fully blew my mind. Definitely my favorite character in the movie. And Malkovich...well, what is there to say?I'm so happy that Charlie Kaufman was able to find his way into filmmaking through Spike Jonze's 90's hype and the capitalization of that hype used to move from making top notch music videos to making feature films. This would lead to Adaptation and then Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind, both which I also need to re-visit ASAP. I feel that Adaptation is another film I saw in the theater but did not fully understand, while Eternal Sunshine I loved to death, and found to be one of the most emotional movie viewings I've ever had. Kaufman is a mastermind, and it all started here. This movie is magic. He's having fun, he's offering you challenges, he's taking you on the most epic rollercoaster which covers so many bases, full of so much possibility. It's so much more than what most filmmakers do, and I can tell there is still cathartic value within it for himself as well, even when something comes off as goofy as this - there is still so much soul & viscera within it.This is a singular masterpiece. Even Kaufman's other films don't quite replicate it. It's already saying a lot that there are not a lot of filmmakers who could get away with this - but to make a masterpiece out of it is just mind-blowing. It's revolutionary.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Average score for an atypical movie,"This film is one of the strangest I've ever seen. And If feels to me unusually as if it's strangeness is both an asset and detriment.

I think the actors did an alright job. Especially John Malkovich himself and Catherine Keener. The visual effects are nothing special. But they at least hold up which is admirable given that this film came out in the late 90s.I feel like this film is one where it's important for a new viewer to watch it under the right context. If they know that's it's truly bizarre and elicites shrugging and bemused scoffs, the new viewer will probably have a good time. If they're more than if they're told that it's some deep important ground breaking film of that it's one of the worse movies ever. It's not an average film.

Completely Bizarre,"Being John Malkovich is easily the weirdest movie I have ever seen. It is completely bizarre. The story is more original I think than anything since the beginning of cinema when well everything was original. Charlie Kaufman has written three near classics called Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Being John Malkovich. And this Being John Malkovich is the best by far. And although it doesn't have the best performance of the three which is held by Nicolas Cage for Adaptation it has the second best in that of John Malkovich, who plays himself and a bunch of other himselfs. The script is one of the best ever made into a film. It is flawless with great characters and dialogue, not to mention the plot. The direction is also wonderful as are the visual effects. The one big thing I didn't like about Being John Malkovich is John Cusack who although much better than usual still can't give a good performance.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A creative and weird movie.,"This is a bizarre film with a bizarre story. However, it is a very creative story.  Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) gets a job at a company on the 7 1/2 floor of a office building. While organizing some files, Craig finds a door behind a filing cabnet.  Inside the door is a portal into another world, the world of another person.  Craig can experience thoughts, feelings, and see the actions of this other person.  The only thing, it that this other person is famous actor John Malkovich! However, Craig can only experince this for only 15 minutes, then he winds up on the side of the road at the New Jersey turnpike.  Craig and his sexy co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener) see this door as a money profit business.  Yet, Craig has also fallen in love with Maxine, eventhough he's already married to an animal loving pet store owner, Lotte (Cameron Diaz).  From there on is a wild and twisted story that keeps going up hill until the very end. I have never seen a film quite like this one.  This seems like something that former Monty Python member Terry Gilliam would have thought of.  It's very creative, and at the same time twisted, strange, and very very funny!  I thought the idea of a building being on the 7 1/2 floor was creative, but there's a lot more creative images and settings than just that scene.  And the dialogue is also very witty!  With such lineslike ""Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate,"" is the most wittiest lines that I have heard actors give since the Marx Brothers. The acting is also very well done.  John Cusack is excellent, as usual, as the man who torn between two women, seeing the world through two people. Cameron Diaz took a big risk playing a non-glamorous role, and she still manages to pull through.  Catherine Keener is also great as the seductive co-worker who has plans of her own.  And of course, John Malkovich himself is also very enjoyable as, well, himself. But Malkovich is such a great sport, that he even allows the story to make fun of himself. Director Spike Jonze (Vig from THREE KINGS) is going to be a popular director because of this film.  He directs the film along the same simialr lines as a Terry Gilliam film: dark, bizarre, and funny.  And writer Charlie Kaufman shows a promising career with this being his first major film.  I would be very upset if this film doesn't get a Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, it deserves it!  ***** (out of five)",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A brilliantly original piece of fictional film making,"From the creators of Adaptation and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (Director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman), Being John Malkovich is a splendid and incredibly original film which on top of the unique script boasts an all-star cast (John Cusak, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and John Malkovich).The plot is unique and complex and centers around the life of Craig Schwartz (John Cusak), an unemployed and unsuccessful puppeteer. His simple, modest life takes an abrupt and confusing turn when he accepts a job as a file clerk on the 7th and a half floor of an office building in NYC. Here he becomes obsessed with a co-worker, Maxine (Catherine Keener) and starts to fantasize of a romance with her, despite his marriage (to wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz)).Things become even more strange and complicated when Craig discovers a portal in his office, which, when entered, takes you into the head of famous actor, John Malkovich (playing himself). From here on in the the lives of Craig, Lotte and Maxine become entwined, complicated and very strange as they attempt to work out the best possible solution for their own problems, needs and desires.Being John Malkovich is one of the most brilliant, original and unique films of the last decade, if not of all time. Kaufman's script combined with Jonze's directing is the perfect match and compliments each others unique way of story telling, pushing all the boundaries of fictional story telling and creating an utterly compelling and clever film.An excellent film - 8/10!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A pure waste of time,"It was this site that put me up to rent this movie and for the first time I felt the need to ask my money back. I didn't even see the end of it. After 3/4 I got so bored with this movie that I wanted to burn the DVD or throw it from my balcony (3 stories high) The plot never seemed to catch me and even knowing that this movie was pure fiction, I found the story (you're walking IN the head of JM, with JM by walking through a door behind a desk, CAN IT GET MORE STUPID ????) so hard to get that I just gave up.Don't rent it, don't waste your time.

"Don't dig too deep, this is a really a FUN movie!","Most reviews here try to dig too deeply into this movie. It is supposed to be fun. ""Funny"", ""wildly imaginative"", and ""highly original"" are the best ways to describe it. If you're looking for the meaning of life, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for an off-beat comedy with great dialogue and acting, and something truly ""weird"", then this is the movie for you! John Cusack's boss is hysterical! And his secretary is outrageous! Malkovich shows some real backbone allowing himself to be made fun of like this. He's perfect in this movie. And Cusack is great too. Both he and Diaz have some great comedic talent, and great facial expressions. This is the most original, and flat-out weird, movie I've ever seen, and I mean that all in the best way possible!I think too many people are looking at the weirdness and originality of this movie and thinking that it must have some deeper meaning that doesn't make sense to them. Well, it really doesn't have any deeper meaning, and those people are disappointed. I watched this movie having no idea what it was about, and as I watched it, all I thought was ""This is so weird, but it's so funny.""Watch this movie for the purpose of pure entertainment, and set your expectations correctly beforehand. You won't be disappointed!9 out of 10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of my favourite films ever,"I knew nothing about Spike Jonze, had not read the critical reviews, and was not a fan of John Malkovich prior to viewing this film. I watch both mainstream and independent film and am critical of both. I went to see it with a psychotherapist friend and we were both thoroughly enjoyed it! If you are at all familiar with and appreciative of Jungian psychology, psychosynthesis, drama therapy, and surrealism, there is a strong probability that you will get this film. It also helps if you have a sense of fun and humour, a willingness to suspend belief, a love of creativity, imagination, and originality, an understanding of the functioning of the human psyche, and an attention span. The introspective encounter with one's own internalized roles or subpersonalities was brilliantly and humorously portrayed in the film. The love it or hate it reactions are not so surprising. Genius in art has often being reviled, as witnessed, for example, in the reaction to the early Impressionists. If you do see this, I can only hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Original, Bizarre & Funny",Bizarre is the one word to sums up this film. The protagonists include a puppeteer & an actor playing himself which must be a first.I have never seen anything like it yet strangely it does work. For such a strange film it is not pretentious & can be enjoyed without having to think about too much.All the cast are great & with Cameron Diaz dressing down it took me 30 minutes before I realised she was in the film.The plot does seem to unravel towards the end but I prefer to applaud the effort of trying something different which mostly works. One of my favourites.If you like your movies to be predictable & have Hollywood endings then this is not for you.,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Clever and imaginative film,"This is a clever and imaginative story with a lot of droll and peculiar situations that make for an entertaining film.  John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a frustrated puppeteer who can't find work.  He takes a job as a file clerk and discovers a portal that leads inside John Malkovich's head that allows him to see and experience what Malkovich is doing for 15 minutes until it spits him out on the New Jersey Turnpike.  The remainder of the film uses this device to create absurd uses for the portal, from selling tickets to Malkovich to two women having sex using Malkovich's body.Ultimately, the puppeteer discovers how to take over Malkovich and he proceeds to usurp Malkovich's life.  In one particularly ingenious scene, Schwartz is manipulating Malkovich to be a puppeteer who has a marionette manipulating yet another smaller marionette.  It's a little like Russian matroishka dolls where every time you open one, there is another smaller one inside.  If you take it one step further, it was really Maxine who was the master puppeteer, manipulating Schwartz to manipulate Malkovich.This film goes beyond humor of the absurd to humor of the bizarre.  At times it gets a bit too far out to be funny (like when Malkovich goes inside Malkovich and sees Malkovich's everywhere).  But the material is fresh and innovative and most of the skits work well, silly as they sometimes are.Spike Jonze is a strange guy with a strange sense of humor which is perfect for this film.  If you get the DVD, one of the bonus features is an interview with Jonze.  If you see this interview, you will get a fuller understanding of just how strange he can be.  He does some very interesting things with the camera, lighting and setup that give the film a very distinctive look.  This was Jonze first feature film.  Clearly his work in music videos, where directors are a lot freer to push the creative envelope, helped in the making of this film.  I thought he could have done a better job with the Malkovich perspective (it looked like you were looking backwards through a pair of binoculars), but most of the camera work was quite good.  I particularly liked the way he split the sound tracks to have Malkovich's voice come out of the back speakers while in his perspective.The acting in this film was terrific.  John Malkovich, who excels in both dramatic and comedic roles did a fabulous job of playing himself, poking fun at himself at every turn.  Poor John Cusack.  He is such a tall guy and they made him play half his part on a set with 4 ½ foot ceilings.  He was very funny as the tortured puppeteer.  Catherine Keener was a scream as the bitchy and evil Maxine.Overall, this film is a rollicking good time.  I rated it 8/10.  It is funny throughout but sometimes goes a little too far off the deep end.  If you like absurd humor, you will love this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A odd but interesting head trip - a great movie,"Being John Malkovich is commerical and music video director Spike Jonze's first film, he next made Adaptation which I felt was much better then this movie but enough of that. I'll say it straight out. Being John Malkovich is weird. VERY weird. It has random moments in it that you won't get for a few seconds, but its funny. I can't really blame Jonze for this, mostly Kaufman for conceiving the way of executing his concept - being in the mind of someone famous. This movie is sad, has great acting, flawed characters, etc. John Cusack does a good job as well as Cameron Diaz but the 2 stars of this film are Catherine Keener (oscar nominated role) as well as John Malkovich (who didn't get a nomination). The characters in this movie are unsually inconsiderate, they will destroy each other for stupid reasons. The only person you feel bad for is John Malkovich because he has to go through all of this s***. I felt this movie deserved best director and best screenplay, but it didn't win... Overall, impressive comedy, sometimes too wacky. I'd recommend seeing Adaptation over this but do as you please. 9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ever Wish You Could Be Someone Else? Now You Can!,"There are some films whose plots are so obvious from the very beginning that it is a wonder why they are even made. You know the movies, the ones that begin ""Once Upon a Time"" and end with ""Happily Ever After."" And, to a certain extent, there is a chain of events that most films follow whether they mean to or not. Being John Malkovich is not such a film. If the film poster—which shows an auditorium filled with the actor John Malkovich head in front of various bodies—makes you feel strange or makes you say, ""That looks too weird for me"", then this may not be what you are looking for. If you are someone, however, who wants to see something very abnormal, very original, and very brilliant, then welcome! Feel free to jump inside of the head of John Malkovich.This is a crazy film, and the worst thing to do to a crazy film is to reveal too much of the plot. It starts off with a struggling puppeteer named Craig Schwartz who finds an advertisement in the newspaper for ""a man with very fast fingers."" As he is used to working with his hands, this is the perfect job opportunity for him. On the first day of work, he finds that his office building is located on the 7 ½ floor (which can only be opened when the elevator is stopped between the 7th and 8th floor and a metal wrench is inserted into the doors of the elevator.) Shortly after working there, he discovers that there is a portal in the office that leads to the head of actor John Malkovich. Once inside the portal, you can experience life through John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. This was all I knew before stepping into the world of Being John Malkovich and I believe that it is all one should know. What follows is an insane film filled with great acting, great directing, and genius writing. The characters are strange, yet they (eventually) become very real and their uniqueness soon becomes relatable. This did not feel like a film that was strange just for the sake of being strange. Everything that happens seems to fit perfectly. As with any unique idea, there is always the risk of being too ridiculous or having the results be a disaster. Never once does this film venture off into that territory. It could have been a giant mess, but instead it manages to be beautiful. The motive that the characters have is one of the most universal wants there is: to be able, if only for a few minutes, to be someone else, to live life through the eyes of someone else. This is a seemingly simple task. It is not. One of the great things that this film highlights is the ""domino effect"" that all of us are a part of. We cannot live our lives without interrupting the life of someone else. Every action we commit affects someone, which in turn affects someone else, which in turn affects someone else. It is a continuous circle that never stops, no matter our age, gender, or position in life. And just when we tell ourselves, ""It can't get any stranger than this,"" it does.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great idea, but misguided.","I went to see Being John Malkovich with high expectations, but came out of the theater somewhat let down. The film has a great premise, good actors and it's full of original ideas and intelligent twists. Even bigger the disappointment, when after the first half the film loses it's thematic integrity, turning into a conceptual merry-go-round without a proper focus on anything.As said before, the first half of Being John Malkovich is ingenious. Although based on an extxraordinary idea, the film doesn't just play with it, but instead uses it to explore themes such as identity, manipulation and celebrity. Strangely, much of this is thrown into the trashcan after we hear the explanation why there is a portal into Malkovich's mind (in my opinion, there was no need for explanation, and the one given was stupid and incoherent). After that the film is nothing more than a battle of who controls John Malkovich; it suffers the fate it kept avoiding for it's first half. The last 30 minutes of the film are nothing more than an intellectual masturbation with no direction nor deeper meaning. The ending, albeit strange, is unsatisfying and does little to save the movie.A minor letdown is John Cusack. His literary lines and over-the-top acting would work well if Being John Malkovich were just a comedy. But when he tries to play the tragic character and display inner conflicts he simply isn't credible. This is hardly Cusack's fault, though; the dialogue, the characters and their emotional reactions are not crafted in a believable way (the only exception being John Malkovich himself). Whether this is deliberate or not, it ruins much of the films dramatic tension.Despite all this criticism I still kind of liked Being John Malkovich, mainly for its clever themes and original way of approaching them. If American cinema is going into this direction, I'm not complaining.Rating: **½ (out of ****)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I hate this film with every fibre of my being!,"I wanted to like this film. Aww heck, I wanted to love it. I'm a big fan of black comedies in general. I've followed Spike Jonzes career for years, John Cusack is one of my favourite actors and Cameron Diaz... Well let's just say that my feelings towards Cameron Diaz are pretty much the same as every other hetrosexual male's. So this should have been a slam dunk. I liked the concept of the film, the reviews were glowing, I was receptive, pumped and primed.Then I saw the film...And it did suck. Balls.Huge great hairy balls of suckiness.There was not a single character I felt any affinity to. I found the situations contrived and pointless. The ideas explored were either  bland or annoying. The acting was over the top and all I was left with was an uncomfortable desire to slap everyone involved.Was my reaction a little extreme? Perhaps, but I don't feel too bad, given that I seem to be in the minority here. Everyone appears to love this film. People go on and on about it, so if I've missed the point, well, my opinions are hardly going to drown out the true believers. But what if I'm right and they're the ones who are wrong? What if there are good, film-loving folks who are just embarassed to admit they don't get it?

"Stunning, awesome, knockout!","I saw this movie few days ago, over 10 years after it came out for the big world. How could I miss it for so long? I am not good at making reviews, yet I would make the review for this one.Seems so simple, and marketed as a comedy - no idea why? It ain't no comedy. More, it is not funny that much. Of course, you laugh sometimes, but if you watched carefully it becomes more dark and dark as you go deeper into the forest. This movie is about life. About choosing path. About condition of mankind. About being yourself. About hundred other things that are important in life. Did you think American Beauty was about choosing the right path? So you were right, but only to some extent. Just watch ""Being John Malkovich"" and you, (maybe, as it not that obvious:) ), grasp the true meaning of life. I mean it - this movie opened my eyes wider than 100 movies before. Of course, it is just a movie, you won't be millionaire after watching it, but well... You'll get what I mean, soon.Not to mention fantastic screenplay, so original and fresh. I've not come for a screenplay like this before, ever. Maybe ""Truman Show"", being THAT original, hit me as well that much. But it's different of course.If you desire from a movie something more intellectual than average 1,5 hrs , pick ""Being John Malkovich"". If you like to ask questions - go even more with it.

"""... this is a very odd thing. It's supernatural, for lack of a better word.""","When we talk about bad movies, we often say that they are so because they are weird, strange or because they don't make any sense at all. But ""Being John Malkovich"" is just too much weird and too much complicated to be rated as a bad movie.John Cusack stars as Craig Schwartz, a struggling puppeteer who lives with a dog, a talking parrot, a chimpanzee and an almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz as his wife.Craig badly needs money, so he takes a job as a filing clerk and he works for a New York firm located on the seventh-and-a-half floor of a Manhattan building.Things just get even stranger when Craig discovers a secret tiny doorway that leads him directly into the mind of actor John Malkovich (played by John Malkovich). After having lived a quarter of hour into Malkovich's head, Craig is ejected from it and mysteriously finds himself on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike, just outside New York City.Craig and his new colleague Maxine (Catherine Keener) have the idea of making people who want to live the same experience pay for it. So, Craig and Maxine ""rent"" Malkovich's mind fifteen minutes at a time and people become a famous Hollywood actor for that amount of time.""Being John Malkovich"" is directed by Spike Jonze, better known for his numerous music videos, and masterfully written by Charlie Kaufman. His screenplay is brilliant and of an almost unreached level of originality and perfectly allies surrealism and the philosophy of mind.Jonze evidently does a great job in the director's chair, with some astonishing and breathtaking moments. Unfortunately for him, Kaufman is the real star of this movie and so is his simply unreal and completely crazy story. At some moments, we could find ourselves wondering what does Kaufman have in his mind, if he didn't simply put his brain on autopilot and went on a wave of automatic writing.Only a few examples are enough to illustrate my point of view. First of all, we get to know that Craig's wife works in a pet store, but is it a good reason to keep a dog, a talking parrot and a chimpanzee named Elijah in their apartment? And then, we get to wonder how can people work on the seventh-and-a-half floor of a building. And when we finally get the ""rational"" explanation, we wonder why we asked that question instead of shutting up.And the characters we get to meet are not any more normal. The first example is the secretary who interprets every word wrong. Then, Craig's new boss, Dr. Lester, who is 105-year-old and who drinks almost exclusively carrot juice, which explains why he ""pisses orange"".But except the surrealist moments, the movie is also one of the most thought-provoking and philosophical motion pictures of the recent years. Actually, 1999 seems to be the year of philosophy in Hollywood with the releases of ""John Malkovich"", ""The Matrix"" and ""Fight Club"".The film cleverly plays with the themes of identity, celebrity and the body/soul union. Is living for a moment as a famous person is worth it? Is it legitimate? And if it was really possible, would there be a real danger of ""playing"" with a person like the characters of the movie do? ""Being John Malkovich"" is an intellectual comedy drama unlike any other. And the first term is the most important of the three. With such a mix of surrealism and philosophy, it's definitely not a movie for the weak minds. You have to love these two things and complicated stories as well, or else you're gonna quit on this movie about halfway through.And the most controversial aspect of the film is the relationship between Maxine and Cameron Diaz as long as the events pass. There are moments that are gonna put some people away, if they are not instantly outraged and/or scandalized.With everything I've said about the movie, there's only one adequate way to describe it : it's a movie that takes chances. And this attitude gets rewarded by the viewers' admiration and amazement.I perfectly understand that it's not everybody who's gonna love ""Being John Malkovich"". But I believe that it's a movie that deserves to be watched. Not necessarily loved, but watched for sure. Because we have to salute the originality, the eccentricity and the vision of every artist involved into this project.""Being John Malkovich"" is one of the rare proofs that we can both stimulate our mind and our moralities by watching Hollywood actors. And this fact is enough for us to appreciate the movie as a whole.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A fine piece of work,Being John Malkovich is the best comedy of 1999. Equally as twisted as anything David Lynch could come up with but with a lot more 'laugh out loud' humour and a lot less pretentiousness.The cast is brilliant particularly Cusak as a completely hopeless/tragic puppeteer. John Malkovich must be applauded for his outstanding portrayal of 'himself?' possibly one of the more challenging parts I've seen anyone perform. It was also great to see Cameron Diaz play a complete frump as opposed to her usual tizzy blond role.I give this film 10/10 for the amount of laughs it provided and the uniqueness of it all.

"Was I drunk, or is that actually what I just saw?","Charlie Kaufman has written some strange films, but this still tops the list, it somehow is a comedy, tragedy and character drama all in one. But considering the utterly original concept of this film the execution is excellent, most anybody could be given this idea and told to write and fail miserably, but Kaufman actually succeeds in making a compelling, coherent story, that grotesquely sucks you in, just like the characters in the film itself are sucked into ""being John Malkovich"". Performances were very nineties but great nonetheless, a huge recommendation from me, especially if you're drunk or high.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Could Have Been Much Better,"I love John's work in this and many of his other titles, but this movie had so much potential that was wasted.

However, without giving anything away, I won't say who, but sleeping with John M in order to sleep with someone else is pretty pathetic.   Just my thoughts.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Original, but not really good","One of the great things about storytelling is, that you are absolutely free. There are no limits to the imagination. Whatever you can think of - in your story it can happen. Unfortunately filmmakers do not very often make use of this unlimited freedom. Most of the movies made these days are just variations of stories that have been told in other movies before.Every now and then, however, someone has the courage to be original. All it takes is one good idea. That idea does not necessarily have to make great sense - on the contrary! A really weird idea can be the foundation for a really interesting film. Like: ""What would happen, if all the birds suddenly started to attack people?"" (as in ""The Birds""), or: ""How would it be, if you had to live through the same day over and over again?"" (as in ""Groundhog Day"").In ""Being John Malkovich"" that basic idea is: ""Imagine, you would find a gate which leads directly into the brain of John Malkovich."" Very original, very weird, very promising!Unfortunately this time the result falls short of what might have been. The opportunity sure was there. With a setup like this the outcome might have been a hillarious comedy, an exciting thriller, perhaps even a spooky horror-movie. It became neither. Somehow the author could not come up with enough good ideas to give the film the tempo it needed. All the twists and turns that could and should have been in the story are amiss.One more reason, why this film fails are its characters. I am not talking about the actors here - they are good. But the people they play are not. To really get into a movie like this, audiences need a focal point. A character, they can identify with - the ""hero"" if you like. Who is that supposed to be here? In the beginning it might have been Craig Schwartz . Professionally unsuccessful, a little bit naive and with some kind of stubborn pride. All in all quite likable - even in spite of his clumsy attempts to cheat on his wife with Maxine , who is a bitch if there ever was one. As the movie goes on, however Craig becomes increasingly mean. He does things, that we feel, we would not do, and thus loses us on the way. And lost we are now, for there is no other potential ""hero"" to turn to. Maxine is still the bitch, and Lotte is simply to whacky for anybody to identify with her. What happened was: before the supposedly dramatic climax of the story I had ceased to care, for whom there would be a happy ending and for whom there would not. And that is a perfect foundation for being bored. (5/10)",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

John 'No Hair' Malkovich in hilarious expose. With sheep.,"This has got to be the funniest film I've see in a L-O-N-G time.  Knowing full well that John Malkovich would feature heavily within the plot I couldn't wait to laugh at his slapheaded exploits.  But the sheer amount of freaky goings on was too much.  It's not a slapstick film or even a witty comedy, but the sight of J.M going mad because he thinks he's being cursed by ""a freaky lesbian witch"" is too stupid not to laugh at.  The end was not great, and a little bit sad too.  But when J.M goes inside his own head and appears in a bizarre restaurant, well, see for yourself.

"Clever, Original, but Slight","""Being John Malkovich"" is a film with a wonderfully creative, refreshingly original concept, but burdened with one-dimensional characters and a very flimsy plot.  You know what though?  It doesn't matter.  The concept is so good that it's enough by itself.The only really serious criticism I have of the film is that, on repeated viewings, the minor weaknesses reveal themselves more fully, but this seems like such a small, petty complaint to level at such a fresh, inventive film.So, is it just a gimmick movie?  Well, yeah, it really is.  But the gimmick is executed with some real flair.  What saves this from being just some minor art house curiosity is primarily the work of two people: John Malkovich (whose performance in this film has been criminally underappreciated) and Charlie Kaufman, who wrote the script.What allows ""Being John Malkovich"" to succeed as it does is the continuity of the characters, even as they go about inhabiting various bodies.  Thus, even though John Cusack disappears for a large stretch of the film, his character, Craig Schwartz, is in it from beginning to end.  This is a very difficult feat, and the script deserves a lot of credit.  But Malkovich, in particular, deserves the credit, for undertaking the performance of three very distinct characters in this film.  Now, giving a single performer multiple roles is not a such a big deal.  But in this film, Malkovich had to take over characters from other actors and continue them.  When Schwartz finally takes over Malkovich, that's the last we see of Cusack for a considerable time.  But Schwartz is still there.  Same again when Dr. Lester (or, if you prefer, Captain Mertin) takes over.  Continuity is kept with the previous actors and their respective performances.  This is so crucial to make this film work, and the both scriptwriter and the actor deserve credit both for appreciating the importance, and actually making it work.So, sit back and enjoy this truly inventive, clever, and original film. Just don't think about it too hard.  Don't worry about the mechanics of Lester taking people with him.  Don't worry about the utter arbitrariness of Craig's infatuation with Maxine.  Don't worry about the even more arbitrary pairing of Lotte and Maxine.  Don't worry about how Maxine could possibly know whether the child was Lotte's or Craig's.  Don't worry about the odd coincidence of Emily (the new vessel) being the daughter of Malkovich (the old vessel), and don't worry about how Lester knew this, or knew anything else about the portal, or where the portal was before the Mertin Flemmer Building was built.If you want to be a stick in the mud, these are legitimate questions.

"Far Side style entertainment, no redeeming qualities","I wouldn't say the film is the best I've ever seen.  I would quite readily admit that it is one of the weirdest.  Very funny. Good solid entertainment, but no more than that.  An interesting idea, well-rendered on screen.I found the main characters (with the exception of Malkovich) to be a bit on the unbelievable side.  The transitions that the characters make do not seem to be supported by the story or the dialogue.  The acting jobs were quite excellent (especially Malkovich), but I think that the material was lacking. I think some of the ideas brought up in the film were intriguing, but the film doesn't really delve into them, which is a bit disappointing. (Does everyone have a portal?  Who does?  Is there only one?  Why?  What does it really mean? etc.) Still, worth a matinee, its was good fun to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
'naff said,"I read a few reviews from '99 and I totally agree with them. This is the art. My favorite movie of all times, beats goodfellas, fight club, matrix, china town, taxi driver etc. I can watch it 24/7, probably, but I prefer to do so under alco or herb influence... it makes me live in that alternate universe, and I love it! Fricking 10/10 for me, perfect cinema in my book... Wonder what creators were on when they made this masterpiece... it's perfect, funny, tragic, surreal :O props for all the actors, especially cussack, cause that is the one I've seen most of in other great films: 1408, identity etc. His BEST performance is here IMO, cause for that caliber of an actor it must've been really hard to make this 'mr juares' work, but it did, seamlessly :) and I gotta give props for mr. director of martinflemer with his sick sexual fantasies, his performance was EPIC :) it's one in a century movie, truly unique and totally engaging at the same time. I want to live in this surreal world! :) 10/10 again, just blows my mind this film :O",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Imaginative, but falls slightly flat.","Imaginative and creative, but takes on so much it only skims the surface of the issues raised. Leaving it a bit flat in the end. People desperate to spend 15 minutes in the consciousness of someone famous rather than endure their own assumingly bland existence, speaks volumes about lack of self knowledge and development. Just as desperate to escape a natural part of life: death and the mystery that it holds. Out of fear these people seem to be denying themselves the ultimate portal trip. The movie is more thought provoking than funny and I give it 7/10 for that. It pulls off some original scenes as well. I can't remember ever seeing anything like the run through Malkovich's subconscious. Well done.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Malkovich? MALKOVICH! Malkovich.,"Here it is, one of the most unique movies you'll probably ever watch.It's one of the best written scripts of all time, by the always inventive writer Charlie Kaufman, with also some totally great dialog in it. It's the sort of script you just can't go wrong with. No matter if you tell it poorly in the actual movie, the script itself still remains compelling and totally original on its own. Not that the story is told poorly in the movie by the way, to avoid confusion. Despite his lack of movie making experience, Spike Jonze shows that he's more than a capable director.Always wanted to see and feel the world through the eyes of John Malkovich? Just go to the 7 1/2 floor of the Mertin Flemmer building and enter the door behind the cabinet. This movie is weird yes but perhaps not as weird as you would expect. What perhaps most surprised me was the fact that the movie tried to make sense, as much as that was possible of course. It tries to explain things, without ever getting too philosophical or ever hard to follow. It's the sort of movie that can be interpreted in many ways, it definitely leaves more than enough room open for that but it's mostly above all a movie that you just have to take as it rolls along. Let things overwhelm you, just the same way as the situations overwhelm and happen to the characters in the movie. Don't try to understand everything weird that's happening in the movie, just take it all for what it is. Let the movie just simply draw you into this weird and unreal world. It's a much more accessible movie as you would expect and therefor this is a great movie to watch for basically just everyone. It's a rare case of a movie that's so odd that it becomes totally brilliant. Perhaps the only other real example of this is the Kubrick classic; ""A Clockwork Orange"". Through its weirdness the movie gets also incredibly innovative and helps to make this a totally awesome viewing experience. ""Being John Malkovich"" is also truly one of the coolest movies of recent years, without even trying to be cool. On the contrary actually. Most of the characters are losers, who aren't happy about their own current situation.It also is a very hilarious movie to watch. It's not a movie that tries to be funny it's a movie that just IS funny because of its situations and the way the characters deal with them. It's the type of movie thats fun and hilarious in its small and subtle little things. And of course the concept alone is already good enough to make you laugh. It therefor also is one of the better comedies of recent years. The movie probably kept me smiling all the way through, I believe.You'll probably have a hard time recognizing John Cusack and Cameron Diaz at first. They look so different from their normal type of roles. It such a great and big difference. And how great is that John Malkovich plays himself in a movie with a story such as this one. It takes some real guts to play a role such as this one. In a way he makes fun of himself and his career, just by playing himself. After this movie, you'll probably never look as John Malkovich the same way again. Lots of others stars also make a cameo appearance, such as Charlie Sheen in a bigger role and Sean Penn and Brad Pitt in cameo appearances as themselves. It probably only took 5 minutes of their time but it's so cool they actually did this.A greatly entertaining movie you really have to see- but above all; experience for yourself.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"I never had the desire to see this ""movie"", but I saw it because some of my friends rented it. The premise of this ""movie"" is there is a door that leads to the inside of John Malchovich's head. But like the other poster said its all about a guy who wants to have sex. The ""movie"" has maybe 2 slighty humorous parts, and scince its a comedy that makes it a travesty. They never explain anything in the ""movie"", where the door came from, why its there, or why it does what it does. People say its ""genius"" because its original and differnt, people that does NOT make a good ""movie"". The movie was original and differnt, but non-senseical and unfunny.

Instant cult classic,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This is a strikingly original film that is part science fiction, part love triangle romance, and part comedy with an undercurrent of psychological insight into human relationships, marred slightly by some familiar elements in the resolution. Charlie Kaufman, who wrote the script, and Spike Jonze who directed, are to be commend for being so daring and free with the usual notions of reality while callously demonstrating just how selfish human relationships can be. To analyze this film is very much beside the point, but I'm going to do a little bit of that anyway.John Cusack stars as an out of work puppeteer with a cheating heart. Cameron Diaz is his hard-working mousey little wife who supports him and a menagerie of animals including a chimpanzee ensconced in their New York apartment. An early scene shows her going off to work while Cusack rolls over and goes back to sleep. Catherine Keener enters the scene with her big smile and long legs as a supremely confident amoral user of people and quickly becomes the focus of the triangle as both Cusack and Diaz fall in madly in love with her. She, however, is not so enamored. She is not attracted to Cusack at all and tells him so, and finds Diaz interesting but only after seeing her adoring eyes inside the eyes of John Malkovich, who plays himself.Offbeat enough? Not yet. Cusack has met Keener through his new job as a fast-fingered file clerk at a data storage firm with offices on the seventh and a half floor in a New York high rise. The floor is just about four and a half feet high (low overhead!) so that everybody has to bend over whenever they stand up. Orson Bean plays the head of the firm who is 110 years old or so with Mary Kay Place as his annoying secretary. While filing Cusack drops a folder behind a filing cabinet. He pulls out the cabinet and lo and behold discovers a little Alice in Wonderland door. He opens it and crawls forward in the dark and swoosh! is drawn into the person of actor John Malkovich, who is going about his daily life. Cusack looks out and sees what John is seeing, hears what John is hearing, experiences what John is experiencing. He is BEING John Malkovich!Okay, we have our strikingly original premise. Where the film goes from here is the tough part. It includes some funny shtick and some intriguing ideas about identity, a prospect for immortality, Malkovich being turned into a puppet, some unusual sex games, a couple of appearances by Charlie Sheen as his contemporary self and later as a balding middle aged man, ending with the resolution of the triangle and a hint of a possible sequel. I was entertained mainly because of the strong performances by Keener, Cusack, Malkovich and Diaz. I was somewhat disappointed that the last part of the film did not live up to the beginning in terms of originality. The old people waiting for rebirth reminded me of something out of Cocoons (1985). But Cusack's prospective life as a little girl was a chuckle to contemplate, and I couldn't help but applaud Keener's sly triumph. But enough of these beguiling hints about what happens.

The supporting cast is magnificent across the board.  Orson Bean is particularly delightful and believable. Keenan and Diaz are pure magic together.  But Malkovich himself gives one of the greatest performances in the history of film.  How could he have not been nominated for supporting actor for this?  He reflects so much and so many changes seamlessly as perfection itself.  A truly original film.

BEING ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF 99,"""Being John Malkovich"" will be one cinematic experience that you will treasure forever!

Let's not forget dear John Malkovich, who at even being himself executes one of the best performances of the year.

About as original as a Sears paint job, a cheeseburger, or a banana-peel gag. This movie was so mundane and so poorly done (except for Mr. Burwell's music and a few cool camera tricks at the end) that I wanted my money back. And I didn't even pay to see it! You want original? Rent Rope (the movie or just plain rope from a hardware store; either will provide far more fun).",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why oh why?,"I can only say that this movie is completely awful.  There is absolutely nothing to like about it. The characters (the hero in particular) are unlikable.  Even though you do feel sorry for John Cusack's character.  You are still even more puzzled as to why he deserves so much pain in his life. Why must we see another movie that promotes the most negative and rotten sides of human nature.  Why does John Cusack's character have to love a woman so evil that when he is confused and upset. The only advice she can offer him is to point out a window so he can end his own life. I don't get it.  This movie is one of those pieces that once people come to their senses they will realize they were duped.  I don't see how anyone could like it. I don't consider seeing Cameron Diaz being locked up in a monkey cage by her husband (John Cusack) who has been worked into a fit of rage because Diaz decides to become a lesbian after being inside Malkovich as anything worth watching. I don't see how this can be high art or even comedy for that matter. If this is dark comedy then I feel sorry for Hollywood.  It's too bad that most movies today are so bad that something really bad confuses critics into liking it. The plot is way too complicated for such a ridiculous movie.  Why do we need such a long explanation for why he can go inside Malkovich???  It seems all so contrived and forced.  If I could suspend my disbelief for just one second, maybe just maybe I could almost tolerate this movie as documentary on how to not make a movie. when I saw the film, my friend and I were 2 of 4 people in the theater. Half way through 2 people walked out and it wasn't my friend and I. It's a pretty good indication that a movie is bad if you lose half your audience during a showing. I would have been a lot easier on this movie if it were not presented as an art/indie film. But a film should be reviewed on the level it is presented at. Thus a children's film wouldn't be judged as hard as this movie because it was aimed at children. I can best describe the this movie as a pseudo art film with some novelty thrown in. I can say that the only funny joke is the one concerning the 7 and half a floor. After that joke, it's all down hill.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
There just aren't enough words to fully describe this movie.,"I've seen quite a lot of movies, including some weird ones (Lost Highway for instance), but this one is by far the weirdest that I've ever seen. There just aren't enough words to fully describe this movie.A puppeteer doesn't earn enough money as an artist, so he needs to find a 'real' job. He finds an ad in a newspaper, reacts and is hired immediately. The only problem is that the offices are on the 7.5th floor and the walls are only half as high as in a normal office... During his work, he discovers a secret door behind a filing cabinet, opens it and sees a tunnel. He enters the tunnel and ends up in the head of the actor John Malkovich for about 15 minutes. He sees what the man sees and can steer his reactions, thoughts and words... After the 15 minutes he falls out of the sky, somewhere in a field outside of the city...At first I just couldn't get used to the whole concept of the movie, but after a while it felt ""normal"". I don't know how the writer ever came up with the idea, but at least you can be sure that he didn't copy it from someone else... Oh well, I really had a good time watching it and I give it an 8.5/10.

Bizarre... truly bizarre,"I don't believe I've ever seen a movie that I had such a hard time understanding every second of, yet was drawn to at the same time. From the very first frame to the last, the film is bizarre and weird. The characters all act in a way that is quite hard to... 'decode' is probably the most accurate word here. Some act entirely uninhibited, some just act plain weird. I gathered that the whole portal into John Malkovich's head was a metaphor, but I couldn't make sense of all of the film. The plot is interesting and unbelievably bizarre, and quite difficult to follow. The pacing is a little slow, but that might just be because I had such a hard time understanding what was going on and why. The film has some truly memorable scenes, and even a few memorable lines. I'll never forget the famous restaurant ""Malkovich"" scene, and I doubt anyone else who've seen it will. The whole idea is great, and I think it's fairly original, as well. I didn't understand all of it, but I suppose I would if I were older, and had experienced a situation similar to that of one or more of the main characters, I would understand their actions more. This is a hard movie to comment on... especially since I don't entirely understand it. I will say that, while I found the ending to be slightly unsatisfying(which can probably be attributed to my being too used to Hollywood endings), I liked the deep, insightful commentary on love and emotions. What else is there to say... I might not be making a good case for the film, but I really do recommend you to watch it... if nothing else, it's a great unique movie that makes you really think. A very weird movie, but a very good one as well. I recommend it to just about anyone who is up for a new twist on one of the old love-story formula, and a good story that boils down to one of the most common fears among us humans. If you think you might like the movie for whatever reason, go see it. If you are smart enough to appreciate something slightly different from what you're used to see in Hollywood films, you'll most likely enjoy this. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

But, I can't help thinking about this movie as weird. There's so much weird stuff going on. But, that's certainly what makes this movie so beautiful and unique. I couldn't help, but feel entrapped in that world together with the characters, too. Yes, somehow the story is written in that way to make this phenomenon seem so real and natural. Maybe because they took a person from the real world: John Malkovich. His real existence behind the scenes makes us believe more in what is happening in the movie. I also like to compliment the actresses . They were driving me crazy in the most curious way. I can't say that there is something bad about this movie. The ending was so clever and even perfect for me. Because it showed how all good things must come to an end(at least good for someone). Also, worth mentioning is the obsessive love that Graig Schwartz (John Cusack) feels for this one woman. Brilliantly performed by John Cusack. Whenever he was feeling miserable and lost, I was too.

"Avoid this movie, it's not worth the intellectual investment","Listening to a drunk's account of his mishaps out on the town the previous night is a lot more fun than actually watching him do it.""Being John Malkovich"" should have been a 10-20 minute short, a skit on SNL or something along those lines. It has an interesting premise but not much else. There's a lot of cool individual stuff not seen in other movies but it doesn't add up to anything, really, least of all a decent movie.To learn that Spike Jonze was, and presumably still is, a music video director didn't surprise me at all. He knows how to work a camera, set up shots and make stylish, good-looking stuff but in a feature film one needs a lot more than that. I love the Beastie Boys, Beck and Daft Punk videos as much as the next guy but there Jonze has the advantage of being able to simply throw a lot of cool, unusual things on screen without having to tie it up into anything remotely coherent. He tried the same approach here, with the result being pretty weak in my opinion.To hear this movie be lauded with compliments such as 'daring', 'thought provoking' and 'visionary' is very laughter inducing, I must admit. What thoughts other than 'get me outta this theatre' did this mess provoke? I'd really like to know.To summarize, ""Being John Malkovich"" is original, unusual and visually good but, more importantly, it is also messy, annoying and not deep enough in story and characters to support a 2 hour movie around this one single idea.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

There is something called suspension of disbelief, and this movie really pushes it.As a few other commentators pointed out, the first 1/2 of the movie is very funny and enjoyable. However, there is a section about half an hour long where John Cusack is absent. This ruined the film! He was the strongest character and suddenly we're stuck with John Malkovich. John has undergone a major character change which I HATED and could not accept. It's so ridiculous and so awkward that the movie stops being funny and is suddenly a horrifying mess. There is a lot of plot holes and a lot unanswered at the end. It was almost worth it, but there is a lot that doesn't really make sense.

"somewhat overrated, but definitely worth watching","""Being John Malkovich"" is a truly unique movie... one of the most bizarre and creative concepts ever captured on film. Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman deserve high praise for unleashing their warped minds and creating a film that almost defies comparison. Yet it has a number of flaws that can't be overlooked. This is certainly a good movie, but I don't consider it to be a true classic.First of all, it drags on far too long. In particular, the beginning scenes prior to the discovery of the portal are almost painfully overextended and barely held my interest. The dialogue was also very stilted at times. After Craig first visits the portal he figures out far too much about it too quickly. The characters also discuss the philosophical ramifications of the portal in a very ham-handed way. In both cases it seemed that Kaufman felt viewers wouldn't understand the visual symbolism and needed the ideas spelled out in detail (although he may have just been poking fun at film critics).Some of the scenes are visionary and hilarious (Craig's puppet shows, Malkovich entering his own brain, the trip through his subconscious) but many others fall flat. The result is a mixed bag. The saving grace is the brilliant performance by Malkovich himself. His good natured self-deprecation and his ability to play several wildly different characters make the movie work. I was also impressed with Cameron Diaz, who proved that when freed from the constraints of beauty and bad scripts, she can be a good actress. I was not as impressed with Catherine Keener as most critics were-- her part was well-written, but she wasn't terribly convincing.In the end, this is a good (7/10) movie that gets an extra point for its spectacular creativity. Spike Jonze shows the potential to be a truly great director. But he isn't quite there yet.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sadly encumbered by a plot,"""Being John Malkovich"" just misses being a great movie because it has to resolve too many odd situations.  While the film takes you down paths you probably can't predict (and don't want to), the set up is better than the delivery.  The parts that are good are very good, and the film will probably seem better in a few years, so I recommend it.  Still, the film starts on a roller coaster but ends in teacups.  Too bad there turned out to be a plot; its nice that most threads were wrapped up, but not so nice that most of the madness got explained away.

The only reason I rented this movie (thank God I didn't waste $6.50 on it at the theater) was because all of my friends/relatives were saying what a great movie it was. And it didn't sound that bad at first---the plot outline actually sounded pretty interesting. And not to say that the acting wasn't good, either, but for some reaosn, I just did NOT like this film. AT ALL. First of all, if you think this movie is ""funny"" or ""hilarious,"" then your sense of humor is way way beyond mine. I thought the idea of the 7th-and-a-half floor was humorous, a few of the little jokes at the beginning were okay, but after that, I didn't laugh at all. Considering this is supposed to be mostly a comedy, it makes the movie very boring.Second, the movie is just too weird and unbelieveable for me. And the weird thing is, I love cult films and strange movies. I have no problem with bizarre supernatural powers in movies and actually like that kind of thing. Being John Malkovich....I don't know, you just don't get it. Okay, when the building with the portal was built, how did the portal get there? I am still trying to figure out this part. The Lester guy showed us pictures of the office building with the portal inside of it being built---where does the opening to John Malkovich come into being? How does it work? It's just too radical for me to accept and it's probably one of the reasons I didn't like the movie. Another part that had me wondering was when Lottie was chasing Maxine with the gun and they went from the locker room to the bus.....oh, never mind, I'm just getting more confused. It was not brilliant, it was weird. There's a difference.Third, the whole plot, when you really boil down to it, is about a perverted puppteer (Craig) who wants to have sex with his coworker. That's it. And the rest is just the scenarios and problems he encounters while trying to get that sex. And, no offense to lesbians/gays, but the whole thing with Lottie and Maxine in love was just sick. I'm fine with movies about homosexuality (Boys Don't Cry, And The Band Played On, etc.) but it just didn't fly for me in John Malkovich.The saving grace of this film was the acting. John Cusak, Cameron Diaz(!), John Malkovich, etc. all did great at their parts. You have to give the movie credit for one thing.Well, I'm sorry, but there you have it. I can't say that I enjoyed Being John Malkovich. Some movies are so bizarre, their brilliant; John Malkovich is so bizarre, it's stupid. And BORING.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Puppeteer finds a door leading inside a celebrated actor's head,"Certainly, this film is an intriguing, surrealistic piece: it kicks off, after a dramatical puppet play, as a down-to-earth independent low-budget movie, with an unrecognizable John Cusack playing the role of an unemployed puppeteer (Craig Schwartz), who in turn is married with a naive pet shop clerk (Lotte Schwartz) impersonated by a totally transformed Cameron Diaz in what could be described as her most disgusting character to date (although charming in her own way).Then, as Craig follows the path to applying for a job in floor 7½ of an office building, the picture starts to draw a hilarious turn in a surrealistic, almost Monty Python dialog that reaches its peak in the screening of the flat's history. Later on, things start to get creepier as the newly-employed Mr. Schwartz finds a secret door that leads to John Malkovich's head, with unexpected consequences involving the Schwartzs and an attractive employee in the same floor named Maxine (Catherine Keener), or a highly laughable and meta-linguistic sequence when one dares to cross the door to its own perception (no pun intended).All in all, this is a very original and amazing movie which starts out pretty well but, in the end, it lacks a tad more of rhythm and gets a little repeating, but in no way predictable and unparalleled in Hollywood standards, indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Completely original and hysterical!,"Unlike anything I've ever seen. Spike Jonze gives a brilliant and inspired vision. This guy should have moved on from music videos a long time ago. I can't wait to see what project he will take on next. Incrediblly funny performances were given by the entire cast, especially Malkovich, Keener and Diaz. Although it is an excellent film, the offbeat nature and unexplored territory will not be enjoyed by all moviegoers.

Malkovich Club?,"The first rule about ""Being John Malkovich"" is: See ""Being John Malkovich."" The second rule about ""Being John Malkovich"" is: See ""Being John Malkovich."" This is the most original movie I've seen in a few years. (There are no huge explosions, and the lone chase scene doesn't involve cars, planes or space ships.) Unlike many ""art house"" movies, I didn't need to struggle to understand or enjoy it. It's a film about human identity, a story in which a number of characters struggle to express themselves, to find fulfillment and to pursue happiness -- in ways that are rather bizarre.  They live in a skewed version of reality (either that, or New York City has gotten worse since my last visit).  We have passed through the looking glass, and some things are not what they appear to be.  The characters are interesting and well-developed. The humor is dark and incisive. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are deep in character and barely recognizable. Catherine Keener is the ultimate femme fatale. Orson Bean is hilarious. John Malkovich is brilliant -- and very convincing -- as himself.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Being an art house movie that is still funny,"Malkovich is something that grows on you. A fungus of the film kind. If you see it only once, you probably will be mad about a few little things, and slightly amused about others, but it will stick in your mind. You'll wonder about where the plank went during the whole movie. You'll wonder how all the old people are running the body. You'll wonder if he really is peeing orange. But mostly you'll be wondering if it is still in stock at the rental place. Watching again you laugh more, but it will still make you want to see it again and again and again. And that is why it is so good. Seeing a good movie once is easy, dwelling on a great movie is devine.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

So bad it hurt,"This movie was so bad it made me sick. I can't believe I sat threw 120 minutes of pure junk. I expected more out of this movie because I enjoy John Malkovich's body of work has had over his distinguished career.I first noticed Malkovich in ""Con Air"" when he portrayed Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom really well. I have since followed his career in amazement. I can not believe how the other actors let such a great plot sink to such a level that there was no hope of recoveryFrom beginning to end, I was lost in a maze of dialogue and bad development as well as execution on everyone's part that I wanted to leave after 30 minutes. However, something told me to stick with because one never knows what will happen later on; I was disappointed to learn that there was nothing worthwhile to see and I wasted my time on an awful movie.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO ANYONE nor would I allowed to be paid to watch it again.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Very strange, but brilliant in a warped way","The thing I noticed about this film the most was its ability to really capture the viewers attention and hold it.

It was really bizarre but very original - I still can't quite believe what I saw.  I don't think I have seen John Malkovich perform in a role even remotely like this one - he did an absolutely fantastic job playing himself- but then not really playing himself in the real world sense.

Second Best Movie of the Year,"It has been years since we, the moviegoing public, has seen a year as filled with great cinema as 1999.  First The Matrix, then The Sixth Sense, the cartoon The Iron Giant, my favorite movie of all time American Beauty, the raging Fight Club, and now, Being John Malkovich.  Never have I seen such a creative concept for a movie.  And the entire series of plot twists that make the entire movie one huge jumble of plots and stories.  And right at the center is John Horatio Malkovich.The story is so original and absurd it is hard to believe anyone could think of it:  A puppeteer/file clerk finds a doorway into John Malkovich's head, in which you can see the world through John Malkovich's eyes for fifteen minutes.  The clerk teams up with a beautiful coworker, who his wife ends up falling in love with.  And the coworker loves the wife-when the wife is inside of John Malkovich.

REVISED REVIEW: A tour de force at 2 different levels,"This revises my previous review (14Nov99; #54 in the Comments Index)Few who see this movie can ever forget it, it's so original and creative, so well acted by a marvelous cast, and it's so funny.But this is a movie that needs to be seen a second time. In a first viewing, you're so busy hanging on to the roller coaster -- sort of like an action film (e.g., ""Romancing the Stone"" minus the threats of danger to the characters) -- that you miss its deeper meaning. The two levels complement each other and make each the richer.At the first, most obvious level, this movie is for enjoying rather than stating philosophical issues. But along the way, while it provides few satisfactory answers, it does raise some intriguing questions: -- do we feel that we'd be more fulfilled as someone else, maybe someone famous, than as ourselves? -- what's the difference and what's appealing, between men and women's sexual experience?; would some women enjoy or envy men's faster arousal? -- would some men like their sexual experience feminized? -- what's it like to be a movie star? -- what's the source of those various conflicting urges we sometimes feel within us; could we say they come from the prompting of others voices/urges within us? But the most insistent question for most of the characters is how they can feel most self-actualized and they try to find an answer, not in being really themselves, but rather as puppeteers who pull someone else's strings.And at this first level, the characters' quests are just material for the fun plot. But don't look for thorough consistencies (e.g., Maxine's early frank sexual opportunism/ predation vs. her later stance; or aspects of the Craig & Lotte relationship in its earlier vs. later stages). And don't look for deep answers; just enjoy the most original, creative ride in movies for some years.The second, deeper level becomes clearer with a second viewing. In a sense it's very much an insiders' joke about directors, directing, and making movies.The beautiful, stunning scenes we see (early in the film) of lifeless, wooden puppets becoming so brimming with life, movement, and feeling, these state Spike Jonze's love and homage to his craft -- who wouldn't want to do this (these scenes ask) and make ideas and people come so alive?The film director is, metaphorically, a puppeteer who brings out of his/her marionette/actors new lives into new roles. It's the high from this experience that Lotte craves when she announces she wants a sex change operation; the sex of the first level is a metaphor for creativity at this second level. And, after making a film is over, after the high of making a vision come alive, it's like being dumped into the banal, the prosaic, the commonplace -- almost like being dropped beside the New Jersey Turnpike after having lived in the magic of Oz.But there are problems that any director/ puppeteer faces. Being creative and talented is no fun unless there's an appreciative audience; that makes fame and ""box office"" valuable and worth pursuing because it gives more avenues and freedom. And while a puppeteer has the advantage of owning the ""actors"" (the marionettes), any one director has many competitors wanting to occupy the chosen actors and invest them with his/her vision. And there's always another director/ puppeteer waiting to grab them.And the role of Maxine, I think I understand how this fits with the various people involved with making films -- but you'll want something to also figure out at this second level, don't you?I very much appreciate Robert Lesser's review (#51 in the Comments Index, q.v.); we share similar views and seeing his comments supported the thinking expressed here.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

If I ever hear that name again...!,Being John Malkovich has to be the worst movie I have ever wasted my time watching.  I cannot believe that a single person can find anything worthy of mention in this movie.  It is a sad reflection of the weird people that are beginning to become the norm in this world of ours!What is worse is that it has been around for a month or so here and I hadn't heard how bad the movie is.  While watching it I thought that it may be a candid camera movie theatre and the real joke was going to be released later - showing all the frowns and disbelief on theatre-goers faces as the watched - and as they left the theatre.  It was the one thing that I did enjoy - everyone wanted to talk about how bad the movie was as they exited.  Heads were shaking in utter disbelief!That's what I think... it's my duty (and anyone who's seen it) to tell others... then it's up to them.,,Anonymous,Fantasy
Original Movie,"Being John Malkovich is an original movie. This movie has great humor. John Cusack did a good job, Cameron Diaz did a good job, Catherine Keener did a good job and John Malkovich did a good job. This is one of the best movies of 1999. American Beauty beats this movie. This movie is so imaginative. This movie got nominated for 3 Oscars: Best Director - Spike Jonze, Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress. I could not hardly realize that was Cameron Diaz. John Cusack was hard to recognize too. This movie had great acting, directing, cinematography, sets and script. This is unlike any movie I have ever seen before. I do not know why everybody hates this movie. The movie that came out later that is similar to this is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Proves once and for all that truly original doesn't mean merely strange.,"Describing the plot of Being John Malkovich beyond a rough outline is a waste of time.In the case of most films the two or three paragraphs on the reverse of the DVD cover are enough to give you a fair idea of what the film is about, based upon your own tastes you should then be able to get a fair handle on whether it is for you or not.With Being John Malkovich that simply won't do. It needs to be seen before you can be sure – perhaps twice.After saying that I'll try a little: Craig Schwarz (John Cusack) is a struggling yet talented puppeteer in a world hardly crying out for them, his wife Lottie (Cameron Diaz) works in a pet store and seems to take much of her work with her to the menagerie that is their home.To pay the bills Craig applies for a filing job ('must have fast hands') on the 7 ½th floor at a company called Lestercorp where the 105 year old CEO thinks he has a speech impediment because his personal assistant can't understand what he is saying and Craig works with a cocky self confident woman named Maxine (Catherine Keener), who he becomes absolutely besotted by.It is here that Craig finds the door that leads to a portal into John Malkovich's mind behind the filing cabinet for 10 minutes before dumping you near a freeway onramp in New Joisy.Isn't it always behind the filing cabinet? By now you are rolling your eyes or thinking 'that might be the most bizarre plot I've ever heard'. You're probably right on both counts, but it is also one of the more brilliant, genre blurring and ambitious quasi mainstream films in the last century which I guess is in film history.The film is filled with abstract and just plain oddball touches – not the least of which is best describes by two words: monkey flashback – the main characters take turns lusting after each other and the non-Malkovich's are all changed by their experience inhabiting him.It all seems so right, when a concerned Malkovich looks around desperately for someone to approach for advice and seeks the consul of one Charlie Sheen playing Charlie Sheen. (Who thinks that a woman calling him Lottie during the heights of ecstasy 'hot'. Of course he does.) Both Cusack and Diaz – especially Diaz actually – have never looked less 'Movie Star' with their unkempt and unruly hairdos and *GASP* blemishes. Malkovich is obviously playing himself, and he seems to relish taking potshots at the everyday humdrum of his own everyday existence and of being constantly nearly recognised. Keener is unexpectedly sassy and bitchy, it seems she is either used to getting her way or has decided that she doesn't care what others think of her, and as always is the case those guys n gals that treat others like spam somehow manage to find themselves adored and fawned over by the very people they lord over so undeservedly.Thankfully they don't bother with the formal event scene that demands everyone (Read: Diaz) gets done up to prove that they/she really can be hot in real life.But I don't think Director Spike Jonze is even vaguely interested in doing Hollywood mainstream pleasing pap. It is far more enjoyable for him to indulge in a scene where Malkovich enters his own mind through the door and encounters a whole society of men women and – bleh – creepy children all sporting his round bald dignified visage and saying his surname in lieu of normal speech. And if that hasn't either compelled you to either look this film up or steer well clear of it then I haven't done my job at all.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. Napoleon Dynamite and Will Ferrell have managed to turn quirkiness into profit (and undeserved millions). 'Quirk' needn't be try-hard or oddball, sometimes it is borderline genius. Being John Malkovich isn't easily digestible, but it is one of the rare films that can truly claim to be totally unique and more than a mere oddity.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great story, bad movie...","I was really looking forward to this movie because it seemed interesting. But there was a problem with this movie in that it did not transport me. Really good movies I find transport me into another world, but for some odd reason this movie simply did not.Hard to put the finger on it, but it seemed to be a whole slew of little things like the bad humoured Maxine, or the over-reactive wife.  It all seemed to be a bit too surreal and too far fetched.  It almost seemed to me that everybody was trying too hard at their character.I do not think the storyline was bad.

A Strange and Surreal Dark Comedy of Self and Obsession,"This movie is a highly strange and surreal look at self and obsession.

Strange but good viewing,"I rather liked this movie.  It seems to have split its jury between those who love it and those who hate it.  This is probably down to its weirdness. Getting over the strange plot, it is a thoroughly absorbing and entertaining film.All the main characters are truly horrible - even the Cameron Diaz ""mouse-of-a-wife"" character (unusual part for her) is a tough bitch underneath the weak, sugar surface.  In fact the chimpanzee was probably the only character I genuinely liked. Which is fine, by the way, because although you don't like the characters, they are quirky and interesting enough that you want to see what happens to them.Takes a while to warm up - Jane slept through most of the first half hour which made the plot wicked difficult to explain.  I recommend seeing it awake the whole way through.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One Incredibly Bizarre Journey,"Entertaining, sublimely odd, and uniquely original- Being John Malkovich isn't necessarily a great film, but one of the most bizarre and quirky films I have ever come to see. The writing can be a bit all over the place, but for the most part, it is a wacky joke filled satire facing complex characters with existential crisis'. Its acting is quite good, notably from the titular star himself and Catherine Keener as per usual. Cameron Diaz and John Cusack both give roles that are far out of their comfort soon however, and are both memorable perscenes on screen as well. The look of the film can be rather dull, but realistic. It isn't going for anything quite memorable in those departments, and though its plot is very engaging and interesting to follow, a bit of it feels dissapointed by the lengths it promises but never seems to go. The film feels very odd in a tonal and atmospheric way, and though it is not anything too drab, I did feel it impacted my overall opinion on the film itself. Spike Jonze does do a good job crafting this flick, but Kaufman's script doesn't seem as complete as other works he had done such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In the end, Being John Malkovich is a film experience you will never forget, and though it isn't perfect, it certainly is worth watching for more than a few reasons.
My Rating: 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but not a comedy...","Being John Malkovich undoubtedly has some marvellous ideas, but there's a frustrating incongruity of tone.  The first half of the film is perfect, sophisticated comedy, but as Craig starts to really lose it the laughs drain away to leave what is one of cinema's few philosophical horror films.  The ending seemed one of the most sinister in living memory...Overall, I'm left with the same disturbing feeling as I had when watching Terry Gilliam's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - that if the film-makers expected to create this sensation the film is marvellous.  If, however, Jonze intended this as a pure comedy (and a great deal of reviewers seem to have taken it this way) then I feel as if I'm dealing with people whose armour of hip cynicism has grown so thick as to rob them of all human sympathy  for their characters.  Still worth seeing, though.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Cameron Diaz once again proves she's more than just a pretty face (and great body and terrific legs), and, well John Malkovich deserves a Supporting Actor nomination.  The only annoying thing is that Catherine Keener is one of those actresses who doesn't mind nude scenes as long as she's not exactly naked, so you have a couple of Austin Power type scenes where she's covered by absurdly strategically placed sheets or pillows.

You're never truly yourself until you're someone else...,"Weird & Deep  if that's what you like in films you'll enjoy this one; if not, you might as well stop reading now!From 1st-time director Spike Jonze, whose work up until now has been as a director of pop videos, & co-produced by R.E.M.'s Michael Stipes, this is a film which is highly original & hard to classify.Craig (John Cusack) is a puppeteer with a habit of living out his fantasies with puppets made to look like people in his life. Unhappily married to frumpy Lotte (Cameron Diaz as you've never seen her before), he is desperately & unsuccessfully trying to have an office affair with sassy hard-nosed Maxine (Catherine Keener).While looking for a dropped file at work he stumbles across a womb-like tunnel that turns out to be a portal into the mind of John Malkovich (who plays himself). This enables him to experience everything Malkovich does for 15 minutes before being dumped beside the New Jersey Turnpike. When Lotte tries it, she decides she's really a man trapped in a woman's body (or something) & also takes a shine to Maxine. Maxine fancies Lotte too  but only when Lotte is being John Malkovich! Meanwhile Craig discovers he is able to control Malkovich from inside the way he does his puppets, & when Malkovich himself gets involved things really start to get strangeThis is definitely an ideas movie  designed to make you think as much as to entertain. We thought it was largely about Identity; how we define who we are through others - lovers, spouses, children, celebrities  even to the extent of vicariously living our lives through them; & about how we can mercilessly manipulate the people in our lives to meet our own needs.

"Remarkable, extraordinary, and a refreshing diversion from the usual bland and lifeless stuff","This is a unique and original film to watch, and not like many others. John Cusack is good as Craig Schwartz, a struggling puppeteer who gets a job on the seven and a half floor of an office building, and discovers a portal to access actor John Malkovich. Cameron Diaz plays his wife Lotte, and Catherine Keener is good as his co-worker Maxine. They decide to charge people two hundred dollars for the pleasure of visiting Mr Malkovich, but he soon finds out, and the scene when he himself goes through the portal is amazing, and the best scene in the film. The scenes when Craig and Lotte are inside Malkovich reminded me slightly of the final segment of Woody Allen's Everything You Wanted To Know About Sex....But Were Afraid To Ask, when a group of people are inside a man's body controlling him, and also the movies Fantastic Voyage and Innerspace came to mind also. But this is far better than those films. John Malkovich is also good playing himself with a soft spoken voice.

Slapstick of Identity/Sexuality Confusion Showcases Kaufman's Twisted Writing,"This cozy low-budget slapstick production, where the characters humorously struggle with confusions of identity and sexuality while being inside actor-in-the-real-world John Malkovich, showcases the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's twisted talent, while Spike Jonze is surprisingly invisible as a director. Some settings to generate an unusual atmosphere work (i.e., the seventh and half floor with a low ceiling), while the others don't (i.e., the Schwartzs' unusual pets such as a chimpanzee). Malkovich should have differentiated his acting more when Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is inside and controls him. The Malkovich-inside-Malkovich sequence, which is somehow reminiscent of an endlessly looped picture on a monitor when a camera is aimed at the monitor, is not unpredictable enough and seems to be added only to satisfy some demanding audience who would question this if it was not there.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A strange and boring movie,"I can honestly say I do not understand why anyone would like this film. It's incredibly strange and surreal, and some people like that, but even if one does, I can't imagine how one would not be bored out of one's skull by this intellect-impoverished movie.The story starts out with a struggling puppeteer, who gets an office job. But the office is located on ""floor 7 1/2"", which is between floors 7 and 8 in an office building. Although there is a bit in the movie that gives a pseudo-explanation for it, the characters don't really believe what they are told, and neither did I. We never find out where floor 7 1/2 came from, which I might have found mildly annoying, if I were interested enough to care (which I wasn't).While working, the puppeteer finds a small doorway, that leads him into John Malkovich's brain. The story, if it weren't strange already, just gets stranger from there. They charge people money to ""be John Malkovich"" for 15 minutes, and when you're done, you end up on the New Jersey Turnpike (how you get there, is never explained). I don't mind a bit of the surreal in a film, but to have the whole entire movie be stranger than your oddest dreams, is just unpleasant.But it's not just the weird goings-on in the movie that made me dislike it. The movie was utterly boring. I did not care a fig about any of the characters in it. I fell asleep twice watching the DVD, and had to re-wind and watch the parts I'd slept through; the second time, I almost just shut it off instead. If I hadn't paid my hard-earned money for it, I probably wouldn't have finished it, to be honest. There's very little reason to keep watching, and I spent most of the time eyeballing the clock and hoping for it to be over.If you like strange, weird movies with no plot, not much character development, and no explanation of what is happening or why, and where almost nothing happens through the whole movie, then you'd probably like Being John Malkovich. If you don't like those things, then you probably won't. I don't like them, so I did not like this movie.My score: 1/10 (and that's only because IMDB doesn't let you give zeros).",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One Wonders Why John Malkovich Wants to Be John Malkovich,"Previous to this film I watched ""8MM.""  THAT film made me want to take a shower with lye soap and a brillo pad, but it didn't disturb me half as much as this sick little fantasy.  At first I was fascinated by the puppetry aspect.  I laughed over the conceit of a seventh and a half floor. (The lady who first shows Cusack how to get out at that floor should get an honorary oscar for her bit part). Mary Kaye Place was a treat as the snotty, incomprehensible secretary. Even that first trip through Malkovich's brain was a hoot.  Then...it stopped being a brilliant discussion of manipulation (who, after all, is the real puppet here--the wooden puppets, Malkovich--or Cusack's loser puppeteer himself???) and turned into something so revolting I was glad I had rented it from my library.How many times have we had to sit through the plot device of the ""old lecher boss""?  How many times have you watched a story in which our hero (such as he is) pursues the ice queen only to learn she's in love with his wife (or some other woman in the story)and continues, blindly to pursue her after he learns the truth?  After a while, the satire wore thin and really, what did it all amount to in the end?I did want to like it because of the way it handles manipulation and for the really nasty twist in the last few seconds (poor little Emily!)...ultimately, though, I want to get the taste of this movie out of my mouth.  Ugh.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

DISAPPOINTING,"People say you either love or hate this film but as far as I can see it's not interesting enough to warrant either feeling from me. Rarely have I seen a film that has received such high accolades from reviewers that in reality is only average and mildly entertaining. I wondered if I had just watched the same film as everyone else. From the underdeveloped and miscast 2-dimensional characters (Particularly Catherine Keener & John Cusack) to the tasteless and pointless lesbian love triangle subplot, there was simply too many flaws in a film that had so much potential. BJM could have been an intriguing insight into the subconscious of the human mind and an analysis of human psyche but falls short on both counts. I can only wonder what this film could have been in the hands of a genuine director, as opposed to an amateur music video director like Spike Jonz. I wanted to like this film, just as so many who found ""Malkovich"" lacking. As it stands, it's nothing more than average entertainment for the everyday masses. SCORE: 4/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Different, Deep but GREAT!!!","This movie starts off, right off the bat strange. You have no idea how someone could even come up with an idea for this. John Cusak plays a man named Craig who is married to a nutty crazy haired Cameron Diaz who is named Lotte. Lotte is a pet shop owner and she has about 20 pets living with her and Craig in an apartment in NYC. Craig is a puppeteer,well a struggling puppeteer he is unable to find work therefore he sometimes sets up puppet shows on the side of the road. One day after being nagged by his wife to get a job till puppeteering becomes more lucrative Craig see's an ad in the paper for a man with skilled hands. That leads Craig to this filing company run by a strange man named Lester. One of the woman Craig meets while working there is the sexy and mysterious Maxine, who Craig instantly falls for. While filing and working in his office Craig finds a portal(behind a filing cabinet). Craig ventures through the portal,which is a shlep through mud and muck, into the head of John Malkovich.After 15minutes in his head you get transported out and you land on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Craig tells Maxine of his findings and they start up a business where strangers can spend $200 to venture through the portal into the head of John Malkovich. Then Lotte tries the portal and soon sees she enjoys being a man. Maxine realizes she likes Lotte and when Maxine goes to sleep with John, Lotte decides to go through the portal and be John. Lotte soon sees she loves Maxine, but so does Craig. Therefore Craig locks her up in the monkey cage (Lotte has a monkey that when through a trauma when it was young) and Craig decides to be Malkovich every time Maixine is going to be around Malkovich. Craig then figures out how to control Malkovich, how to make him say and do whatever Craig wants. THAT'S WHERE SOME FUNNY STUFF GOES DOWN!Though this movie is not directed by a director like David Lynch, no one could have done this better. This has many points where this could be about real people, about what they think and want out of life. Though it does seem like a strange idea it really is funny and very honest no character lies to you and you can easily associate yourself with one of them. Whether it is Craig, who is always pushed around, Maxine who is commander and takes over, Lotte who wants to be loved, or Lester who fears death or even John Malkovich who has no control over his life, its a great movie with a hilarious cameo by Charlie Sheen who later gets called Charlie the ""Ma-Sheen"".",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
definitely worth watching,"This film is full of holes and sometimes what the characters do are quite hard to believe. But it doesn't matter cause this is supposed to be a surrealistic film. It talks about how our ""skin"" affect different things.For example, the puppeteer was miserable and dispised upon when he was in his own skin, but it was ironic the way he archieved huge success only when he possessed John Malkovich's body.Another example is how Maxine was only interested in Lotte only ""when she's John Malkovich"".So is it that John Malkovich is an avatar from god so that there are things only he couldve succeed at? I don't think so, and the film doesn't think so when Maxine was married to Lotte in the final act.Perhaps Craig could've done everything on his own if he only he has tried harder.The film also talks about obssession and honesty in different ways. I'd recommend this to everyone.I'd give this a 7/10. Points down because the charactors act strangely sometimes.

But I can't help feeling that that does not help. I'm not very fond of the story in particular.

"Entertaining, but highly overrated","The basic premise is great, but wasted in my opinion. Malkovich is a great subject for such a premise, but the plot revolves around sex, jealousy, and manipulation rather than any of a host of other elements that would have been more compelling and made full use of the potential of the premise. Other than Malovich, the characters come off as very shallow and empty. I was impressed with the puppetry scenes, which surprised me with their artistry, there are some great quirky elements of the film, and the brief appearances by Charlie Sheen are very funny. This is a film worth watching, but I feel it is definitely NOT one of the greatest filmes of all time. Don't go in with the expectation of being amazed by what some feel is true greatness, and you will probably enjoy the film. Personally, I only give it a 6-7 out of 10.

"Not absurd, but boring.","Terrible jokes, ""the bad kind of genius"" cinematography, and too many mixed metaphors and plot twists make BJM a mess. Just because it's art doesn't make it good.

It's an honest movie with a somewhat neat idea that gets so bogged down in metaphors and imagery and camera work and stuffy philosophical ideals and egos and ids and projected ideas of self and... Sorry, I nodded off there for a second. It's got so much baggage it looses the story and worse, the audience. The ideals are lost on most people and they end up thinking it's quirky, absurd, or funny. Not like Frank Zappa weird, but Tom Green weird. I'm a professional artist and I have friends who love this movie. I make a living by making connections others don't.

US rating system under religious suspect,Why is it that in the U.K. this gets a rating of '15' and in the U.S. an 'R'. The 11 year old kids in Norway seem to be able to watch it alongside 13-year-olds from Spain. If Howard Stern could read this he would have a fit! Why are these films censored the way they are. Granted there is a lot of swearing and nudity etc. but it's content doesn't seem to dictate something harmful. There isn't a lot of swearing for swearing sake. It is an interesting story akin to the Twilite Zone ----I'm wondering how far the religious right have infiltrated the minds of Americans where they aren't allowed to make better decisions for themselves.

Farcical Dark Comedy,"If Music Video Auteur, Spike Jonze's first feature-length film is any indication, this will be someone to keep an eye on.  Jonze is to Music Videos what Steven Spielberg is to movies.  Two videos in particular, Weezer's ""Buddy Holly"" and ""Sabotage"" by the Beastie Boys have become classics.  ""Holly"" spliced footage from ""Happy Days"" with Weezer playing in a mock-up of Arnold's.  ""Sabotage"" was a skillful parody of 1970s police dramas a la ""Starsky and Hutch.""  My personal favorite, though, is Bjork's ""Oh, So Quiet"" which was an affectionate homage to Fred Astaire dance musicals.  All of his videos are known for their creativity and visual flair.So one would expect a lot of flair from ""Being John Malkovich.""  Strangely enough, not in this film.  ""Being John Malkovich"" has enough chutzpah and imagination from its very strange story.John Cusack plays a down-on-his-luck, and facial-hair covered, puppeteer named Craig.  In any other movie that may sound like a cliche, but in a hilarious opening sequence, Craig performs a beautiful yet highly erotic puppet show.  And of course the only people watching it are a very traumatized nine-year-old and her outraged father.  Said father then punches Craig.  Our puppeteer hero is married to Lotte, an almost unrecognizable and homely-looking Cameron Diaz.  Lotte is a pet store owner who keeps most of the pets in their cramped apartment.  It seems the young married couple are experiencing financial woes and Cusack must go get a ""real"" job.  Since he's good with his fingers, he gets a job as a filer in an office building....on the 7 1/2 floor.Things get stranger.  The floor has incredibly low ceilings so everyone must spend their time hunched over.  The film does a great subtle job in the weirdness.  Brief reactions of bemusement are given by Cusack, but nothing over-the-top.  Weirdness filters in and out of life after all.  Why do you need to act surprised?  It is on this floor that Craig first lays eyes on Maxine (Catharine Keener) and falls in lust with her.  Maxine is not impressed with our puppeteer and is even less impressed when he tells her his talent.  ""You still play with toys?""Things couldn't get any worse, right?  But they do get weirder.  As Cusack is filing one day he happens across a little door behind a file cabinet. Curious, he enters the door and finds a portal that leads into John Malkovich's consciousness.  Yes, John Malkovich.  Otherwise the title wouldn't make much sense.  The catch is that he can only spend 15 minutes in the body before being spit out on the New Jersey Turnpike.  Why New Jersey? Why not?Later he tells his wife about the metaphysical ramifications about this particular Pandora's door.  She tries it out anyway and finds she enjoys being a man.  Meanwhile, Cusack tells Maxine about the door and she comes across a capital idea of turning in some profit from people who want to be a celebrity.  That distinction is important.  A great running joke of the film is that everyone knows who John Malkovich is but they can't recall any of the films that he has done.  Everyone just wants to be someone else for fifteen minutes.Things get more complicated as each member of our trio wants to use Malkovich for their own means.  Then Malkovich gets wind of the door and enters into his own consciousness.  And if that ain't weird enough, don't worry.  You'll have plenty to go ""Wha?"" about.Kaufman has got his own brand of logic to this illogical story.  There are certain subversions to classic character traits.  For instance, Malkovich the victim comes up with the most logical idea:  Seal the damn door.  But it lasts for only three minutes as his humane plea goes unheard.  I felt sorry for Malkovich the character.  Then there is our hero.  He at first tries the door out, then feels reluctant to share this information citing metaphysical inconsistencies that could prove irreparable.  But when Maxine begins to show interest in Malkovich, Craig goes ahead just to be with Maxine.  In fact everyone in the film is suffering from some form of obsession; even Lotte disregards Malkovich's right to exist as an individual because she wants to complete her self-actualization as a man and consummate with Maxine as Malkovich.That I think prevents this film from being four stars.  The first thirty minutes are farce funny as it piles on layers and layers of strangeness. Then things take a dark turn as Malkovich becomes Cusack's ultimate puppet. I get the sense that nothing went unheeded with detail.  Everything makes sense in the story; nothing is weird for weirdness's sake.The cast does an excellent job.  Especially John Malkovich for allowing himself to be in on the joke.  He seems to be having fun.  Cusack proves himself in another wonderful performance as a nobody schnook-hero who turns into a monster. Keener makes a great bitch.  And Diaz is terrific as a homely wife who finds her happiness by pursuing masculinity in Malkovich.But Spike Jonze provides intelligent restraint.  One can almost imagine what Hollywood would do with a story like this, probably add some computer effects for the portal and the expending on the New Jersey Turnpike. Again, the story is fantastical enough that added effects would underscore the artificiality of the film.  In other words, there is a nice sense of realism in the details.I actually had a nightmare after the film in which I dreamt there was another consciousness dwelling inside me.  So that must say something about what kind of effect it had on me.  The scary thing about ""Being John Malkovich"" is that if there was a way for people to change their identities, they probably would.  The question is would they want to go back.  Would you?",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Being Brilliant!,"This is a brilliantly original movie. Virtually hilarious throughout with numerous memorable quotes(see the IMDb listing though they appear to have missed one of my favorite's...""the 'I' comes before 'U' "" one).The writer, film-makers, and actors all deserve top honors for contributing to a masterpiece of black comedy especially in my view the actress playing Maxine,who simply sizzles.The genius of this film is that the more preposterous the plot the more absorbing it becomes. Many reviewers have in essence interpreted this film as what it is like to have ones' 15 minutes of fame; I view this film as examining with great hum-our the concept of ""being""-played for and with maximum laughs.And in my opinion the strength of the picture lies in its' uncanny ability to examine that concept with an array of compellingly super characters.

Spike Jonze has moved from MTV to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion...,"Having seen Being John Malkovich at a Yale Film Society screening while visiting a friend, I can say that I am looking at one of this year's Best Picture Nominees. If it, with American Beauty and Fight Club make the Best Picture List, the 2000 Oscars may be known as the ""year of the surrealist attacks upon commercial society."" Being John Malkovich is not as visually surreal as one would initially assume it to be, but its plot is warped and twisted enough to require near linear cinematography. In it, a disgruntled and unemployed puppeteer who takes a white-collar job to please his wife discovers a portal into the mind of the actor, John Malkovich. The meditations upon the meaning of fame, viewpoint, relationships in and outside the sphere of normality, and the New Jersey Turnpike are handled with a veneer of black humor which lies finely over the mind-blowing and exciting ideas that these concepts raise. All of the ambiguities are classically handled by the sublime performances of the leads in Being John Malkovich, especially John Cusack, whose tall frame provides one of the most engaging sight gags in the whole film, as his office is on the 7 1/2 floor where he has to stoop: ""low overhead."" Cameron Diaz, Charlie Sheen, and Catherine Keener (also coming off a good performance in 8MM, one of the few saving graces of that film) are all also excellent, and John Malkovich may get a Best Supporting nod just for his rendition of what going through one's own portal is like. The short summary remains: see Being John Malkovich. Go with a friend. Talk about the movie. Talk about life. Wander for a bit. When it really hits you, sit down.

"outstanding and original premise, less-than-perfect resolution - still unusually captivating","Like other screenplays by Charlie Kaufman (e.g.: Adaptation), this movie has an excellent premise, the intriguing idea alone of which is enough to hold the viewer captive for about 2/3rds of the movie.Though some other viewers seem to think the over-the-top plot is too far-fetched and nonsensical to be believable enough to hold ongoing interest, i disagree. i have seen the movie 3 times, and indeed, the details all make sense. However - i qualify this praise by saying the accelerating weave of turmoil that takes place about 2/3rds the way through the movie does begin to get a little tedious - one wishes Kaufman would have stuck to the simplistic beauty of the original idea without getting so hallucinogenic. 1 or 2 subplots is enough, not 5 or 6. And the cinematic reference to ""Rosemary's Baby"" is cute, but totally unnecessary.That being said, i still gave the movie a 9 rating for the originality and interest of the idea alone, and the excellent casting and production techniques.

Superb atmospheres. Do you want the immortality? See the film,"Lilliputian and dreamy atmospheres introduce the spectator into the marionettes world of Craig (John Cusack). Meanwhile the story gets complex and the dream to manage people like puppets is confirmed for a moment. The incapacity of communication is filtered and overcome by misusing somebody else's body. It has reminded me, in a different way, the very essential message of ""Cyrano de Bergerac"". Having found a tunnel, a passage, which ferries into the head of John Malkovich gives an immediate benefit to succeed in love with the woman of your dreams. But this passage could be also used, with a sort of sexual ambiguity, by the wife-Lotte (Cameron Diaz), misusing once again John Malkovich's body. The wrong ferrying process could bring to very disappointing effects: like being trapped in an undesired body or searching into the private unconscious of John Malkovich. But the very essential of this brilliant, and very original film is how to get the immortality using, by time to time, a different ""body container"". John Malkovich is majestic, Spize Jonze has done a demential and absurd but original and clever superb film. At the end the only question to ask is: are all of us puppets or puppeteer?

Twisted...original...hilarious...,"Being John Malkovich is one very weird movie. It almost defies categorization. You can't help but wonder how the idea for the movie came about. I'm betting alcohol was involved. Probably drugs, too.The plot revolves around what happens when one of the characters discovers a portal into the head of John Malkovich, the actor. You crawl through this door, enter into this long tunnel and all of a sudden you're in John Malkovich's head where you're seeing and experiencing everything that he is at that moment in time. The experience is apparently quite thrilling so before long a business is set up and everyone is doing it, including the famous actor himself.The movie gets high marks for its originality and dark humour.

A Film That Leaves You With Mixed Emotions,"""Being John Malkovic"" is certainly not a typical film. On the contrary, the ingeniuity of its plot is definitely its most strong point: A loser puppeteer who discovers a portal who makes people get into John Malkovic's brain, is persuaded by his evil colleague Maxine with whom he has fallen in (one-way) love with, to turn it into a profitable business. However, things get much more complicated when his hippy and animal-loving wife enters the portal and finds out that she has the hots for Maxine too! And this is just the beginning of the story, with more twists to follow later... However, ingenious the scenario might be, it gets at some point a bit over-stretched. The result is that when the movie ends, you are a bit overwhelmed with what you have just watched, and you are left with mixed emotions. This does not mean that the movie is not good: The performance of all the actors is great (with Malkovic being an excellent... Malkovic!), whereas the movie certainly does not let you get bored as the plot develops at a fast pace. The movie gets a 7/10 overall.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Inventive and original,but certainly not great. For a film that is as much arthouse as it is mainstream it makes no point at all whatsoever and it comes nowhere near taking advantage of it's wonderful premise. All we get is a shaggy John Cusack and a bushy Cameron Diaz going head to head over Catherine Keener through John Malkovich. It does have the occasional weird charm but I feel like it could have been so much more.Only a few scenes raised a smile in me. Don't get me wrong. I've never seen a movie that had so much originality to it but I have also never seen a movie that did so little with its ingenious idea. It becomes quite boring and saggy in places. Whenever this happened I just wanted it to go to another scene where they go inside John Malkovich.Alsothe ending makes no sense whatsoever. And the writer doesn't even give an explanation for the portal or how it is possible. This may have worked for Groundhog Day but just seems lazy here. It takes advantage of the audience and is very superficial. As you may have guessed the ending annoyed me very much.   I do recommend you see this movie. But don't let the hype and blind-faith of others cloud your opinion.,,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wickedly original!,"You get lured into this film and almost hypnotized by its off beat story, quack dialogue, and the strange behavior that is accepted as normal in this Spike Jonze film. Probaly up there with the top 3 movies I have seen all year... You are for a treat when you commit yourself to this movie. As the movie ended and the credits were rolling, I felt oddly out of place because no one was getting up to leave. Everyone sat there silently just watching the credits for about 2 or 3 minutes.

"Smart, imaginative, but never overwhelming","Both a zany surreal comedy and a Kafkaesque nightmare, ""Being John Malkovich"" explores the artist's need for self-actualization. In a society where everyone would pay to erase themselves and become someone else, the protagonist (a misunderstood artist) is the only one who actually needs a ""vessel"" (what a coincidence, an actor) to be himself and express his full potential. Spike Jonze's direction feels a little pedestrian here, as if to contain the exuberance of Kaufman's script and at the same time go along with the dreary tone of the characters' lives.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A whole different world view.,"When i started watching this film I wasn't sure what to expect, but after watching it i can safely say it reached far beyond my expectations.Being John Malkovich tells more than just a story. It tells a person. With strong themes such as self acceptance, soul searching, existentialism, sexuality and all the complex things that come along with them, this definitely isn't a light watch.It's complicated, perplexing, unique and thought provoking. If you want to look at the world through a new set of eyes then this is where to do it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I can't believe the high score this has.,"Okay, I wouldn't say that this movie was a TOTAL waste of time; it was somewhat amusing at times.  But as I write this, the movie is listed as #25 in the Top 250 list.  I have absolutely no idea how it can have a rating that high.  It was nowhere NEAR that good.  I've read several other comments here, and a lot of people say what an ""original, and fresh"" story it is. Yeah, it's original, but not GOOD.  I like the premise, but I think they could have done something more interesting with it!  I kept expecting something to HAPPEN, but nothing did.  It seemed to just keep rolling along with no real point to it.  It didn't really seem to have a message or a deep thought for us to ponder.  It didn't even throw me any (interesting) plot twists to make me really care what was going on, or to make me care about what might happen to these characters next.  I did laugh quite a bit, and I liked the 7 1/2 floor bit (especially the hilariously authentic-looking orientation tape explaining the reasons the floor existed.) But I didn't laugh SO much, or find anything about it interesting enough to ever want to see it again.  And I certainly wouldn't give it ""classic"" status.  It was really a let-down for me.  I was really looking forward to seeing it, because I'd heard so many good things about it, and because the story idea sounded so ""original, and fresh,"" but it was absolutely nowhere near what I'd hoped.  I gave it a 4.  If not for the few laughs it did have, I would've rated it much, much MUCH lower.  It was not particularly clever, and as I said, I think the movie COULD HAVE been good if they had done something more with the premise.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Post-post-everything filmmaking--but is it good?,"It's fitting that this movie was done by the same person who directed Fatboy Slim videos; the idea of this movie seems the same as Fatboy's music: to sample a broad swath of pop detritus, and use it to create something new. Such seems to be the post-post-everything school of art, and _Being John Malkovich_ is a good, but hardly perfect, study of that school.The first thirty minutes of this movie delivered an hilarious absurdist set-up, that reminded me of Terry Gilliam (complete with Brazil-like improbable office space) directing a David Letterman skit.But, unfortunately, one slowly realizes the rest of the movie is more like The Rocky Horror Picture Show starring the characters from Ally McBeal. Entering Malkovich's brain and observing his extraordinarily boring life seems almost inevitable when put in the context of the incredibly over-the-top characters that populate this movie.  Worse, their obsession to become John Malcovich becomes a heavy-handed attempt to explore tired existential philosophies, with the effect being a bit like watching MTV discuss social issues.  There were times when I thought I should be laughing, but I worried that maybe by doing so I was actually not ""getting it.""Despite my disappointment at the film to leave me feeling satisfied, I still recommend it; it is very inventive and creative, and has some very well-done moments.  (I especially like the gawd-awful ""orientation"" video scene, complete with bad actors dressed in late '70's attire.)This sort of creativity should be encouraged--not necessarily rewarded at this stage, but encouraged, in hopes it will mature.  I think it's possible to take a bizarre idea and make it into a satisfying full-length movie--but it will take some practice.  _Being John Malkovich_ is a good first attempt.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"'Malkovich' is eye candy, in the least likely place","Being John Malkovich' is one of the most ingenious, creative, and bizarre movies that I've ever seen.  There is never a tedious moment in the film. Charles Kaufman creates an utterly original heap of entertainment that makes Alice in Wonderland look like a teen flick. Whether you're laughing, or crying, the film will keep you on your toes.The first few minutes are a little sluggish but you still find yourself intrigued by the bizarre camera work.  John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz a deprived puppeteer who is an brilliant, yet sadly unknown puppet master. Schwartz doesn't think he needs a day job until he offends a little girl's father with one of his puppet shows, and gets punched square in the face. After that he realizes that he needs a day job to support his wife, and hopefully a future child.Cusack's job interview leads to some of the funniest 20 minutes I have ever seen on screen.  With dark, and intellectual comedy at it's best, it's one of those scenes were you just die laughing in the aisles.Cusack's boss is old, senile, and thinks he has a speech impediment when actually he talks better than Cusack himself. He works on the 7 ½ floor where the ceiling raises 5 feet above the floor.  It's a place were everyone has to bend over to walk. While filing one day Cusack drops a folder behind a file cabinet.  While retrieving it he finds a small door that leads inside the brain of John Malkovich.These minutes of entertainment never dumb down, or slow up.  It just gets better and more surreal. You would expect them to run out of ideas; but they don't.  The laughs come on stronger, and the movie bullets in a different direction.Cusack ends up only being able to spend 15 minutes in Malkovich and afterwards gets dumped out by the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. He proceeds to tell his wife played by the beautiful Cameron Diaz, who in this movie looks appalling and utterly unattractive.  She wants to try it, and what she ends up finding is not a portal within John Malkovich, but rather a mirror into her innermost desires.  She finds her true self in another person's body.Instead of using this portal to try to find what the significance of it is Diaz and Cusack use it to fulfill their sexual fantasies with Cusack's co-worker, played by the lovely Catherine Keener.  However, it seems she is only attracted to them when they are within the body of Malkovich.The plot spirals into many different directions at this point, and steers clear of comedy. It becomes a philosophical message, which is: The only way we can be who we truly are; is in the mask of someone else.Being John Malkovich' could be considered the Truman Show' of 1999, only more imaginative, and bizarre. The film is so deep that it's poetic. Everything in the movie has a meaning, and represents a symbol for life.John Cusack gives an first-rate performance.  In the beginning you feel sorry for him.  In the middle you hate him. At the end you feel sorry once for him more. Cameron Diaz clearly has made the transition from comedy to drama, and establishes herself as a future award winner.The last words heard in the film are the words ""Look Away"" muttered by Cusack in a depressive state.  However, you can't look away. You are so intrigued by the ending that you can't do anything but look intently at the film. This film deserves a standing ovation for what it has done for filmmakers.  It tells them to think of every possibility.  Hopefully we will see more original films like Malkovich' and less clichéd films like House on Haunted Hill' - Chris Sandberg4 out of 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Brilliant but ultimately flawed,"I gave this movie 8/10, but I have to admit being a little disappointed when I finally got around to seeing it.The first half is almost flawless - a dystopian Kafkaesque world, designed seemingly by Terry Gilliam, inhabited by off-kilter characters that adds to the general air of strangeness and unreality. Striding through it all is an unrecognisable Cameron Diaz, and the (once again brilliant) John Cusack. Yet then it seemed that the initial promise somehow slips away- the film shifts its focus from Cusack's character to Malkovich himself, and the less screen time that Cusack gets, the more the film loses its momentum to (what I considered to be) an unsatisfactory finale. There also seemed an element of over explanation in the final scenes - why not just leave the audience wondering?Still, a brave and original piece of film making all round- script & direction. Would that more films took risks like this did.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Bizarre, beautiful, fun.","For those who want their reviews as ""thumbs up/thumbs down"", see it. This movie is stranger than you think, funnier than you might imagine, and actually somewhat troubling. It's a bizarre fairy tale, a twisted fantasy, and a warped love story. It's directed by a former skateboard cameraman, who went mainstream, first with music videos (Beastie Boy's ""Sabotage"") and commercials (the one I recall involves doctors, the song ""Tainted Love"", and an EKG).I should warn you that I walked into this movie tremendously excited and enthusiastic. It's set in New York City and prominently features a bit of the New Jersey Turnpike that I know well. Better, I got free passes. Yet USA Films has in no obvious other way bought me out, and any ebulence I show is strictly coincidental. Heck, they didn't even give me a movie poster or a John Malkovitch mask. So I'm sort of resentful.The movie has two trailers. In one, we hear the soundtrack to ""Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control"" while Steven Hawking's voice explains that humans are vessels for something else. In the other, John Cusack asks for the seven and a halfth floor, and the lady with him jams down the ""STOP"" button and crowbars open the elevator. Clearly, she's done this before, and the elevator shows the damage. That trailer is set to the song ""Brazil"" (from the movie ""Brazil"").Those, alone, sold me on the film.See John Cusack out of a suit for the first time in his life. Watch ""Abelard and Heloise,"" the puppet show, with incredible marionettes. Watch John Malkovitch play John Cusack playing a geek. See deep into John Malkovitch's subconsious.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unimaginative,"I bought (yes BOUGHT, not RENTED, but BOUGHT) this movie without having seen it.  That, my friends, is faith.  I had read about the premise and thought it was brilliant; truly innovative.  ""Finally"", I thought, ""a movie that might wash the bitter taste of Lost in Space: The Motion Picture out of my mouth!""  I believed that it might even move me to forget the mistake I made in seeing Hollow Man, though in my defense I was dragged to the theater by two very well-meaning friends.  I must say I was also influenced by the wonderful cast. I mean, there was not one actor in that movie whom I despised, a rarity in my case.  So what, you may be thinking, was my problem?Let me tell you.As far as a wonderful idea goes Being John Malkovich didn't let me down. The film holds an idea born of sheer brilliance, and, let's face it, probably more than a little cannabis.  It is an idea rife with promise and potential.  With it this work could've gone so many wonderful places and could've expanded minds like no movie since Spaceballs has even attempted. The makers of this film could have done all of these things and more with such a fresh idea, such an imaginative idea, but did they?  No.  That is why I am so bitter.  I wasted $16.50.  The makers of this film instead took an idea that was so original, so untouched, so imaginative and turned it into the most trite sex farce I have ever seen.  They turned it into a movie all about sex.  I felt insulted.  Sex is the least thought-provoking theme that a movie could ever have, and it is almost blasphemous when applied to a film with such artistic potential.  I mean, who doesn't think about sex at least once every minute?  Yeah, real unique.  To be honest, the latter part of the movie seemed like a cop out.  It seemed to me that the script writer wasn't sure of what to do with such a gem of an idea.  Here in his usually capable hands was something that no one had done before, so he panicked and ruined it with an almost narcoleptic ignorance of what he was doing.  Like Dorothy, he had no idea what a pair of ruby slippers could do, so he let them go to waste.  At least Dorothy realized the power of those damn shoes by the end of her romp through Oz and decided to do something about it.  Being John Malkovich makes no such about-face, however.  In fact it falls flat on its face.  Still, like every movie it has its moments and I definitely think it's worth viewing, just don't make the same mistake I did.  For the love of all that's good and decent, borrow it from somewhere.3/10 For giving it the old college try",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
unclassifiable,"I'd love to be able to pigeonhole this film, but I can't.  It really is that good.  The basic premise - a portal in a filing room on the 7 and a half floor of an office building leads into John Malkovich's head - is crazy, surreal, and weird.  Ok - this could never happen.  But, like Craig the puppeteer and Lottie his curly headed wife (Cameron Diaz!), we slowly come to believe in it.  Well, kind of.  Key to this is the participation of Malkovich himself, who at least shows he sees himself with some humour. Catty Maxine proves a draw for the man and the woman visiting the portal, which gives rise to all kinds of green-eyed situations (and a knock-out and extremely moving ending).  To get from A to B is hilarious, uneasy, and unlike anything else you're like to see.  Work of genius.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hilarious and imaginative,"Being John Malkovich is a film that defies easy categorization, and that's part of what makes it such a fascinating experience. Directed by Spike Jonze and written by Charlie Kaufman, this 1999 film takes an audaciously original premise and runs with it, delivering a satirical, surreal, and often profoundly thought-provoking narrative.The story centers around Craig Schwartz, played with a wonderfully neurotic charm by John Cusack, who discovers a portal that leads directly into the mind of actor John Malkovich. The film then explores the bizarre consequences of this discovery as Craig and his wife, played by Cameron Diaz, and a love interest played by Catherine Keener, each find their lives entangled in increasingly absurd ways.The film excels in blending dark comedy with existential themes. Kaufman's script is a masterclass in inventive storytelling, examining identity, desire, and the nature of self through a lens that is both deeply personal and broadly absurd. The narrative's twists and turns keep the audience constantly on their toes, blending satire with an oddly poignant commentary on the human condition.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This film is quirky, odd, original, which is hard to come by, unusual, strange, unnatural yet natural, bazaar, silly, exact, and in general, a pleasure.

The most weird and original movie I have EVER seen.,"And that is a good thing.  From the conception of the title, to the outline of the story, down to the preview of the film - this movie, no doubt, was going to be either the stupidest creation from some pretty screwed up minds....or it was going to be pure genius, from some of today's most creative film makers.Genius, it very well was.  I mean, whose eyes would it be better to see through than John Malcovich's?  Not many.  John Malcovich deserves Academy recognition for this film, even though he's just acting like himself for most of the movie.  And John Cusack gives his best performance yet as the man who discovers the portal to the unknown (i.e. John Malcovich's head).To compare this movie to anything else would be impossible - it stands on it's own, and may single-handedly redefine the 'weird' movie genre (as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Die Hard"" did for the action genre, and ""Scream"" did for the horror genre). ""Being John Malcovich"" is one of the top 25 best films of the 90's.  To me, it was more than just a simple viewing experience - it opened up a new light to entertainment, thinking and film making.

"To be Malkovich, or not to be Malkovich. That is the question.","John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a nerdy puppeteer who goes to work as a file clerk. While at the office, he accidentally discovers a portal into the mind of the famed actor John Malkovich. This allows people who enter the portal to temporarily (for 15 minutes) experience the world through Malkovich's eyes. Craig finds that he really enjoys the experience, but his mousy, pet-obsessed wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) loves it even more. Craig and co-worker Maxine (a sexy, memorable Catherine Keener) decide that they're going to exploit his find for everything that it's worth. This leads to various unforeseen circumstances.Written by the talented Charlie Kaufman, this is clearly one of the cleverest, most original feature film ideas to come down the Hollywood pike over the last 25 years. Directed with gusto by the equally talented Spike Jonze, a veteran of commercials and music videos making his feature debut, it's an engrossing, one of a kind journey. It turns decidedly darker in its second half, which requires some adjustment on the part of the viewer, but it never ceases to be interesting - and, of course, very funny at times. Malkovich himself in particular is a hoot, but the whole cast is great. Orson Bean plays Craig's boss, a genial, paternal figure, if also irreverent at times. Mary Kay Place is the amusing ""secretary"" at his office. Diaz is sympathetic in what was, at the time, a change-of-pace deglamorized role for her. Cusack shines in one of his more immersive performances, as a character who ultimately comes off as pathetic. Pay close attention to briefly see film director David Fincher on screen (he plays Christopher Bing).Kaufmans' script is quite entertaining, and proves to be involving every step of the way (it's more than just a ""gimmick"" movie). The most laudable element about it is its unpredictability: the viewer can't be 100% sure of where it's going much of the time.

The scene where Malkovich goes into his own head is comic brilliance (even moreso when he gets beaned by a beer can as soon as he comes out).

Now, his stuff isn't for everyone, particularly the average film-goer who isn't ready to sing, or rather, 'think for their supper', so to speak, when it comes to payoff. But for those willing, there's cerebral wealth, hidden pockets of emotional truth and endless story beats that play out like curveball eureka moments and make us ever curious as to how the map of the man's brain plays out when he's spinning his work. Whether a bona fide masterwork (Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, an all timer for me) or a cacophonic dud (Adaptation, a painfully nonsensical misfire) the guy's pen never strays into generic narrative mud. Being John Malkovich is perhaps his oddest entry yet, and believe me it's hard to settle on one to occupy that pedestal. In this one, John Cusack plays a bedraggled puppeteer who lands a job at a weirdo company called LesterCorp, a five foot tall office space located in between the 7th and 8th floors of a high rise. Their he meets sexy Catherine Keener, who throws a wrench in his lifeless marriage to frumpy, pet store owner Cameron Diaz. That's nothing compared to the film's central plot though, a trip into a head scratching metaphysical twilight zone that's equal parts amusing and disturbing. Cusack inadvertently finds a hidden portal which leads directly into the mind of movie star John Malkovich, for a few minutes at a time before dumping the cranial voyager out on the New Jersey turnpike. It's a concept so off the wall and disarming that you kind of have no choice but to roll with the punches and see where it goes, out of sheer curiosity alone. Malkovich plays himself in belligerent, over anunciating glory, and the scene where he inevitably ventures into the portal himself is deranged brilliance worthy of the surrealist hall of fame. Not all of Kaufman's quirks come out unscathed, as we begin to see the deliberation to be weird for the sake of weird shine through the frays in the blanket of authentic inspiration. But when it works, it really works, riding a wave of restrained absurdity that kicks into outright mania when you least expect it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
ma-sheeennn! malcatrazzz!!,"i didn't know what to expect from this movie. i thought it would be a really weird, freaky movie. it had it share of weirdness, sure, but turns out it's alot more as well. it's an absolutely hilarious comedy, a drama, a great salute to john malkovich, who kind of ironically does one of the best performances in his career, and a great piece of art.i throughoutly enjoyed the comedy in the movie. the conversations with charlie sheen and malkovich are great, and malkovich dancing the puppet dance is just so silly-looking i didn't know weather to laugh or cry so i did both.i won't give it a perfect score as a movie due to some inconstansities in the plot and some not that good acting, but as a work of art, the projection of creative minds jonze, malkovich & kaufman, great stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

And I couldn't even make it all the way through this movie! The plot was somewhat interesting, the acting was great, but the way the idea was executed was just plain stupid. The characters were just stupid wannabes who couldn't get a hold of their own pathetic lives. Sure, we're all like that. But these guys were SO eccentric, I couldn't stand to watch. Certain scenes were disgustingly pointless, and the characters were not sympathetic making this movie futile. Sure, there was a good joke thrown in every now and then, but they were almost impossible to laugh at when you remembered what you were actually sitting through.

It took me a few minutes at first to get used to him all raggedy looking. I think he's great. Cameron Diaz was great in this film, but WAS THAT REALLY HER?

amazing,"Rarely have I come across something so interesting. It is not at all just simply a comedy, but an intelligently done genre defining movie that is wickedly funny, disturbing, absurd, and even sad. What makes it even more interesting is how all the characters are not phased by the absurdity around them. Most people would make a big deal about a building with a 7.5 floor, and strange portals into actors minds that drop us off into the NJ Turnpike. Yet, the character take it as it comes, as if it is a very interesting turn in their lives. Perhaps they are unique because of the rather strange lives they lead.Enough about absurdity. This is definitely one of the most creative movies I have ever come across.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
WOW,"Hugely creative.  The writer and director reach for so much.  The actors push this movie along quite well and, looking back on it, I remember my general expression being an open-mouthed, giddy, stunned smile, with a growing confidence that nobody involved in this movie was going to drop the ball while taking me places I have never been to.  ""Being John Malkovich"" is to any movie you have ever seen what Dali or Picasso were to impressionists or realists.  A quantum leap in creativity, with no peers in any recent art form.  It sounds like I'm laying it on a bit thick here, but I have never been this blown away by ANY artist's vision.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Definitely original and fun,"Being John Malkovich is easily one of the most original films ever made. It's plot is twisted and difficult to explain; a financially failing puppeteer, Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), works on the 7 ½ (!) floor of a building filing papers and discovers a portal to the actor John Malkovich's brain.  His sexy, tempestuous co-worker played by Catherine Keener is along for the ride, and his wife (Cameron Diaz) is involved with both.  Then there is Schwartz's boss (Orson Bean) who also has a special interest in Malkovich.The idea behind this film is brilliant, but the most fun of all comes from watching Malkovich himself endure this bizarre situation. The cast and the special effects are the two best features of this film, and Malkovich should win some type of award for being such a good sport. Unfortunately, the story sputters a little near the end, but for its originality and bizarreness , this is definitely worth seeing.  Spike Jonze has made his directing debut that will be remembered for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Disrespectful, bizarre - and utterly brilliant","Director Spike Jonze's first full-length feature is a work of demented genius. Jonze, whose previous work includes the video for Fat Boy Slim's Praise You and a small role in David Russell's 'Three Kings', has created something virtually unique: a film far too bizarre to ever get studio interest, but with main-stream stars and a world-wide release.Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a brilliant but pretentious and egotistical puppeteer. His frumpy animal-obsessed wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz, looking plain  I told you this was weird) urges him to get a proper job, which he eventually does, sorting files on floor 7 ½ of an office building, where the ceiling is so low he is forced to crouch all the time. There he meets a very attractive woman (Catherine Keener) who isn't at all interested in him until he finds a magical portal into the mind of John Malkovich. She suggests charging $200 for fifteen minutes in the great man's head, after which the passenger is dumped onto the verge by the New Jersey turnpike.To explain any more of the (increasingly odd) plot would only convince you not to watch this film. This would be a bad decision, as Jonze handles the idea (by Charlie Kaufman  arrest this man, he must be a danger to society) with a deftness that astounds. The ridiculous concept is only half of the film  the reactions to the supernatural are the real charm. The concept is not clouded by philosophical considerations of self, as Schwartz naively believes, but by love, jealousy and greed.Of course, this turns on the central performances. Malkovich is wonderful as himself and adapts his performance brilliantly as the plot requires. Cusack bravely loses all attractive character traits to create Craig, a jealous impotent idiot with ideas above (and indeed, outside of) his head and Diaz is equally remarkable as the wacky Lotte. It is Catherine Keener however, who steals the film with a display of such massive selfishness and egotism that she fully deserved her recent Oscar nomination. These performances, and a host of cameos, some less than a second (spot Winona Ryder and Jennifer Aniston), really make a film that is in danger of being a little too weird. I have no idea how this got made, but thank goodness it did  it waves two fingers at Hollywood and runs off giggling.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Brilliantly Funny,"I admit that I wanted to see this film for the sheer absurdity of the premise, but I was oh so pleasantly surprised to find that it was an amazingly funny.

Which has amazingly low ceilings. It's when he discovers the portal to John Malkovich that his dreams start to become a little maniacal.I've never been impressed much with Cameron Diaz, but I have a whole new respect for her as an actress after seeing this film. She is almost unrecognizable as John Cusack's wife Lottie with no makeup and frizzy brown hair.And as always, John Malkovich was superb! I highly recommend this film to everyone.

However, these three elements are the only areas you can fault this movie.  But then again, isn't that is what most movies are about: fantasy?Like Brazil, this movie is highly satirical but it doesn't get too serious. And it doesn't have a blunt message like the former movie.  It is just meant to be enjoyed for what it is.  I guess you could fault the movie for the lack of message but that isn't the point.Jonze has created this whole fantasy world firmly grounded in reality that we can explore through the course of the movie.  Being in John's head is quite an experience.  And then John being in John's head is mind-blowing (I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen the movie).  These elements combined with the 71/2 floor, a pet-obsessed wife and tour scheme make this movie great.This movie accomplished brilliantly what 'The Last Action Hero' failed miserably at.

Pungent black comedy about the consequences of human exploitation.,"Weird.  Strange.  Thought-provoking.  These adjectives can be used to accurately describe what you may feel after watching this very original satire/fantasy written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze. Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a struggling puppeteer who gets a job as a filing clerk on the 7 1/2 (!) floor of an office building.  One day after dropping a folder behind a filing cabinet, Craig discovers a small door which leads him into the actual mind of actor John Malkovich!  After experiencing this unbelievable sensation, he is then dumped in a ditch near The New Jersey Turnpike.  Craig then relates his experience to his bisexual, pet-loving wife Lotte (played by an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz) who after going through the portal herself, is convinced that she REALLY wants to be John Malkovich!  Malkovich himself seems to be having a good time poking fun at his own image, giving light to his own hang-ups and eccentricities. However, the film's most colorful character is the shrewd, shrewish, and cold-hearted office worker Maxine Lund (played to perfection by Catherine Keener, who deservedly won an Academy Award nomination), who finds herself becoming the object of both Craig and Lotte's sexual obsessions.  For a $200 fee, Craig and Maxine begin offering everyday people their own chance to be John Malkovich, leading to a dramatic (and less than hilarious) conclusion.. This is an imaginative and sensational expose (in the vein of ""Network"" and ""Bamboozled"") about the effects of trading in integrity for dollars. Nominated for 3 Oscars, ""Being John Malkovich"" is a movie experience like no other.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Unique, Memorable Piece of Filmmaking.","I had wanted to see Being John Malkovich for a long time after seeing it was placed on the top 250, and that it had excellent A+ reviews.John Cusack is Craig Schwartz, a straggly-haired, poverty-stricken puppeteer goaded by his animal-fixated wife (Cameron Diaz, almost unrecognisable under a gigantic brown wig) into getting a proper job, which he does, as a filing clerk on the seventh-and-a-half floor (a gag which really has to be seen) of a nondescript office building. It's here, while working for a dotty centenarian boss (Orson Bean) and lusting after colleague Maxine (Catherine Keener) that he stumbles upon the hidden portal that sucks unsuspecting parties straight into John Malkovich's brain, thus giving the person the opportunity to literally ""be"" John Malkovich for 15 minutes, before being spewed out beside the New Jersey turnpike. But what starts out as a money-spinning novelty quickly descends into insanity, as Diaz discovers the joys of the portal, Keener discovers the joys of Malkovich, and Malkovich slowly begins to twig that a bunch of complete strangers are messing with his head.The acting is brilliant in Being John Malkovich, Cusack has rarely been better and Diaz hasn't done anything this amusing or creative in a long time. But it's Catherine Keener and John Malkovich who stand out the most here, Keener's performance is wickedly enjoyable, she deserved her Oscar nomination. And Malkovich, who really needed to get that Academy Award nomination over Michael Caine, is amazing, he pulls off the most superb performance of his career, playing himself. Spike Jonze is also a man I look forward to seeing more from, his direction skills are ironically fascinating. Charlie Kaufman's writing deserves an Oscar and a Golden Globe, because he has written the most original story I have ever seen in a film.At the end of Being John Malkovich, you'll be sitting there with your jaw dropped open because this film is such a mindblowing, intelligent ride. You'll never, ever see another film like this, so, for your own good, don't miss out.I rate Being John Malkovich 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Film of the Year,"An amazingly hilarious and undeniably strange film, BJM was perhaps a little too ""out there"" for Academy members, but it was without a doubt the best film of '99 in my book. I cannot recall ever laughing harder in a cinema than I did in the scene in which Malkovich enters his own portal. The film's ideas, scenery, and cast all make for an undeniably fresh look at cinema, and the casting of Malkovich was destiny.  He's the last person you'd expect to star in the comedy of the year, and perhaps that's why the film works so effectively. I've tried to explain this film to my friends in Germany (I saw the film in California, while visiting in winter, and  BJM won't be out here until may (!)) yet I wish I had never tried to explain it.  It can't be explained, nor should it be! I have also bought Carter Burwell's score...brilliant!  I can't see why that wasn't nominated for best score.  It's the richest, darkest, and therefore most original piece of music ever set to a comedy, and it adds a completely new layer to the film.  I recommend this film to anyone who thought the Oscar nominations were a bit thin, and to anyone who is tired of ""cookie cutter"" hollywood productions that are either sequels, remakes, or films that SEEM like sequels and remakes (Double Jeprody?  Green Mile?  You've got mail?  Runaway Bride? Boiler Room?  Why don't we just call these movies ""The Fugitive in a Dress,"" ""The Shawshank Magic Man,"" ""Meg and Tom III,"" ""Pretty Woman got Married"" and ""Wall Street Jr.""??)

The Best Movie About a Portal into John Malkovich's Head Ever Made!,"Being John Malkovich, directed by Spike Jonze, probably gets better every time you see it. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman is a genius when it comes to subtle foreshadowing, as well as thinking up with metaphysical comedies like this. But you might be wondering: what is the plot of this bizarre and brilliant movie? Allow me to elaborate.John Cusack is Craig Schwartz, an insecure puppeteer who gets a job working on the seven and a half floor (why would there be a floor that's only half as tall? ""Well, the overhead IS low."") of the Merton-Flemmer building in New York City. There, he meets seductive co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener), who he finds much more attractive than his plain wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz); and Dr. Lester (Orson Bean), his quirky, 105- year old boss who drinks lots of carrot juice. For the first twenty-five minutes or so, we don't even get a mention of Mr. Malkovich, until Craig discovers a small door hidden behind a file cabinet containing a portal. That portal lets you go inside the head of actor John Malkovich (playing himself); to see, hear, and feel all that he sees, hears, and feels for about 15 minutes before being spat out onto the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Craig uses this fantastic discovery for personal gain with Maxine, and Lotte becomes fascinated too. But, once Malkovich himself catches on, things really start to get strange.Yes, this movie is weird and slightly surreal. But Spike Jonze portrays it in a sort of quiet, low-key, realistic way, which makes the weirdness and comedy all the more memorable. If you're a fan of Charlie Kaufman (like me!), then you know that you do sort of have to suspend your disbelief while watching his movies. Granted, I found it a little hard to swallow that everyone in this movie believes Craig about the portal almost right away, but it's really just a stepping stone to keep the story moving along. The characters and acting are all great, and while I wouldn't really say that the humor is laugh-out-loud funny, it leaves you with a unique feeling and becomes more evident on every viewing.The movie isn't just clever and witty, it's often beautiful, with great production values (even if it is apparent at times that it was filmed in Los Angeles rather than New York--when Lotte falls onto the Turnpike for the second time, look in the background for some very Southern Californian palm trees.). The scene where Malkovich goes through the portal into his own head (A.K.A. the best scene in the movie) proves through hilarious means what a low budget movie can achieve with special effects nowadays.By the time the third act rolled around, I thought I had what was going to happen figured out pretty well, but then the already fantastic movie suddenly gives us a great antagonist and a great unexpected ending. Kudos to Kaufman, who makes sure no subplot gets left behind, not even one involving a chimpanzee.As for the title character/actor, John Malkovich is funny and superb as himself, going through all this craziness. People often call him the most sympathetic character in the story, but I would have to give that honor to Craig. Of course, other people will give it to Lotte, or Maxine, or Lester, showing how deep and ultimately unforgettable Being John Malkovich is.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Being cheated out of awards.,"Well, the story repeats herself once again. Last year this happened to the unforgetable `The Truman Show' and this year to `Being John Malkovich', probably the best film directorial debut for a video commercial director. What both films have in common is a unique originality, unpredictability and involving, seductive, irresistible subliminal monsterous tone that spoke of big issues in an unrepeatably subtle, and yet direct way.Obviously, they weren't long enough, or something, for the Academy's taste. I hold that they both deserved the Academy Award for best picture, because that is, I think, the only way American movies have a bright future  if awarding ultraoriginal creations, magnificantly and spectaculary constructed, uniquely written and powerfully and impressively performed. And that's exactly what `The Truman Show' and especially `Being John Malkovich' are.Charlie Kaufman's screenplay has enough originalities for two dozen other movies, but, togather with director Spike Jonze's certainty, they reveal them slowly and neatly, always in a well-argumented manner and with good balance. The plot keeps surprising you from the beggining to the end, never going over the top or losing it's direction.It's hard for me to even imagine how much effort the creators had to put into making this movie, and how hard it was to write it in the first place and then edit all that rough material at the end. I can't remember them failing anywhere, which is very rare in American filmmaking in general nowadays, and when it even happens in a movie like this, it's a miracle.This movie is even so endlessly inventive and unpredictable it kept surprising me even more in the last quarter than in the first or the second one. Or the third one  maybe the most original one. And when even that happens, and when it's not done in a one-invention-on-top-of-the-other-with-absolutely-no-order-or-reason manner, like it isn't here, then you have a great motion picture.`Being John Malkovich' talks wisely, funny and instructively about a lot of subjects that all come from the one in title, and the message is that they should not. Jonze managed to devise a very specific, strange atmosphere that he drags throughout the movie and adapts it to the situations. The result is one of the most stirring movies I've seen in the last few years.An endless number of words could be spilled out about this film. Not one could describe how good it was to me and how truly entertaining it is. Maybe it's not as emotionally moving as his last year's partner in pain `The Truman Show' (both of the movies received best director and best original screenplay nomination, and were deprived for acting nomination  Carrey last year, Malkovich here), but it probably is even a little better performed and better balanced (or edited).Both of them were best pictures of the years they were released in. But obviously not long enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bizarre film deserves a Grammy,"Not wishing to spoil this movie for those of you brave enough to watch.  I disagree with the majority opinion that this is a good movie.  I found it bizarre, offensive, and unrealistic.  Also, there are many dry portions in the action where I felt a better job of tying in the major themes would have been more appropriate.  Overall, the lack of realism and bizarre scenes in the film left my head spinning!  I rate this as one of the years top three worst films (that I saw).",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bit of a disappointment,"Good first attempt Spike Jonze at doing a sanitized Terry Gilliam movie that suffers from a bad Hollywood ending.This film had so much potential in starting with a bizarre premise.  Through the film it later studies the nature of artistic medium, the actor / director relationship, the depth of the human psyche and personal observation in relationships.  However, by the end we are treated to a lame love story, a stupid Sci-Fi premise, and a Hollywood inside joke.Great performances by John Cusak, Cameron Diaz, Orson Bean, John Malkovich, and Mary Kay Place, Why Diaz was overlooked for the average Catherine Keener is beyond me because Diaz really goes all out in this roll.It is too bad that there is 10 minutes of ending that could have been left on the cutting room floor.  Otherwise, this could have been a real classic if it had the courage to follow its story rather than pander to Hollywood.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The funniest, strangest movie I've seen in some time","It would take much more than 1,000 words to describe this movie, so I won't try.  Suffice it to say that you'll not soon see one like it.  It's its own genre.  From the casting against type of Cameron Diaz to the bizarre premise on which the movie is based, it seems an unlikely candidate for a very funny, comples movie -- but it surely is that . . . and more!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Being John Malkovich: a moral story?,"SPOILER!! Be warned!This is one of my favorite movies; I've watched it several times and it keeps taking on new meanings. Other contributors on this site have found the emphasis on sexuality and lesbianism objectionable, but in my opinion these elements are instrumental in expressing what appears to be an essential moral message. Craig is not satisfied with his life, he wants something more and better. In order to fulfill his dreams, he eats the forbidden fruit (i.e. 'hijacking' John Malkovich), and as a result of his hubris he eventually loses everything, including his wife. His marriage with Lotte - though dull and unsatisfying to both of them - could perhaps have been saved and improved somehow, if it hadn't been for their mutual exploitation of Malkovich.As for the scenes dealing with sex and lesbianism, I find them far less disturbing than the scene in which Craig threatens Lotte with a gun and locks her up in a cage, bound and gagged. Up to that point, I had no problem identifying with Craig and feeling empathy for him, despite his problems and weaknesses.On my scale, this movie gets ten stars out of ten.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cruel and smart story,"This movie was mind's roller-coaster! Cruel idea was so soooo insane that it was brilliant! I enjoy, really to watch that film. After many films I don't have a feeling that I have to watch it again, but after this I feel so! And it is A LOT! This mind-twister have to live again!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sheer surreal genius,"This is one of those movies that really affects a certain type of person. If you like surrealism, then you're one of them. If you don't like to think, or if you want a movie as background entertainment, then I wouldn't bother. The plot is so utterly ludicrous that you just have to suspend disbelief for long enough to enjoy the experience. Definitely worth watching several times as there are many subtle jokes and philosophical points throughout the script. The acting is superb. Of course, John Malkovich himself does a fantastic job despite being required to act as a parody of himself. Cameron Diaz is barely recognisable as the wacky wife, and plays the confused, ignored role exceptionally well.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next Terry Gilliam","Unfortunately most won't get a chance to see this film at the theater.  It will most likely only be a limited release unless it starts to make serious money, but for those in markets large enough, run to the theater.  This movie is the most original film of the year.  This premise, on initial description, sounds somewhat suspect.  A out of work puppeteer takes a filing job and finds a portal inside of John Malkovich's body where he can be John Malkovich for 15 minutes.  To explain anymore than that would be giving too much away.  The less known, the better.  The script is smart and funny and the inspired ensemble cast is brilliant.  The most winning aspect of this film is John Malkovich, for having the sense of humor to be cast as himself.  The film is probably not for all tastes, but if you are a fan of Terry Gilliam (Brazil, 12 Monkeys) you will love Being John Malkovich.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a roller coaster,"I found myself laughing wholeheartedly at so many completely unexpected and bizarre scenes in this movie.  What could have been a good movie was made astounding by the sheer audacity of having John Malkovich actually playing himself as a character (a brief jaunt through his subconscious made me wonder as to the honesty of it).  A full force tumble through someone's brain through the eyes of three very needy and occasionally cruel people.  Addiction, love, betrayel, integrity, and just a little drool....",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a terrible movie.  Cinematic garbage.,"This movie was terrible. It was supposed to be poke at the Hollywood mob mentality and chic lifestyle. It is a twisted mess of metaphors and psudo-inside jokes and it comes off as a massive waste of time. The fact that people buy into it is a testament to how desperately the concept has needed a vessel, but this movie is not it. It's like an artist who is artsy trying to pick on artsy people. Comes off as just as elitist as it tries to make Hollywood seem. There is one humorous part that still makes me laugh to this day however. Should you have the stomach to watch this pile, wait the for the ""Malkovich, malkovic, malcovich"" part. It's funny, It's too bad John Cusak was in this movie, in my opinion he had a great record up to this.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Abysmally self-indulgent, slow, unwatchable and pointless","I *desperately* wanted to like this movie. But I hate it! This is a movie that tries too hard to be clever and takes a long time to go anywhere. There are some great moments, especially as Cusak's character settles into his bizarre employment in the seven-and-a-halfth floor offices but these are rare oases in a lifeless desert of self-indulgent tedium. Like Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"", this movie needs a good 45 minutes cutting from the middle.I actually recommend that you rent this movie and sit through every interminable minute of pretentious posturing that it has to offer. Then go find someone who claims it is a good movie and tell them exactly what you think of it. Just remember to rent another movie at the same time to avoid a wasted journey to the video store.In short - a dull and irritating movie that slowly but surely disappears up its own backside.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best movie of 1999,"Hands down, I loved this movie better than any one that I have seen this year.  I saw it before it came out for the first time.  I went in like everybody else, not knowing what it was about.  I laughed until I cried from being so offronted with audacity.  It was funnier than anything I saw, including South Park, Election, and Go.  It was a brave new movie that challenged how all movies were made, in general.All of the actors and actresses in this movie seemed to know what Jonze was going for.  They all acted psychotic and unbelievable in a movie that was psychotic and unbelievable.  There is absolutely no realism to this movie, nor does it ever attempt to be a realistic movie.  From the surreal intro to the creepy ending, this movie never strayed from way out of left field.  It stayed its course, and everybody who hates this be damned.I really would love to spill the beans about everything in this movie, it is so wonderful...but I can't.  I can't even give away any basic plot points. I went in blind and appreciated it all the more for going in blind that I do it now with all of my movies.  I will go in blind, except knowing about performances or genres.  I almost started this paragraph spilling plot points that are basic, but I deleted them.  Go in and be surprised.However, I cannot recommend this movie to everybody.  This is a brash movie that will shock and offend some in ways that they have not imagined.  It is a black comedy, darker than most.  However, there is no death in this movie. It takes its humor from better, more intellectual sources than that.  But, it is dark, and most will hate the movie for being brash, and not having many likeable characters.  However, the rest will love this movie for being brave, brash, and unlike anything we've ever experienced before.----------------10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Who wouldn't want to get into THAT head?,"Well, I'm biased. I love everything Malkovich does. But this is extraordinary. It's weird. It's top-notch. What a wonderful mix of talent and wackiness. And they are all so great. How did they get Diaz to look that homely? How did they get Cusack that nerdy? How did they get Malkovich to make fun of himself like that? Wonderful! Everybody's favourite seem to be the ""Malkovich Malkovich"" scene. Mine is when Malkovich is freed from Swartz and for a brief moment enjoy a moment of relief before his mind is totally bombarded by an endless stream of seniors. You got to see this!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Huh?,"This was one of the most boring and pointless movies I have ever seen in my life! That bit where John Malkovich enters his own head was completely daft.Its just weird because it wants to be, not to do anything with a proper plot (if there is one). The movie just moved along with people having random ideas and somehow tying it all up with entering into John Malkovich's head.Hippie-looking puppeteers, transsexuals, midgets working between floors of an office building, and people living inside people?What's the point?",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"a remarkable, wildly imaginative tale","Smart, funny, wildly inventive, highly original dark comedy/fantasy about a struggling and socially inept puppeteer (Cusack) who discovers a portal at his new job that literally gives him access to the mind of mainstream actor John Malkovich. When he and a manipulative co-worker decide to exploit the discovery for all it's worth, it quickly backfires in ways they could never imagine. An unusual but fascinating, ingenious story driven by subtle but broadly funny humor and effectively off-the-wall performances, especially Malkovich. It's not always on target, yet consistently finds ways to throw out new, effective ideas. A real treat for those who are looking for something fresh and unconventional. ***½",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you like ""Films"" you must see this one!","Short and sweet. I had very high expectations going into this movie. I was not disappointed! If you like John Malkovich, John Cusack, or Cameron Diaz you will probably like this movie!By the way, there were no cheesy lines about Malkovich and Cusack both being in Con Air.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I have seen the light and it is John Malkovich,"The most creative movie I have ever seen. I won't bother summarizing because it wouldn't even begin to do the film justice. All I can say is that I was so mesmerized by the concept and the performances that the film could have been 45 hours of John Malkovich brushing his teeth and I still would have been weeping uncontrollably. If you want to indulge your fascinations and get lost in a wild creative ride SEE THIS MOVIE. I only wish I had thought of the idea first, but I probably would have come up with something much less interesting like ""Being Bob Saget"". No offense I think I saw every episode of ""Full House"". Anyway this movie is certainly a must see and will captivate your imagination well after you've left the theatre. If nothing at all it's a blast to sit through.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
