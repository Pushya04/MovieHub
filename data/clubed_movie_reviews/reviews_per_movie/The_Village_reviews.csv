Shyamalan's most under-appreciated film,"I don't think I've ever been more shocked by how much I liked a film. I had very low expectations when I decided to watch ""The Village,"" because I knew how much critics had panned it. I'm not saying that I regard the consensus of the critics as sacrosanct. But the movies I love are rarely ones that have earned critical scorn, so by the law of probability I doubted that this one would be any good. Besides, I had noticed a steadily downward slope in the quality of M. Night Shyamalan's films since ""The Sixth Sense."" When ""The Village"" was released and subsequently panned, it seemed to fit the pattern that I myself had noticed. So I didn't go and see the film. Only recently did I take a look at it on cable, more out of curiosity than anything else.And alas, I found the first fifteen minutes rather slow. The movie has a lot of characters, and it doesn't quickly establish which ones are the most important. All we see is this primitive nineteenth-century village in the midst of woods that the villagers believe to be haunted by ominous, sentient creatures who will not harm the people as long as they don't set foot in the woods. The villagers have all sorts of rituals to protect themselves from attack, such as avoiding the color red (what is it with Shyamalan and red?) and wearing yellow hoods. But rules are meant to be broken, and a quiet, mysterious young man played by Joaquin Phoenix wants to journey into the woods so that he can visit ""the towns"" on the other side, which boast superior medicine. Among other things, he wonders if he'll find a cure for his mentally handicapped friend (Adrien Brody). In the meantime, he's falling in love with the blind girl (Bryce Dallas Howard) whose role in the plot will expand as the movie progresses.The love story between Phoenix and Howard is well-handled and believable, transcending the romantic clich√©s. The two characters seem to possess a common understanding and don't have to talk much in order for us to feel the developing bond between them. But what they do say to each other is intriguing. My favorite line is ""Sometimes we don't do things we want to do so that others won't know we want to do them."" Their personalities also transcend stereotype, particularly with Phoenix: while stoic and courageous, he's also shy and withdrawn, as revealed in scenes where he passes letters to the public council instead of speaking in front of them. His ultimate significance to the story turns the heroic convention on its head.Everyone in the village speaks in an oddly formal manner, using big words and avoiding contractions. The accents are American, but the diction is like that of a nineteenth-century English novel. Amazingly, the actors make this language sound natural as it rolls off their tongues. The cast includes several familiar faces: William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson, and the aforementioned Phoenix and Brody. But the star of the film is the as-yet unknown Howard, who delivers a performance so compelling that it's a shame the film was trashed by critics.Much of the film concerns the relationships of the characters in the village, but the mystery of the creatures also dominates the plot. This is more of a quietly creepy ""Twilight Zone""-style tale than outright horror. Like Shyamalan's other films, it ultimately carries a message of hope and optimism. But Shyamalan does not forget his horror roots. No other Hollywood filmmaker today is better at crafting scenes where a character is being haunted by an evil presence. These scenes work because of Shyamalan's acute sense of how nightmares feel. Like all skilled horror directors, he knows not to focus on the monster itself but on the panicked reaction of the character being stalked.While the use of a blind character is hardly a new device, Shyamalan handles the scenes with Howard in an interesting way. Instead of the usual approach of teasing the audience by showing exactly what the blind character doesn't see, he practically makes us blind along with her. He has the camera follow her as she walks, so that we don't see what's in front of her. We soon realize that we are seeing little more than what she is able to discern about her surroundings. In crucial scenes, we are effectively almost as much in the dark as she is.I cannot say much more about the plot without ruining the movie's surprises, which are abundant. Critics dismissed ""The Village"" as a crude exercise in plot manipulation. I couldn't disagree more. While I'm not certain that the logistics of the plot work in every detail, most of the criticisms I have heard reflect a superficial reading of the story.The film has the same basic structure that Shyamalan always uses, where we are swept up in the events and only at the end do we find out what the movie was truly about. From there, we have to think backwards to understand the ultimate meaning of the story. I have seen the movie three times now, noticing new things each time. The social themes make me think that Shyamalan is familiar with Joseph Campbell's works on primitive societies and the origin of drama. The back story is very well thought out compared to that of the average thriller, and I feel some disappointment that more people aren't able to appreciate it. The beauty and genius of this film is a well-kept secret.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ignore the Shyamalan stigma - this is a gem,"In recent years, M Night Shyamalan's reputation has taken a serious beating, having directed universally panned Razzy films (such as The Last Airbender and The Happening), and even some recent successes (Split, Glass) haven't been enough to salvage his career. However, slightly earlier in his directorial filmography sits this genuine horror-mystery masterpiece, criminally underrated and judged undeservedly.The Village is a different take on a horror trope, detailing an isolated community's resolve against a hidden threat in the surrounding forest. As this genre goes, the cast does not get any better: Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody and Brendan Gleeson all feature prominently, as well as relative unknowns Jesse Eisenberg and Dallas Bryce Howard in some of their earlier roles. All are individually excellent and well-cast, perfectly depicting the repressed fear of a society without outside influences.The plot of is consistent and of genuine quality, which doesn't often translate in the horror genre; however, do not be dissuaded by the premise of horror - The Village plays more off the resulting drama than cheap jump scares, and slow burns until the revelations in the second half blow the script open. The forest village is the ideal setting for this hidden evil, sparsely populated and somewhat bleak - the integral use of red and yellow elevate the cinematography further, making the environment more distressing.The Village should be a must-watch purely on the merit of the plot: some may not connect with the subtleties of the script and the nuances of the story, but those who take the time to invest will be thoroughly rewarded with a quality film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I Don't Understand the Hate,"This appears to be a really divisive movie. It seems to me that people wanted another Sixth Sense and when The Village arrived, people were disappointed. Maybe the distributor didn't help by giving the impression it's a horror movie. It isn't. Or maybe some have taken against the writer/director.It's a story of someone going to great lengths for someone they love. It just so happens there's a twist on the way.I've recently rewatched The Village after many years. And whilst I knew the twist, there was plenty to keep me entertained and I think it's held up well. Put it this way, I persuaded my 14 year old to watch it with me, and she thoroughly enjoyed it. There were jump scares, good performances and it looked good. The twist completely wrong footed her, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Movie suffers from inaccurate marketing......,"As with M.Night's other movies, I enjoyed this latest outing, especially the performances of the leads. I think the movie suffered in overall response due to a poorly conceived marketing plan.The movie was sold as a horror film and fans of that genre went into this with that mindset in place. When the film actually turned out to be a look at how we try and protect those we love from the horrors of the ""real world"", fans were upset and rightly so. As anyone that has enjoyed M.Night's movies, all is not what it would seem. I think the marketing pushed too hard the horror aspect which created an expectation that was not going to be met.I think if you go into this movie expecting another commentary on spiritual and moral themes, you are going to like this. If you are going into this for the scare factor, you are going to be left empty.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good enough for me.,"I read somewhere that The Village was M. Night Shyamalan's best and most underrated movie. I wouldn't agree with that as The Sixth Sense was his best to me. But that's my opinion. The Village is entertaining though, like most of his movies, with the right amount of suspense. The cast is great as well, all top class actors and actresses so bad acting isn't present in this movie. To be honest this is my second viewing of this movie, and I liked it more the first time but that's just because of the element of surprise that plays a big role in his movies. It's a good movie for a first time viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a very underrated movie,"I like clever movies, and I like scary movies. And because of my disposition I already spent money on two very awful movies that came from Hollywood this year: abysmal ""Godsend"" and at first glance promising but ultimately stupid and disappointing ""The Forgotten"".That's why I proceeded with care to the latest Shyamalan's work: ""The village"". The trailer looked promising: a desolate turn-of-the-last-century village, sorrounded by the forest in which some horrible creatures live. Promising, but being careful lately, I first checked around the net...and was amazed to see a big load of negative reviews. Roger Ebert for instance, whose opinion I usually respect, gave it a horribly low grade! Great.Nevertheless, I chose to see it, and I must say was quite pleasantly surprised. Here, ladies and gentlemen, you have a very nicely shot, atmospheric thriller with great cast, good story and a few finishing touches of Shyamalan's cleverness (which could be simply called brilliant when compared with the latest scripts that the Hollywood vomits over its audience!).Why the lousy reviews? Well, there are basically two kinds of people that will want to see this movie: first the horror fans, who will expect a gruesome and chilling and potentially bloody tale, and the puzzle-movie fans, who are more or less not interested in the movie itself, but in ""solving the latest Shyamalan's puzzle"" of what the movie is all about.The horror crowd will be disappointed. There are scares in this movie, but way too much characterization and drama for their taste. As for the other crowd, well people, the twist is there, but this time it's very guessable (although Shyamalan still has some tricks up his sleeve, as you'll see).It seems that Shyamalan will always live in the shadow of his masterpiece ""The 6th sense"". People still remember getting their socks knocked off with its powerful ending, and keep expecting that to happen again with every following movie. What's worse, Hollywood realized that the twists are trendy, so lately we have lots of movies with a final twist, most of which are stupid/cheap/illogical. People today set their expectations too damn high, especially if they see Shyamalan's name at the movie poster.This movie is great. The atmosphere is great, the cast is fantastic, and what I mostly love about it, it's clever. It's logical. And whatever you say about it, it's CONSISTENT. Compared to the other Hollywood crap we are getting served lately, this is a VERY good movie.Watch this, but not as a puzzle, but as a great movie in itself.Well, just my 2 cents.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Shyamalan's Best Films,"The Village is set in a small, rural community living in a kind of 19th Century self-supporting agrarianism. Woods surround the town, and the villagers maintain a strict perimeter, as there are creatures in the woods with whom they've reached a truce so long as the borders are not breached. Tension mounts as the creatures start breaking their normal pattern, and one of the villagers, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), seeks permission from the town elders to travel through the woods, to the towns and ""those we don't speak of"", so he can acquire medicine for his fellow villagers.For anyone seriously interested in the art of film, The Village is worth a viewing just for its cinematography and score. That's not to say that the story isn't good. It's a captivating tale of a very odd small town, complete with a twist, as is characteristic of director M. Night Shyamalan. The twist may not be as shattering here as it was in some of his previous films, such as The Sixth Sense (1999) and Unbreakable (2000), but it is still a change that catalyzes an eye-opening recontextualization and reassessment of the previous material, making the film and the final resolution of the story even more poignant. It is also interesting to note the many possible metaphorical readings, ranging from political insularism to religion, or even more literal comparisons to social and geographic segregation (from ethnic enclaves to gated communities).Shyamalan could be said to have a directorial gimmick, although that might not be the best word because it's usually taken negatively, and I don't mean it to undervalue his approach. He makes genre films in the guise of realist dramas. So far, all of his films since he hit it big with The Sixth Sense have used this interesting device, each in a different genre. The Sixth Sense was a horror/ghost story. Unbreakable was a comic book film. Signs was sci-fi. The Village is fantasy/adventure. It also has some horror elements (as do Unbreakable and Signs).Part of Shyamalan's genius as a filmmaker is that he can achieve the usual responses associated with those genres using such unusual, relatively mundane and realist material. For example, in The Village, he is able to build up an incredible amount of suspense in relation to two very simple things--flowers of a particular color, and beginning a walk into the woods. A simple walk into the woods is also the beginning of an adventure just as grand as any depiction of a quest for the Holy Grail, say. And the ensuing plot developments, although very ordinary on one level, have a profound, redemptive effect. Many of the most important developments in the climax aren't even directly stated; they're just subtly implied in what we're shown, yet they all work extremely well. While Shyamalan's style may require some adjustments for viewers more accustomed to chaotic, MTV-paced genre films, or on the flipside, for viewers less accustomed to elements of fantasy in their films, it is worth altering your preconceptions about pacing and content.The cast is excellent. I'm not usually the biggest fan of William Hurt, but I even loved his performance. Joaquin Phoenix and particularly Bryce Dallas Howard are amazing. The film wouldn't have worked without the right person in either actor's roles. Both were perfect choices. There is also a wonderful, very slight surreal quality throughout most of the film shown in the behavior of the villagers towards each other.James Newton Howard's score may be his best to date in a very long list of credits. The music always provides just the right atmosphere, sense of wonder/mystery, pathos and suspense. Roger Deakins' cinematography is equally brilliant, capturing a slight eeriness, sense of foreboding and comfort all at the same time, and with an ingenious use of colors. Much of the film leans towards rich yellow/orange hues and tints, with strong green accents in the grasses and trees. Whenever red is introduced, it is appropriately intense. The framing of shots and staging of scenes is equally impressive.I know that this film has had its detractors, but I cannot see why. For my tastes, The Village is yet another masterpiece from a very creative, innovative filmmaker.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not necessarily a horror film, but a character study with elements of horror","I went to see M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" today.First things first... I won't even discuss a SINGLE aspect of the plot, here, so you can read this safely. I will say this: If you plan to see the movie, do not read a single review (besides mine!). As with most of Shyamalan's films, the less you know about the plot going in, the better.As far as the quality of the film... it is solid. Beautifully directed, well acted, dramatic, scary, sometimes funny, and with some great plot twists. It is not as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", but it's probably not fair to keep comparing Shyamalan's work to his first big hit, one of the best psychological horror films ever made. A director could work his entire career and never make a SINGLE film as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", let alone recapture that movie's amazing brilliance.But, I hear you asking, is ""The Village"" better than ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" (Shyamalan's second and third films)??? Well, that depends on what you thought of those films. Personally, I'd probably say that it is a better film than those two. At the very least it is more sophisticated, with stronger themes, a much bigger and better cast, and more subtle surprises than in those two films.""The Village"" continues Shyamalan's pattern of there being twists in the plot, but this time there are SEVERAL of them and they occur sporadically throughout the film... not one big one at the end. You WILL be surprised by the film, but don't expect to be bowled over.I would describe this as his most subtle film, and also as more of a character study than a horror film. The characters here are very rich, and their interactions and relationships with one another are very rewarding in big and small ways. The acting is phenomenal, most noticeably by Academy Award winner Adrian Brody and Joaquin Phoenix. But first time actress Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter), William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver all give solid performances as well.""The Village"" is a character study of how a community and individuals respond under pressure and fear. And while it has elements of horror, I'm not even sure I would describe it as a horror film.But don't get me wrong, there are some real scary moments in the film... just don't go in expecting a roller coaster ride. While I was watching it, I kept thinking about some of the better episodes of The Twilight Zone that had a few thrills but left you thinking about human nature more than anything.Go see ""The Village"", but bring someone with you.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Mixed bag,"Shyamalan has enlisted an impressive cast in this film who all give fun performances. Unfortunately, like the plot itself, the great cast is ultimately left to dry. I'm beginning to wonder if Shyamalan makes the same film over and over again. The films always open with such promise, creepy, suspenseful. Like with his other films this one revolves around the ""suprise"" plot twist, but this time around it doesn't quite work. The ""surprise"" is pretty obvious and revealed much too early, pretty much killing the suspense.The film is beautifully shot, but all visual quotation of classic landscape paintings seem to distance the viewer more than bring them into the story. Sometimes the film sweeps you away with its sensuousness, but in the end it leaves you feeling cheated.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
odd movie from Shyamalan but has his touch nonetheless,"I had no idea what to expect from M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village,"" since I had heard nothing but awful things about it. It wasn't awful; there was a lot good in it, as Shyamalan, unlike some, is a thoughtful filmmaker. I don't think he's the man with the problem. I think it's his audience. They go, as they did in Signs, expecting to see a scary alien movie and are disappointed. With Shymamalan, it's never what's on the surface; it's always what lies beneath. And no matter the plot, what lies beneath an M. Night Shyamalan film is spirituality and some of life's fundamental questions.The question here is: Can we really isolate ourselves from evil? A little village, bordered by a forest that contains some sort of evil creatures, is threatened when the creatures, for the first time, seem to be encroaching on the citizens' territory. When a near tragedy strikes, one of them (Bryce Dallas Howard) must go through those woods into the town - something never done.There are some scary scenes, to be sure, but Shyamalan for me is never about the scary scenes so I'm not going to object that ""The Village"" wasn't terrifying enough. What I will say is that it does not have the pacing of his other films. It is drawn out with some slow patches in which nothing happens. Atmosphere is one thing, and it has plenty of that - but when that's all there is, a little judicious editing is called for.Bryce Dallas Howard, as the blind Ivy, seems to have inherited the family acting talent - she is a real find and does a marvelous job with a large and difficult role. Joaquin Phoenix as well is very good. And then there are the actors with whom I was young - Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt - class casting for sure, and the two pros give beautiful performances. Hurt is really making a niche for himself as a character actor. Weaver is still beautiful enough to play leads if she can get cast in one. Broadway star Cherry Jones seems to be a favorite of Shyamalan's, and she is again on hand in a small role. To cast even a bit part with a double Tony award winner shows good taste.Adrien Brody has had an odd career since his Oscar win. I advise him and Halle Berry, while we're at it, to get new agents. He plays what can best be described here as the village idiot. At first, I thought the character had Tourette's syndrome - well, there was something wrong anyway, and while I suppose he was good, I agree with one of the posters. He was annoying - a manic in a sea of soft-talking, well-mannered people.Be advised - M. Night Shyamalan doesn't make horror films. Strange sometimes, surprising, spiritual, romantic. But the aliens et al are just bogeymen asking us to confront what needs to be confronted.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Extremely Underrated (NO SPOILERS),"M. Night Shyamalan definitely did himself a disservice in releasing ""The Sixth Sense"". Brilliant as the film was, its ""twist"" ending was so powerful that audiences the world over expected nothing less from the talented young director. And so, Shyamalan has been trying with every single outing since to recapture that sense of awe.Although many have made scathing remarks about the ending of ""The Village"", it is perhaps his most perfect since ""The Sixth Sense""; though by no means a huge surprise, it nevertheless settles into the ambiance and leaves the film with a tinge of melancholy that belies the trailers.It is a film of startling imagery, with a theme of 9/11-inspired innocence versus corruption that creeps into the mind and stays there until it unfolds over and over again. Many have called the acting ""wooden"", but a second viewing of the film would change that opinion; it is, after all, part of the point. Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter) lights up the screen in an astounding premiere performance as the blind Ivy, Adrien Brody delivers a searing portrayal of longing as the dim-witted Noah and Joaquin Phoenix heightens the moody tone with his strong, silent-type Lucius. ""The Village"" is about these people, this community living in fear, not the monsters of which they have been warned; it is about the psychology of fear rather than a horrific portrayal of it.It must be said that the only thing wrong with ""The Village"" was the promotion for it. The adverts made it seem like a thrill-ride of Gothic horror, like the scariest film yet to be filmed - and audiences were running in their droves to catch yet another Shyamalan Twist. Instead of investing their emotions in the characters, viewers kept their distance in the knowledge that they would be hoodwinked, that the entire thing was a set-up to catch them out anyway. Wrong as this is, it was ultimately the undoing of the movie; had it been promoted as a thoughtful, stark, moody piece of film-making, then both the critics and the public would have been satisfied.This is not a film about The Twist Ending, but about wrapping its beauty around your mind, and the quiet, haunting finale is what helps to keep it there.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Brilliantly nuanced, subtle, smart, and expertly played","It's not what you think it is. It's not horrific. It's not gory. It is however a very well written and played thriller drama, with a fantastic love story woven into it to keep it from getting overbearing.I've seen the 6th Sense and thought it was fantastic, and passed on Signs because I'd already been sick of alien movies by then, though it looks like I should see it.I went into this film without preconceptions about M. Night Shyamalan or his previous work. I wanted to see a good scary movie. Good it was. Scary it was less. Don't go into it expecting to get horrified, and you won't leave the movie upset about it.I liked this movie a lot, largely because it caught me by surprise at many points. It's too easy to spoil the movie if I mention why though, so I'll just say you have to see it for yourself.The acting, particularly by Bryce Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, and William Hurt, was played well with the right subtlety and nuance to make the characters believable.Howard's role as the smart, emotionally strong tomboy who also happens to be blind was played with an understanding you don't often see in a period role. She was Ivy, and she was living in the late 19th century. She showed an innocence that she could only have gotten away with in this character, and she played it like the time was hers.There was no doubt of who she was. She conveyed the strength (both her real strength and that which she exuded with a feminine machismo) of her character very well, but never pushing it over the top. She never shouted an emotion; she whispered it, but it was loud and clear. When she spoke about love and fear, you felt it. When she cried she wasn't hamming it up; she exuded grief from eyes, face, and body. She was brilliant, and I can't wait to see her on screen again. She also happens to be incredibly beautiful. Did that cloud my judgment? Go see the movie.Phoenix continues to upstage his previous roles in every movie I've seen him in. His expressions are classic. The theater laughed more from his modest look of confusion in one scene than I've heard at the last 3 comedies I've watched. He was being more serious than ever, but the comedy of his emotions, however brief, was transmitted perfectly through his stone cold face, only barely showing what he felt inside, but saying everything. Throughout the movie, he was quiet, thoughtful, brave, and pure of spirit, and he said it all in so few words. When he spoke of emotion, it had a power that gripped me. The lines he delivered, though incredibly well written, were meant for him.Shyamalan's dialogue helped, in that it was rarely obtrusive when spoken by these actors.About the story: It twists in ways few could imagine. That makes it a bit upsetting. Expect to be let down a little. If you're not looking for gory horror, then you might just love it. When it's not changing directions though it's fantastic in it's subtleties. I can't avoid that word because it applies well to how Shyamalan put this together.I don't buy many movies, but I will be purchasing this when it comes out on DVD.",,Anonymous,Mystery

the village was good,"I disagree with other commenter. the ending twist was not obvious. I found this to be a thoughtful, deep movie with effective dialogue.

However, if you go into it with an open mind and like drama/suspense with a good premise, this is a very nice movie! The camera work was effective. Adrian Brody plays a good role albeit not a large one. Rating the Shamalan movies, I'd say The Village was second only to Sixth Sense. It was better than both Signs and Unbreakable.

Sociologically fantastic,"This movie absolutely blew my mind. I grew up in a small village in Central Illinois. My village is on the map solely because of the Amish community which has established itself in the rural area around the town. ""The Village"" is reminiscent of all things strived for by the Amish community. Whilst ridiculed by many and misunderstood by most of the rest, the Amish and the community in ""The Village"" long for the same things: a return to simpler times when the good in life was much more prolific. Although it could be argued that the members of the village have their ideals based upon and rooted in fear, that doesn't differ drastically from many ideals held throughout the world. The negative aspects of our ideals may not be as obvious and spelled-out to us like those of in ""The Village,"" but they remain similar none-the-less. ""The Village"" is a real thinker's movie and I commend M. Night Shyamalan for another remarkable movie. I can't wait to see what's next.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A Sensitive, Unique Look At Occult-Like Events","The Village (2004)7/10A Sensitive, Unique Look At Occult-Like Events29 January 2005. Warning: Spoilers. Mr. Shyamalan has attempted a very difficult task of creating a horror-like movie with a major twist. In an effort to use audience's past impression of his prior works, Mr. Shyamalan taps into this impression in a major way to create an illusion - the major premise of this film. In an effective, though not entirely satisfactory way, Mr. Shyamalan is able to pull off a very human, sensitive, and thoughtful thriller that reflects more of humanity than on the occult or horror. It is impossible to know if any other director/writer could have improved on Mr. Shyamalan's attempt in this movie since he is operating on a singular premise of fear, horror, and monster-mythology in a way that is perhaps unattainable. He is to be commended for his efforts at an entirely different way to perceive reality and reflects both the confusion in today's world to another alternative way to seeing it that in the end may have not ultimate resolution.

Critics only dislike it because of the ""dissapointing"" twist, which is a shame. Shyamalan made two movies with a twist, and critics started to expect it. I love the ending.

"Exceptionally literate psychological drama, with intricate threads interwoven in compact yet complex plot...","M. Night Shyamalan wrote, co-produced, and directed this deceptively simple whirlpool of deceit and consequence. This is the kind of human study (with a suspenseful undercurrent) that might have become legendary as a paperback novel, a swift read on a rainy Saturday afternoon. An isolated East Coast community in the late 1890s, apparently made up of simple farmers and their families, have made a pact with the ominous creatures who live in the forest which borders their hamlet: do not cross into their territory, do not offend the creatures with the color red, feed them raw meat for supper, and be thankful for every day they've had without upsetting Those They Dare Not Speak Of. After a backwards villager has stabbed an innocent young man on the verge of getting married, his intended (a wise but blind lass) asks permission to travel through the woods to find medicine in the neighboring town. Shyamalan always runs the risk of upsetting his own core audience by not coming up with amazing-enough answers to his own circumstances. The scenario here is fully dimensional, the narrative is absorbing and intriguing, and all the players are wonderful...yet, Shyamalan is perhaps too logical in his storytelling (and too methodical in his approach) to satisfy a thriller audience with this story (in the end, it isn't audacious enough). On the other hand--purely as a psychological study--the movie has layers of complexity that seem even deeper in retrospect, and the dialogue is so well-written and delivered it nearly doesn't matter that the scare factor is all a sham. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Knowing The Ending Might Actually Improve Your Enjoyment Of This Movie,"A couple of weeks ago I was part of a family get together and like all family get togethers boredom rapidly set in , so one night my sister rented a couple of DVDs* with one of the films being the horror movie THE VILLAGE . "" Ah "" I piped up "" I know the ending of this and it's not a horror movie "" and promised not to tell anyone the twist ending . The titles came up and my sister asked who the director was as M Night Shymalan rang a bell . I explained that he was the writer/director of THE SIXTH SENSE ( Overrated ) and UNBREAKABLE ( Brilliant movie ) . About half an hour later my sister asked if anyone was still able to follow it and at this point my brother admitted he'd seen it at the cinema and it does pick up .This sums up everything that's wrong with THE VILLAGE - Imagine if you have no idea who Shymalan is and you're expecting a horror movie watching this will be a dire ordeal . It's makes a snails pace look like a speed OD in comparison . We're treated to a series of sequences that on the surface make little sense like people burying red flowers in the ground . This all might make sense after the ending is revealed but what ruins the movie - Even if you know the ending - is the editing , the scenes jar without any sort of flow and as many people have pointed out this feels like a twelve hour movie cut down to a two hour movie with a lot of important scenes cut out . For example we see an attack by the mythical creatures then there's a jump cut to the next day which is very disjointed ,it's not well into the film that it's revealed that Ivy is blind when surely it would have been obvious at the start . Little things like that leads me to believe there's been large chunks cut out of the narrative along with characters that seem to be underdeveloped . And on top of all this the director insists on shooting several scenes in slow motion as if the movie isn't already slow paced enough! !!!! SPOILER !!!!As for the ending where it's revealed that the village is part of the 21st century and has been built by people wanting to escape the violence of modern day America it's by no means as clever as the endings of THE SIXTH SENSE or UNBREAKABLE . There's also a lack of internal logic to this . For example if the younger villagers believe they're living in the 19th Century then why do they wear 19th century clothes ? If they were wearing flares and tie dye T-Shirts they'd still believe they were living in the 19th century if that's what they've been conditioned to believe wouldn't they ? The characters also have odd sounding 19th century speech patterns . Again why would people not knowing what century it was have to speak in 19th century speech patterns ? They could easily use 21st century speech patterns which would make the dialogue easier to understand . Ah but that might make the audience cotton on to the fact that this isn't a 19th Century village after all , the whole film revolves around the twist that it's the 21st Century . As many , many people have pointed out similar ideas have been done much better in a third of the running time in THE TWILIGHT ZONE and without a doubt THE VILLAGE is Shymalan's weakest movie* Just for the record COLLATERAL was the other movie we watched that night",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Shyamalan strikes again with another chilling, yet wonderful film.","When we go to the movies, we have certain expectations in mind. These expectations are increased when one attends a Shyamalan film. He is known for his intricate plots, mind blowing twists, and thrillingly suspenseful style. His newest feat, ""The Village"" more than lived up to his reputation.This is the kind of film that will make you gasp, scream, and jump from your seats while also making you think, which is rare with today's movies. The viewer is never quite sure what will be around the corner and that is what makes this movie so great.All of Shyamalan's movies (ie. ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs"") have a certain mysterious essence that makes them stand out from other suspenseful films. He makes the audience feel many emotions besides fear, in fact, the presence of so many emotions in The Village adds to its quality. He manages to weave a romance into his story, thus making the audience truly feel for his characters. His films tend to have in underlying them, whether it be hope, courage, faith, or in this case love, and that is what makes his work so superb. Go to this movie expecting to feel fear, and every emotion in between.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Very unfortunately advertised completely incorrectly,"The film The Village, was quite unfortunately Mal advertised, this being in Greece of course. Instead of showing the ingenuity of the plot and the sort utopia created, it depicts a cheap horror story. This accomplished two very inopportune things. Firstly it attracted quite a unimaginative unintelligent crowd of people, who were, of course, displeased by the outcome of the story. Secondly it didn't allow the more imaginative more interpretive crowd to enjoy the quite complacent plot and Walden Two like utopia ultimately falling apart the sole reason people never left the place was due to their fear of some unknown creature.It was well done, had a good group of productive actors and a very suspenseful plot and deserves better reviews than it is given.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's really not that bad...,"People write the most accusatory things when they don't get what they were expecting. While not a masterpiece, it is definitely Shyamalan's best film since ""The Sixth Sense"", with the most engaging protagonist since the lovable, mature Cole Sear.""The Village"" is the story of a small community in the 1800s in Pennsylvania, living their simple lives in their utopia, under the threat of omnipresent monsters who dwell in the woods - Those We Don't Speak Of. While the social commentary of this film on American society, post-9/11, may be overly simplistic and misguided, several aspects of this film are nice. While it tends to drag a little at the end (Shyamalan likes quiet, slow moments), the pacing is generally quite good. Technical aspects, such as cinematography, acting and music and are all brilliantly executed - especially Bryce Dallas Howard's performance - she's so fun! When she laughs, it makes you smile. Her character, Ivy, is so full of joy and Howard animates her to endearing effect. Adrian Brody similarly stands out, but Sigourney Weaver is wooden throughout the majority of the film - disappointing given her reputation.Everyone should know by now that ""The Village"" was marketed completely incorrectly. In the ads, it was dumbed-down to a shock-horror using the brazenly obvious symbolic code of the colour red and some nifty, atmospheric shots through twigs. There is more to this film than twigs and red: The characters are generally well developed. Ivy is a splendid character, one of Shyamalan's better ones, especially since the devastatingly dull, stunted Rev. Graham Hess who dominated ""Signs"". Joaquin Phoenix's character, seemingly similarly underdeveloped, is revealed to be loyal and sensitive, and surprisingly masculine. Even the retarded 'village idiot', who initially seems included for comic relief, has a greater purpose in the development of the plot, with a bizarre love triangle emerging. Most of the other characters are either left untouched, or the rest is left to the audience's imagination (particularly with the elders).The music is stunningly good, and (in a rare case with Hollywood films) actually enhances plot development by being closely affiliated with the protagonist.The plot - It's been said before but I'll say it again! It's a love story. Awww, how nice. Ivy and Lucius are a cute couple, and even if you were expecting a horror film, their romance is strong enough to carry the film. However, one of my major qualms with the film lies in the plot, concerning how much time is devoted to the elders, who frankly, aren't that interesting. Interesting in concept, maybe, but the actors who played the elders were stoic and stiff! But, at the end of the day, ""The Village"" is definitely not the worst film ever made - it was made with love, with the actors going to a boot camp to learn how to perform typical 1800s activities, and a score that mirrors the protagonist's 'internal struggle'(if I can use a clich√© term). However, my one criticism of M. Night Shyamalan is this: Please stop trying to rely on one shot to carry a scene. The audience goes to a film expecting just that - and if you're not using that one shot for an effect, such as suspense, please stop pretending that you're directing a play. Yes, I realise you specially cast theatre actors so they could deal with long takes - but long scenes of one take is just ridiculous. The last scene with the elders exemplifies my frustrations perfectly. But, the long take is used to great emotional effect in the scene on the porch between Ivy and Lucius. I commend Night on that scene, but I think my criticism is fair.Look, basically, you're into this kind of slow-moving, genre-hybrid, dystopian fantasy, or you're not. It's up to you.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A literate and clever movie,"The Village is a clever and literate movie. I know it has received a number of negative reviews. However this is to be expected as Mr Shyamalan has had some popular success and is therefore fair game to ""critics"".There is a twist at the end, of course.

The Containment,"M. Night Shyamalan has produced a decent film in The Village. It is interesting how he has used the village and its people as a metaphor to show how fear can keep us imprisoned, contained and controlled. It takes a rebellious mind to break free. It is also striking to see that people could theoretically be contained within a time period. We see the village living in medi-evil times while a few short kilometers away the rest of the world lives in the 21st century. It is an intriguing film to watch and attempts reasonably to get the audience to feel the fear of the villagers. It is a worthwhile film for those who like twists and turns. M. Night Shyamalan has become somewhat of an Alfred Hitchcock with his cameo appearances, and with films like The Sixth Sense he is not too far off.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A lovely shot tale that has resonance in the modern age.,"This user comment is my own personal feelings, it is not a review that I make in the hope of turning anyone's opinion to that of my own, no mater what anyone says or does, my feelings for the film will never change.I see a smartly crafted movie about fear and hope, a community living in fear of the outside world, I see involving characters to follow with interest, I see a gorgeous setting that intrigues and engages me.Manoj Night Shyamalan's fourth mainstream picture is now, as we can all agree, a victim of a terrible marketing campaign, wasn't it? For there are horror elements in the film, of which I don't wish to spoiler write about, the horror elements are there, they just aren't the boo jump scary monster variety that many had hoped for. The ending to the film disappoints many it would seem, but it doesn't to me because it is here that the film has most resonance and the point is well and truly made. It's acted out with style from the majority of the cast, and Shyamalan directs with a steady caring approach. It's not without flaws for sure, but this is a very tidy piece that's saying quite a bit if the viewer is so inclined to jump on board. All told, it's a very solid and thought provoking piece that's made with much film making care. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Recommended Mystery, With a Touch of Evil","Every time I have ever seen a dramatization of ""the good old days"", it comes immediately across as cheerful and smooth. Here, I am, at once, captured by the downbeat, Gothic flavor of this period piece. How did the director achieve that? The entire cast of characters seem on edge from the get go. Something isn't right here in this village. There were a good number of people to mistrust through the entire affair. And multiple plot lines were tied up nicely.I haven't found a fellow-reviewer, yet, who sees the social message underneath all this. Seems no matter how hard you try to make things perfect, something evil is always there, banging on the door.See if you feel sorry for these people, like I do, once you navigate through this roller-coaster ride.The director loses 1 point for a few discontinuities.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The idea that humans would submit to being terrified by nothing at all without fighting back in any way at all does *not* work- especially in America!

"Good movie, part easy to guess (but in good way), part surprising","I don't believe anyone could dislike this movie. It has a soft style, and is directed and written with an emphasis on ""Twist"", with a logical sequence which keeps the viewer guessing, but informed. It is probably best described as an actual horror movie, but not one of those ho hum slasher movies of which there are so many it is hard not to be numb to them. Instead, this relies on acting, story telling, writing, and directing, and I dare say it succeeds admirably. In an isolated village (and the viewer keeps wondering why it is isolated, and that is explained little by little), the elders warn the younger members that there are hostile creatures in the forest which won't bother them as long as they stay in the village. There are secrets kept by the elders, but also secrets by some younger people. The writer, director, and others involved in the movie, knew most of us would guess right on the secrets of the elders quite early, so they provided another surprise that was harder to guess at involving the younger generation. On reflection, the viewer is left to wonder whether this was the end result of the decisions of the elders or it would have happened anyway. To say more may spoil the movie, but it has a lot of messages, and a lot of entertainment value, and it is scary in parts, and the characters are all valid and likable (to some extent). I'd be very surprised if someone didn't like this movie. Very well done.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

great moody light horror but horribly weak ending,"Covington is an odd isolated village. There are mysterious creatures ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" lurking in the woods. They are supposedly attracted to specific colors and the villagers wear the safe yellow when they are close to the woods. The villagers have a truce with the creatures. However suspicious animal carcasses suggest that the truce has been broken. Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to travel to other towns to get medical supplies. He is denied by the town elders and his mother Alice (Sigourney Weaver). Ivy Elizabeth Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) is the blind daughter of the chief Elder Edward Walker (William Hurt). She is kind to village idiot Noah Percy (Adrien Brody). When Ivy and Lucius get engaged, a jealous Noah stabs Lucius. In desperation, Ivy goes out to get medicine with the help of her father.It's an interesting movie for about 2/3 of the time. It has a nice moody vibe. At time, it borders on horror. It's a really fascinating movie. I wish Bryce Dallas Howard is better at playing blind. I also wish William Hurt's character doesn't reveal so much. It deflates the movie. Her odyssey loses much of the tension. Instead of fearing some mysterious boogeymen, the audience is left with nothing more than the random falling into a hole. It tries to recover with a strange mysterious thing. I wish it stayed with the surreal turn. It would work infinitely better if William Hurt would shut up. None of it could really saved this from a truly weak ending. People really hate it when their TV show ends with these kinds of reveal.

M. Night's Final Trickery,"The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs are three terrific suspense/mystery flicks from director M. Night Shyamalan.

Night truly entranced us at the theater.I wish I could give you a little plot summary, but this is the type of film where the less known about it the better. I will say this: Whereas today's ""wonderboy"" director JJ Abrams is all about time travel and relative physics concepts, M. Night's trademark was misdirection. You think this movie is about one thing, but in the end it is 180-degrees of surprise.Overall, this is a suspenseful, mysterious film that will have you on the edge of your seat.

Underrated Masterpiece?,"I just now watched The Village again after nearly ten years since having watched it the first time, and I'm left a little baffled at having fallen for the low review rating and what seems to be the popular opinion that it is not a good film.Granted, the dialogue is sometimes this side of cringey, and questions do arise as to why the characters did or did not do certain things which otherwise would have caused the plot to unravel, but as stories put to film go, this one is quite beautiful.Additionally, in terms of star-power alone, I don't think there are many other films that match it. Seeing Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Jesse Eisenberg, Brendan Gleeson, Cherry Jones, Judy Greer and Michael Pitt, among others, all together in an M. Night Shyamalan film is worth 6 stars on its own.Sadly, it seems that the Village suffered from being mis-marketed as a horror film, when it is anything but.I definitely enjoyed it this second-time-around, much more than the first.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Thoroughly entertaining but by no means a masterpiece,"The various reviews of The Village by IMDb members follow the usual - and I am bound to say, rather unchivalrously - American pattern: it seems this is regarded either as a work of quite unparallelled genius (as in 'this week's work of quite unparallelled genius') or it stinks so much to heaven that it's a wonder the writer, director and chief bottle washer dares show his face in public. But that's the Americans for you: never like to do anything by halves. This rather reserved - Americans might say buttoned up, but they would be wrong - Brit thinks The Village is a rather entertaining, well-made horror flick, but which, at the end of the day, pulls is punches. In hindsight, the plot is so full of holes, if it were a fishing net, a shark would have no trouble escaping. But that is in hindsight: while you are watching, from the spooky opening funeral to the final scene, its rather good, very entertaining, will quite often send a pleasant chill down your spine and will keep you guessing right until the end. It is, in fact, a difficult film to write about because revealing only one of the plot twists would rather spoil the viewing of someone who is seeing it for the first time. So just let me repeat: there are twists aplenty and anyone who knows where it will all end at any point is a better man than I am. The saintly Roger Ebert gave it a very sniffy review when it was first released in 2004, and although I understand the points he raise, his judgement does seem unnecessarily stern. (And his judgement might well be questioned by asking just how much attention he was paying. He did, after all, get one plot point very wrong. The village idiot was the heroine's brother, not just some unrelated village idiot.) Certainly, this has more in common with a shaggy dog story than Macbeth, but then who says that is a crime. Look, I'm struggling to describe this film without giving anything away. Every time I think of a point, I realise that making it might ruin the film for the first-time viewer. So just let me end by saying that everyone from Joaquin Phoenix through Ron Howard's daughter to William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver acquits themselves well, Roger Deakins photography is, as usual, great, and even if the film does, in a way, cheat by (at least to this viewer) by making out it is raising a few quite interesting moral points, only to drop them one by one unceremoniously without a second thought, you could do a lot worse than spend 103 minutes watching The Village.

A superb movie,"This is the movie that finally taught me to forever ignore the critics, at least as an undifferentiated mass. What they have to say about this (and other movies of M. Night Shyamalan) is of a piece with the way Pauline Kael used to dismiss Hitchcock movies as fluffy, second-rate thrillers. Or the way logical-positivists dismiss all philosophy. Here's a clue: If you're an MSM movie critic and see and dislike one of this fine director's movies, spare yourself some professional embarrassment and recuse yourself. ""The Village"" isn't a complicated movie, but it does explore some quite interesting subject matter--what constitutes and sustains a community, what role does the individual play, how do the tensions between individual and community play out and, in that process, how deeply does this interplay challenge and touch our hearts. Touch-feely critics whose critical faculties are formed in our therapy-driven society apparently are just not equipped to see or understand any of this.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Atmospheric drama,"I'd heard some fairly mixed reviews for The Village but decided to give it a go when it was on television as I'd enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's earlier film The Sixth Sense. While I didn't think it was as good as that film it was still fairly good.Set in what appears to be a nineteenth century village the locals live in fear of the strange creatures that live in the surrounding woods, this fear is so great that none of the younger generation have ventured through the woods to the towns they know are beyond them. Since the village elders have had bad experiences in the towns the younger villages aren't that keen to risk going through to woods to go to them any way. This changes when Lucius asks permission to venture through the woods to get medicine from the town that he thinks may help his friend Noah who has learning difficulties. While he isn't given permission to go, Ivy the blind girl who loves him, has to make the journey when Lucius's life is in danger.I've tried to avoid as many spoilers as possible as hinting at plot twists could spoil the film. I suspected the final twist fairly early in the film but right up until the reveal I wasn't certain about it so it still worked. The acting was good, especially Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy and William Hurt as her father Edward Walker. While there are a few scares and there is a fairly creepy atmosphere there is very little gore and no offensive language so it is suitable for most ages. If this is on television it is worth watching and perhaps worth picking up on DVD if you spot it in the bargain section; I've only seen it once but suspect it would be enjoyable even when one knows how it ends.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
My Sixth Sense and All Signs tell me to wait for the next M Night's film on the Unbreakable DVD somewhere in The Village,"My husband and I have seen M Night Shyamalan's most famous four films together, and our opinions were very much the same until we saw ""The Village"" about a week ago. We both loved ""The Sixth Sense"" so much than when ""Unbreakable"" was released, we rushed to see it on the opening weekend. We liked it but not as much as TSS. After we saw ""Signs"", we both decided that we were not going to see Shyamalan's movies in the theater. We waited for ""The Village"" DVD and managed not to know anything about the big twist in the end. To make the long story short, he did not like ""The Village"" and would watch the next Shyamalan's movie when it comes on the network. As for me, I went from dismissal - ""where on earth did he hear people talk like that?"" to ""is this guy as retarded as Brody's character?"" to ""he sure knows how to make a nice looking film"" to ""hey, it is not a horror movie at all"", to ""the idea is really interesting and goes way beyond this movie"" to ""if he only had a sense of humor and did not take his films so seriously"" to ""if only the final result would match the original idea"" - and here where I finally stay. I keep thinking about the film and I find it intriguing, interesting but flawed and often laughable where it did not mean to be. That's what Shyamalan misses, IMO - all his heroes are the pale lifeless shadows, life seems to be drawn out of them. In some of his films, it works, but most of the time, I could care less what happens to them. Besides, even his avid fans mention holes in the plot, and huge ones, I assure you. The whole concept of ""The Village"" is holding on the girl's blindness. Take it away and what do you have? The nice cinematography and music, the good actors who had not much to play, the Brody's character who made me laugh hysterically every time he was on the screen and I don't believe that was the writer/director's intentions, the moody atmosphere (again, I've been in his atmosphere, all his films have it), and sometimes, ridiculous dialogs.I think, I will wait for the next Shyamalan's film's DVD and I believe ""The Village"" is better than ""Signs"" but inferior to ""The Sixth Sense"". I also believe that he was on the top of his game when he told the story of one little boy's struggle with his gift/curse and not when he tries to embrace the global problems.The Village 6.5/10 The Signs 4/10 The Sixth Sense 9/10 Unbreakable 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Their relationship felt very genuine and was very sweet, especially a scene on their porch.

Well, I remember voicing my thoughts there and then after and, finally, last night I was disappointed to find out I was bang on the money.So, the twist isn't unpredictable and most will spot it a mile away. Another ""Sixth Sense"" experience, me thinks! But how does the film stand-up in general? Well, to be brutally honest, it's just average. There are a few creepy moments and there's some imagination in Shyamalan's script but it's a flat experience overall. The talented cast are wasted in this project.

'The Village' Doesn't Fit Neatly in a Box...,"Therefore, all the hatred and horrible reviews ensue. Roger Ebert gave this film 1 star. Unbelievable.

If you've read Ebert's reviews over the years, you will see he misses the boat on many great films. This is one.This is a film that defies genre. That apparently is too much to handle for a great many film goers. It also comes with a profound twist. This film is best appreciated if one doesn't know about this on initial viewing. Many people who knew about the twist ahead of time trashed the film. Many others were expecting a gruesome horror film.'The Village' is loaded with profound thematic material. In the character of Noah, we see the origins of evil. Petty human jealousy leads to a 'crime' as Walker puts it. This is what the founders of the Village came to escape.We also see the creation of a mythology in Ivy's journey. Every budding civilization required its own mythology. The story of Ivy and Lucius underscores and edifies the vision of the founders.Its not a perfect film, but I found it to be so fascinating, I re-watch it every year or so.

The movie was presented as a scary supernatural horror/thriller. What you got when you watch the movie is a thriller with too few real thrilling moments and a dramatic love story. Basically all the excitement in the movie was already in the trailer.Still ""The Village"" is a perfectly watchable movie mainly because of the cast. I think it's fair to say that the movie is better as an actors movie than as a thriller. Especially Adrien Brody was surprising good in his role. Bryce Dallas Howard is a good actress (although she was not really a convincing blind person) but her character is not strong enough to carry the entire final part of the movie. Joaquin Phoenix's characters disappears way too soon out of the story, the movie could have really used his character.I know that M. Night Shyamalan and Roger Deakins deliberately choose bright colors for the movie but I can't say that I'm completely happy about the visual style. A more of a foggy ""Sleepy Hollow"" kind of atmosphere would had done wonders to the movie I think. It would had certainly made it more exciting.All in all a movie that promises more than it really is and that lacks some good and realistic excitement that all other M. Night Shyamalan movies thus far had. Disappointing but most certainly not unwatchable!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
one of my top 20 favorite films of all time.,"From the story to Deakin beautiful cinematography, and perfect sound track. There are just so many moments that i can comfortably say that they were actually ""perfect"". The the whole cast was just one of the best ensambles Ive seen. The speach William Hurt (one of my favorites) gave to convince the elders he had to risk everything ""for the right and knoble cause"" just gets me every time. These people created a harmonious community in hopes to remove everything horrible in the world and create a sanctuary.I often look at the amish and think how womderful it was. Just a community that lives for eachother and they do so without all the technology that is supposed to make are lives easier. In reality we have every horrible thing happening in the world piped right to our brain.So in summation, its a beautiful movie, from a world far less complex than modern day society.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Do Your Very Best Not To Scream...,"In my opinion, this film is highly underrated. The Village isn't as good as The Sixth Sense or Signs, but I still find it very entertaining with a great cast and interesting premise. I feel like most people will focus on the ""twist,"" and call it lame. Unfortunately making his films all about twist endings is a bed that M. Night Shyamalan made for himself and must lie in. The Village certainly isn't his best twist ending, but the storytelling leading up to it is excellent. This was made during his prime and features outstanding performances by Joaquin Phoenix (shocker), William Hurt and Bryce Dallas Howard...her best acting work as far as I'm concerned. Shyamalan always does a fantastic job of creating bone chilling moments in his movies that will make the hair on your arms stand up and this film features many of those. His scripts are always simple and he has always been able to make long periods of silence his ally. Overall, I find that if you don't concern yourself with trying to figure out the twists of his films you will have a much easier time enjoying them for what they are.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
an interesting concept but the film fails to deliver on the premise,"M. Night Shyamalan, presents an interesting concept but miserably fails to deliver on the promise of an excellent trailer. Then again, the trailer did do its job i.e. get my but into the seat. However, the primary reason for the movie's trapping lies squarely on the shoulder of its director. Undoubtedly a talent, he can set perfect moods from carefully constructed scenes and camera angles (see Signs) and has modernized Hitchcock's style of movie making. However, audiences have come to expect a surprise ending or twist. As such many are going to head into the theatre with the intention of figuring out what is the twist. You can almost do that immediately in the first few frames. If you miss it, there is a likelihood that you'll be bothered and miss the true revelation of the movie (which lies in one of the best star making turns in recent movie history).Given the above, I must be vague. The movie revolves a community which is almost Amish in its characteristics. The villagers are self sufficient in their world. It features a great cast led by William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver and Brendon Gleeson. However, the talent is so wastefully squandered with too rare, fleeting moments of interaction, notably with Weaver/Hurt and Brody/Phoenix. That star making turn mentioned above, is the acting debut of Bryce Dallas Howard, the daughter of director Ron Howard, who plays Hurt's daughter and girlfriend of Phoenix. She reminds me an awful lot of Kate Hudson in ""Almost Famous""....very sweet, idealistically driven, and strong willed. Each time she takes the screen you can't help being transfixed. Although a supporting character, the movie thankfully belongs to her.The elders of the community (Hurt, Weaver, Gleeson and others) have prohibited the villagers to venture into the surrounding woods, as there are ""Creatures of which we do not speak"" living within. They wear red hoods and red is a color which they are not allowed to cast their eyes upon. The community is in turn paralyzed by fear. As history would have it, there has been bad, spilt blood with these creatures and a truce was called. The promise of the truce, is that neither party is not allowed to set foot into the other's territory, or else it will be considered void. Sounds ominous and promising and there are a few genuine scenes which make you jump out of your skin. There are a handful of moments when this movie could have kicked into high gear. However, the plot becomes so transparently thin, and the movie is let down by the acknowledgment that it could have been so much more.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Worth a viewing,"Shyamalan tries to be a latter day Hitchcock - even down to his cameos. Unfortunately he is lacking something. I've seen Hitchcock's 'Psycho' numerous times and despite knowing the ending I am still compelled to see it again. Meanwhile, I've seen Shyamalan's 'Sixth Sense' once and am not compelled to see it again. Both movies have twisty endings but nothing in the performances, nuances, camera angles, etc., manage to make me want to see 'Sixth Sense' again. The same holds true for 'The Village'. It's a good story. Everyone in the cast does a good job and the plot twists are very interesting - yet, after the movie ends I don't feel like I've just seen a 'great movie' with layer upon layer of subtle and magnetic character idiosyncrasies. It's all fairly straightforward ultimately. Besides, I pretty much figured it out long before the end. Something didn't quite gel in the props department for me to believe that this was supposed to take place in the time period implied. In all honesty I did think about the film quite a bit afterward. I was mostly wondering how it would hold itself together --- enough on that though. Bottomline: It's a film worthy of a viewing - definitely, but it's like Chinese food -- you'll be hungry in an hour and not necessarily for more Chinese food. I gave it a 6 simply because there is little replay value. It is at least a 7 though.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Why some actors agree to appear in such a stinker is beyond me.It only shows that after a successful film like Sixth Sense, a director needs to really work on the story before filming it.For me the silliest point are the clothing of the villagers - they cannot go out of their confine, yet they are all immaculately dressed.Dialogue is sometimes so silly that one wonders how on earth director thought of it.Nice camera-work though.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Well directed, but the plot puts holes in the film","Like many of his films, M. Night Shyamalan's latest suspense film has many things going for it. For one, Shyamalan is a very talented director. He has a great grasp of what it takes to direct art and is very obviously influenced by a master, Alfred Hitchcock. His attention to artistic details, including mis-en-scene, color, kinetics, framing, diegetic manipulation and so forth are all top-rate. He peopled the film with a very capable cast. And he's very capable of plotting very twistily. This film has a great number of surprises and if you don't like being fooled, you will not like this film. Despite the fact that you go in knowing that there will be a very major plot twist, he still gets you. That's impressive.Of course, there are some glaring problems with this work. First of all, the dialogue is filled with excessive verbiage and unnatural phrasing. It's not quite inane, like Lucas' latest endeavors and fortunately, after being immersed in it long enough, you stop noticing it, but it immediately distances the viewer. Secondly, it's lacking in story. True, Shyamalan is a very capable plotter, but when it comes to providing a strong and compelling story, this film lacks it. Motivations and characters don't always follow correctly and he creates a particular character, seemingly because he needed that character to tie his plot together, which takes away from the writing's credibility and also threatens to expose his plot--which I was usually able to keep ahead of.the plot, although at times, I was indeed fooled like most. Lastly, the film isn't able to keep itself controlled because of the need to follow the plot. Holes exist and inconsistencies appear that aren't really explainable, despite my attempts to defend them.When the film ended, I thought I saw one beautifully directed, well acted, but ultimately shallow film, particularly because of the emphasis on plot over story. With the right co-writer or script, I think he's going to be capable of a whole lot more, but I think it's time to take the actual storywriting a little bit out of his hands. It helped the aforementioned Lucas, it will likely help Shyamalan. Still, as far as a suspense thriller with a whole lot of surprising craziness and strong direction, it remains quite watchable. But I'm guessing it will be a divisive film to its audience. 6/10. Make your own call.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disturbing Film!  Stylish and Thoughtful Cinematography!,"M. Night Shyamalan is one of our most creative and singular directors, recalling the styles of many of the European film auteurs. In ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable,"" there were fascinating locales within the urban confines of Philadelphia. In ""The Sign"" and ""The Village,"" the uniquely sinister mood is evoked in rural Pennsylvania.In ""The Village,"" Shyamalan develops a story around the daily life of a strict commune¬óvirtually a cult¬óliving in a small community in rural Pennsylvania in the nineteenth century. It is a hothouse environment with people held together with a bond of fear due to the mysterious appearances of supernatural creatures. The casting of the film was outstanding with Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver as major figures within the community. Above all, it is the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard who delivers the emotional impact of the drama as a young blind woman named Ivy, who is forced to make an arduous journey for essential medicines for her fianc√©. The mysteries and indeed the secrets of the community unfold along with Ivy's odyssey.In the undercurrent of violence which ran through the film, ""The Village"" recalls the famous and disturbing 1955 novel of William Golding, ""The Lord of the Flies."" In Golding's story, a group of boys isolated on an island discover the hidden, violent impulses lurking from within when forced to function on their own in a community. In the rural Pennsylvania of ""The Village,"" the story of commune is nearly identical to the world of ""The Lord of the Flies."" The so-called elders of the community seek to promote a peaceful existence. But like a self-fulfilling prophecy, the violence will emerge and potentially tear the village asunder.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Honest Review,"The hate again is geared to the fact that it is a Shyamalan movie and it's hip to hate on him now.It always seems to be that way, shocking how many people hate on things because it's hip and not really because of any honestly valid reason: ""It sucks because, because, it's a Shyamalan movie and we all think he's self-important."" The fact is that, yet again, he gave people something new...and they despise him for it.But not only that it is a great allegory for 2004. Terror threats were common back then. We were told to live in fear. Today is an orange day, be scared. Today is a red day, be terrified. And nothing ever came of it, but a frightened population is a controlled population. It's a population that doesn't explore or ask many questions.The Village does a great job of expressing that. A society controlled through fear and fear used to hide an enormous secret, to cover up a big lie with another lie.But again, in typical Shyamalan fashion, it is a subtle parallel. It's one that doesn't stand out in the glaring fashion that you'd see in any other political movie.And, again, it is original, but because of that, like all his other movies that broke away from the re-boot, re-made, re-hashed style of Hollywood, he got labeled and people hate him for being unique and having the courage to make his own stories come to life.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Do they venture into the woods to go to the towns for medicine to save the victim, or do they stay within their protective bubble safe from the monsters?You can tell that a lot of thought and effort was put into this movie just by the way it unfolded.

"""Heed the warning bell, for they are coming.""","M. Night Shyamalan has made some of my favorite movies: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs. Now he has written another movie that has what is now known as the ""twist ending,"" something he is becoming synonymous with in The Village. I wouldn't dare give away the quick turn to the left the movie takes, but I will say, it disappoints to a degree. It is not a ridiculous ending, but what could have been if Shyamalan had trusted his original premise of a 1890s Pennsylvania countryside village terrorized by creatures who patrol the surrounding woods. We get the usual eerie mood that Shyamalan has given us before. The Village excels in the isolating feeling that we got in Signs. I might be the only person to admit to liking Signs, but I appreciated the humanized battle between one family and invading aliens. Here in The Village, we have one town, cutoff from the rest of society trying to battle a race of creatures who limits their abilities to even treat their sick and injured. The pace of the movie is slow and moody, especially through the orange tint and effective soundtrack. The village is lead by a counsel of elders, including Edward Walker (William Hurt) who is father to two daughters, including the blind Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Ivy has a childhood fling with the local mentally challenged man Noah (Adrian Brody) but ends up falling in love with Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), who is the first to suggest leaving the village to gain medical supplies. After Noah causes harm to Lucius, Ivy decides she's the one to go out into the woods and find medical help. This is where the movie goes from moody mythical theater to that movie with a ""twist"" ending. I wanted more, dammit. I don't think I'm the only one. I was intrigued by the creatures, and I didn't like how Shymalan dealt with them. Sure, there is a certain amount of interest and logic to how the movie played out, but it could have been more. I didn't hate this movie, but I kind of hated how it ended. Mr. Shyamalan, for your next movie, perhaps the best ""twist"" is no twist at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Amazing movie, don't listen to critics","The Village is an excellent movie in all respects, possibly not Shyamalans best, but definitely up there. I really can't imagine why reviewers gave it low scores, I don't know anyone personally that dislikes the movie at all.The Village centers around a quaint 19th century village in the middle of nowhere. The inhabitants of the village are relatively happy, despite the constant fear of the horrible creatures in the woods surrounding the village.The characters are extremely believable and beautifully crafted. Granted, there is some broken dialogue, and it makes one cringe at one point or another, but it is not common and does not ruin the characterization. Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as usual, as is Bryce Dallas Howard, a new face in the cast of Oscar winning actors.The plot is a typical Shyamalan twist fest with a little romance added for good measure. This does not take away from the atmosphere at all, however, and is done very well. There are a couple parts that are quite chilling, but not SCARY per se. I definitely felt a tingle run down my spine a few times.

Sasquatch meets Johnny Cash,"This movie had it all, monsters, retards and blind cuties. What it didn't have was anything scary.

This sasquatch is very different in that it has claws that can tear you apart. In one scene, Bigfoot is running around in the forest and the kids try to test how BRAVE they are by standing on a platform and taunting the yetti. I won't reveal what happened. All I can say is that there were torches lit on fire for a special effect. The yetti turns out to be much more than we expect. To say that there is a twist in this film is a gross understatement.

Isolation is not meant for all.,"This movie tries to live off the reputation of its writer/director M. Night Shymalan and is a big dose of disappointment following months and months of hype. Covington is a small town in late 1800s rural Pennsylvania. It is an Amish-like community chaste and pure of thought governed by the fear of mythical creatures that inhabit the woods that surrounds it. The daughter(Judy Greer)of the town's leader(William Hurt)proclaims her love for a young man(Joaquin Phoenix)who has the inner strength to stand up against community policy. Phoenix has no interest in Greer, but actually loves her blind sister(Bryce Dallas Howard). Phoenix wants permission to go through the woods and go into the outer cities to bring back modern medicines. Before his departure he is stabbed by the village idiot(Adrien Brody). Howard in spite of her lack of sight has the fortitude to enter the woods with intent to reach the cities and bring back needed medicines to save her young lover's life.Plenty of drama; but where is the thrills and horror implied by what seems like six months of hype. The movie drags along and you wait and wait for something to happen. If you momentarily doze off you risk missing a subtle hint of what this story is really all about. Not only is Phoenix wasted, but so is Sigourney Weaver who plays his mother. I dare say that Brody steals the show. Howard(daughter of Ron Howard)is very impressive. Also in the cast are:Celia Weston, Brendan Gleeson, Frank Collison and Fran Kranz.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Stuff,"This is a welcome change for me and as such it stands tall amongst other Hollywood offerings. As with his other movies there is a gimmick attached to the plot but I am glad M Night Shyamalan gave us a simple story with two fine performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard amongst a strong ensemble cast. People who view and review Shyamalans movies often concentrate on the gimmick 'I see dead people' Sixth Sense; 'an indestructible man' Unbreakable; 'alien beings' Signs; when I believe these elements come a close second to the characters and how they develop throughout the story. For me Unbreakable was about discovering love and meaning within your life (Bruce Willis gave up a sporting career for the love of his wife, a love which slipped away in the face of life's mundane disappointments) and in Signs it was about Mel Gibson letting go of the past to live for the future and reaffirming his faith. Children and family feature heavily in the two latter stories and their fathers, although loving, are lost within them selves and are unable to see the love and joy available within their family group. The story progresses and the plot gimmick, when realized allows the character to move towards their niche in the world.I found similar themes within the Village. For me it's essentially about faith and romance; faith in yourself and again the joy to be found in companionship and love.The movie starts slowly immersing the viewer in the village community; I found that this time was well used to develop character and setting and serves to allow the viewer full access to the characters thought process when making decisions later on.Some have said that you can figure out the ending, so what? At least it's done well; I rather liked the idea myself, although, I understand that it has been used before but then so has 'dead person finally realising they're dead' (Sixth Sense) and this was met with rave reviews across the world! Who cares if its been done before? This is a deftly handled piece of film-making; I reveled at the innocence of the characters and the beginnings of the romance between Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard. I found simple enjoyment in setting up their feelings for one another and then putting them to the test such as when she steadfastly believes he won't leave her in danger and the moment he finally holds her hand again. I think I enjoyed this romantic aspect because it was subtle but powerful. In many respects is difficult to place the movie in a genre; one reviewer was disappointed because they thought this movie was going to be a horror film; I found this incredibly difficult to believe given the amount of information on offer before it went on general release and can only assume that this particular reviewer doesn't get to watch many movies. I found the movie offered some eerie moments and some genuine excitement.While it may not tick all my boxes its miles better than many of its contemporaries and definitely worth a look.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not Bad, But Poorly Marketed","M. Night's ""The Village"" is certainly not a horror film. It's not even really much of a thriller. The film is, at its core, a love story. Played out against a Quaker-esquire rural community, the story revolves around a young blind woman, her boyfriend, and her mentally-challenged and very jealous admirer. Through a sordid series of misguided actions, the three are thrown into a somewhat twisted tale of courage, love, and revenge.Unfortunately, this was not the film that was advertised. The trailers and movie posters offered us a sort of psychologically driven monster movie-- and that's not what we got. Many fans of M. Night and critics in general felt slighted. This was not the movie that they paid to see.While it's certainly not a brilliant piece of film-making and, aside from a great performance from Howard in the lead, offers just mediocre acting, it's not nearly as bad a film as many are saying. An open mind and fewer expectations (of genre, not of quality) on behalf of the viewers could have made this a bigger success.Alas, however, the marketing people did what they did, the viewers expected what they expected, and the critics wrote what they wrote, and this is what we got: A decent movie that was treated like a horrible movie. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A most complex and troublesome film,"""The Village,"" M. Night Shyamalan's latest twisting thriller, is full of ideas and creepy moments, but is hurt by much subtle complexity and very troubling storytelling.  Since he hit it big in 1999 with ""The Sixth Sense,"" he has become one of Hollywood's last truly innovative filmmakers, and therein lies the problem (I think).We've come to expect so much from him lately, that we may flock to his latest flick and then comes a big letdown after a most wonderful buildup. But that doesn't automatically make ""The Village"" any less thoughtful; at least he tries.  Most other directors wouldn't have lasted past the first hour.Shyamalan has been on a wild streak since ""The Sixth Sense,"" and most people would agree (though I don't) that ""Unbreakable"" was a letdown and the masses are pretty much divided on ""Signs.""  Die-hards will unanimously agree that ""The Village"" is a monumental letdown and should never have seen the light of day.Superstition is the latest topic up for discussion with ""The Village."" Shyamalan seems to have an interest in exploiting certain aspects of our culture and using them to full effect.  In ""The Sixth Sense,"" it was childhood fears and ghost stories.  In ""Unbreakable,"" we learned about superheroes and that they may be ordinary people like you or me.  In ""Signs,"" we got a lesson about faith and an alien invasion.""The Village"" plays with the popular superstitions of a Puritan-like community and uses those to set up a story about deadly creatures that live in the woods outside the town.  And one of its citizens is questioning those beliefs and is eager to see what truly lies outside the town's borders. Shyamalan plays with these beliefs, getting us to accept them like the people of this community and terrorize us at the same time.He has a way with endings and ""The Village"" is no different from any of his previous three blockbusters.  To me, it did come as a big shock and was totally un-hinted on earlier in the film.  In ""The Village"" however and unlike the previous three, Shyamalan has created an atmosphere that is deliberately misleading and that is something I didn't find in ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" or ""Signs.""All in all, ""The Village"" is still a valiant, if somewhat lacking effort from one of our last and most innovative directors.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

traumatizing,"The village is possibly the most disappointing film i've ever seen. immediately the audience is deterred by the disastrous script at which one finds himself/herself cringing at the hap-hazard attempts at older Pennsylvanian speech (which can be explained by the conclusion - but we don't know that while we're subjected to hearing it!).Added to this is how pathetically ""those we do not speak of"" (a title which contends in idiocy with the ""younglings"" of Star Wars episode III) are presented to the audience; besides looking like inside out fish with porcupine spines the techniques used to create tension around them is unoriginal and ineffective. Such clich√©d methods as passing an image quickly across the screen accompanied by a spontaneous loud noise does nothing more than wake the audience members who have already fallen asleep.If this isn't bad enough, the film loses all credibility with lines the would be more appropriately suited to Scooby Doo, such as when Noah claims that she will be protected by magic rocks - come on!The actors' contribution hardly helps to lift this cinematic tragedy out of the hole into which it was sure to fall. Adrien Brody, whose performance I have never before been dissatisfied by, cannot distinguish whether his character has Downs or is simply mad, and needless to say neither can the audience.If there's one film you see this summer make sure its not this one for you will be utterly disgusted and disappointed and most likely to such an extent that you will decide not to get one next season.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This movie is: terrible, boring, ridiculous, boring, badly written, boring, badly directed, and (did I mention?) boring.Bryce Dallas Howard was amazing, and I can't wait to see her in a REAL movie. She will undoubtedly be a star soon.Some of our favorite moments (which caused us to shriek with laughter on the ride home): --Joaquin Phoenix ""nervously"" reading his letters to the town elders. --All of the scenes where people whisper urgently about ""the BAD color."" (And, by the way, why is gold ""the good color""?) --The 3 or 4 scenes near the end looking up into the waving trees. --Each of Adrian Brody's idiotic, over-the-top scenes. --The many, many scenes where people just stood around looking at each other.Two or three -very- brief scenes WERE actually well done: --The scene where Phoenix grabs Howard's hand at the end of the dance --The scene on the porch with Phoenix and Howard --Part of the (otherwise absurd) scene with Howard asking for help near the end of the movie. But M. Night Sham messed this scene up, too.I enjoy many types of movies, including slow-paced character studies, dramas, and thrillers. (I liked all 3 of MNS's previous films.)However, I honestly don't understand how -anyone- could recommend this terrible mess. I may really mail my ticket stub to MNS and ask for my money back.

"Let's have a good old chat about ""Those We Do Not Speak Of""","He pulls the rug from under your feet, you pull out your wallet - that's the M. Night Shyamalan way. Box office receipts prove that building a movie around a twist can work beautifully, but what's left if, like me, the viewer is wise to the scam?Nobody gave away the ending of The Sixth Sense, but I'd done the math before the movie even started - ""The kid sees dead people!"" + ""There's a great twist!"" = ""A-ha!"". I enjoyed it none the less. The Village did actually have to begin before I worked out what was going on, but where The Sixth Sense still managed to sustain an air of suspense and creepiness, this became a mere exercise in red herring-spotting.No matter how rich the photography or how many orchestrally-prompted shocks and starts he throws in, Shyamalan squanders an intriguing set-up with a ""so what?"" denouement.The cast aren't to blame: Richie Cunningham's daughter is excellent and William Hurt gets his best role in years but all the talk of ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"" and the inevitable opening of ""The Shed That Must Never Be Opened"" made me wonder when Night is gonna give us a ""Movie Not Based On A Gimmick"".",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of the best films of the year,"I saw the screening last night for the Village at work. I work at the movie theaters, showcase cinemas. I saw it with a house of about 40 people, mostly teenagers from work (like myself). I even watched Unbreakable today with my film-making partner to prepare myself for the newest M. Night Shyamalan masterpiece. And unlike EVERYONE I saw it with, I loved the movie. The premise was intriguing. Adrien Brody's performance made the movie for me. And I loved the creatures. I loved the story. I loved the twist. But don't get confused, the twist isn't the ending. The ending is a reintroduction to the main points of the film, and after viewing the twist, and the subsequent ending, I'm still in awe, and still trying to fathom some sort of understanding of it. I'll need to see it again, probably a couple more times. But it's definitely a movie worth seeing at least once, even if you don't like Shyamalan's work.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unappreciated,"I am absolutely bewildered by how many negative reviews this has received. I am a fan. The Sixth Sense absolutely blew me away when I was young.

I do not agree that Brody's acting was subpar. In fact, I think he was excellent. Some of these actors they are expecting large performances from. These viewers do not realize the subtlety that was intended- so purposeful. This is about love, sacrifice, the loss of community in modern day society. It is FICTION. All of his films have a hint of ""This can't happen in real life."" If you are going to pick that apart, you've missed the point. If you cannot understand his artistry or his intent to exaggerate to make a statement - definitely do NOT watch Old. The metaphors would be too grand for you to process.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The village people.,"Upon its initial release, 'The Village (2004)' was fairly heavily criticised; now, there are plenty of people who view it as somewhat of a cult classic. It seems as though its ""love it"" to ""hate it"" ratio is about 50:50. I don't think either extreme is particularly pertinent, to be honest. To me, this movie is a mixed bag. In many ways, it keenly represents writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's best and worst qualities. Examples of the former include assured direction, a steady pacing and a tangibly melancholic atmosphere; examples of the latter include clunky dialogue, somewhat sloppy storytelling and a preoccupation with having a twist ending. For the most part, the piece plays out as a quiet drama about an isolated community who live in fear of the woods that surround their home. Some members wish to travel beyond their village's boundaries to find things such as food and medicine, while the elders remain adamant that their solitary existence is paramount to their safety. This element of the story isn't developed as much as it could have been, especially since the reveals that most keenly relate to it are saved until very late in the game (if they occurred earlier, the film would have time to more effectively ruminate on their repercussions). Most of the movie concerns a couple of second-generation citizens and their budding romance. This element isn't particularly bad, but it isn't exactly engrossing. It's almost wholly saved by the performances of Howard and Phoenix, who bring a chalk-and-cheese dynamic to their relationship and are afforded a few quietly tender interactions that genuinely feel rather sweet in their own way. Though its pacing is pretty slow, the picture is never boring. It's an intriguing and atmospheric slow burn overall. However, its story has a number of issues and, ultimately, it all feels a little bit hollow. Its potential thematic resonance is undercut by the placement of some of its key plot points, and I'm still not entirely sure if its ending is successful or not. The movie's inevitable twist actually has a couple of different elements to it. These elements compliment one another well, but the narrative takes some time to walk back on the first a bit before it commits to delivering the second. This undeniably dampens the impact of the initial reveal. Besides, the reveal is handled somewhat clumsily; it would have worked much better with just one or two seemingly obvious small tweaks. Still, the twists and turns of the story (most of which, it's worth noting, I was pretty sure I already knew before pressing play) aren't entirely unsuccessful and, despite threatening to, they don't come across as totally stupid. Plus, the piece's most surprising moment occurs long before its most obvious and most talked about reveals. Ultimately, the solid performances and confident direction keep this feeling much fresher than perhaps expected. It has a distinct tone and keeps you mostly engaged for its duration. However, its story certainly has its flaws and it could've used with a bit of tightening up here and there. It isn't great, but it's a decent effort that does some interesting things with its material. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
How to write a terrible story and then make it a bad film.,"Some people have called this guy the next Hitchcock. All I can say is that they must be referring to his cameos. Because this is a film for slow people who can't figure out anything for themselves and need to be taken by the hand with flashbacks and story revelations. I think he spent more time trying to fit in little jokes and light moments than finding ways to scare or shock people. There are more ways to scare people than the ever popular hiding behind a tree and then turning to see what you are hiding from is right there. AHHHH! oh wait that was in the trailer too. I mean a little mystery would be nice, don't give away the ending before we've even got there. Time to go back to school Mr. S.

"Oh Shyamalan, you done it again","The Village is a suspense/thriller by M. Night Shyamalan. I thought it was good, though a bit slow. To sum it all up, if you like typical M. Night movies and stories, you will like it quite a lot. It takes a little while to offer real explanations for the behaviors of the villagers, but it is also easily predictable. At times the movie can be a bit scary, but I would not call it a horror flick, as the scares are short and don't do much more than make you jump a little. The movie is relatively clean of plot holes, except for the blind girl being able to navigate her way through a dense forest alone with nothing but a stick. I was pleased with the beginning and middle of the movie, but the ending was extremely disappointing. It ends with a pretty bad cliffhanger, as is typical with M. Night's movies. The concept of the movie was well-thought out, and kept me captivated throughout the movie. It would have been a bit more exciting, however, if it was not so predictable. If you get lost in the movie, however, I believe it would be fun to watch and not hard at all to pay attention to. I also liked the costumes for the creatures, they were enjoyably creepy.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Boring and pointless.,"This movie was terrible! And yes it had nice photography. With a budget of $65M you can afford good technicians and a great DOP, but that doesn't help you out of your story. The only discovery at the end is that Shyamalan is just another Hollywood director trying to seduce an audience. And even if he was good with actors in other films, in this one they are stiff and boring. There is no character development and for the most part 'I saw dead people'. The movie was based on a child book ""Running Out of Time"". Unfortunately, they've adapted the story for a public of 6-year-olds.

We can move towards hope,"The story is borrowed from the book titled ""Running Out of Time"" by Margaret Peterson Haddix. It has been slightly modified for the screen by M. Night Shyamalan.Everyone lives a full life in a self-sufficient 1800's village. We live in a symbiosis with a mysterious species. However, we also live free from the evils that permeate those other villages beyond the forbidden forest. So, what happens when we violate the truce with the other species?The film is produced by M. Night Shyamalan; so, there is no surprise in the formula or big picture. It is not hard to figure out the premise shortly into the story. However, there are several surprising twists on the way.The acting was surprisingly exceptional. We have well-known actors that have the ability not to let their personalities overwhelm their characters.The sets and period costumes were superb. You can see that there was a lot of time and money that went into them. You have the feeling that you are there.Although this film may not have achieved the potential in many eyes it is probably one of the best balances and almost believable stories Shyamalan has shown us. It is more than just a tale as we see how people relate and can relate to stress and great joy.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

If you haven't seen this before, you need to ignore the criticism and go into this film with an open mind and open ears. Pay attention to every little detail, every little thing that is being said. Yes, we all know Shyamalan will drop a bombshell with a twist- but leading up to that point in his movies includes a lot of important information about the plot and the characters.This film is emotional, and it's intense.

I didn't think it was that bad actually....,"Of the four films of M Night Shyamalan's that are panned as bad- The Village, The Happening, Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender- I thought The Village(having just finished re-watching it yesterday and was not sure what to make of it at first) was the least bad of the four, to me the other three are as bad as they're said to be.I wasn't expecting to like it after so many uncharitable things both here and elsewhere and by how it was marketed, but I sort of did. It does look great with beautiful scenery and brooding cinematography and the score is very haunting, eerie quality about it. There are also some genuine jolts and poignancy in the first half, and The Village with a great concept does start off intriguingly.The best thing about it though is the cast. William Hurt is nuanced and intelligent and Joaquin Pheonix is wonderfully stoic, but the biggest surprise was Bryce Dallas Howard, who was fantastic and quite moving here. There were however a few disappointments, and I say this as I consider these actors the most accomplished generally of the cast. Sigourney Weaver and Brendan Gleeson are great actors but underused and Adrien Brody comes across as wasted in a rather nothing role.What let The Village down and from stopping it from being more than it had potential to be was that while M Night Shyamalan can have films where he is a master-storyteller(The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable) or where he is sloppy(2nd half of Signs, The Happening), he comes across as rather over-ambitious here. The story is so interesting at first, but the second half is let down by too many ideas, and some of them are wonderful ideas but underdeveloped.Consequently the pace becomes more drawn out, the dialogue becomes clunky and apart from Howard I found myself indifferent to the characters by the end. And to top it all, the ending is ridiculous. All in all, not that bad but has a lot wrong with it in my opinion. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazon Prime Revisits,"It was 16 years ago when I worked on the DVD release of this movie. By ""work"" I mean having to watch it a hundred times to make sure there were no issues with it. So I studied pretty much every frame of this film. Talk about torture.
Now that I am older and watching it with some distance, I understand the intention of the film but the core story is flawed. Without giving too much away, it is about a small village that is haunted by a creature to which they refer to as ""the ones we don't speak about"" as if the name itself would conjure them to their borders. Somehow they've convinced the villagers that they have made a truce and if they don't go past their borders, the creatures won't impose themselves on them.Yep.And the rest, is just really great stars in what appears to be Amish Playhouse In The Park. I mean, I'm not sure what they were watching to mimic it, but it is corny on a level that, I guarantee you, the actors looking back most likely were embarrassed by it. Not that they should. They did the best with the material. The heaviest lifting being of William Hurt. Even he couldn't make some of the lines work especially when you discover where it all comes from.
Anyway, there are so many questions once you are done watching the film. Silliness, logic flaws, poor decision making, like sending a blind girl through the woods to go get medicine to help an injured villager? Come on. Even in its most bizarre that doesn't fly.I feel like director, writer, producer (man, he was proud of this). M. Night Shamaylan had this really great idea but once he got developing it, he was too stubborn to let some of the details go. It isn't a BAD movie, since I really appreciate it for it's dreary atmosphere (village actually feels cozy) but it leaves you with an emptiness that makes you wonder how this village could endure the next tragedy.

What can I see... Skip it,"Let me start off by saying I like The Sixth Sense it was a good movie even if you knew the secret it was still a good movie. The story was built on character development and good development of plot. The Village however lacked everything. Let me start out by saying that this movie is a knock off of another story written about 3 years ago and you know what that story was dumb then and its dumb now. I hated this film from the beginning. When I think of a guy whose name utters ""one trick pony"" M. Night Shyamalan, I mean come on people the guy needs to stop making this boring ""thrillers"" and try to branch out not every movie can have an ""exciting twist"" to it. So the film follows a bunch of people living in an isolated village, (that doesn't seem to be from any time period) hmm... I wonder what could be going on just from that comment any one with half a brain can guess this plot I watched the film for 5 minutes and I new how this one was going to end. The work seemed to lack the flare that Shyamalan had in the Sixth Sense it also seemed to be on of his most boring films yet. He doesn't even really give the audience a chance to get to know or like the characters. Right off the bat we see that a child has died because the ""Village lacks medication"" that can save the boys life and we are supposed to pity these poor folks, come on now, Plus we meet the boring cast of characters the first one I'll call THE CYBORG aka Joaquin Phoenix if there was a film about a guy with no emotions and seems to play it off very well it would star Joaquin Phoenix and Keanu Reeves geez can any one say WOOD. He gives his performance with almost no incentive its like hi I'm here where my paycheck and Joaquin Phoenix is a pretty good actor in other films like Buffalo Soldiers and Quills but his performance seemed wooden. The there's the ""Mentally Challenged Character"" sorry Brody but I'm not even going to point out how you ruined this one ""one hint though there a difference between being mentally challenged and being stupid and Brody performance was stupid. Adding shame to the handicap is the ""blind girl"" who the audience is supposed to pity THE only pity I had for her was that she was in this movie. The movie seemed to trudge on and on and on. At one point we are seeing one of the lamest wedding sequences I have ever seen the next moment we see a character stabbed I mean if you wanted to steal someone else story at least steal a good one. The next person who deserves the (Holy crap you bored the audience to death award) would be William Hurt (Mr. Gonzo himself) he seems to be bored out of his mind to the point where he doesn't even care about the movie he like a talking prop through out the film. There a moment in the film when the audience is supposed to feel bad for Kitty walker whose just been dumped as she confesses true love. I couldn't help but laugh then I notice the entire audience was laughing that called bad storytelling I mean when someone tries to hard for one of those ""hall mark"" moments it seems to be another gag on the blooper reel Shyamalan. So I hope you all enjoy The Garbage I mean Village because all you stuck in the I'm a Bi+ch to the blockbuster need to get out and expand your mind. *out****",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Far Better Film Than Advertised,"'The Village' suffers from 2 major problems: the advertising campaign, which insists on trailing it as a mainstream shock-horror film, and the refusal of many movie-goers to shift mental gears and accept the film on its own terms.This film is not about whether or not the audience can ""see the twist in the plot"", nor is it a conventional horror tale; it is a film about layers of complexity, an acutely observed study of human pain and fragility, and an unsettling examination of an ethical dilemma. The Elders of the village have created a solution to the problem of their pain by rejecting the outside world and its values. However, their simpler life is built on lies and deceit which, no matter how well intentioned, cannot be sustained without serious negative consequences for their community. In order to protect themselves and those they love, deception is layered upon deception, and the entire edifice of lies is in continual danger of crashing down around their ears. The fact that the village is generally relatively tranquil does not detract from the severe ethical compromises made on a regular basis; the Elders have locked themselves into a pattern of irresponsible and dysfunctional behaviour from which they cannot escape even when given the choice. When it becomes clear that there are opportunities to allow the younger members of the community to make their own choices based on the truth, they choose instead to give only partial information instead, obscuring the Big Lie which is fundamental to their way of life.Joachin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard shine as the most truthful and courageous members of the village, whose insistence on doing what is right and decent discomfits the Elders. Their nobility is never showy, always simple and honest. Hurt and Weaver turn in beautifully low-key performances as their parents, each making bad choices for good reasons. Brody's performance invites the audience to be simultaneously appalled and compassionate; his strange behaviour is both destructive and malignant, and yet this malignancy is laced with innocence.The closing scenes provide both hope for the future of the community and the probability that the Elders will continue on their path of lies, leaving the audience unsettled and uncomfortable with the knowledge that the inhabitants of the village may never come to know the truth; that if they do, they will be irreperably damaged, and if they don't, they face a bleak future in a slowly declining isolated community.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A Unique Film of Beauty and Mystery,"Released in 2004, ""The Village"" is not a horror film; it's a romantic mystery. Not a 'mystery' in the sense of a murder mystery, but rather all-around mysterious. It's a ""What if...?"" tale. The set-up presents the viewer with a slew of questions, which are all answered in the final act. The fun of the film is to see if you can figure out the answers before they are revealed, but that's not the only reason to appreciate it.THE PLOT: A small village in Eastern Pennsylvania in 1897 is surrounded by foreboding woods that harbor mysterious creatures. The villagers are pretty much imprisoned in the hamlet. Something happens that prompts a young blind woman to risk a journey through the dangerous woods to find medicines in another town.Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, stars as the innocent blind protagonist while Joanquin Phoenix plays her strong-and-silent loved one. Adrien Brody is effective as the detestable village idiot. Also on hand are Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt as the town elders, who know more about the situation than they let on.Director & writer M. Night Shyamalan portrays the locations with an aura of beauty and mystery. On top of this the score is fittingly haunting and beautiful. As such, the film is a feast for the eyes and ears.There's one potent scene I must mention *** minor spoiler***: Near the end, the blind girl finally encounters a person from the outer towns. The contrast of the innocent, secluded blind girl and the outsider is well captured. The outsider questions the mysterious girl but ultimately discerns that she is genuine. This is an extraordinary scene -- ranking up there with the all-time best in cinema (much like the mysterious Native American bar sequence in ""Wolfen"").Although the end-revelation in Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" was outstanding and arguably better than the the one in ""The Village"", I personally prefer ""The Village"" overall. Bottom Line: If you have a taste for surreal mystery and rustic beauty, don't miss out on ""The Village."" It's a moving, one-of-a-kind picture.GRADE: B+ or A-***EXTREME SPOILER ALERT*** Do not read further if you haven't seen the film.There are two main mysteries: (1.) The nature of the creatures in the woods, and (2.) the reality of the village itself. The truth about the ""creatures"" may be discerned by some viewers before it is revealed, but, I gotta admit, my wife and I didn't figure it out (and she's good at predicting story elements). As to the second mystery: There's no way a viewer could figure this enigma out as long as s/he accepts that the story takes place in 1897, which both the film and the DVD jacket indicate. The only way you could unravel this puzzle is by considering the possibility that it does not take place in 1897. My Wife and I never considered this possibility (after all, why would they lie?) and so were unable to discern the truth.Beyond all that, the film has a potent subtext. It's an allegorical slam against socialism in general and, in particular, that humanity-destroying socialist experiment known as Sweden. Its title is a riff on Hilary Clinton's socialist polemic ""It takes a village (to raise a child)."" Shyamalan shows the deadly consequence of entrusting the care of our children to the socialist state. The movie opens with the village's burial of a young child and begins the final act with the death of a product of village upbringing: a dim-witted, craven murderer.The movie focuses on the sad fate of the young adults who manage to survive their socialist upraising while retaining a remnant of hope for a better future. The pure-hearted and intelligent Ivy is ultimately seduced by power and welcomed into the inner-circle of village leaders where she will promote the utopian lie of peace within the community and chaos outside, meanwhile continuing to bury the young and execute the useless. Her love interest, the obedient Lucius, is unfit for the inner circle but will be useful as a goon-enforcer for the village as he carries on the Elders' practice of terrorizing its own citizenry in the guise of forest monsters.As with Sweden, the village is dependant on Western capital. Its appearance of self-sufficiency is a facade. It was built with, survives on and is protected by the wealth of capitalists. This can't last forever, of course. As Margaret Thatcher put it, the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Thought Provoking,"A Utopian (?) village and community beset by a beastly condition, as captioned in preview, should capture just about anyone's interest. And in watching this by M. Night Shyamalan had me predisposed to think that this was just another run-of-the-mill monster movie, but it was not. It was a movie, and tale about just about any person or people, and experiences, and about going to the extreme in finding a solution to a problem(s) that holds in sway, if not grips everyday life.From the locked box, to the shed; the so called ""quiet-room,"" to the designated colors; from the commandments, and even to the prominent family surname the movie was woven into a tale that had communities from the Amish (since it was in PA), to the extreme of cults, or even the Branch Davidians of Waco leaping initially to mind. However, what kept the interest piqued were the 'creatures,' or the beasts that held this isolated community voluntarily captive, if not united, until the unexpected happened which had the community, and its elders and leaders considering to break a long held pact.The manner in which it was performed was mediocre, however how the story unfolded, and plot thickened (so to speak) was exceptional - IMHO.

This is different from a lot of other Shhyamalan movies, where the twist is very clearly telegraphed throughout the movie.This is both a blessing and a curse, though. On one hand, yeah, it does mean it's harder to outsmart the movie, but on the other hand, it does make it feel like the twist sorta came out of nowhere to some extent.This ends up being the big thing that drags the movie down for me.

Another stinker from M. Night Shyamalan! This is his worst movie yet!!,"Anyone who has seen a real thriller will be ten steps ahead of this film the whole time.

Anyone familiar with Shyamalan's body of work will realise that he loves his twist endings, so they will see the twist ending (Two twists in fact) a mile off! Joaquin Phoenix delivers his worst performance to date, and despite the fact that there are some a grade actors in this film, they do little but stand around and spout poetry throughout. Sub plots concerning romance make no sense whatsoever and other sub plots are introduced just for the sake of it. This film is the worst movie by M. Night Shyamalan to date! You would have thought that after delivering a stinker like ""signs"" the only place to go was up, as you could not possibly make a film worse than that, but he has proved us all wrong!

Suffered for Being Advertised Wrong,"I just watched this movie the other day when it was on TV. I saw it in the theater when it came out but I didn't really remember it too well. After watching it for a second time, I realized that it was a pretty good movie with a genuinely interesting plot. In fact, all of M. Night's movies are good (except for The Happening...which is the movie we will not speak of). The problem with all of his films including The Village is that they are advertised wrong. The Village was advertised as a horror movie when in actuality, it's not. Ever since The Sixth Sense, everyone has been expecting M. Night to scare them...but this is not what he does. Most of his movies are fantasy-dramas with engaging stories and characters you come to care about. Although scary, even The Sixth Sense wasn't a horror movie. The Village succeeds on so many levels such as in the set design, atmosphere, characters and twist ending. Everyone needs to give M. Night some credit as a master storyteller and quit criticizing him for not being scary enough. His films are enjoyable when you're willing to enjoy them for what they are.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Innocence,"M. Night Shyamalan directed this ambitious film that stars William Hurt as Edward Walker, who leads his small, isolated village in Pennsylvania, along with Alice Hunt(played by Sigourney weaver) whose son Lucius(played by Joaquin Phoenix) is in love with Edward's daughter Ivy(played by Bryce Dallas Howard) That love is tested when Lucius is attacked by mentally-impaired Noah(played by Adrien Brody) forcing Ivy to seek medical help in the outside world, with the woods in-between occupied by mysterious creatures they have a truce with to keep their children out, but for reasons that, if uncovered, would destroy their carefully created community. Commendable tale about the virtue of preserving and cherishing innocence is well-made and acted, with a most thoughtful story, though it came perilously close to imploding when you consider the revelation at the end, which viewer may see coming a mile away. Still, an interesting and atmospheric film that is worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Really well put together story,"I thought The Village was a very good movie but the marketing for the film had me expecting a different movie than I got. As a previous poster noted, the producers of this movie were way off with their ""thriller"" movie claim. I didn't find the movie to be thrilling so much as intriguing. Suspenseful at times and hair raising at others The Village left me feeling just fine about the 20 bucks spent at the theater and that is something that seems to happen less and less often these days.Joaquim Phoenix and Adrian Brody were both very good in their roles as was Ms. Howard but the star of this film is Shyamalan's fantastic ability to tell a story on the big screen.

Some Fine Elements But Disappointing as a Whole,"Despite its other shortcomings, I did enjoy the fine craftsmanship evident in this interesting film. The score, cinematography and sets were beautiful, creating a unique and engaging atmosphere. In a market that's over-stylized and CG'd-to-death, it's a rare pleasure to find a scary film that gets its chills from the environment. Bryce Dallas Howard's acting was very good, as was that of the distinguished actors relegated to small parts. The story was interesting, with the added bonus that it dealt with one of the most topical subjects of our time: fear and its effect on societies.That said, I was never fully emotionally or intellectually invested in The Village. I found the plot to be overly complex and unfocused, with too many characters spread too thin. The romance wasn't convincingly moving, the horror convincingly scary, nor the mystery convincingly engaging. The script was littered with a combination of patches for the logical holes in the story and misdirecting details. Undue attention was drawn to elements which had little to do with the story, while significant items were treated so lightly I almost missed them. If not intentional, this could only be the result of a director who was too close to the production to see the overall picture. Whatever the reason, much of the emotional impact of the story was bled away by these distractions. The over-casting of the smaller roles was another distraction. When Brendan Gleeson, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are on the screen, one expects them be a significant part of the story.According to M. Night Shyamalan's comments in the Extras section of the DVD, the plot of the film changed significantly quite late in the production. This would certainly help to explain the meandering storyline. But the problem here runs deeper than that. I'm left to wonder if NIght himself wasn't spread too thin writing, directing and producing this film. The Village contains a great deal of creative energy which never seems properly directed.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"well made, needs more time","I sadly went in to this movie with the final twist spoiled but was still surprised here and there.This is one of the better M. Knight movies I have seen. It is far from perfect but overall it keept my attention throughout it's runtime.The dialogue can be a bit too much in this movie from time to time but overall I think it works also because there is some great actors who can sell the lines.Go blind into this movie for the best experience. It is one of those movies where that will make things land much better. It is also a m. Night movie so that should say it all.We follow a small town and it's community. They don't dare to travel beyond their borders since they have made a pact with the monsters living outside the borders. But the monsters start moving into their town and conflict arise.This movie is part horror part drama and part romance and I wish the script would have stuck with just two of those. The movie doesn't spend enough time on any of the aspects to fully land with me. The world is interesting the charecters are interesting but we only get to know them and the world on a surface level. I would have loved this movie to be a bit longer.The monster design in this movie is great and I loved the ideas of separate colours for the monsters and the city to create contrast.

You should know better than to trust the opinions of the viewing public...,"...because despite the fact that I saw the twist coming about 30 seconds into the movie, this was a fantastic movie. I think the reason for the transparency was that we've now come to expect the twist, and so we're looking for it. The most surprising thing that MNS could do is make a movie with no twist at all.But set that aside for a moment. Let's talk a bit about the performances, which are uniformly magnificent, and sadly, all of them are lost in the overwhelmingly negative hype the film has received. Particularly great are J. Pheonix (I can never remember how to spell that name), Bryce Howard, and especially Adrien Brody.Portraying the mentally challenged seems to be a rite of passage for all serious Hollywood actors, and here Brody does his turn at it with panache, keeping you sympathetic even when you're recoiling in horror.Bryce Howard, in what appears to be her first major adult role, is both talented and beautiful, and her next project is a Lars Von Trier film, which is the most exciting fact I've heard in ages.I've never been a particular fan of Pheonix, but he's fine here, playing the brave loner. All of these roles evoke boatloads of pathos, and even when the script takes a turn for the ridiculous, I was completely caught up in the humanity of the characters.Anyways, the problem, as with The Others, is actually not one of quality, but of context: Had this film come out before The Sixth Sense, it would have been regarded as fantastic, but I think that at this point, Shyamalan has now both codified and exhausted the ""twist film"" genre. However, I believe that if he can move beyond this singular limitation, he has several truly landmark films in him. He's far too talented and unique not to.",,Anonymous,Mystery
The Village of Manoj Night Shyamalan,"It is as good as Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal. It's a parable & it's great.It's a microcosm of life where we create rules within ourselves to protect us from vulnerability. Yet our nature is such that we are forced to seek truth , may be unknowingly, like the blind girl. What we know in the village is non-knowledge. Science is true knowledge,in this case the medicine. Yet the giving, receiving and using of medicine is shrouded in non-knowledge,though it might help Lucius Hunt. It shows how a cult takes shape. Here it is harmless but dangerous potential exists in such communities.

Criminally Underrated Film,"This is the story of a small village, isolated in the woods before the advent of indoor plumbing or electricity. The story is somewhat centralized on the Walker family. The eldest daughter is played magnificently by Bryce Dallas Howard. She is blind and has an undying love for Lucius Hunt, played by the unequaled Jaoquin Phoenix, who refuses to acknowledge the mutual attraction. He had just denied the advances of the other Walker daughter, Kitty. Lucius is not the only gentleman that would have her though as there is a mentally deficient fellow named Noah Percy played by Adrien Brody with his usual excellence, who has desires for Ivy (BDH). The village seems to be idyllic in every aspect, but soon we find out that the color red in bad, as it attract and angers a race of creatures that dwell in the woods surrounding the village, called ""those we do not speak of"". The village elders had come to a peace accord with the creatures, but soon they start to find slaughtered animals within the village boundaries, making some fear that those we do not speak of (twdnso) have broken the accord. Life goes on, as it does and Lucius and Ivy announce they plan on wedding. In a rage Noah stabs Lucius. Against the will of the elder council, Edward Walker dispatches his blind daughter on a trip through the creature filled woods to another village nearby to get medicines to save Lucius. Will she succeed or will twdnso kill her before she can save her love?

The Village 7/10,"As good as The Village is as a film, it's pretty apparent to see here that M. Night Shyamalan started to stray away from his strong suit, the supernatural, and go towards different story lines. The Village is extraordinary just from a casting standpoint; bring the likes of Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt. Each character had to be precise and some highly articulate in order for their roles to be pulled off perfectly. It's not often to say that I felt Phoenix's character lacked while Bryce Dallas Howard portrayal of Ivy Walker was terrific. Shyamalan was lucky to get such a great group of actors and actresses for his film, along with his consistent partner and great composer, James Newton Howard. Howard's score for The Village is just as good as it was in Sings and it really sets the tone and mood for the story. Shyamalan tried to pull off a twist like The Sixth Sense with many clues, and short cut-off scenes to the past, but it just didn't get the hype he hoped for. It's not a horror film which many people thought because of what the trailer represented but an unsettling drama with only a couple intense moments. I'd still recommend The Village to anyone but I also see why so many people were disappointed because it isn't the typical Shyamalan film by any means.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This gets way more criticism than it should,"My wife and I recently watched The Village (2004) from my DVD collection. The story centers on a secluded village living a simple life, governed by strict rules designed to keep the community safe from the mysterious ""things in the woods."" When a few teenagers break these rules, the entire village faces dire consequences.This film is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Signs) and stars Sigourney Weaver (Alien), William Hurt (A History of Violence), Joaquin Phoenix (Joker), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Adrien Brody (The Pianist), and Jesse Eisenberg (The Social Network).Since my wife hadn't seen it before, I was excited to pull it from my collection. I've always loved this movie-its storytelling and conclusion really stand out. The characters are so well-crafted and convincing that you feel immersed in every scene. The eerie, atmospheric setting, period attire, and mysterious creatures all contribute to a ""Sleepy Hollow"" vibe that works perfectly. The storyline is meticulously written, with each twist unfolding in a way that captures the imagination. The ending is especially well done.Watching it again, I agreed with my wife that an additional 30 minutes showing how the ""epiphany"" affected the culture of the village might have added depth to the story. But overall, I still think this is an underrated gem that deserves more appreciation. I'd give it an 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shyamalan's Best Film,"Forget for a moment what you know about Shyamalan's tendency to ""twist"" each movie, this has been done by directors for years, and look at this film in it's entirety and you will see how well put together it is.Although billed as a ""horror"" movie this film is not one in any aspect. The Village is a study in psychology, sociology, family, grief, love and the endless possibilities opened up when people put themselves toward a common goal. In all reality I would categorize this as a romance film. This film, which is underrated and over-criticized by the vast populous, is a brilliant piece of social commentary on many levels. True, some of the acting was overdone, and some foreshadowing was forced and arbitrary, but if you view it as a whole with no preconceptions of reviews you have seen, you will not be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great thriller-much better than most,"The Village was a great thriller, much better than most. The reason why it was so good, was because it wasn't about some maniac killer who likes to cut people up into bits and pieces, or some freak video tape that kills people. This movie is actually plausible, without containing gallons of blood, gore, or obscenities. M. Night Shyamalan mainly focuses on the storyline of the movie. That means he is not concerned most with just scaring you out of your skins. Granted, startling moments do occur, but they are in good taste. This movie is something that you could watch over and over again and still watch it as an actual movie, not something you save for Halloween(if you get my drift).

better than advertised,"Though it's sure not to be everyone's cup of tea, M Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" plays like a good old-fashioned ""Twilight Zone"" episode all done up in period costume and expanded out to feature film length.Set in the late 1800's, the story - which plays like a cross between ""The Crucible"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" - takes place in a small village that has been cut off from the outside world by strange and potentially deadly creatures who inhabit the woods nearby. These mysterious figures - referred to by the townsfolk as Those We Don't Speak Of - have made some sort of pact with the humans to the effect that they will leave the people alone if the people leave them alone. However, one individual in the town - a young man named Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) - has an aching desire to leave the village and explore the world beyond the parameters of the woods. It is that unprecedented willingness to cross the barrier and violate the pact that sets the story in motion.""The Village"" is obviously intended to be an allegory about how humans use fear of the unknown to keep themselves from venturing out to worlds beyond their own, and, concomitantly, to justify hiding from the ugliness of life. The film has the stripped-down look and feel of a morality play performed on a stage whose sets are simple and stark and whose characters and dialogue are weighted down with heavy symbolic value. ""The Village"" requires patience from the audience and an acceptance going into the film that this will not be a horror movie in the traditional sense - i.e. one filled with gore and grue or high-octane chills and thrills - but rather a subdued exercise in portentousness and understated suggestion. In this respect, the movie works quite well.Heavily reliant as it is on imagery and mood to achieve its effects, this is less an actor's film that it is a director's, but Phoenix, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody as the literal village idiot, deliver reasonably compelling performances. But it is Bryce Dallas Howard, as a young blind woman sent into the forest on a danger-filled mission to bring help back from town, who shines in the film.Shyamalan has made quite a lucrative career out of movies that use indirection rather than explicitness to generate their suspense. That ""The Village"" is the weakest of those films thus far (""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"" are more fully realized works), doesn't diminish the fact that those willing to give it a chance may find it to be a rewarding experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
When you're desperate for medical supplies and your village is in the middle of a forest far away from civilization...send the blind girl for help,"I was SO glad that I took a chance, and saw this film at the theatre. Not only was I pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it, but it also introduced me to Bryce Dallas Howard - for which I'm forever grateful. She left a lasting impression with her role in this movie, playing Ivy Walker - a blind girl who ""sees"" (but just not as we see), Bryce is quite a wonder to behold. People will complain how, for a supposedly ""blind"" person, she manages to get around pretty easily/know where she's going and seems fairly familiar with her surroundings. If you actually pay attention, you will hear that she was not born blind. She obviously got to know the place where she grew up and familiarized herself with her surroundings/how to get places before she lost her sight. Even after that, she still ""sees"" people's ""colours"". So there's actually an explanation for the way she gets around, you just have to listen.At its heart, this movie is a tale of romance (in its purest form). What holds the movie together is the love story between Bryce's Ivy Walker and Lucius Hunt (portrayed perfectly by Joaquin Phoenix. No wonder he's a perfect fit - as the role was apparently written for him). It's also no wonder that Shyamalan cast Bryce without an audition from her and after only having seen her on stage. She's quite the find. Her chemistry with Phoenix is a large part of what makes the film work. There's a purity and innocence to their love for each other. Their interaction/dialogue really gets to the heart of what love is/should be about. I especially liked her trust in him and his faithfulness and loyalty to her.The rest of the cast also does well. William Hurt is excellent as Ivy's father, Sigourney Weaver is quite good as Lucius's mother, and Brendan Gleeson is great as always (though a little underused). Meanwhile, Adrien Brody has a tough role, playing Noah Percy (who is literally ""the village idiot""). He'll probably get on some people's nerves, while some might just find him unintentionally amusing. I thought he played the role well, and I even felt a twinge of sympathy for him. Judy Greer is also good as Ivy's sister, Kitty (and she shares one especially amusing scene with Lucius. Both she and Phoenix are excellent in the scene where she makes her feelings known to him). Apart from the wonderful relationships of lovers, father and daughter and mother and son, there's also the love/relationship between two sisters on display.The film itself looks great. Very moody and atmospheric, nicely gloomy and cast-over. The night scenes are brilliantly done, taking full advantage of shadows and the only light source being candles. I just cannot say enough about how good this film looks. It creates the sort of place one would almost want to step into, walk around in and be a part of. It has a mystical sort of quality to it, yet everything is grounded in a 'reality' of sorts. Speaking of, the elements to this film that may feel 'supernatural' in nature are actually handled really well. There is an explanation for everything that happens in the film, but like with all good movies, you can't expect answers straight away. You have to pay attention and be willing to go along for the ride all the way.Obviously, after Shyamalan's other movies, people are expecting a 'twist'. Thing is, if you go into this movie for the sole purpose of *looking* for what the twist might be, then chances are you may figure it out. I myself went into the film not actively seeking out the twist, and was able to sit back and just enjoy the movie for the story it had to tell. The 'twist ending' is not the main thing you should be worrying about here. It's the *story* that matters...and it was a story that I thoroughly enjoyed. Some may possibly feel that the film just sort of ends abruptly, but I think that if you've been paying close enough attention to the journey that the character of Ivy Walker goes through, you'll realise that the somewhat open-ended final scene can only have one natural resolution. It's really left up to you to decide, but I know that I was happy with how I thought the film ended.It's one of those cases where you either 'get' the film or you don't. And I absolutely 'got' it. It addresses issues about today's society and makes you really think about what the world has come to. What are people, as a whole, like nowadays? Not exactly the best examples of human nature are on display in today's day and age. People, in general, are deeply flawed, and The Village ponders what could be done about that to escape the unpleasantness. I very much appreciated this film and, after having recently re-watched it yet again on DVD, I love it just as much as I did the first time I saw it at the theatre (maybe even a little more). Out of all of Shyamalan's films that he's done, this one is easily my favourite. It's a truly under-appreciated gem of a film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Shymalan swings, he hits, he... puts one in left field.","M. Night Shymalan is making a name for himself not only as an auteur in the psychological thriller genre but as a moralist. So my ""7"" score is partly due to the fact that ""The Village"" fails to live up to its hype, or to the rest of Shymalan's work, for that matter. Of course, Shymalan is a money maker these days, so the producers probably felt pressured by the money men to make us see ""Village"" commercials in our sleep prior to release.The problem with the media blitz, of course, is that almost NO movie can live up to a full-on 21st century movie ad campaign. The nice sense of schadenfreude when something like ""The Day After Tomorrow"" goes flat can be satisfying, but it should never happen to one of Shymalan's films.""The Village"" just plods along most of the time. I've spent a lot of time in woodland clearings at night, because a lot of my relatives lived in the woods or close to the woods or between the bayou and the marsh on a levee, and he captured that ambiance very well... but I didn't feel as though the movie was going much of anywhere until halfway through it, because the pace just lagged.The pace of the film does pick up about halfway through the film, which is good because I was about to duck out for a lined notepad and pencil to start writing the foreshadowing down so I'd remember it in the second half of the film - or out for a nice meal, something.And that's as close as I'm going to get to spoiling the film, except to say that the Shymalan twists at the end of the film were predictable - unlike ""Signs,"" which starts off making you sure you're watching a psychological thriller despite the spooky 50's sci-fi setup, then makes you sure that everyone in the house, especially the Mel Gibson character, is a head case - and the next day, guess what - you're in a modern science-fiction movie which then morphs into a play all about faith... and there you are leaving finger indentations in your hardwood coffee table or the plastic armrests of your theater seat.""The Village"" is, unfortunately, nowhere near as unpredictable as ""Signs."" The final, chilling plot twist occurred to me a third of the way through the film, and halfway through, I was certain of it. And I was right. Ditto with the second-to-last chilling plot twist.I can't decide whether it's the actors' fault or Shymalan's that the characters all seemed to have gotten into a private stash of quaaludes before every scene until halfway through the film (of course, William Hurt acts like that all the time, so was it type casting in his case?) I mean, I was appropriately moved when I should have been, but not moved in the way I'd come to expect of Shymalan's work. It's just not fair being M. Night Shymalan, you know? Reviewing a thriller is difficult - unless you're sadistic enough to want to spoil everyone's pleasure in the film in question. And that would be a shame for this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An Anthem to Minimalism,"What I suspected from MNS starting from his Unbreakable appeared clear in Village - he is interested in developing as a drama director. I will not be surprised if one day he decides to screen Shakespeare.If you are a pure horror movies fan either quit seeing MNS' movies or start seeing other aspects in them.Another suspicion, which became obvious in Village is his strive for minimalism. Not in the way Lars von Trier does (handheld shooting, no props) but in terms of playing and the picture. Remember the Sixth Sense booming of each scary scene and rewind to the most dramatic episode with the knife in Village when there is no sound at all. Remember the limited set of colours in Village, shooting unnecessary heroes from a distance, etc. This is the most minimalistic movie I've seen from mainstream Hollywood in years.The movie does not lampoon GW Bush administration as it could appear from many comments. At wider scope the issues raised in the Village equally concern e.g. Hitler and Stalin, elections in Ukraine, etc. Bad colours, somebody we do not speak of, etc. The novelty of the Village is that in contrary to his latter movies (e.g. childhood problems, family relations, etc.) MNS now took even more difficult philosophical aspects to explore (place of individual in community, manipulation of masses, etc.). Respect.The only reservation I keep is the minimalism in playing, which I agree to be somewhat numb. The most of actors are little underused. Better use of simple human emotions imho wouldn't spoil the minimalistic set.The script, picture, camera-work, soundtrack (which is a masterpiece), proper use of sound/visual effects, and philosophical background make the Village deserve 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pillage the Village.,"Here's a concept: A bunch of people live in a creepy village located in the middle of a field in anywhere, anytime, North America. Within this bunch of people reside a retarded murderous pianist, a blind woman who can see, and a ring leader that talks like a robotic Dickens novel. Everyone dresses all Amish. Surrounding the village is a forbidden forest, where ""Those We Don't Speak Of,"" (glorified dark crystal beasts,) run amok, slaughtering and skinning dogs, leaving their glistening corpses on villagers doorsteps, all sinister-like. Sounds cool right? No. Not cool. There is a cornucopia of reasons why you, your friends, or their friends should not waste their valuable time on this piece of utter disappointment.Let's just start with the logistics. How many torches surround the village? These flames burn eternally? Who lights said torches? If the woods are off limits, where does all the wood come from? Who built these houses? What worm hole does the food, 80 foot banquet tables and fine linen materialize from? Is this the very same wormhole that the script appeared from when it landed on M. Night's desk? Why didn't he throw it back, or ask Steven Hawkins for a second opinion.As if the absurd logistics aren't enough to bury this film, dialog so weak it could make the pope weep is coupled with less then savory performances from seemingly qualified actors. The Village makes Unbreakable look good... hold on... I think I'm going to... yes, I'm going to throw up.This film put the ""uck"" in suck. -Cherry ""Pop"" Siskel",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Well Photographed with a Silly Plot. A Poor Man's ""Twilight Zone"".","Even if you're a follower of M. Night Shyamalan's first three films, his latest effort will test both your intelligence and patience as a viewer. ""The Village"" is a beautifully-photographed, goose-bumpy stinker with a (you guessed it) twist ending.It seems Mr. Shyamalan is content in making the same movie over and over again, and though the plot, characters and settings may be different in each film, there is still that terribly clever plot twist.What the surprise in ""The Village"" is, I won't say because I don't want to spoil it for fans of this sort of thing. However, by the film's end, I will say I felt cheated. I groaned out loud because I couldn't believe the final twist could be that silly. I was wrong.The late, great Rod Serling wrote these kinds of morality plays 40 some years ago but those were classic examples of mood and storytelling. Most of these ""Twilight Zone"" episodes taught a moral lesson or commented on a social issue and many of them had an O. Henry-inspired twist ending. These scripts also had a wry, satiric sense of humor and were crafted with great skill by Mr. Serling. The script for ""The Village"" is not.As a director, Shyamalan creates a foreboding atmosphere and a few chilling moments but his flat, clunky screenplay fails both he and the audience as the film draws us to its rather mundane ending.Shyamalan's terrific cast of actors tries hard but even the seasoned pros can only do so much with some of this corny and stilted dialogue. I hope these actors were paid very well for their work here.Of the ensemble, William Hurt does the best, especially since the dialogue seems to flow naturally off his tongue. One of my favorite actresses, Sigourney Weaver, is basically wasted in a colorless role.Joaquin Phoenix is dour and very serious indeed and pretty newcomer, Bryce Dallas Howard, has plenty of charisma as Mr. Phoenix's love interest. In the role of the ""village idiot,"" Adrien Brody is way over the top but he's obviously having a rollicking good time.The film looks spectacular thanks to the rich, burnished cinematography by Roger Deakins, who photographs the backgrounds in ""The Village"" as if they were paintings created by Dutch masters. Kudos to Mr. Deakins for an outstanding effort.Though Mr. Shyamalan has created some interesting characters and situations in ""The Village,"" they're basically abandoned for what is a rather ridiculous and implausible ending. But by that time, no one really seems to care.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Thought-provoking movie,"The village is a thought-provoking movie that deviates from the typical M Night Shyamalan, scare-the-crap-out-of-you movie like The Sixth Sense, The Happening, or Signs. Shyamalan does deliver his typical twist, that I found a bit predictable here, but I leave that part for you to decide.A village in the late 1800s/early 1900s lives in isolation from the other villages. It looks like a Quaker village, simple lives, no electricity, basic water, simple clothes. They don't allow the color red, there's some sort of aversion to it. No one is allowed to wander into the woods because there are creatures there who may attack you. The villagers stay in the village and they are safe. Or are they?Joaquin Phoenix delivers a powerful performance as Lucius, a young man who doesn't say much, but what he does exhibit is extreme courage. He is attracted to Ivy, a not-quite-totally blind girl, brilliantly acted by Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of Ron Howard, the famous actor/director from Happy Days and Apollo 13. Their attraction is one of the key story lines.Other key story lines are Adrien Brody as Noah, somewhat of a village idiot. Something not right upstairs. This craziness borders on obsession, and that is a key part of his personality and the film.Finally, a wonderful performance from Sigourney Weaver as a single, middle-aged woman with an unobtainable attraction to William Hurt, who plays pretty much the leader of the village, Edward Walker. There is a core group of elders, who meet to discuss the direction of the village, and that is the final key storyline. Why do they meet? What do they discuss? what are these boxes they all seem to have? Intriguing.Events happen that drive action, and if you paid attention during the movie, you have an inkling of the ending. It's a collision of hearts and minds with no clear resolution, except it gives you hope that, somehow, all will work out well for the village and its people.See The Village. There is terrific acting by all, an intriguing plot, and a thought-provoking ending. Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Suspend logic all ye who enter here,"M. Night Shyamalan is a very polarizing writer/director. Even at his best his style isn't for everyone, and 2004's ""The Village"" represents everything that his critics hate and that his fans love.Naturally there's a twist. It's his calling card. But never has the dramatic success of his films ever been so dependent on whether or not the one here ""works"" for you. For me it did, but that's not to say that it didn't come with some concessions. Chief among them is that you just can't try and analyze the logic here. At all.Whatever you may think of Shyamalan, he's a very good director on a technical level. He does an excellent job of creating a mood and quietly pulling you into the world he's creating. Here he's in top form, and he's aided by strong performances from his cast. In particular Bryce Dallas Howard, who carries the movie. I contend that she'd have gotten an Oscar nomination in a more ""serious"" film.I've always believed that ""Unbreakable"" was Shyamalan's best movie, but ""Signs"" had always been my favorite. It'd been years, probably since it was first released, that I'd watched ""The village"". Having had a few hours to digest it I think that I might be willing to put it alongside ""Signs"" as my favorite. It's a movie about a return to a simpler life that resonates even more in this rather crazy world of 2024 than it did 20 years ago. And it's just really good... if you can set aside the plot holes.Look, my favorite movie of all-time is about a kid who travels to a planet to train with a space frog (see if you can guess the movie), so suspending disbelief is something that I've never had a problem with. All movies are fake, even the so-called serious ones. So if you can buy ""The Godfather"" and ""Citizen Kane"", there's no reason why you can't just escape into movies like ""The Village"" as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Not Great, but looks great","The Village is that one M. Night Shymalan movie that splits people right down the middle, some like it, some don't, but not many people love it or hate it. When the trailer was first released for this film, it made the movie look like some kind of supernatural thriller, and it looked really cool. Unfortunately the trailer lied to people, the movie is actually more of a romance. Sure there are a few thriller elements in there, but people went in expecting a thriller and got a romance, and were very disappointed. Personally I like this movie, but it does have some flaws.For one, this movie can get extremely boring in a few places. And I mean almost fall asleep boring. Also, most of the characters are extremely forgettable. The two leads are fine, Sigorney Weaver is a little memorable, and you got a feel a little sorry for Noah, but the rest are just forgotten once you stop watching the movie. It gets way too overly dramatic at times, and it's a little pretensious.But the film looks fantastic, can someone please explain why Shymalan is a terrible director, every single one of his films I've seen (everyone except Praying with Anger) looks great. The lighting is great, the use of color, and every shot is done well. The acting is good for the most part. And I actually really like the twists, a lot of people, even fans of the movie don't like them, but personally I thought they were pretty good. And I like how you can analyze the film. I won't spoil anything, but the last twist brings up some questions that are worthy of being analyzed.I like the Village about as much as I liked Drive, both have great things about them, but they are dragged down by being too much about the style and getting really boring at times. So if you loved Drive, you should love this movie. Personally I like it, it isn't as good as Signs or Sixth Sense, but it is better than Lady in the Water and Unbreakable (bring on the hate.)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I admit I am a huge fan of M. Night starting with ""Signs"" so you could interpret this review as bias but not anymore bias then all the people hating on him and his films. Overall I loved the film.

Slooooooooooooow,"But not bad all in all. The story of an Amish style society, told with the directors usual assortment of sight frights and skin crawlers. These mostly concern the creatures that terrorize the village by night. They are definitely scary, modeled almost exactly like the devil's henchmen in Time Bandits, those tall cloaked creatures with the cows skull heads and hook hands if you have any idea at all what I'm talking about. Gilliam was definitely onto something, because as goofy as they sound, for some reason they scare the crap out of you. Shamalyan has a gift for getting the absolute scary most in a situation, and in this film he exercises the talent generously. Here's the trouble, if you find the fright ineffective, I can almost guarantee you will hate this film, because not a whole lot else happens in it. There isn't a plot as such, its more of an examination on the way of life and the attendant troubles of a closed off society. The trouble of the creatures becomes the overriding drama, and the Twilight Zone style resolution isn't bad. Its not great however, and there's unquestionably too much ineffective dead time. Fans of this director will no doubt overlook the shortcomings and repeated themes, and enjoy one of his scarier efforts. For the average guy on the street, it might not satisfy.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Deliciously Entertaining..,"When this movie released in August, I was simply overjoyed and immediately wanted to go see it. Because of my busy schedule that summer, I didn't have the time to go see The Village. When I did have that spare moment, I didn't bother to go see it because the majority of my friends said it was crap and a waste of money.Just a few weeks ago this movie came out to rent on DVD. Looking somewhat forward to renting it, my friend spoiled the enormous twist at the end just to prove it was a stupid movie. About a week later, I went to the movie store looking forward to renting a comedy, but ended up getting the Village. I wasn't expecting it to be so good.I think that most people didn't enjoy this movie because the twist was disappointed, but since it was spoiled for me, I found absolutely wonderful! Besides the Notebook, the Village is now my all-time favourite movie. It captured my attention from the first title on the screen, to the very last.I'm really upset that none of the actors got an Oscar nod; especially the actor who plays Ivy Walker.

"Wow, where to begin","It's a known fact that M. Night Shyamalan can make some truly scary movies. The Sixth Sense echoed Alfred Hitchcock, a comparison that is not tossed around lightly. Signs was an exercise of letting one's imagination fill in the horrific gaps of what the audience cannot see. But Shyamalan's latest outing dives into a new type of scary: That a filmmaker with such an accomplished resume, two Oscar nominations, and a very profitable background could create a film so bad that the audience would be more likely to find amusement hitting their heads against the seats in front of them in this movie.The plot is sketchy at best, but ""The Village"" is about a village of people in an indeterminate setting have become threatened by mythical creatures in the woods who are beginning to invade the town. Meanwhile, Joaquin Pheonix says that he wants to venture into the woods to find some medicine from the outside towns. Pheonix and newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard share moments of fleeting love that is never truly defined. For that matter, neither is any of the characters' motivations. We are essentially watching people go through the actions, but the audience is left in the dark.So essentially, Shyamalan is trying to show the dangers of hiding from one's past, but the story is so disjointed and poorly told that his message and story get lost in the chaos. A few more drafts or at least a ghost writer or two could have saved this story from incoherence, but it seems that Shyamalan saw this as his baby and wanted complete control over it. Since the film is now his own, he becomes the one who is to blame. Shyamalan should have known better.This movie brought to mind an interesting riddle, what's a bigger crime: wasting a talented ensemble cast or framing a movie in a way that disconnects the audience from all attachment to the characters? We have Joaquin Pheonix, Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson and the promise of a newcomer in Bryce Dallas Howard, yet this movie proves that no matter how much talent you may have, if there's no motivation to work with, no clear goals of the characters, and lines so out of place and distractingly bad, talented actors becomes no more than a mannequins for the director to manipulate. Shyamalan should have known better.Obviously, there is a typical twist at the end of an M. Night Shyamalan has become expected, whether it be ""I see dead people"", ""They call me Mr. Glass"", or ""Swing away,"" relying on such twists can be a treat for an audience, but ""The Village proves that relying on twists too much can make the audience realize they are on shaky ground and make them watch every step the movie takes. By Shyamalan's fourth film, the audience already begins to expect such an ending and instead begin looking at clues instead of the film itself, which in the case of ""The Village"" may actually be a good thing, but in this case, the payoff is so juvenile that one expects it from a sixth grade creative writing paper rather than from the man who made us ""keep the secret"" of ""The Sixth Sense."" (You can find the twist in the paragraphs of this review) Shyamalan should have known better.Directors carry most of the blame if the movie they make isn't clear or interesting to an audience and here, Shyamalan is the man to blame. He stages his shots so that we never see any reaction on the characters faces during critical moments in the film. And the staging of each of the actors is so dehumanized and impersonal that it does more to draw an audience away from a film than draw them in. If the atmosphere looks great, one can credit the greatest living director of photography: Roger Deacons and the always talented costume designer Ann Roth. But their efforts seems wasted as the photography or the costumes are never given the chance to breath on their own. Shyamalan should have known better.Although, we could make the argument that Shyamalan needed a more accomplished film editor. People like Andrew Mondshein (The Sixth Sense), Dylan Tichnor (Unbreakable), and Barbara Tulliver (Signs) all knew how to handle Shyamalan's disjointed storylines and add a depth, using the cutaways to reactions. Here, Christopher Tellefsen is satisfied allowing the camera to hold on shots where the characters' backs are talking to the audience, never cutting away to show us reaction shots or giving the film a satisfying pace outside of sterile. If he had stuck with any of the other editors he'd worked with, the film might have worked better, but he chose not to. Shyamalan should have known better.You'd be hard pressed to find an enjoyable moment in this whole film. Watching this movie, one gets the feeling that Shyamalan should have written a few more drafts, made the film more clear, made the characters relatable or at least allow the audience in on their thoughts. For a director who has already displayed his own sixth sense for showing a depth of character (all together now): Shyamalan should have known better.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shyamalan best movie so far.,"I enjoyed this movie a lot because of the story, actors ( i love weaver sooooo much ) and of course the jump out of your seat moments. Yeah sure this movie isn't very scary and the monsters don't look amazing but that doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable. Bryce Dallas Howard was simply amazing and this movie was perfect for her. Sigourney Weaver is my all time favourite actress. 1. because shes beautiful 2. because shes a brilliant actress. 3. because she stared in the best film ever made (alien). 4. Oh god i just love her, shes sooooo amazing. The one thing i didn't like about it is that the town elders sounded a bit evil making up the creatures like that. Still they were trying to protect the villagers from the outside world. I would love to live there as long as Weaver lives there. It seems so peaceful and quiet, the setting is brilliant. Lady in the water is my second favourite Shyalmalan followed by signs ... i have sadly not seen the sixth sense of unbreakable yet nut i hope i can see then soon. The Village has quickly become my 8th favourite movie with lady in the water one place above it at 9th.

These people were instructed to never enter the woods that surrounded their village and there were very strict rules about doing practically everything. The Village was controlled by a group of men, namely, William Hurt who had a great ability to lead the people into doing just what he wanted, like puppets on a string.

Very underrated,"The Village is a film that often seems unfairly judged, and I think it deserves more credit than it typically gets. One of its most notable strengths is the setting. The film's meticulously crafted village is visually stunning, creating an eerie, atmospheric backdrop that complements the story's tension. The performances are also commendable; Bryce Dallas Howard, in particular, delivers a heartfelt portrayal that adds emotional depth to the film.The twist, which some might find divisive, was a clever narrative choice for me. It recontextualizes the entire story and adds a layer of complexity that invites viewers to rethink their understanding of the film. It's a testament to M. Night Shyamalan's knack for weaving intricate plots.However, the film isn't without its drawbacks. The pacing can be quite slow, particularly in the first and middle acts, which may test the patience of some viewers. The buildup can feel drawn-out and confusing at times, as the story takes its time to fully reveal the plot's intricacies. This deliberate pacing may lead some to lose interest before the twist delivers its payoff.Overall, The Village is a visually impressive film with strong performances and a unique twist, but it suffers from a slow start and moments of confusion. Despite its flaws, I think it's a compelling and underrated entry in Shyamalan's filmography, deserving of a more nuanced appraisal.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A Fascinating Meditation On Fear, Sorrow, Sins & Superstition","Operating behind a shroud of secrecy, pervaded with a hint of mystery, and imbued with a disquieting chill, The Village is an intriguing meditation on fear, sorrow, sins & superstition that makes effective use of available resources to deliver a consistently immersive experience, and is all the more elevated by its masterful cinematography & excellent performances.Written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable & Signs), this period thriller finds him investing heavily in the sight & sound elements to create an isolated community that looks alive & feels authentic. He also maintains a strong grip on how the events unravel, keeping the eerie vibe & forbidding tone in tact, and also makes sure all the relevant characters are fleshed out.The images are gorgeous to look at, thanks to Roger Deakins' stellar camerawork & pitch-perfect lighting. Character interactions carry emotional weight. And the honest performances from its impressive ensemble steers the drama in an assured fashion, with Bryce Dallas Howard impressing the most. As for the twist ending that's always a given in a Shyamalan film, it doesn't live up to the brilliance of its earlier build-up.Overall, The Village is an expertly crafted, sincerely acted & deftly balanced period thriller that's notable for its immaculate visual & sound design, remains a thrilling & engaging ride for the most part, and is definitely one of Shyamalan's better outputs. What brings the film down by a notch is the director's obsession with twist endings, for this story could've done without one.

After more thought...,"I'm writing a follow up comment to one I left right after seeing the movie because the more I think about it, the more frustrated I become.  The Village really could have been so much better than it is and the problem is the ""surprise"" ending, the thing that so many people here are commenting on, but not actually for the reason people are saying.I think M Night Shyamalan (as well as the people who saw The Village and actually thought the ending worked) would benefit greatly from watching an Atom Egoyan film like Exotica.  Egoyan is a truly brilliant filmmaker while Shyamalan is a filmmaker who thinks he's brilliant.  Egoyan delays information to keep the audience off-balance and so they don't immediately know what's going on, but he doesn't keep it for a big twist at the end--the delayed information is parceled out during the course of the movie to enhance dramatic impact.  The Village would have been much more powerful and affecting if Shyamalan had utilized a similar storytelling structure rather than relying so heavily on a rickety would-be surprise ending.  By keeping such a major plot revelation for the very end Shymalan screws up the movie because: a) people like myself who figure out the ending early get bored waiting for the obvious to be revealed and b) people who don't figure out the ending feel cheated because it invalidates what they thought the movie was.From a marketing standpoint the problem with eliminating the trick ending is that once you do The Village turns into what it really is, a romantic drama rather than a thriller.  The Village isn't a thriller.  The only way Shyamalan can even create the illusion that The Village is a thriller is to withhold crucial information until the very end.  But people who go to The Village expecting to see a thriller will feel duped (as the many angry comments here on the IMDB can attest), and people who actually enjoy the more thoughtful aspects of the story are likely to be frustrated that the structure with its gotcha ending prevents the romance and actual dramatic conflict from being developed to anywhere near the extent that it should have been.As much as I liked parts of The Village, at this point I'm hoping that after the inevitable strong opening weekend it tanks.  Based on recent interviews it seems like M Night Shyamalan judges whether his movies work or not based on their ultimate box office take, so if The Village flops maybe it will force him to actually take a few chances and break free of his formula that is not only showing greatly diminishing returns from movie to movie but, in the case of The Village, turned what could have been a really first rate and thought provoking romantic drama into a mediocre and gimmicky thriller.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A must watch , although only once","Mind Boggling plot twists are undoubtedly Shyamlans prerogative. The entire span of the movie is basically a contrivance aimed at involving the viewer in a mindset which would warrant all sorts of ""sighs""and ""wows"". Although the movie does have a few shortcomings, the contrivance itself has been very well crafted. The ending truly does baffle you. However, with repeated viewings , a bunch of incoherencies do tend to crop up. But that is the case with almost every movie in this genre.That sense of originality which is the quintessence of Shymalans movies, is very much present in ""The Village"". And as ever, the final sequence of event will leave you guessing and contemplating. This movie is somewhat chillingly creepy and tends to send pulses up and down your spine at times. The Village beats The Sixth Sense in the race for ""Shyamalan' masterpiece"". Personally, ""The Sixth Sense"" was more predictable than this one. With this movie, he does live up to every expectation warranted by his previous works.Bryce Dallas Howard irrevocably deserves more laurels for her performance in this movie.

Really?,"Daniel Yu March 5, 2017 The VillageWith great expectations for my film class, our class started the semester by watching a film called The Village by M. Night Shyamalan. This film started out in suspense, just like how thrillers are supposed to start. The setting seemed like it is set somewhere around the 1700s. The movie starts out with people having worried facial expressions and a sort unpleasant atmosphere. To even further keep the audience on an awkward mood, there is also a failed proposal to one of the characters. With all this happening, we later found out that the village is under constant pressure from a creature that attacks the village. Because of this, people don't leave the village even in an emergency. However, when one of the characters needed medication from an injury, the main character goes in an adventure to through the wood to find the medicine.This film is not one of those ""action-packed"" film that modern people find these days. It is a slow-paced movie with a rich story line. There are many times when we must think for ourselves to understand what is happening. Therefore, this is a film for higher class thinkers.Personally, I did not appreciate this movie. There were way too many times when I thought nothing was happening and the story line was not moving forward. I also thought that the setting that was set during 1700s didn't interest me. However, the thing that bugged me the most was the major conflict and the solution of this film. I personally thought that the major conflict of this film is not very important and came out of nowhere. The conflict happened in the middle of the film and came unexpected. There were no follow up or any sort of clue that the conflict was going to happen until it happened. Lastly, there was not a conclusion to the conflict; the movie ended in an abrupt manner.Overall, I would recommend this film only to people that come to think. For viewers that want a straight forward story line, this would be one of the last film that I would recommend. This was a meaningful, but a not-so-interesting film.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Film without a home,"This is a great movie, one of my favorites, but it is destined to be an outcast.It is a classic period piece, with beautiful music, visuals, people, and language. The plot is near perfect. Every time I watch it I notice something else that hints at the core climax of the plot, but so subtly, I only see it after many viewings. The characters are nearly perfect as well, and Adrian Brody, if his character were more prominent, would have won an Oscar.It is also a thriller, with mystery, violence, and moments that make you jump as a horror film might. It will make you scared of the woods in autumn almost as much as The Blair Witch Project.The fact that it is these two things at once, there lies the dilemma.If you watch this movie without expectations, you will be disappointed, because it is fluid and changes, and is never quite what you thought it would be even as it ends. If you watch it with romance and Jane Austin era expectations, you will be disappointed because it is blurred together with something completely different. And if you watch it with Thriller expectations, the same thing happens in reverse.I believe no one could truly love this film as they first view it because of all of these truths. I know I didn't care for it the first time. However...If you are reading this review, and have not seen The Village before, you have a chance! A very small chance to truly enjoy an amazing movie, without knowing why until it is over.Let the film be what it is, a truly unique outcast that will never really belong anywhere, and enter in fully, as if you are there in the story.There are no guarantees you will fall in love like I have after just one viewing, but you might! And if you watch it a few more times after, and love great cinema, I can guarantee you will.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Average/good Shyamalan movie.,"I like M. Night Shyamalan's movies. His masterpiece THE SIXTH SENSE, his very very good big budget and succesful SIGNS, the UNBREAKABLE trilogy with SPLIT and GLASS and even THE HAPPENING. This one was a good movie with good suspense but i think shallow and weak reveal and ending. It has all-star cast with great performances from Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, the veteran supporting cast William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Brendan Gleeson, but the real star of the movie with amazing performance was from Bryce Dallas Howard, she was amazing in this movie. Also the score, the music and the setting and atmosphere of the movie was good.If you like Shyamalan's movies, you will like this one too.Something between 6.5 - 7.0 / 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent and underrated film,"A very underrated film mostly due to the fact that the previous outings from M Night have all encompassed supernatural, fantasy or alien themes + his trademark twist endings. Its a shame that many people seem to feel cheated that TV doesn't provide this.....exactly !! This film is not really about twists, or trying to be too clever for its own good. In my opinion its a bit more straight forward. Very pleasant music. Fantastic cinematography 'the bland colour tone is great', 'as is some of the camera-work and editing - especially the first time Lucius enters the woods - you'll know the bit I mean when you see it :-)' Solid acting - William Hurt is perfectly cast, as is J Phoenix. Great performance by Bryce Dallas Howard also. Anyway overall I give this a solid 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Builds up great tension,"At first one is taken by the simple, innocence that permeates the life in the village. There is happiness in the simplicity of things, and the simple pleasures of life seem more then adequate.Then there are those foreboding woods, forbidden woods, the tension builds, now there is much fear as well as joy that are found in the inhabitants, fear of the woods and of the unknown.Filled with solid performances, by William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Brendan Gleason, including a slightly archaic dialog that adds to the atmosphere of the film.Filled with great cinematography that expertly builds up scenes that can draw in the audience. A good film to spend the evening with.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Forget who the director is and you may enjoy it,"One must not expect too much from M Night Shyamalan. He made the fatal mistake of producing his best film first, meaning it could only go downhill from there. Unbreakable and Signs (IMHO) were not as bad as everyone made out, they just weren't as good as The Sixth Sense and the same goes for The Village. If this had been the first film by M Night Shyamalan I feel that public opinion would have been higher.The twist at the end was expected and therefore guessed pretty quickly, but if you look beyond it and see the movie as a whole it is something very beautiful. Shyamalan has used colours so well, they are integral to the story but also he allows them to beautify the screen. The dullness of peoples clothes and the buildings is contrasted by the bright yellows of the cloaks and torches and the reds of the flowers and beasts.The true winners of this movie however are Joaquin Phoenix (his best performance yet) and a surprisingly good debut by Bryce Dallas Howard. The love story between them and the way M Night Shyamalan allows it to blossom is mesmerising. The Village is an okay horror/mystery film but is a really amazing love story. I still look forward to his next project.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Never the same movie twice,"M.Night Shyamalan films have recurring themes in his films, and some have gone so far as to suggest he makes the same film over each time. This is rather like saying Picasso used too much blue. The hues and tones of each Shyamalan study are completely different. The Village is a beautiful consideration of the human condition. Shyamalan is a symbolist, and the layers of this film can be peeled back revealing the extent to which our inner demons isolate us, the past of adults and how it can determine the paths taken by their children,and a theme many with children will surely warm to - the horror that can be created when an elder is trying to protect a youth. The environment he creates in The Village is lush,the colours are deep and rich, the characters complex and naive at the same time. The Village stands surely on it's own merits, actually the film is rather like beautiful, many layered poetry.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"No Sixth Sense, but I enjoyed it","Fortunately, I did not see the trailer for this movie, and had no preconceptions. I'd been disappointed by Unbreakable, which gave me lowered expectations for Signs, which accounts for my enjoyment of that movie. I decided to approach The Village neutrally and try to judge it without any expectations.I found an enjoyable movie with a couple of twists. True, some I had mostly figured out, but there were a few very subtle twists that I only realized after the movie had finished.If you don't expect a horror movie and approach it with an open mind and no expectations, you just may enjoy this work.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Such an obvious 'twist',"Oh I wanted to like this film so much. But I just couldn't at all. The pacing was really slow throughout, vast majority of characters either didn't make sense or were just worthless to the cause, the plot was overall just a bit boring and the massive ""twist"" is the most obvious thing to exist ever.So, there's a lot to whine about here. So the characters: zero character development. Which is fine, given the circumstances, but a lot had traits that were just not explained and made no sense. Joaquin Phoenix's character wasn't one for speaking. Why? Give us more. Furthermore, all the characters other than the blind woman didn't really serve a purpose at all. Not even an exaggeration either. Sigourney Weaver was no existent this movie and that's a common trait throughout.The plot: well as explained at the top, the twist is painfully obvious. I honestly didn't believe it was the ""twist"" because it was so obvious what the situation of the village is. Beyond this, the pacing was beyond poor. Takes over an hour for anything to really get going. Adrian Brody's character Noah I just don't understand. Without using spoilers he does things that are just never explained. I had to google what his character was about after because of how poorly explained and poorly written he was. But overall I found the plot just a bit dull and more so just unrealistic. As the plot unfolds towards the end I just found myself just disagreeing with what I was being told. The ending is just painfully underwhelming as well, nothing of note happens. Just ends.So yeah, clearly I'm not a happy bunny today after watching this. Only positives I have is that it was shot really well and Bryce Dallas Howard I thought did a great job also. But beyond that I just thought there were too many flaws and annoyances to be enjoyed. A very weak 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Different from Shyamalan's other films... one needs to know that to appreciate it.,"Although being a fairly good admirer of M. Night Shyamalan's previous three films I did not go to see ""The Village"" in theatres when it came out, partly because I was very busy with my work then and partly because I received negative comments from friends who saw it. I finally saw it on TV and am now regretting the fact that I missed its theatre screening.To speak things clearly, ""The Village"" is not primarily 'a suspense-horror film with a sharp ending twist' as the popular description of his films goes. It is essentially a beautiful and faithful love story in the backdrop of an unusual situation. This backdrop has those elements of suspense and horror only to enrich the story, not to contaminate it. The film's social and political undertone shows how Shyamalan is growing more mature in writing cinematic materials, with several conflicting points of view interwoven with one another. And his visionary about the village and the woods is simply amazing. That makes it a visually stylish film too. And about the so-called 'plot twist', I think it was intentionally given away much too early, otherwise the original love story would have been largely affected. One must appreciate the film's ending, even if it does not contain any 'twist' as one might expect.Bryce Dallas Howard completely steals the show with her dedicated portrayal of Ivy; I'd definitely look for her future works. Joaquin Phoenix as an actor is also nice to watch. Adrien Brody remains a little under-utilized in my opinion. And one must not forget William Hurt's excellent acting as Ivy's father.The bottomline: To watch this film and appreciate it, it must not be compared with his previous films. It does not have their elements, but it has something new to offer. Keep and open mind for that.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
better than i expected,"I expected to be disappointed mainly because our local film reviewers whose opinions are usually valid were not so positive about this film but I was happily surprised.I still think 6th Sense was Night's best but this is better than the others he's made since. There were a few twists which were unexpected and the acting was faultless.It's not your usual over-the-top type of horror movie which I don't like anyway but it would be a disappointment if you had expectations.Best to go open-minded and be pleasantly surprised. 7/10(I count 10 lines but this isn't enough according to these stupid regulations!

And so M. Night fades away quietly into the night...,"From thequickflickcritic.blogspot.com/ This is the one that did it. Having finally seen 2004's ""The Village"" I can now endow confirmation. THIS is the abomination that killed M. Night Shyamalan's career.Never in the history of recorded time has any movie been more massively marketed to the masses. And never has any film been more of a miserable disappointment. A thriller devoid of even a mild buzz. A mystery with a dreadfully dumb and barely comprehensible solution. The waste of a cast so impressive the hope is that they were all paid handsomely for their parts in such an appallingly hopeless cause.The only possible point to be extracted from this wretched wreck could conceivably be, in the words of that classic comic strip philosopher Pogo, ""We have met the enemy and he is us."" But even THAT is stretching it.Even the ending blows. Chunks. MNS would have been better served (but not by much) to have stuck with the original ending. Google it.

Both dark and brilliant, all from different angles. The characters and actors blend together to create a surreal, stunning, and tantalizing struggle of humanity.

Some nice ideas to think about,"I went to this movie without expecting a copy of The Sixth Sense, which was good because it wasn't.OK, it does bear some similarities - it isn't till the very end that the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, the build up of suspense is very slow but steady, and the fairly straightforward story is cleverly narrated.What I liked about this movie, is that it didn't focus on the obvious thrills of Hollywood blockbusters. Yes, I immediately knew there had to be a logical explanation for the creatures in the woods, and still I found myself intrigued by the feelings of fear, the behaviour arising from fear, the way fear had crept into the lives of these people. The existence of the creatures had so effectively scared the s**t out of these people, just the mere story about and odd occurrence of these monsters was enough!In the end, we find out why the creatures are there. Afterwards, I found myself wondering if I would go that far for some peace and quiet, if it is humane to instill fear in others for your own selfish reasons, if it is OK to deprive your offspring of certain aspects of the world. There is a resemblance to religion: people who raise their children with strict religious beliefs, always set out (stern) barriers, thus restricting their view on the world. Is that a good thing? I wonder.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Village Idiots,"Thankfully, I saw this movie on television and did not spend money for viewing it in the movie theatre but long ago Okay, folks it is time to pull the trap door under M. Night Shamalamadingdong. Bring out the ole vaudeville hook too; anything get rid of this sucker.The movie plot is too simple to be interesting. The characters are not well developed. The flick has some of the best actors in the industry and yet we do not see enough of them. I feel as though the whole film was made to focus on Bryce Howard; not her character but Howard, herself.It is also very annoying that all the actors seem to talk in a soft monotone that is hard to make out. I suppose the sound was better in the theatre but on DVD or on the TV it is not a pleasant experience to keep having to turn up the volume.Why would you go to the trouble and expense to hire some really big box office actors and then hobble them with lame dialogue and incomplete character development? Why would you rather shoot dismal scenery than these wonderful actors? I would have rather seen more of Joaquin Phoenix and Adrien Brody than I saw of mudslides, water, leaves and scary outlines of tree branches.The ending is ridiculous; Bryce Howard goes through trials and tribulations and gets fantastically muddy-dirty-nasty but in the end she is clean as a newborn babe....come on!",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Doesn't know its movie history,"Mainstream directors who try to make horror movies without being fans of the genre frequently embarrass themselves. They think they're bringing something fresh and imaginative to the genre without realizing it's been done before, often better. Mike Nichols' WOLF is entertaining when it examines the effects of lycanthropy on office politics but its werewolf scenes are retreads from old Hammer and Universal horrors. Barry Levinson's SPHERE doesn't know it's ""clever twist"" is straight out of FORBIDDEN PLANET from fifty years ago. And M. Night Shyamalan's VILLAGE lifts its central conceit intact from Roger Corman's drive-in classic TEENAGE CAVEMAN without, I'm sure, even knowing it. Even the so-called ""monsters"" looked like the suits in Cormon's old movie. I have nothing against Mr. Shyamalan. I've heard interviews with him and he seems like a good guy. But the ending of his SIXTH SENSE was obvious to anyone who's seen TWILIGHT ZONE a few times, and the ending of THE VILLAGE was just as predictable. I saw it coming from just about the halfway mark, and it frankly made me feel ripped off. He needs to sit down with a bunch of old movies and a stack of FAMOUS MONSTERS and discover that the stuff he thinks he's inventing was invented before he was born. Then maybe the surprise twist of his next movie might actually surprise someone.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Waiting for the twist will keep you awake....,"OK so it's not as dreadful as 'Blair Witch Project', a film that 'The Village' vaguely resembles, but it certainly does not stand up to any sort of close scrutiny. For the sake of the plot only the blind girl can leave the village since she would be unable to 'see' the truth on the outside but for heavens sake she actually runs through the wood and has no difficulty scaling a 10 foot wall never mind gauge exactly the moment she will be attacked so she can take evasive action:sorry but this was just too corny for words. Nice atmosphere, moody music but the actors speak their stilted dialogue ('This is the shed that must not be used....The coat that is made of the colour that is safe etc etc..) so earnestly as if they actually believed the rubbish they were saying. The whole thing is so po-faced you just feel like bursting out laughing to lighten up the proceedings.

A less harrowing experience than his other films but a more intellectually satisfying one,"The very noun `village' connotes a closed community often out of time in an outer world grown increasingly forbidding.  M. Night Shyamalan's (`Sixth Sense,' `Signs') `The Village' incorporates those notions and more modern isolationism and xenophobia stemming from ultraconservative politics and `9/11' to create a less harrowing experience than his other films but a more intellectually satisfying one.A late nineteenth-century hamlet in rural America is plagued by threats from monsters in its forest to the extent that the town fortifies itself with encircling high torches and a watchtower along with animals sacrificed and tossed to the woods as supplication. The fortified Utopia has the simple architecture of a Shaker Village and speech patterns in a stilted English often associated in depictions of Puritan life. There is a similarity to Arthur Miller's `Crucible' and the attendant problems of dealing with the unknown, in that case witchcraft and in this one, vague outside forces only briefly sited looking like red-cloaked college football celebrants with Howard Hughes nails and guttural speech like theirs after being over served.Associated with the frustrating search for a perfect existence as chronicled from Thomas More to Hawthorne and now Shyamalan is the constant need to adjust for imperfection especially in the human body.  So medicine from the city is frequently the catalyst for facing the developed world; `The Village' is no different.  Rather than facing the disrupting intruder, the recluses must become intruders themselves to survive. In this film a striking parallel occurs with a `Twilight Zone' episode, in which Cliff Robertson's settler wagon train must send a member over the hill for medicine. Facing the outside world means endangering all that you have guarded from it but possibly saving your life.A sub theme of the power of love nicely parallels the isolation one. Each character seems to struggle with embracing and exposing love not without dire consequences. William Hurt is believably torn by his and the other elders' decision to live and love apart.  His blind daughter, played disarmingly by Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, expectedly sees more clearly than anyone else, and Joaquin Phoenix creates the right mood of ambivalence about the whole isolation. Only Adrian Brody as a disturbed troublemaker is underdeveloped as a character.  Yet he does point out the obvious corollary that the enemy may be within.The teens in my audience were restless for at least the first hour because the solemn tone and stilted conversation seemed as old as the village.  They were certainly not ready to forsake a good scare for lofty idealism, a good Shyamalan plot twist for an existential exploration of life's purpose for the social being.`The Village' has Shyamalan's patented twist but not as shocking as those in `Signs' and `Sixth Sense.' The writer/director here reinforces the notion that `these days isolationism is not a good policy,' as the fat Ferrari warned Rick in `Casablanca.'",,Anonymous,Mystery
Not impressed at all ...,"I was not impressed by The Village as I had high hopes for it (I'm a big M.

I enjoyed Bryce Dallas Howard's performance -- she's an amazing actress. I also thought Adrian Brody acted well although you have this love-hate relationship with him in this movie. Overall I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a thriller or a scary movie. I felt it was more of a ""love"" story however the ""love"" scenes were touching and well acted.

"Banal plot, good acting, superb image","The plot here is far from being new. There is nothing bad about that in the end, since the idea of a self/isolated community governed by some taboos was always very challenging. What I didn't like about the movie is that, first of all, everything was too predictable for a movie that has mystery and thriller as key words. Secondly, I found it sometimes boring; for me there were some scenes (like those with the elders' council) that were too long and it seemed to me that the producer wanted to gain some more minutes. So, shorter would have been better. The acting was very good, especially Bryce Howard, who was really great, very natural and really Ivy Walker... What I really loved about the movie, and really stroke me from the first minutes it's the image. It is not about the location for shooting the movie, (since the forest is in no way different than others) but is about the way it was filmed, one could sense the movement of the nature (I could hardly find a more appropriate term). It was as if there was always something around, and I'm not referring at those stupid red creatures. I just think that the way cameras were used saved the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This movie is a work of art.,"When I first saw this movie, I had never seen any of the director's previous works, nor seen the trailer. I had no expectations or preconceived notions. I just took everything as it came.I was floored by the movie's drama and suspense, the meticulous staging of every scene, the outstanding performances of a top-flight group of award-winning actors, the unusual plot and twists, and maybe more than anything else, by the overwhelmingly beautiful, poignant soundtrack, with solo violin by Hilary Hahn (who has been called one of the ten best violinists of all time).I understand why people who were misled by the trailer and were hoping for gore and the supernatural probably felt let down, but as someone who doesn't care to see things like that anyway, that didn't enter into the equation at all for me. What I felt, and still feel, is that this is one of the most artistic and emotionally powerful movies I've ever experienced. I also came to love and admire the story's characters for their nobility. Their earnestness in trying to live a decent and harmonious life together, and to nurture and truly care for one-another, is something I still think is inspiring.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Definitely Underrated! **(NO SPOILERS)**,"This film is hardly a horror movie. In fact, I'm certain it was never really meant to be. Writer and director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Signs) is a master at creating his own fairy-tale worlds, and his films are wreathed in beauty and symbolism.This film is certainly a beautiful one. The art design is fitting, and James Newton Howard's musical score is beyond perfect. The film moves slowly, as it must to achieve this level of beauty. I believe this is why the film is often misunderstood- many watched it expecting to see a quick-paced, terrifying suspenseful thriller (not unlike the brilliant 'The Sixth Sense') but, instead, were met with something quite different.I will not delve into any details about the plot or the characters, since I think it would be better off to approach this film with as little prior knowledge as possible.

That End We Do Not Speak Of,"Like horror movies? Well, ""The Village"" is a scary movie, not a horror film.

A director who has made twist endings and scattered scares his trademark. This movie has his most controversial twist ending to date. I'm sure most people are going to feel angry and tricked after watching it, and this is something Shyamalan should check for reference when he thinks his next plot.Still, you have to praise Shyamalan's imagination and attention to detail. He's the only director in Hollywood now doing something different. His formula may not work all the time, but it entertains at the least.I think the story is very clever, but to many he'll pass as a smart**s.I won't bother to tell you the plot since you'll see it in other reviews.""The Village"" must be the first scary movie I could let children watch without any concerns.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Beautiful, Eerie, and psychologically frustrating","As I was exiting the theatre when the Village ended, I was not happy. It wasn't so much that I was disappointed, but rather that I was annoyed. I expected a ghost story, and what I saw was more of a psychologically themed, semi-thriller, with a lame third act twist that almost turns the Village into two different movies. The second time I viewed it was years later, and somehow, I think I saw it in new light when I realized what Shyamalan was trying to do. The Village is enjoyable if approached a certain way. There is something kind of primal and antique about the nature of the film which is distinctive. It is fairly aesthetic for a horror movie, yet there is the catch. This isn't really a legitimate horror movie, and if you attend it with that mind set, you may be disappointed.Set in late 19th century Pennsylvania, the story takes us to a charming little village in the woods, and introduces us to our prinicle characters. We have Ivy Walker, and her two best friends, Luscious Hunt and Noah, who is a harmless but unstable. The village remains at peace, just as long as no one enters the woods which surround it. Lurking within, are 'Creatures they do not speak of'. At the halfway point a violent incident, leaves Luscious on death's door step. With his condition almost beyond help, Ivy wants to travel through the woods to fetch medicine from 'the towns' on the other side. The Village are seemingly unwilling. There reason's for disliking the towns have remained secret, but now could be the appropriate time to reveal the truth, when lives are at stake.With its beautiful score, and photography and occasionally cute banter, The Village is quite charming, but when it wants to, it can turn quite eerie as well. The film sets itself up well, and as it progresses it gives us an exiting idea of what is to come, and then suddenly, it flips its wheels on us. The twist that Shyamalan throws in at the beginning of the climactic act, almost literally turns the premise of this film into an illusion. It is presented in a way feels sloppy and not very clever.Depending on how you look at it, the twist could be a positive or a negative. Seeing as it spoils the chance for a dramatic climax, I call it a negative. It is clear however, that the Village has something to say about human nature. Shyamalan wants us to ask ourselves, what is it that we choose to do when we are driven to question whether there is any good in life.The village in the end is kind of a morality story. It turns out not to be a bad movie, but it does something that cheats everyone in the audience who goes into the film expecting edge of seat suspense as good as that in Sixth sense or Signs.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Don't Count Him Out Yet,"M. Night Shyamalan made an interesting move in this game of chess also known as the movie business. A lot of us did not catch but those select few did. Think about it..you make a stunning ghost thriller to make a great first impression, you make a crippling movie like Unbreakable to continue that reputation but you put an unlikely cast within it to make it unique. Signs..he throws his thoughts and ideas about the fate of the planet (many would say an H.G. Wells knock-off), and most recently he sends us the village, a more softer dramatic side of his spectrum. This movie and all other movies are put in a specific sequence that I think will all come together to build the end all of all M. Night Shyamalan films. I enjoyed the villages even though a lot of my friends did not, in some way I could connect with a good part of the plot. Therefore like a lot of his movies I've had to watch it a number of times to get the entire 'spoonfull', that message. In my humble opinion I think that Shyamalan did a great job on this movie and he also did a great job of widening the spectrum of his film career. With this film he is saying ""This rabbit hole goes a lot deeper."" Comments/Questions please, I have a feeling there will be a few.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A bunch of people hide out in the woods somewhere.,"I wonder if there isn't a lot of in-breeding going on in this village? Well when a bunch of people decide to cut themselves off from the rest of the world to form their own little community.....well, you do the math.At the risk of appearing to contradict myself, The Village is both boring and interesting at the same time. By this I mean it's boring in it's delivery but has an interesting overall idea. I would describe it as a slow-paced (talkative), mystery-thriller. There was 1 or 2 tense moments during the course of the film but it really doesn't get moving until the very end. This means there is ample time for you to take a few naps or go to the bathroom and stare at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself the meaning of life.So in closing, If you don't mind talk padding your mystery-thriller, then by all means check The Village out. For the rest of you, seeing this movie will probably leave you with ""mixed feelings""; an interesting idea but could have been delivered better, i.e., less talk and more creepy sh*t happening.

"because the buildup to it is thrilling, it works.","The trouble with The Village, as I suspected would be the case is that it's being sold as a horror movie starring Joaquin Phoenix.  Didn't the bro population realize when tiffany didn't jump terrified onto their crotches during Signs that the sixth sense guy doesn't really make horror movies?  He makes M. Night Shyamalan movies, which are a different thing.Now¬Ö the movie was good.  That said, I think you're all going to hate it.Yes it's centered around a huge plot twist AGAIN, like you're hoping.  And yes, I like the twist.  What I like about it is that it prompts discussion afterward, and because it makes you go back and reprocess everything, and because the buildup to it is thrilling, it works.Again an important note is there's a brief maybe ten minutes of the film where you think the twist has happened and there seems to be no point in watching the movie.  In order to survive this part I'll tell you in advance (no spoilers) that the movie flounders (At the point where Michael Pitt chickens out), but sort of recovers when it explains what the deal is.But the problem around this point is it really feels like it's being explained.  And not only that but the plot doubles back in time and has totally unnecessary voice-over bits that really give the feeling of a drunk guy telling a story, leaving an important part out and then going `before I tell this next part, I forgot to tell you that¬Ö'  Then the developments unfold in such a way that the writer's hand is clearly visible, thumping a few really clunky plot devices together and they don't quite fit (for later reference I mean Adrien Brody and what's under the floorboards, for one thing) but when it's over I smile I grin and I walk out of the theater because the twist got me, kind of.So what you know about the plot is that people in the village are afraid of some kind of creatures in the woods.  Now, knowing what you know you'll probably almost start to guess the plot twist correctly¬Ö that's why I said it got me kind of.Of course the other reason it works is because Night is so well-versed in the tricks of the trade.  His moves all give the sense that you're being manipulated in every way imaginable and having a good time at it.  He takes all the tricks, the frustrating camera angles, slow reveals and explosive rack focuses and throws them  all together so that rather than feel cheated you come to enjoy being tricked.  That's the fun of his style.And once again great casting fills in the space left by some of the plot holes.  After this you'll be saying `Joaquin who?'  yeah he's kind of forgettable in the movie but there's this actress, Bryce Dallas Howard (seeming WAY too old to be Ron Howard's daughter) who absolutely knocks it out the park as his blind love interest.   A stellar blind performance: convincing without being cloying and begging for sympathy, yet strong without being a joke.Adrien Brody is in it (who knew?) as the village idiot.  He'll knock your socks off until the plot is in more way more control of the character than the actor is.This is not the best example of what Shyamalan can do, in fact it's his worst so far, but it's valuable because since the plot is so transparent this time around, you can really study how his mind works.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Very Good Film,"I have always enjoyed watching this film. I think the fact that this film does not fit neatly into one genre is what may make it difficult to have overall success with audiences. Not to mention that expectations had spiraled out of control for M Night given his earlier success when released.When people go into a movie immediately trying to solve what the big reveal is going to be based on the directors history, they ultimately end up robbing themselves of a satisfying movie experience.Creepy, visually beautiful, wonderful score, professional acting performances, and a thought provoking conclusion make this a very entertaining film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of the worse movies I have seen this year,"I had a lot of expectation for this movie. With some famous names in the list of actors, I thought it would be a nice movie for a lazy, rainy, Saturday night. But I was wrong, the story is really shallow, the acting is so bad, I cannot remember when was the last time I saw any movie like this.The movie is a fiction, like ""field of dreams"" and if I had this in my mind before watching the movie, I would have given it a 4 or maybe a 5, but as it is now, I can not give it more than 2 very generous stars that's only because I like to see William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver.The idea of the movie is interesting, an Amish like society isolated from the outside world where a group of elders decide about the important issues. An utopia of American dream, where girls and boys become adult and chose their partner and get married and life is as good as you can imagine in a perfect Christian way of living. But as the movie goes on, it looses its strength and becomes a boring un-realistic story.The part that disturbed me most was the scene were Edward Walker (William Hurt) refuses to shake hand with Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver) because he has feeling for her. That reminded me of the meeting of Iraqi deputy prime minister with secretary of State, when he refuses to shake her hand, that was the level of fanatic stupidity promoted by this movie.I am very disappointed at Hurt and Weaver to take part of such a bad movie.

"spooky, but less than the previous Shyamalans","The Village is the newest creation of M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs). It's about an isolated community, living in a small village, late 19th century, complete with long skirts, Shakespearian language and small ordinary houses and grazing cattle in the surrounding fields.At first sight a very peaceful town, but a dark secret is hidden behind this misleading surface. The inhabitants constantly live in fear of 'those we don't speak of'. The tiniest tip of the color red, scares the villagers to death. They do not dare to take one step into the woods, and not one of them would, or should take even one step over the well marked borders of The Village.The new movie of M. Night Shyamalan has all the well known ingredients: surprising turns, an atmosphere that gives you goosebumps and moments where you jump up from your seat. In my opinion, it's a very disturbing story. But there's one thing that I miss: a great climax. This movie never seems to get this highlight. Shyamalan's latest is in the style of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, but in these pictures the ending gets you by surprise, they leave you with your eyes and mouth wide open. The story gets to you piece by piece, sometimes surprising, scaring or horrifying. But it doesn't last. The ending of Shyamalan's other movies left you with some of the surprise, horror, or fear. The Village's ending does none of this.Still, it's a nice movie, as long as it lasts. You're curiosity gets tickled and you only get one piece of the puzzle at a time. If I tell you more, it will ruin the plot of the movie. All I can tell is that it contains a love story, a tale of dubious and clashing moralities. The well known ingredients of Shyamalan's movies I mentioned above, are still an experience. If this is your sort of thing, then this still is a very enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
M. Nights most advanced work yet,"This movie was superb.  For anyone and everyone who liked this Sixth Sense, strap yourselve's in for another two hour mind bending experience.  Bryce Dallas Howard gives an electric performance, not allowing you one moment to look away.  The film is not a horror movie, as it may have been advertised, but rather a suspense.  On a deeper level the movie gives way to hours of thought on society (I'll stop there for fear of giving anything away.)  The camera work was pure genious, M. Night is truely one of the few remaining directors who appreciates the effect a simple camera move can have on the audience.  The story is delightfully sprinkled with bits of humor here and there, and features not only Howard's fantastic performance, but also a great job by Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver.  I would have no problem placing this in the top 3 movies so far this year, and would recommend this film to anyone who is looking to enjoy themselves.  Perhaps the film went over the heads of the general public, or perhaps it will just take some time, but this movie is gold, and eventaully all these nay sayers will realize that.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
underrated.,"It's far from a perfect film, but I have to give it a 10 to combat the mediocre ratings because of a collective bias against M. Night's hit-or-miss films.The twists and reveals aren't as satisfying as those of The Sixth Sense, and there's some unfortunately shoddy editing in the climactic scenes (all those establishing shots of the forest take us out from the tension...)But this movie is my go-to example for how to portray romance. Writers take note. There are various forces that keep the two lovers apart from each other throughout; it's through DISTANCE, rather than through kissing and sex scenes, that keeps the tension strong. and that tension only adds to the thrills.And the violin score is equally thrilling, haunting and gorgeous. One of the most beautifully scored films ever.Does it deserve a 10? No but somewhere between 7.0 - 7.7 would be more fair.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Seems bad at first, until you think a little about it","I waited a couple of days before writing this review. I'm glad I did, because it doesn't seem as bad upon sober second thought as it did after first seeing it. I was even contemplating revealing the surprise ending, so that others didn't have to bother watching this film. But I won't give it completely away.Yes, there is a twist at the end, although the twist pretty much gets revealed about 30-45 minutes from the end. The twist gets fleshed out in more detail from the first revelation to the final ending, and you are even wondering part way through if the twist is the real twist or if there is something even more twisted underneath. I'll let you know your first impression of this twist might be that it is a bit of a letdown.But prior to the revelation of the twist, we have about another hour of character development. It's filled with very idyllic scenes of 19th century American village life. Simple people going about their simple lives. Communal dinners in the outdoors. People socializing with each other. It's almost like watching a documentary -- with scary music that is. I sometimes wonder if Shyamalan isn't really more cut out to do documentaries on simple people; most of his movies have had some scenes of simple peacefulness -- even The Sixth Sense. Really good scenes, and I dare say only Shyamalan could get away with putting such slow-moving scenes into a movie -- because you know that there is going to be a twist at the end which will put this idyllic life into perspective.All I can suggest to you is don't be too disappointed by the ending, it's not as bad as it first seems.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Scenes that are given time to develop. A certain rhythm. Untold mysteries that never quite get explained.And really quite wonderful to see such a powerful performance by William Hurt, who has been missing in action for awhile.Well, if you enjoyed ""Signs"" or ""Sixth Sense"" because you had about given up on film making of that order, you will not be disappointed by ""The Village"".",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Farce, Lunatic Fairy Tale Film.","While watching this film it started to become very apparent to me that M. Night Shyamalan and his cousins he teamed up with to the write this film. They decided to make a film with a great premise of a story line, and take that base idea and subsequently create a series of ideas that changed the first thing they made you believe true; one thing at a time. Just barely enough to make you accept the change and make you want to continue to believe in the original storyline. The only problem with doing it this way was, the writers decided to justify each change after the first with an even more rediculous far fetched Fairy Tale make believe concept than the last.The Village went from A-Z(A being the original great premise and Z being the Stupidest concept of all), and in between it made D, dumber than C, which was more ass-nine and more make believe than B and so on. This film did this from B-Y. Putting twists and changing what the audience is made to believe while watching a film, is something that M. Night Shyamalan has recognizably done before.( The Sixth Sense , Signs ) Which till this film was made moderately acceptable and did not make the film suck monkey balls. When done in excess it made me and all the people I went along with want to walk out multiple times during the film. The Village could easily compare to a bad episode of days of our lives. The only accomplishment in this film was it's absurd ability to make people believe in such a rediculous made up bull-sh*t story. Even more than the biggest one of all.

The Village (2004) **1/2,"After seeing the very good THE SIXTH SENSE and SIGNS, I've come to regard M. Night Shyamalan as the ""Savior of Modern Horror"". He's a brilliant director who takes the offbeat material seriously and always maintains a quality approach to his films. It turns out that THE VILLAGE is not really a bonafide ""horror film,"" though, and it's perhaps best approached with that in mind. I liken it to an overlong TWILIGHT ZONE fantasy television episode that might have been more effective at 30 minutes opposed to its 120.It's beautifully shot with a wholesome feel for the 1800s, and more than a few surprises (the shocking stabbing scene comes to mind). Bryce Howard gives a good performance as the lovestruck blind girl of the story, and William Hurt is strong, too.THE VILLAGE is a flawed movie that isn't on par with THE SIXTH SENSE or SIGNS; it's not a ""great"" film by any means, nor even a ""very good one""... but it works well as a fairytale that plays on people's fears, and I liked that about it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Work of an artist,"To me, three movies from Shyamalan stand above others. The Sixth Sense was scary, Signs was extremely entertaining and finally The Village is a work of audiovisual art and emotion. Rest of Shyamalans movies didn't have as much impact on me, altho I may need to return to Unbreakable one day.There are summer movies, winter movies, and of course spring and autumn movies. The Village is a definite autumn movie, like Hitchcocks The Trouble With Harry. The color scheme is amazing, all the tones of yellow from cold bleak woods to warm light of the candles. Everything accented with dark shadows and occasional reds. This is one of the most beautiful movies to ever hit the screens.The soundtrack is also amazing with the violin played by Hilary Hahn. The sounds are a perfect companion to the cold late autumn visuals. The ""Those we don't speak of"" scene may just be one of the greatest moments on film. The combination of sound and visuals is breathtaking.The story has been bashed many times. In a movie with such powerful artistic touch, I don't see the plot that important, but I also don't see many faults there. There are a few scenes, which may seem a bit ""fantasylike"" and one unnecessary explanation, but despite these, it's a very clever and well thought of story. Shyamalan must have exercised his brain really hard to make the story work, and in my mind he succeeded very well.Even tho there is a twist in the end, the movie is not completely dependent on it, unless you yourself put all emphasis on it. If you do, you may feel a bit let down, because it's not 100 % in your face revelation. If you only expect the movie to drop you off your chair in the end, you will miss a lot, as this is a movie of emotion and subtle nuances.It would be fun to see this movie again, without ever seeing it before and never having heard anything about it. Now I feel the first time I saw it was ruined a bit by all the negative hype. As it is, I find myself returning to this movie at least once a year, even if I know the story already.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Surprising, interesting, subtle character acting.","Lucius (Phoenix) is the shy yet brave blacksmith in The Village, a place trapped by the presence of mysterious creatures in the woods which surround it. The creatures, against which the villagers must always be vigilant, will accept no incursion into their woods. This state of affairs manages both to protect the villagers from the outside world and make their lives within the village slightly more precarious. The only wrinkle in their perfect, crime free existence is the end of the medical supplies from the 'Towns' outside the woods. When a young child's life could have been saved by these medical supplies Lucius decides the time has come to brave the creatures wrath and enter the forest. But will his actions mean the end of the villages' existence in more ways than one?This is an interesting film, which tries to tackle the serious issue of fear as a control and trust in community leadership. How do we create a better world for our children? Serious questions but this film also has a sense of humour.The villagers all seem to make an effort to speak in a forced frontier version of American English. It is not clear whether this is poorly written dialogue or an intentional jarring to make you realize that there is something unnatural about the villagers and their cut-off way of life.The romance between Phoenix and Howard is the most absorbing part of the film; it is a real pleasure to watch the quiet Lucius and Tom-boy Ivy developing their relationship and eventually their actions lead to the films finale. Phoenix seems to have cornered the market on vulnerable insecure men emerging as leaders and Howard is just wonderful as the strong and independent Ivy.Some scenes don't reach the intensity the director was aiming for, but still the sentiment behind them is obvious. I found myself having to actively force my suspension of disbelief on some points, and the film could quite easily become unintentionally funny if you let it, this is especially so of our first sight of the creatures. If you go expecting a pioneer version of Predator or Alien you will probably be disappointed, but if you go looking for a gentle drama, well acted with a few boo scares along the way and some subtle insights into society you will enjoy this film.If you liked The Others, Cold Mountain or Signs this film is for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

M. Night Shyamalan Does It AGAIN!!,"*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind BuyM. Night Shyamalan has built his career on a simple formula. First, set up the main plot and suspense. Second, have an event that changes the tone of the film and sets it in a new direction. Third, end with a twist that forces the audience to rethink everything they had just seen. This formula has been applied to Shyamalan's past three films and is the foundation of his storytelling. Of course, The Village is no different. The film follows the formula to a tee and is at the same time astounding and original.The Village is about a small community in 1860's Pennsylvania whose citizens live in constant fear of mystical creatures that live in the woods surrounding them. The townspeople have a simple and longlasting agreement with the creatures 'do not to come to our village, we will not come to your woods.' However, when Lucius Hunt takes it upon himself to explore the village's boundaries the creatures decide to explore their own boundaries. The end result is a film that is hardly frightening but all the more shocking. Night adds more twists than in his previous work and even manages to blow all his other films out of the water.As I said before, Night's formula consists of three parts. The second part of his formula, in which there is a shocking moment at the halfway point that changes the tone of the rest of the film, is more present in The Village than ever. The Sixth Sense had the famous, ""I see dead people"" scene. Unbreakable had the weight lifting sequence, and Signs had the Brazilian home video sequence. The moment in The Village that changed the direction of the film was brilliant. I won't elaborate for fear of saying too much but that particular moment had me in a state of shock for a good ten to fifteen minutes. The rest of the film is just as gripping and Shyamalan's signature twist is not quite as genius as The Sixth Sense but is still mind blowing.Signs used the story of an alien invasion as a backdrop to tell the tale of a man regaining his faith in God. The Village is somewhat of a love story at heart, although the love story is not nearly as ""in your face"" as the faith story from Signs. Instead, the love story acts more like a subplot that drives the character's actions. This made the film much more enjoyable than the massively entertaining Signs.Overall, The Village is the fourth consecutive reason why M. Night Shyamalan is one of the the most talented filmmakers around. Night has proved himself as a genius storyteller and I am looking forward to whatever he brings us next. I give it ***** as The Village is the very definition of a ""blind buy"". Undoubtedly, many people will hate it. It is, like his previous works, a love it or hate it kind of film and I happen to be one that loved it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Village of the Dumb,"I never thought, in all my years, I would see a film that stirred as much loathing as my #1 Most Hated Movie of all time: Armaggedon. Yet M. Night Shaymalan has done just that with the creation of this insulting twaddle of a film.Shaymalan, who brought us genius in ""The Sixth Sense"", and suspense and tension in ""Signs"", takes a shallow run at the concept of an 18th century haunted village (done so well in films such as Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow""). Unlike Burton's film, however, Shaymalan's is boring, cliched, and unendearing, and that's only up until the big ""plot twist"" towards the end. Then the film turns downright stupid and, yes, insulting to the audience.What separates ""Village"" from other, routinely bad movies, is it is wrapped in fine cinematography, lighting, costumes, and other marks of a good film. Plus it was promoted to a certain caliber of audience, not your typical teen slasher flick. So it was supposed to be a ""quality, thought-provoking film"". Yet it is not, it borders on the ridiculous that would only be believable to those with the mind of an eight-year-old.Shaymalan must regard his audience with contempt to have created such a despicable piece of work.

It actually made me jump, the explanation was backed up sufficiently well (I believed the back-filling - in an eccentric storybook style, anyway), and the second revelation was quite spooky (the first was a little pathetic for anyone not living a Brothers Grimm tale). Even the touch of sending the blind girl out was well done.

M. Night Shyamalan's last decent film (in my opinion),"The Indian auteur burst onto the scene with the classic 'The Sixth Sense' and followed it up with the equally impressive 'Unbreakable.'

Those expecting a straight out horror film will be disappointed. And anyone hoping for bucket loads of blood and guts will be sorely disappointed. The Village is a slower affair, moody and well-shot as a group of people refuse to leave their village for fear of the creatures who live in the woods all around them.Perhaps The Village could be best described as a 'love story,' as the relationship between Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix is central to the story.The film boasts an impressive cast, all of whom play there parts subtly and with great understatement, all of which adds to the overall creepy, isolated environment.It's very possible to enjoy this movie, but only if you're in the mood for something a little more subtle. It's a slow burner if ever there was one, well shot, well acted and often overlooked. Give it a go if you're up for something a little different.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
is separation from everyday life more of a state of mind?,"We have faced the enemy and find it to be ourselves.The movie thrusts you into the apparent tranquility of a remote ante-bellum 19th century Pennsylvania village. The villagers are celebrating a communal feast and then you hear it the howl from the woods just outside the clearing. Exactly what forces of darkness are out there in the forrest that make the villagers avoid the color red and use a beigish-tan as a protected color.The movie spirals into the nature of the threat and the secret past identity of the elders, the adult villagers.The film is well recommended for its occasional cinematical brilliance in moments of tension, fear and surprise, but I think errs on one point, very perilously close to its central premise: If one transported 21st century people back to the tranquility of an era of good feeling prior to the civil war, wouldn't they be 21st century people in costume transplanted anti-modernists rather than 19th century people? Think on it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Alternative.,"Of all the criticism if the village most of it centres around the idea of a poor twist... well, what would you rather?... that the creatures were a sort of reimagining of little-red-riding-hood, with a role reversal a-la little red is gone and a group of beasts exist in her stead?... i admit that is interesting but i can't see a bunch of critters sustaining this film. It's gratifying that the revisiting of long-held poor reviews are being modified.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Good atmospheric thriller,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Village"" (2004) was probably the last good movie from M. Night Shyamalan, after near masterpiece ""The Sixth Sense"", and terrific movies ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"". It is not as good as those three movies, but it's a damn good atmospheric / drama thriller with some twists along the way. There are couple of twists in this movie, and watching this movie back in 2004 in cinema (i was a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan at that moment) i was hugely disappointed by first twist, but the second (and last) was amazing - didn't see that coming for sure.Acting is good in this movie, with Bryce Dallas Howard best performance (period) and strong supportive acting by the great Joaquin Phoenix. The whole cast is great in here, and although not everyone received opportunity to shine, they all did a pretty good job in my opinion. Direting is good, but movie drags a bit there and there mainly because of script - it is good but inconsistent.The best part of this movie is in its atmosphere, which is created beautifully here (superb sound design (picture has to be seen with the best possible sound system) and good cinematography). There are some great suspenseful scenes as well - kudos to great direction in those scenes.Overall, ""The Village"" has problems with pacing, but overall experience is very positive. It's best parts are not in conversations (which drags a bit due to script), but in overall mood and some great suspenseful scenes as well as feeling that something isn't right in here and question ""who or what is behind this all"". When all questions will be answered, some of them are very disappointing, but most of them will force you re-think and probably re-watch this movie twice - and it is worth seeing it more than once (but two times will be definitely enough).",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Everything was good except the reveal,"The Village was deep, thoughtful movie with effective dialogue. Movie had proper drama and suspense. The camera and music work were effective. The actors did their jobs in a perfect manner. You can connect with them. The direction was also good, the director created spooky dark environment that you can feel.The only problem I had with this movie was that the suspense reveal was too blank. The way and the manner it was reveal, the effectiveness of suspense faded too fast.Overall, it is a nice movie that you will enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
where's the love?,"There are films that come out that live up to all the hype and leave you with such a lasting impact that your somehow changed by them. The Village is that type of film to. The Village is the 3rd horror/thriller from writer/director M.Night Shyamalan following his mega hit ""Signs"". Well after The Village came out I noticed a strange pattern to Shyamalan's film...he makes the more mainstream film then he follows it up with a more personal artistic thriller that the public never quite gets. Well this pattern was proved correct so far when The Village didn't live up to the hype that was set by Signs. Is that Shyamalan's fault that the average person isn't smart enough to get his more personal artistic thriller? You damn right it is. If this film is too smart for you people then go watch Charlie's Angels or something because your official brain dead.Script wise...God,Shyamalan is my hero here. Not only is he a master story teller but he makes me(a person who really hates dramas) really dig the drama of the film. This isn't your standard thriller, this is a more dramatic classic horror story then a thriller. This film is about characters...not the damn creatures. The creatures serve the plot but...they are NOT the plot. That's important. Here we grow to know the people in the village and understand them and their fears. It's that understanding of the characters that gives the film it's REAL TERROR. If you don't spend time with the characters and get to care about them...then what's the point of putting them in danger when we don't even care. Hollywood makes so many horror movies. They make film after film with stick figure characters that get put through hell that you only really watch to see them die. Here Shyamalan crafts a perfect tale of love and then tests that love put putting it through terror. This film is about humanity and how they are willing to deal with things beyond their control. The characters here are so well written and the story so well played out that you just can't help but to love it. Then there's the spoken words... god, they're so poetic that it's gives the film a real fair tale feel that takes this film to a whole other level. To hear the characters talk is just amazing to hear...it's masterful. I loved hearing every line and I never wanted the film to end. Then I really loved the way the film was structured. This film has it's own of telling it's story and of back tracking so you understand what's going much better. What I also liked was the morals of the film...the Elders of the village started the village to get away from the horror of society but human natured proved that the horror they thought they left behind still found them. It's amazing to watch.Cast wise...Oh my god. Talk about an all star cast. And I just don't mean because they're big name actors...no it's because they're all great actors and bring real class to the film. First you have the star, Bryce Dallas Howard, and I do mean star...not only because she stars in this film, but because she carries this whole film. She's the daughter of former TV star and award wining director Ron Howard...but here Bryce breaks the hold by being a real actress and not just a girl who's trying to act just because her Dad is famous. Here, Bryce brings so much to her role as Ivy Walker that with just a movement of her eyes she can send your heart beating. God, she's an amazing actress and is so natural with the setting.She has this down to earth personality that you really care about and cheer for. Give me an hour and a half with Bryce and you can keep your slutty Lohan and big butt J Lo. I'd rather watch a real actress any day. Joaquin Phoenix is great as always and really under plays his own personality and gives the character of Lucius a real sense of reality that never goes away. Another thing I like is that the actors brought so much to their characters then I'm sure was in the script. Another great surprise was Adrien Brody who plays the ill Noah Percy who through out the film is amazing. At first glance you think he's just playing the village crazy but if you really pay attention you'll see there is more to his craze then what meets the eye. There's a reason why he acts the way he does and when it's revealed...it's amazing.Directing wise...wow.Shyamalan delivers more than I ever thought he could. He delivers a lot of movement to the camera and a voyeur way of shooting that makes us feel more personal with the film. This film is master story telling at it's best. Shyamalan really keeps up the amazing script with an even more amazing way of telling the story. There's there's the SINGLE SHOT scenes that left me in awe. God, talk about amazing. They were done so well that we felt the same danger that many of the characters felt. Not only does he use the camera to tell the story but he also uses every trick in film make it to use it to tell an even better film. There some scenes were everything goes silent and with the film's directing...it impacts you harder.Shyamalan is the first director I've seen to really use sfx to his talent.At the end of the film, I was left with an impact in my deepest core. I LOVE THIS FILM. This film is the type of film I want to make. This film is the bar for me and if I could make a film just half as good then I could die a happy film maker.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disapointment,"Boy,it is hard to make a post, with my firewall going up all the time some jerk must be trying to hack me.  Anyways, that is besides the point.  The guy who wrote and directed this film, I believe it is an East Indian name that I can't spell, has a bad tendency of writing films that have great previews, but disappointing endings with no conclusions.  Another film like signs.  The story dragged, and the characters were over evolved.  This would be a great short story, but not a full feature film.  The movie is plausible.  Maybe, they should have an aftermath at the end of this film. Like Signs were the aliens could not open doors, but travel from another planet the Village is another hard too digest film.

The Emperor's New Clothes,"Much has been said already so I shall be brief. This film made me immensely sad - which, in a way, was a good thing because it was all that prevented me from falling asleep with probably the severest attack of boredom I have experienced whilst watching a film. I was sad at the thought of a magnificent cast being so wasted, and because this subcontinental director of undoubted talent who could produce films like ""The Sixth Sense"", which I never tire of seeing again and again, and the lesser masterpiece, ""Unbreakable"" should turn out such pretentious rubbish as this and ""Signs"" (whose star also has the irritating tendency of taking himself too seriously).The film is a fine example of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" of the H.C.Andersen story. Self-styled intellectuals patiently enduring the pedestrian unfolding of the plot at somewhat less than the speed of a Japanese tea ceremony, can see all manner of portentous and significant things invisible to more modest eyes like my own. It is as when a talented and competent painter finds he can get ahead better by squeezing a tube of Chinese white on a plain dark blue canvas instead of sticking to his original technically and inspirationally demanding style appreciated by the man-in-the-street. Though this strategy, if strategy it be, appears ,quite deservedly, not to have been a commercial success for Shamalyan.I was especially sorry for the wonderful Adrien Brody, perhaps even sorrier than when he was being brutalized by the Nazis (except for one nice officer) in Polanski's ""The Pianist"". But, in a way, this actor disclaimed any responsibility for this fiasco by playing the village idiot! However, I should imagine that most if not all of the cast secretly wish they had never had anything to do with it.I give the thing 3/10 stars: one out of respect for the misused cast and the talented but ill-advised director; one for the highly competent technical side of the production; and one for the music which was nominated for an award and, as befits a good soundtrack,does not impinge upon the consciousness of the viewer even when he is dozing off.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A let down,"Within 10 to 15 minutes I knew exactly how the movie was going to end! I spent the rest of the movie hoping and praying that I was wrong and we would get something really good. Nope,I was right! The Village isn't a bad movie,just a disappointment.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shyamalan improves.  Satisfying thriller.,"Shyamalan has grown as a storyteller, this is not just the surprise twist, it is a real, fleshed-out story, in the tradition of the Bronte sisters. The Village has several (what I have grown to call) ""Shyamalans"", or surprise twists.The first is the head-kicker, and while I consider myself a very jaded movie-goer, I was very surprised.But the rest tie the story up very satisfyingly. I'll admit, the final ""Shyamalan"" was obvious to me, but still, it's rare I see a movie that ends so fulfillingly.Well worth the price of admission.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The better one from Shyamalan.,"This is one of the better movies from director M. Night Shyamalan, a story about a 19th century village whose close-knit community believes terrifying evil creatures lurk and roam the woods near their homes at night. However, courageous Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) has a curiosity that got the best of him and plans to step beyond the boundaries of the town and into the woods to find the truth behind these creatures.While known for his gloomy and dreary-looking movies with emotionless acting, Shyamalan breathed some life in this picture, providing some attention-grabbing scenes, suspense, and mystery to keep you entertained. It makes you eager to learn the truth behind the creatures and what the plot twist unfolds in this unpredictable story. The eerie sceneries makes you feel you are at the village itself, anxiously waiting to see what the dark woods hide beyond the town.The acting is pretty good, coupled with some good character development and substance, making the cast of characters believable and alive. Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt and Adrien Brody are among the cast members, each delivering some solid performances to the on-screen drama.The plot flows at a steady pace, but with the added tension and suspense, this movie is an exciting piece of work.Grade B",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Enjoyable, but it slips a bit...","I just finished my third viewing of ""The Village"" and noticed some things that may have gotten by me before. Having seen all of M.Night Shyamalan's films, it seems that you don't so much watch an M.Night Shyamalan movie as much as you become a voyeur of it. There is something very intimate about the way he crafts his movies that is very personal. This is one of the joys of watching his movies.Some have complained that this movie didn't have a big shocker ending like Shyamalan is noted for; perhaps not, but who cares. The Village has such a rich atmosphere and full performances, that's as good a reason to see a movie as any, I think. No story details here, as I've no desire to rehash what's already been said; I will say that it may not be a perfect story, but it is a good story, let it stand on its own, and maybe poke us in the ribs a little about the consequences of the choices we make.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A masterpiece and Shyamalan's best so far,"This movie is for you if you, like me, loved Signs. These two movies are very much alike, especially if you compare them to The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Of Shyamalan's movies I saw Signs first and I was impressed with how he makes you think he's telling you a story about Aliens and corn circles and it's really about something else. (Trying not to give anything away here) The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable seemed kind of simple after that. Yeah, they were nice to watch, they had their twist endings but they just didn't have that emotional side I like so much about Signs.But now let's get to The Village. From the trailers I didn't really expect to see a movie like Signs, I was more expecting a Sleepy Hollow kind of experience. Boy was I wrong. Sure, it's creepy and it works much better at keeping suspense up than some people want to make you believe. But there's much more to this movie.First of all I've got to say that when watching The Village it was the first time since I don't know when that I felt I was watching a piece of art, not just a flick that wants to entertain. The images Shyamalan shows us are just beautiful. The colors, the composition are right away amazing. At some points in the film I actually felt like I was watching a painting come alive. What also adds to the art is the music. If you are at all interested in classical music or movie scores you will not be able to get this solo violin out of your head. When I first heard it I knew I had to get my hands on that score.OK, so the movie is presented in a nice way. But is it any good? Yes it is. It is IF (and I can't stress this if enough) you liked Signs, you don't want to see exactly what the trailer seems to promise and you don't mind slow films. 'Cause slow it is. Not in a bad way though. Shyamalan just takes his time to build up his characters and to create an authentic almost tangible atmosphere. In that he's supported by a great cast, especially Phoenix and Howard. Phoenix is good as usual but Howard just blew my mind. They start you off into a story that begins as a horror movie but then evolves into something far deeper and far more emotional. And if you let that happen to you, if you don't just sit there and wait to be scared you will really love this movie.I give it a 10 out of 10 because Shyamalan totally achieves what he tried to do in this film. You just shouldn't think it's about scares and twists.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Now, that said, there is definitely a fair amount of good ""original"" ideas, and the movie does work, even if only for 15 minutes.All in all, it's a stark social commentary, and thats all. Not up to the standards that M.Night has set for himself...this movie could have been a ton better if he'd have spent a bit more time on the script.On the bright side, Hurt was great, Phoneix was good, and Howard definitely has some potential.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Interesting thought on why societies are created...,"Watching this movie going in, I had no preconceived notions. I read a small plot summary and that was it. Nowadays I kinda stay OFFa if I don't want to know much of a movie going in...This movie for me started off a little odd. The way the characters spoke in the beginning of the movie sounded quite a bit off. Ivy, declaring her love for Lucius rather foolishly, and some of the playful interactions of the multitude of younger characters put me off greatly at first. However, that is a HUGE point of the movie that is discussed later on.This isn't meant to be a horror movie, even if it is built upon the foundations of one. Mysterious creatures live in the woods just beyond the borders of this almost Amish, 19th century village. Or do they? The ""elders"" of this community all have something in common though, which you find out later when the origins of the town are discussed. And one of their ""rules"" is to never go into the forest. You can probably make out where this is headed.Without spoiling too much, the innocence of the townfolk seems a little TOO contrived. But when the pieces of the puzzle are put together, certain things like the absence of money, the isolation (seemingly) from the rest of the world and the rather playful and simplistic values of the villagers seems... It makes you think for a moment ""ah, if life could almost REALLY be like this. Hope, love and joy."" Is it NOT a utopia that many would see brought to the forefront?Except the creatures. But they aren't the real problem here; what IS the overwhelming issue is what is not known or discussed with the villagers. There was a TV show on once about a last remnant of humanity that was put to cryo sleep and awakened 4000 years in Earth's future... Without revealing anything, secrets often betray far worse issues than the ones seemingly most apparent.Overall, the ending becomes somewhat revolutionary, with further details giving you ""aha!"" moments throughout the film's final 25 or so minutes. And then once you ""get it,"" all falls into place rapidly, as long as you have been paying attention and letting the ""facts"" stack themselves up. It's kinda like watching Star Wars Episode 4, 5 and 6, and then by the time you get back around to 1, 2, and 3, on Episode 3 you KNOW what's going to happen because you've SEEN it in episode 4. Shymalan's brilliant storytelling mirrors the way Lucas chose to approach the entire Star Wars universe by starting the story practically in the middle. This isn't exactly on the same lines, but you get the idea. Memento utilized that ideology in reverse, and good storytellers can hook you in from the beginning, middle OR end. Though simplistic, I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.Will probably have to go back and watch it again to see even more ""aha!"" moments...",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not that predictable...,"A friend of mine, who belongs to the Brandywine Conservancy, invited me along to enjoy the private screening of The Village. Free food and drinks were thrown in - so how could I refuse. As for the movie, I honestly expected M. Night to provide a surprise (just as he does with all of his films) - but in reality - he delivered a number of surprises, especially after the first act gets underway. Joaquin Phoenix is on his way to becoming an intense presence on screen ¬ñ not quite like his role in Gladiator ¬ñ but in a more silent, deep-seated, moody aura ¬ñ which worked well with the films rather tranquil, but unnerving environment. In all, the movie takes you on a well-woven plot that actually twists at some very unexpected places, which made me take a step back and attempt to stop assuming what the ending may be like, and simply enjoy the story for what it was ¬ñ a 'story'. There was a strong tapestry of characters and scenes that held each and every moment together, tightly, so there was really no room for error. All of the acting was top notch, and was delivered with impeccable performance. There was not one person in that cast who did not offer a hint or two, just to keep the story surprising and worthwhile. In fact ¬ñ I can't wait for the DVD to show up on Amazon - so that I can freeze certain frames just to catch some of the hints and tips that were offered throughout the movie.

"easily one of the most misleading movies of 2004...still it is a ""good"" movie","after leaving the theatre I always try and gather my feelings,thoughts,emotions, etc, so I can have a better idea about what the movie did, or did not have to say. after watching M. Night's third big horror film I was relieved I saved for this movie and not ""white castle"". I have no doubt that it IS a funny movie, but I only had 7 bucks and I would rather watch a ""film"" than a ""movie"". The Village has few truly scary moments in it that would make you shrink in you're seat, but what is there is honestly frightening. yes there are shock moments in the movie, loud noises when something on screen flashes by for .05 seconds.The creatures themselves are oddly designed, rather shoddy looking in some shots, however when you see the film frame-to-frame you understand why they look so shoddy. but they are very bulky and menacing, and actually made me wish that I didn't take the front row seat because I was a bit too close to the screen for my own comfort. I will admit that I was disappointed when certain facts were brought to light....then drawn back....then brought back into light again. the movie is so misleading that at times you feel like a yo-yo that M. Night has his hands on, and he is walking the freakin dog! the forest itself is the most frightening aspect of the film, with branches twisting in odd skeletal shapes, and fog shrouded areas looming every which way. a few actors really stand out after the lights go up in the theatre. mainly Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy, and a very notable performance by William Hurt as Ivy's father. Joaquin is a very handy actor and I see him in other movies with bigger names in the director chair, but here he gives an awkward stoic kind of banality that I really did not care for.the movie's message is very noble and it's notions should be carefully examined and to a much lesser extent be practiced by people. of course there will be a twist at the end...this is Shyamalan for godsake! it is surprising if you haven't seen his films, and run of the mill if you have. 3/4 stars sounds good to me =).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
There was a better story here.,"M. Night Shyamalan earned his way into the consciousness of the American moviegoer by stylizing the twist ending on the big screen. His movies play out like an extended version of Rod Sterling's Twilight Zone. This comparison goes beyond the surprise endings. Both contain themes exploring the complexity of human nature in the midst of tense and often mysterious situations. This review will contain no spoilers, but I will talk about the ending in general terms.People who watch this movie for the twist ending will be disappointed. First of all, it is quite predictable. Also, it plays out very gradually, rather than just hitting you in one, climactic moment. It's just not very logically or emotionally satisfying either. This does not make it a bad movie, however since Shyamalan's reputation is largely built on his endings, this will probably end up hurting the movie at box office. I'm still going to recommend the movie, however. But, this recommendation will come with the warning that you will likely leave the movie theater saying to yourself or your companions that, ""There was a better story here.""The acting is fine. The supporting cast is great, but the movie is basically all supporting cast. Joaquin Pheonix and Bryce Dallas Howard share a staring role, but there is no Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson character in The Village. But, the characters are interesting. The pieces you get of their stories makes you yearn for more. But Shyalaman is too wrapped up in his reputation to stop to satisfy this yearning. His tricks are becoming tiresome. When you go to the theater, take note of the moments where the audience (if there is one) reacts the most. Observe if they are reacting to the moment on the screen or the juiced up volume of a sound effect after a period of extended silence.M. Night Shyamalan is certainly a capable director. He is an artful creator of atmosphere. He also has a skill for pacing and I happen to enjoy the casts he selects for his characters. It's time for him to prove that he can bring a bit more to the table than a few cheap scares and a shock ending. You won't hate this movie, but you will be disappointed.2/5",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Land That Diegesis Forgot,"Should you praise a film merely for being well made? Craftsmanship should be admired, but is it enough? You can praise ""The Village"" for its crisp images, its atmospheric music, its acting, but films are about stories and if a story is badly written or dull, does the rest matter?I think they do matter. And much of the acting in this film is worth noting. In particular, Adrien Brody and Bryce Dallas Howard are very watchable. And the score by James Newton Howard was Oscar nominated. It features the superb playing of Hilary Hahn.The review by Roger Ebert really takes this film to task. And the core of his criticisms, I think, is a story that lacks cohesion. I do think many viewers will anticipate the twists before they happen. And some will look for metaphors where they do not exist. Director and writer M. Night Shyamalan has created a mystery that, when revealed, will disappoint some. But he has also created some very interesting characters. If only they populated a story that was worthy of them.In the end, the suspense and the mystery dissolve like a tapestry made of cotton candy, and the hoped-for value message spends like a bag of rocks.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Very Truly Underrated for Drama, maybe Overrated for Horror Movie","If you expect this movie will get you horrified or maybe show you some brutal monsters and scenes, then put this movie away. It won't do any good for you. Many movies have been there for you, like Alien Vs Predator, Fredy Vs Jason, Texas Chainsaw. But if you want to see a good, clever and well-crafted drama (maybe with some horror part, but don't get it as the main part), then give this movie a try. Many reviews had been given for this movie, and most of them gave low rating. Maybe this rating is given based on expectation this movie will be the same as previous M Night's one 'The Sixth Sense'. Watch this film with no expectation as the next 'Sixth Sense', you will find this film is a great drama film. Also great Music, Cast and Cinematography.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"sooo disappointing, and not a surprising end at all!","I quite liked The Sixth Sense, although when I watched again aftera few years, I was quite disappointed because it is told very slowlyand dwells on forever. Well, this one is MUCH worse. It's boring. It totally foreseeable - Ihave no clue how anybody could be surprised by the (very silly)end! - it's a very bad film. Good actors, but the story is very weak,the whole setting is completely overdone and the music anddialogue are very bad, too. What I found most irritating is that the suspense is broken everytime right after a situation has been created. I wont give examplesin order not to spoil the little that's left of the film for people whohaven't seen it yet, but let's say something happens while the girlis in the forest. It's meant to be scary and puzzling. Apart from thefact that it's very easy to see right through it anyway, it's evenexplained the very next minute by telling what happens in thevillage at the same time. Ever heard of suspense?

An excellent film!,"I loved this movie! The tone and mood were staged beautifully. Without knowing where your headed at first you get swept up into a fantastic story that keeps you guessing throughout and until the end. I loved the characters, and felt for them every step of the way. The tensions was just right without overpowering the plot. And I did not expect what the twist would be, but it was amazing. It really makes you think. But I was very satisfied, as I believe everyone will be after seeing this movie. (That is if their not just going in for a cheap thrill. Which is unfortunately what some people expect after having seen The Sixth Sense. And that's a shame because M. Night Shymalan is a great story crafter.)

Bryce Dallas Howard has to be one of the worst actors,"Bryce Dallas Howard has to be one of the worst actors ever. She plays a blind person with zero sign of afflicted eyes. And the way she delivered dialogue was like hearing someone read off the page on stage in a bad school play. They pretty much all played it like a bad school play. Hurt was best and Bryce was the worst. Bryce didn't even bother to try to convince us she is actually blind.Bad acting always affects my view of a movie. The premise was interesting, but not sure it was enough to rewatch. I like the idea of how easy it is to keep a large group of people obedient based on a lie. I just don't think M. Night maximized his potential.M. Night's films tend to be too slow and not enough pay off. Sixth Sense was the exception. This could have easily been cut down by 20 minutes. Just not enough happened to justify almost two hours. M. Night needs to raise the stakes more in his films. It's too much reality TV ""announcing the winner"" long-drawn-out moments. Get to the point quickly and then add more points.Too bad it was mostly a bore-fest because like I said, the premise was good and would have been great if he added more events and drama that led somewhere with people we actually cared for.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Innocence, character and love shine through much more than any kind of ""horror"".","There were things that I liked about this film, such as the portrayal of an 1800's lifestyle, the forthrightness of the characters and the care that members of the Village had for each other. Bryce Howard as Ivy is a definite role model for young women to see. I think that the positive message of her strength of character outweighs the concerns about scary parts of the movie for teenage (actually preteen) girls. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. The cast of more experienced actors was excellent. William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson, Celia Weston, Cherry Jones all played their parts with a believability and dignity that made the film shine. The musical score added to the enjoyment and contributed to the sense of time and place.

"Not a masterpiece, but well executed and better than they want you to believe","After a seemingly invincible double hit consisting of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, M. Night Shyamalan hit a slightly false note with Signs, which is quite good but was strongly criticized nonetheless, mostly for its admittedly weak ending. The Village seems to continue in that direction, at least according to the majority of critics (Roger Ebert's review was particularly harsh). The reason I said ""seems"" is because The Village is a competent, enjoyable movie - not a masterwork, and occasionally less accomplished than Signs, but still undisputed proof of Shyamalan's gift as a storyteller.What sets this film apart from those preceding it is the setting: the titular village is located somewhere in Pennsylvania, and the date is the 19th Century. The village, inhabited by the elders, their children and grandchildren, is surrounded by woods, and no one is allowed to enter them. Why? Because the woods are supposedly populated by Those We Do Not Speak Of, some kind of monstrous breed that won't attack the villagers unless directly provoked. They occasionally show up after dark, and they're repulsed by the color red.Among the people living in the village who deserve to be mentioned are Lucius Fox (Joaquin Phoenix), a brave young man who doesn't fear the creatures like everyone else, and Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), a blind girl with whom he has a special bond. When Lucius suddenly falls ill (to reveal more would spoil the fun), Ivy volunteers to travel to the city to find medicine, unafraid of defying whatever's hiding in the woods. Amongst the general protest, her father (William Hurt) expresses his approval with a cryptic phrase that gains significance as the story progresses.A slow start notwithstanding, Shyamalan manages to create a sense of quiet dread very quickly, thanks to expert use of camera angles, cinematography, and of course James Newton Howard's tunes. Subtly evoking The Wicker Man with its atmosphere, The Village drags the viewer into a different world, an uncontaminated society devoid of any real evil. In that sense, the film is a clever twist on the utopia genre: generally, these worlds exist in the future, not the past.However, that's not the kind of twist we expect from the director, and that's where the film's major disappointment reveals itself: the usual shocking final revelation is practically spoon-fed to the audience halfway through, not to mention delivered as flatly as is humanly possible. This does detract from the twist's impact, but it doesn't diminish its intelligence: taken on its own, it's worth comparing to the endings of Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.Then there's the cast, another partial misfire: although Hurt is warm and reassuring, Brendan Gleeson and Sigourney Weaver have practically nothing significant to do in the film, and Adrien Brody's demented role is nothing but a contrived plot device. On the flip-side, Phoenix is very good (the scene where Lucius tells Ivy how he feels about her is the most touching tender moment Shyamalan's filmed), and Howard, cast without an audition after the director saw her in a stage play (he didn't know she was related to former Happy Days star Ron Howard), is mesmerizing: playing her first major part without much experience (a few cameos in her dad's movies don't really count), she portrays Ivy as good-hearted and a little naive but never stupid, which is why she manages to hold the entire second half of the picture on her shoulders pretty much flawlessly.Bottom line: quit nagging about the ending. As I said in my review of The Sixth Sense, a good conclusion is no big thing if the overall movie disappoints. Well, the opposite applies too: a sub-par epilogue doesn't completely ruin an otherwise fine film.7,5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Beautifully filmed, with an interesting story","I sometimes wonder if M. Night Shymalan has directed himself into a corner after a strong start.  Since `The Sixth Sense', audiences have been expecting his films to all be of the same genre, and while his succeeding films have had an underlying theme of the supernatural, he seems to have lost the confidence of the general movie-going public.  I think that this is in part due to this nagging feeling I get that he has a lot of self-satisfaction with his work, essentially saying `Look how clever I can be¬Ö see it? See it?'  But even more so, I firmly believe, with all due respect to said general movie-going public, that not every film of his is going to have a huge `twist' in the end, or `Boo!' moments that are going to scare us into nervous laughter ¬ñ and most importantly, he doesn't purport to do this with all of his films; it is simply the vast chasm between audience expectation and director's intent.`The Village', Shymalan's latest offering, is the tale of a small 19th century village whose residents live with the daily threat of the unknown creatures which dwell in the woods that border it.  There is a `truce' between the residents of these two areas; as long as the villagers don't breach their border, the creatures will leave them alone.  One day, however, after the death of a young boy, a young man from the village, Lucius Hunt, (Joaquin Phoenix) after many pleas to the village elders to go through the woods to one of the surrounding towns in order to get medicine to prevent future loss of life.  The next day, red marks appear on the door, and the village's animals turn up dead and shorn; presumably, the creatures in the woods are not happy and are declaring `war' on the village.Shymalan favors a sullen, emotionally pained and quiet protagonist, and `The Village' follows this trend.  Phoenix is all large eyes, slightly stooped and silent, while maintaining a large amount of strength and character.  His love interest, Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of the unofficial mayor of the village, (Bryce Dallas Howard) is probably the most heroic figure of the film, however, and is definitely the most compelling character.  Much has been said of Howard's performance, and the accolades are most definitely warranted.  Adrien Brody has a small but important role as Noah, basically the village idiot, and while he speaks very little, Brody's acting is once again unreal.  I have admired him since seeing `Summer of Sam' years ago, and he his talent has only strengthened.  I didn't even hate William Hurt, which I fully expected to do, just because I find him to be so unbelievably bland.  The films he appears in are generally good, but his lack of any kind of dynamic is disappointing.  As Edward Walker in `The Village', however, he is not horrid.    The production values and cinematography in `The Village' really are quite good ¬ñ Roger Deakins, who I have greatly admired since his first collaboration with the Coen brothers on Barton Fink, really is a master in his field.  His lighting and photography are fantastic in this film, and, as a friend said to me on the drive home from the theater, `¬Öthe film was really beautiful.'I went into this film having seen some really bad reviews, but the ones that gave me pause were positive reviews by other critics that I highly respect. I noticed that several of the negative reviews disdainfully compared `The Village' to Shymalan's earlier film, `Unbreakable.'  I'm sure it was not the reviewers' intent, but this actually made me want to see this film more, because I think that `Unbreakable' was a fantastic film, but that it was a box office disappointment because it was not a clone of `The Sixth Sense'. Mainstream audiences were expecting another scare-fest, and they got Bruce Willis again, but this time as a sad, beaten-down superhero of some sorts. I found `Unbreakable' to be a very personal and endearing film, and I attribute a lesser degree of those adjectives to `The Village'.  It was not a phenomenal film, but it was certainly not a disappointment.  The story was solid and kind of left me with the `Hmmm¬Öinteresting' sentiment that I take away from good episodes of `The Outer Limits' or `Twilight Zone'.  The now-expected `twist' was visible by about 2/3 into the film, but who cares? It was still a good story, and the film, while more of a drama than a thriller/horror offering is a solid movie that I feel deserves a lot more credit than it has been given.  I'm glad that I didn't let some bad reviews mar my viewing experience because I went into the film with an open mind and came out generally satisfied.--Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""M. Night is ""Smilin"" all the way to he bank......better than Sominex, and funny too!!","I hadn't seen any of M. Night Smilin's (as in ""smilin all the way to the bank!) movies since ""The Sixth Sense"" - which was very overrated - and now I remember why. I grabbed this off the shelf of the Video Rental Store because they were out of everything else that I wanted to see..... After the first half hour of this movie, I wasn't sure whether I should laugh or cry. (I wound up laughing).If I were to take this movie seriously - which I didn't - it would be right near the top of my list of ""WORST MOVIES"" I've ever seen. It would have been an excellent movie had it only consisted of music and photography. Unfortunately...there was dialog. Joachin Phoenix - who I like (and who was actually better than Russell Crowe in ""The Gladiator""), was wasted in this movie. On the other hand, Adrien Brody was perfect!! The fewer lines he delivers - the better! His Academy Award for Best Actor in ""The Pianist"" had to be the absolute worst Best Actor award ever given. (It should have been the ""Best Mumbling Award""). He does a fine job of mumbling in this film as well. As for the story, a lot of other online reviewers seem to have found it ""profound"". Oh-oh....I think I'm going to start laughing again. I don't know how I did it, but I managed to sit through the entire movie. My wife had enough after the first fifteen minutes and would have preferred to watch ""CSI"" re-runs instead.My only possible take on this movie is that Shyamalan is ""goofing"" on everyone - and for this I have to give him a lot of credit.

"""The Village""- The beginning of M. Night Shyamalan's fall.  Fascinating ideas and genuinely eerie set-pieces brought down by a meandering pace and contrived eccentricity.","The career of M. Night Shyamalan has been a fascinating and harrowing thing to follow over the past twenty years. His explosive success with 1999's ""The Sixth Sense"" was something of a revelation, and it rocketed him to super-stardom in the annals of film history. After following it up with two films I feel are equal in every way to that iconic and indisputable classic in the form of contemplative superhero drama ""Unbreakable"" and the mind-warping alien-invasion thriller ""Signs"", Shyamalan could do no wrong as far as many were concerned. Little did we know what the near future would hold, and just how far he would fall before finding rebuilding himself back up. In some ways, it could be argued that 2002's ""Signs"" was the last truly great Shyamalan thriller we'd get until 2017's remarkable and brilliantly entertaining ""Split.""And for many people, it was his fourth major release, the period- piece supernatural thriller ""The Village"", that signaled the start of his downfall. While by no means a terrible film and benefiting from sharp direction and strong performances, ""The Village"" is where the confident idea that Shyamalan always knew exactly what he was doing began to crack. On one hand... yeah, it had a lot of the things that we ate up in his previous efforts. The quirky characters, the bone-chilling horror... and yet, it was starting to feel a bit stale. Often feeling like someone else trying to imitate Shyamalan's style than an actual Shyamalan feature. His previously careful, deliberate pacing and focus was starting to feel aimless and meandering. His idiosyncratic humor and peculiar characters began to feel contrived and shoehorned. And his oft- shocking twists and turns became shallow and predictable. Now don't get me wrong... ""The Village"" does have a lot to offer thanks to the elements that do work and on the whole I think the film is enjoyable. But it's still a massive step in the wrong direction.In the 19th century, in the village of Covington reside a small and tightly knit community of families, who all live in fear of the treacherous creatures who stalk the woods around them at night- ""Those we don't speak of."" In order to maintain balance, a set of rules has been crafted to keep everyone safe. Two young villagers- Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) and the blind Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) admit their attraction to one-another and intend on marrying. However, their happy news comes at a cost, when their close friend, the mentally-challenged Noah Percy (Adrien Brody) cannot accept their love and attempts to murder Lucius in a fit of jealous rage. After pleading with village elders, Ivy is given a chance to help her love- she is permitted to enter the Covington woods and try to navigate past the devious monsters that populate it, so that she can obtain medicine from the next town over to try and save Lucius. However, her journey will bring about revelations regarding Covington and the men and women who populate it... revelations that may threaten to destroy the once- strong community.The greatest strengths of the film lie in its exquisite beauty from a production standpoint, in addition to the generally stellar performances of our three main leads. This is one very good-looking and sounding movie, with some of the sharpest camera-work and jaw- droppingly gorgeous music of any Shyamalan feature. The visual guidance is top-notch from start to finish, and Shyamalan is able to paint a dark and troubled portrait of a town haunted with his stunning storytelling. James Newton Howard's score rightfully earned an Oscar nod, and it's some of his best- complimented by the expert violinist Hilary Hahn, who performs a great deal of work on the score. Our three leads in Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard and Adrian Brody are all absolutely incredible in their respective roles and will immediately earn great admiration from the viewer. Particularly Howard, who gives one of the best performances of her career in this film. Unfortunately, the supporting cast is mixed, with some of the actors including William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver feeling woefully underutilized and out of place.And unfortunately, as I mentioned above, this is the film where Shyamalan begins to go a bit too far with his material, at times making the film feel like a borderline self-satire. I almost get the feeling that the film was rushed into production without a second draft having been written, because it all feels a bit sloppy. Shyamalan's quirky characters are there... but they're a bit more stale and a bit less defined. The focus and pacing is methodical and deliberate... and yet all too often the film begins to feel tedious and overwrought. Rules are established and ideas introduced... and yet the film does little with the concepts presented, lacking payoff. And without spoiling anything, anyone who is aware of Shyamalan's penchant for introducing game-changing twists into his finales will be able to see what's coming from a mile away. In a lot of ways, the movie feels like its slaving to try and be the next great Shyamalan film by trying to repeat what he does well. But it's not organic. It's a bit too cold and clinical. Even robotic. It's like a computer wrote the film based on a Shyamalan algorithm. The ideas are there... but the humanity is lacking.""The Village"" is a troubled film. And it is the movie that signals the start of the dark age for the promising filmmaker behind it. And yet, the stellar performances, sharp visual storytelling and absolutely gorgeous musical score are able to salvage and indeed save the film from imploding. It's not a great film... it's probably not even a good film. But it's solid enough that I'd recommend it to open-minded viewers. It might not be the classic that ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" became. But it's adequate. I give it an ever-so-slightly above average 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An excellent concept wasted in a boring and dull soap opera,"Typical of M. Night Shyamalan, 'The Village' is a film that tries to create a solid story in order to hit the viewer with a clever twist that totally changes the perception of the story you just saw.In here we are introduced to an isolated village, which maintains itself thanks to a pact with the creatures who inhabit the surrounding woods. But when one young villager proposes to cross the woods to find medical supplies, the creatures start to act up...The twist, whether you expected it or not, is very clever. It is easily the best thing in the entire movie; however, it becomes almost ridiculous and laughable when put it together with everything that led up to it.'The Village' is slow, boring, and visually dull. The dialogue is terribly written, seeming more like a bad soap opera than a period film, and the acting is horrible. Adrien Brody is nothing more than an irritating caricature of the village idiot, acting like a retarded clown and destroying any and all scenes he is on. Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard have no chemistry whatsoever, and their scenes together are cringe-worthy; even separated, Phoenix is apathetic most of the film and Howard seems to forget her character is blind from time to time. William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are merely decent.There is no atmosphere to go along with Shyamalan's tries at creating thrills. There are a lot of glaring logic problems, too: Shyamalan forces his characters to make nonsense decisions/actions, and sometimes disregard logic in order for some plot elements to work. The fact this is meant to be an allegory for terrorism or whatever (sincerely, some people look too far in order to justify crap) only makes this somewhat laughable.This had the potential to be excellent, but ended up as a complete bore. The twist, the excellent soundtrack (one of the best I can remember of) and the way 'Scary Movie 4' spoofed it are the only favorable things I can think of in regards to Shyamalan's 'The Village'.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A load of rubbish,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsA group of village dwellers in the late 1800s live across the field from 'those things of which we don't speak.'However,some of the dwellers feel mysteriously compelled to summon these things,and it is from here that the hard reality of their lives begins to eerily creep through.Following on from the excellent Signs and The Sixth Sense and the perfectly watchable Unbreakable,writer/director M Night Shyamalan has now added a new film to his CV which doesn't even match the quality of the latter film and most certainly doesn't patch up to the first two.Considering big name stars like Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson head-billed his last two films,this is a comparatively no name affair,featuring stars that either may have reached the peak but not quite the pinnacle of their careers (Joaquin Phoenix,Adrien Brody) or those who have been out the limelight for far too long for their star power to retain any value (Sigourney Weaver,William Hurt).I actually thought it looked more like a new TV series the first time I saw it and even then it would just be something Shyamalan would just sort of lend his name to.And the damn thing is,despite the fact that they're all moreorless perfectly fine actors (Weaver won an Oscar,for God's sake!) they all seem to turn in really terrible performances here.Even the more experienced cast members feel wooden,unconvincing and terribly,terribly forced.It wouldn't really be fair to single a single one of them out,because they're all the same,but it would be fair to mention that Brody is the only one who really stands out,turning in a fairly good performance as a mentally challenged young man.As previous efforts have shown,this is a guy with seriously good talent as a dramatic actor and,if he keeps picking the right roles,or,even if he turns in good performances in bad films,has a seriously good future ahead of him in Hollywood and if he keeps turning in good performances,how can he go wrong?...Mind you,maybe it's the source material that's weighing them down (hey,anyone see Dennis Quaid around here?)With a story that emerges as unengaging and not particularly interesting,maybe they're having as much fun trawling the script out as we are sitting watching it.As for the film managing to be scary,it's very weird,because although I could see the scary scenes coming from about a mile away,they still managed to make me jump for some reason.But maybe I'm just a sensitive sort of guy.Shyamalan's standard twist comes at the end,although it's truly baffling.I certainly couldn't make any sense of it.But then,maybe I couldn't pay close enough attention to it to be able to.As with all Shyamalan's films up to this point,this is certainly a case of intriguing concept.It's just one that really fails to pay off.*",,Anonymous,Mystery

Hauntingly beautiful,"This film is an hypnotic journey into how we would like to feel in our lives. Safe, and loved and protected.The isolation is overwhelming, the unease palpable, yet there is a quiet dignity, and purposefulness in everyone's behavior.The dialogue is kept to a minimum, allowing clever use of visual images to create the occasional shiver down the spine. Slow panning across a mist covered woods made me cover my eyes ! but I was so pleased that because of the skill in Direction, it allowed me to recover very quickly.Head turns and body movements are gentle, some of the violence is masterfully disguised and justified.I have seen the movie 3 times now, and will watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not to mention, it was plagiarised from a book that was actually good. The ending was very predictable, and it wasn't scary at all. Though I have to admit I thought that the retarded guy was funny.

A Promising But Overrated Suspenseful Movie,"In an undefined time and location, in a small isolated village leaded by the ancients, the villagers do not trespass the border of the surrounding forest and never use red color. The population have an old agreement with the weird and evil red dressed creatures called ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" in this regard. When the crazy Noah Percy (Adrien Brody) hurts the brave Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), his blind fianc√©e Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) decides to challenge the menacing creatures, allowed by her father and leader of the community Edward Walker (William Hurt), and to go to the town to get some medicine to heal the wounds and save her beloved future husband.I heard so many good comments from friends of mine about ""The Village"" that my expectations of watching an excellent movie were the higher possible. Indeed, the creepy beginning of the story was very scary and intriguing, supported by a great photography and atmosphere. However, after 60, 70 minutes running time, the plot becomes very boring and does not work well, without any twist. Suddenly, the plot point is disclosed very early, ending the mystery and the reality is not a great surprise to a conscious viewer. I was quite disappointed with this promising but overrated suspenseful movie. The sound effects contribute for some scary moments, but in the end, the excellent cast that has great performance deserved a better conclusion for such a mysterious story. Further, it is hard to believe in such a plot in the Twenty-First Century. Maybe, if the story took place in the 60's or in the 70's, it would be more credible. It is also amazing to see how easy is to the leaders to control a frightened society! My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Vila"" (""The Village"")",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Forces you to take time to stop and think...,"If Alfred Hitchcock were alive today, would critics and audiences be as unkind as they are to M. Night Shyamalan?  Just as Hitchcock's name was the draw for viewers then, ""a M. Night Shyamalan film"" is the hook today. People see the phrase and already have preconceived notions about the film. Shyamalan, like Hitchcock, experiments with characters and stories.""The Village"" is no real horror movie.  Going to the theatre thinking you'll get a good, visceral scare is probably going to result in disappointment. ""The Village"" is a drama, maybe an ""intellectual suspense"", and has the trademark twist.  It's unfortunate that Shyamalan prides himself so much on twists because his movies could probably stand on their own as dramas or well-crafted tales.The dynamics between William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard make it watchable alone.  Some give Shyamalan flak for his cameos, but he's simply following in the footsteps of Hitchcock and Stephen King.

Perfectly Executed Shyamalan Thriller,"First of all i don't wanna Discuss about the plot and ruin your cinematic experience.. Because ""The less you know about Shyamalan's movie the more you will get thrilled""....So try to go with minimum details of the movie (Shyamalan's movie particularly)...I believe he is one directors that we should have keep our eyes on... I also believe that Mr. M. Night Shyamalan is just like a great magician ,who holds all his tricks and twists within his sleeves , which is called as directorial gimmick.. I still cant forget the Twist in the Sixth Sense ..The village is a Atmospheric Fantasy Mystery thriller , It continues Shyamalan's pattern of there being twists in the plot , But this time there are several twists which will reveal periodically.. Character study is very deep , and realistic ... But don't take it wrong with horror genre (of course it contains horror elements,but not much)Coming to the cast , Bryce Dallas Howard played a role of Ivy Walker , which will be remembered through out the years.. As from my point of view , ""The village"" cant be imagined without her...The rest of the cast is pretty good but Bryce Dallas Howard steals the show..Coming to the plot , It is flawless and good...and picking up irrelevant plot holes is meaningless...""In village"" we can clearly observe that ""How screenplay can effect a movie"".. The story is good , but with perfect screenplay the movie is truly appealing.. The plot has periodical predictable and unpredictable twists which will grip the suspense.....Coming to the the background Score , It is perfect....It helped in maintaining pace of a movie...But don't expect it to be another ""Sixth Sense""It is very underrated movie , as from my point of view this is the second best in Shyamalan's career...If you have any idea of the true cinematic art or if you believe in it , then ""The Village"" is worth your money...If you didn't get a chance to see it yet, Go see it now..My Rating : 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Horror/political movie,"It is often said ( and even more often, sadly, forgotten) that one must judge film,music not by the message he receives from it to his like or dislike, but by characteristics of the art itself.Hence,that's why I rated this film so well (7/10), for it's directed well, acted super-bely especially Adrian Brody stands out giving life to his character, retarded man, playing him on brink of caricature, but still keeping the tragical aspects of character.The story is finely written, although in some points illogical, but these are only petty remarks.But on the other hand,the message is terrifying..The creatures didn't scare me, but reading between lines did for what I saw in this film was America of George W.

Ties with Catwoman as WORST film of the summer,"Okay, the first 3/4 of this film were semi-tolerable, then it seems like Shyamalan lost interest and wrote a cop-out ending due to the fact that he never seems to be able to end anything as well as he started. Of course he wrote himself in for a less-than-memorable cameo, maybe that's the reason he ended it so poorly. The film's advertising WAS misleading, and it wasn't a horror film in the slightest. It wasn't even a psychological thriller, drama, or anything even remotely interesting - it was a story without an ending, and not even a good one at that. There was an extreme waste of talent in this film as well. The painful script was brought to life by some of the best actors of our time: Sigourney Weaver, William Hunt and Michael Pitt (yes, he's a good actor - watch Hedwig and the Angry Inch).

Comprehensive Review,"The VillageM. Night has thrilled audiences with three very solid movies in Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs. As a fan of M Night, and movies in general, the line between the two when reviewing his movies is very difficult. I will do my best.In spite of Ebert's recent review that trashed this movie with a 1 star rating, I had to remain open minded. The first thing is, is Ebert reviewing the movie on the basis of other Night's movies, or is he reviewing based on movies as a whole? I have never felt comparing the other works of the director is effective, but Ebert as always seemed to do this. He gave Gangs of New York a not so positive review based on the fact that it did not reach the level of Goodfellas or Raging Bull. Do you think this is how you should review a movie? Now if he did review The Village as a movie on its own merit, than he rated the movie the same as White Chicks, Catwoman, and any other ridiculous movie. Does this seem fair? Was it really that bad? I watched the movie today....This is not a 1 star movie, but by no means a masterpiece. I felt the dialogue was a bit too lax and dry, and at times the movie moved really slow. It was not a long movie, yet it felt like the movie should have been cut up a bit. The cinematography was great, score was also good. But let's get a little more in depth.M Night's trademark twist has now left him with a label or brand. It's unfortunate that most people now watch his movies looking for that very twist. I prefer to look at his movies with conflict and swift climatic resolution. I believe that is true story telling and film making. In the Village, the resolution is visionary again, however I felt the execution was a bit off the mark. The audience was able to guess, or infer the end before the end. This wasn't a terrible thing; it was still fun to watch how it played out. I just think in this movie, they really could have gone with a planet of the apes (original) type resolution. That is, a bang at the end leaving audiences breathless. To do that though, you cannot give a lot away during the movie. The urgency to progress to the secret or ending seemed evident in the acting. While Brody played his character verywell, I didn't really seem to agree of him. He felt more like a plot tool than a character. And again, the urgency in Hurt, somewhat slanted the story.The movie has a short story feel to it. And that is maybe because it plays off the political foreground of today. Many connections can be made, and I will refrain from doing so for the sake of people who haven't seen it. Is it scary? The audience should jump a bit. As trademark M Night, not for what you see, but how little or what you don't see.This is a good movie, with a few problems and minor holes that who knows, may be fixed on 2nd viewing. But this is by no means a disaster. It is the weakest of his four major movies I feel, but no slouch either. A mediocre M. Night movie is still better than most. The best directors always make quality movies that are never atrocious. Scorsese, Spielberg, even Mann. Is M Night equivalent to Spielberg. Not yet, of course not. But my theory is that a director has to make at least 4 really good movies to be considered legendary. It's unfortunate that I cannot consider M night in this category at this point simply because The Village is not great, it's only above average. However, I ask viewers, since when is it a sin to make only a good movie? If anything, I hope it will allow fans and audiences to realize not to label and have preconceived notions of his movies, but instead to go with no expectations except for quality. I am also glad that his next movie is a book adaptation (Life of Pi) which should broaden him as a filmmaker. It would prove his uncanny storytelling ability by directing someone elses story.Rating: 3 Stars (out of 4)M Nights other moviesSigns: 3.5 stars Unbreakable: 3.5 stars Sixth Sense: 4 stars",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Well acted and beautifully filmed.,"The Village tells the story of a large clan of people who live in an enclosed Village (Duh), The Village is surrounded by a forest. In this forest lives ""Those we shall not speak of"", I'll call them creatures from now on. The Village people have an assortment of rules to keep themselves safe from the creatures. Don't let the bad color be seen. It attracts them. - Never enter the woods. That is where they wait - Heed the warning bell, for they are coming. They have these rules because they organized an agreement with them, they stay out of the woods, they won't harm them, but if they go into the woods, they're will be consequences. But a man named Luscious walks into the woods, the creatures decide to unleash these consequences on The Villagers, and now we have The Village.Now The Village is often regarded as Shyamalans first bad film, it's been accused of false marketing, a dumb plot and a disappointing plot twist.First of all, I don't think it's fair to downgrade a film because of false marketing, I personally don't remember the marketing for The Village, but it's wrong to accuse it of something out of the directors hands.Secondly, this is a bit subjective, but I thought that one of the best things about The Village was it's interesting story. It's original and compelling throughout the film.Lastly, the plot twist. It is undeniably not very good at all, it's horribly unveiled in the film, it's not very thought provoking, it's kind of dumb too. I'm sure there was plenty of other ways Shyamalan could of went with it, he could of even avoided a twist and I would have been fine, but it happened and it wasn't very good. My problem is that people are completely attacking the movie just because of the plot twist, of course it isn't good at all, but think about how good it was before the twist was unveiled.Now, I'm giving The Village a 8 out of 10 because of how much I loved the first hour and a bit of the film, it certainly would of got a 9 or 10 if it wasn't for the twist, but sure what can you do. What I loved so much about The Village was the syrup thick atmosphere throughout the film, you could almost feel the mystery of The Village in the air. This atmosphere is established by the beautiful score which I'm glad was praised by most an nominated for an academy award, and the riveting performances.The performances in The Village are some of the best I've seen in a while, especially that of Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy), she stole every scene she was in. Joaquin Phoenix (Lucius)& Adrien Brody (Noah) are both also very good, they completely owned there characters. Everyone in the film is great, but those three were the standouts.The setting of the film is very picturesque, and the beautiful cinematography really brought it out. The script is also something that was very stick out for me, the dialogue between Lucius and Ivy was just so well written, not to say that the rest isn't but it's definitely something worth mentioning. I am disappointed that The Village does suffer from the horrible plot twist, which is a shame.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good movie hurt by expectations,"After seeing this movie, I was sort of disappointed by how the whole story had unfolded. Then I thought back on the movie and I realized that the story was actually very good. What really hurts the movie is the way it was marketed.

It incites a lot of thought.The other people around me left the movie disappointed by the ""surprise"" ending. Shymalan is going to be cursed forever by The Sixth Sense so now everyone is going to want him to top that ending, which he'll never do.The Village had one of the more impressive casts that I've seen in a long time. The younger actors, Bryce Dallas Howard/Joaquin Phoenix/Adrien Brody, all out did the seasoned veterans, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver. I was really impressed by Howard.

Incredible intelligent plot!,"Incredible intelligent plot! It reminds me Hitchcock ones. I came to watch this movie loving all previous Shyamalan works and get not disappointed. The trailer said: ""Do not tell the secret of this movie to anyone!"" I can help falling on that, and it is exactly what happens. I usually try to find out the secret but it is not possible. And I have to confess that I used to know many fiction plots including this kind of psicologic-anthropological-fiction one. There are so remarkable philosophic and psicologic insights during the film that I can not quote one. It should be seen and think about them all after. It is amazing how Shyamalan movies are easy to talk about after seen. There are always key points that drive the plot to a interpretation that, as you do not know the end, should lead it to, but they simply ""pass me by"" unconscientiously. I was capture by the image (and specially the sound) of the creatures and simply could not think, just feel as the images pass by. At certain point I tell to my wife: ""The creatures is showing on! So, it can not be fake, spiritual, man-dressed or something like that. So what is it?"" She was to afraid to respond. And that is the point. You do not have to be afraid but you will. That is the key point why some people tell me that they hate this movie. The fell betrayed cause the are afraid during all the movie and then the end came to shake then to our world with a fantastically punch. Some friends tell me: ""The end revealed an impossible and fantastic issue that remains illogical and improbable."" Then I answer: ""That is why I love it."" As Sherlock Holmes said: ""to solve a problem, after removing all the impossible explanations, the ones that remains, even it looks improbable, it still be true.""",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good Actors. Superb Suspense. Bad Twist,"This film had the recipes of what makes a good horror film. I am a big fan of M. Night Shayamalan's films, and I was really looking forward to this film. Shayamalan's tale boasts an impressive range of actors, an incredible build-up of tension and suspense, but it's key failure was its twist ending, which both shocks and disappoints.The tale is about an old village (17th/18th Century) and the people who live in it, all of them living in perpetual fear of a strange being that lives in the woods that surrounds them. They are apparently attracted by the colour Red, they seem to have some sort of truce with the town elders, and now, they are intent on breaking their truce because 'they are coming'.The film focuses on Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), a shy yet confident man who shows resilience to the mysterious creatures that live in the woods, and his relationship with a blind woman called Ivy (Howard) who admires this courage. Ivy is also a friend of a bewildered and possibly mentally ill man called Noah (Brody) who has some sort of obsession with Ivy. As the film goes on, Lucius starts to break more and more of the bounds that separate the creatures from the humans, and now, the creatures suddenly seem more active, and it seems that Lucius is to blame. Soon, the fate of the Village is anybody's guess.This film boasts some superb acting. Joaquin is fantastic as the reclusive and gentlemanly Lucius, whilst Adrien Brody is spot on as the psychotic and unpredictable Noah. Meanwhile, Sigourney Weaver, who plays one of the town's elders, gives one of her best acting turns since 'The Ice Storm'. They are all unfortunately hampered by the bad twist, but you could forgive it for the way it builds up the suspense. It is not a bad film, it is perfectly enjoyable to watch once or twice, but it isn't one of those films you'd want to get up and watch obsessively.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Some creepy moments but its not as good as it should have been,"The Village has some creepy moments but its not as good as M. Night Shyamalans previous work. A tranquil 19th Century village enjoys an isolated living surrounded by woods which are home to strange creatures. For many years, they remain segregated, but one day, the villagers discover that the creatures will no longer leave them alone once an impetuous young man (Joaquin Phoenix) bravely ventures forth into the forbidden territory. The plot sounds very scary and with a talented cast this should have been a lot better. The film runs for 108 minutes but it feels a lot longer because there's a lot of boring moments. The script needed some work as there were a lot of holes and stuff that didn't make sense. The ending was good and I didn't see it coming but it also didn't make a lot of sense. The cast is great with the best being Bryce Dallas Howard, she's very talented and should will easily find work in Hollywood. Joaquin Phoenix and Sigourney Weaver both do a good job and Sigourney might be one of the most underrated actresses today. The last main person worth mentioning is Adrien Brody who does a good job but his character was really annoying. M. Night Shyamalan also does a good job of directing making The Village look and sound creepy. Even with a great cast and director the movie just didn't work as well as it should have. I do think critics were a bit harsh on this movie though as it wasn't as bad as they were saying.

Not A Horror Movie,"Alright, i'll start by saying that I don't see this as a horror movie. At the time, when I watched, it had been billed as ""horror"" and was left with a weird feeling when I had seen it through. I saw it with a friend of mine and we both reached the same agreement. To put in a good way, i'll say that we agreed that The Village wasn't the best horror movie we've seen.But after I read a comment regarding this movie, it made me think otherwise. It is very character-driven and that is probably why I oversaw the movie in the first place; also because I saw it with a ""horror-movie"" attitude. Which I shouldn't had done. I haven't other of Shamaylan's (Is that how you spell it?) films, but I certainly will try to do so. But back to this comment; it made me think in a different way about this film.

Dissing the Twist Misses the Point,"I think this film has been given a bad rap by people who judge it based on the quality of his trademark ""twist"" at the end. Was I able to anticipate it before it was revealed? Yes. But that's not the point. For my tastes, this film speaks to one of my favorite themes in movies like Dark City or The Matrix, namely that no matter what the appearance of the world you're seeing, that appearance is an illusion.The movie asks us to consider in its microcosm the bigger question about the validity and reality of the world we inhabit. There's a metaphysical movement that is gaining momentum in these times about how much of what passes for ""common sense"" and the nature of reality is not nearly as true as we suppose it to be. What we've been learning at the leading edges of sciences like quantum mechanics and epigenetics is that many of the dominant ideas about how our world works are merely illusions beneath which a more nuanced and surprising circumstance waits to be discovered.Our world is not what most of us have been taught it is. And films like The Village pose a simple but very important question, namely ""Is what we think the truth of things are really the truth at all?""",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Well directed at first sight, brilliant when examined.","This motion picture begins with Mr. Nicholson burying his son, after which the viewer is taken to the ceremonial dinner. As strange sounds come from the woods, only one person, the stupid, gets excited. Then skinned animals being are found. They are firstly said to be killed by coyotes. And that 'those we don't speak of', who keep the villagers from going in the woods surrounding the village, didn't go angry on them. However, some youngsters want to go through the woods to get medicines in towns nearby.Many, many mysteries live in this remote, 19th century village. Red being the forbidden color and yellow the protective color is one of them. What exactly keeps the villagers from going through the woods is another. As are the skinners, and the colors the blind girl actually can see. And of course, the whole 'why' the village is there. Two young men seem to know things. One of them, the stupid, doesn't really care. The other, Lucius, still has to figure out a lot, but he obviously suspects things. But he gets silenced in an attempt of murder. Piece-by-piece the viewer is fed solutions, but he/she is not always given a clear picture.----- This thriller/detective is chronological and uses few flash-backs to illustrate some monologues of characters. The director attempts to build up the thrill by various means: well utilized sounds, nice cam-work and editing (e.g. as Ivy stands in the door waiting for Lucius, or, as Ivy runs into the barrier), and slow and slightly static but splendidly teasing plot.As in a good thriller/detective the viewer is offered fake solutions, e.g. at some moment it is said 'those we don't speak of' are not real, but in a later scene we actually see one of them in the woods.The theme is the distancy of the village. The viewer must find out why. The motives are: fear (of the outside world), supernaturalness (the view of blind Ivy), knowledge (who are 'those we don't speak of'), red (bad color), yellow (good color), innocence (of the villagers), secrets ( 'sometimes we don't do things we want to do so that others won't know we want to do them'), 'Lucius' (Lat., 'lux', light; as in he sees what others don't), 'Noah' (Hebr. 'rest' / wanderer, as in he wanders where others don't, he's locked up at some point ""Lord shut him in"" (Gen.7:16). This name is a bit fague, but as is the character), the innocent 19th century (one can read '1840' on a gravestone in the opening scene)Main characters: Lucius, seems a distant man at first but turns out to be close to Ivy; Ivy, blind but she can see aura's, she's afraid but she withstands her fear and eventually outsmarts her fear; Noah, he's retarded but that wouldn't justify his stunning actions; Mr. Walker, father of Ivy, head of village, he knows it all, at first he's not willing to sacrifice his secrets but when he does, it turns out not to harm them. The characters are round, they have true emotions and they develop them as the movie progresses.------ Concluding, this tribute to innocence in combination with deep mystery and although having a slightly simple plot it's a worthy thriller. However I would agree with ""cozzymo2"". The movie would've been even better when the big revelation was postponed. The viewer should not know the truth until it's almost too late.

I'm forever bewildered & infuriated by..,".. the inexcusable, almost criminal(!) lousy reviews from nearly every known & supposedly ""respected"" movie critic at the time of it's release. And they remain, 18 yrs later. It's maybe the most inexplicably critically panned movie I've ever seen. But then, there's the plethora of 8-10 star reviews just on this site alone! Critics be damned - it's an amazing film! From the stellar cast - their acting & dialog are sublimely superb - as is the cinematography, musical score, scene location(s), and of course, the xlnt script/plot... ALL are brilliant. So don't read those Spoiler Alert reviews; there's more than one plot ""twist"" & none easily predictable or gimmicky, hence wish those rev's weren't even allowed. Especially for films of this caliber & genre - which, btw, is a Mystery/Drama & Love Story, *not* a horror movie. Anthr mystery is why the studio hyped it as ""Horror"", a stupid & costly mistake. Also surprised how some of these rev's that *don't* have an alert still give away far too much of the plot, are incorrect, or just plain cluelessüôÑ. Still, there are many hundreds of xlnt, in-depth rev's that cover the movie's plot without giving critical info away - read those! I'm just writing abt my feelings on it. And how basically, it's best if you have brains/intellect to truly appreciate this gem. Bc it starts somewhat slowly, even puzzling (especially @1st, as I quickly noticed that the village's bldgs + the ppl's attire & speech didn't quite add up to the apparent 19th century we're being led to believe; seemed a bit of a mish-mash of historic styles. So it builds suspense with quiet subtlety; utilizing genuine eeriness, ""scares"" and your own imagination to maximum benefit. I've seen this movie @least 6-7x's in the past 15 yrs (prbly more! ), & every time, I see more, & love it even more.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting movie,"The Village was an interesting movie. I was pleased with understanding the point at the end, but some of the first half the movie was so slow, I nearly fell asleep. (I believe my husband did fall asleep, thank goodness for TIVO).I thought the suspenseful parts were good. I jumped at a few obvious places. And although I hate jumping in my seat as a rule, it worked very well. I just think there should have been more about the life before this town and why they were there. (of course, that would have to come at the end, because it would ruin the suspense at the beginning).I would like to see a Prequel to this one: what caused the elders to want to hide inside an animal park and pretend it was the 1800s? That is very interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not what I expected at all,"I can't remember, from recent memory, the last time I saw a film and it soooo wasn't what I expected. Similar to The Sixth Sense in that I thought they were going to be twisty, plot-heavy horror films. They're barely horror at all, this in particular. I had heard about the twist, and I assumed that As it is, both twists worked very well, and didn't feel like hammers to the head, even when they were over-explained. definitely seemed a bit like overload. I didn't think this was anything too amazing, but definitely more original than I thought it'd be, and honestly the best Shyamalan film I've seen.

M. Night Shyamalan: Setting Priorities,"I went all alone yesterday to the movie theatre to watch The Village. I must say that I was drawn by the all star cast and the aesthetically beautiful movie poster. I haven't liked Signs though, I thought it was boiled eggs. To be objective I consider Shyamalan a conceptual director meaning that he has very interesting themes. He's a master in portraying these themes in terms of motifs and symbols visually and verbally throughout the film, but he has two problems with his screen writing techniques and that's due to NOT setting priorities. When I watch his film, I sense at times that he's a very commercial director who plays with sudden/sleazy sound effects just for the thrills, but at other times I see interesting personal themes portrayed. You can't gain both audiences, Shyamalan: the majority and the minority. Honestly, he succeeded in doing so, but he has a potential of being an artistic writer, why care for the bucks? You had them already. To emphasize, he doesn't set the world of the film. Is this film about plot? Character? or Theme? I noticed that plot and theme were fighting, and character was vanishing throughout. As a director, I don't think of him very highly. I think some scenes are like boiled eggs: the use of long useless shots and uninteresting decoupage.To summarize, he's a potential screenwriter with very interesting personal themes who has to set his priorities. And if you will direct, Shyamalan, FOCUS.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fail to archive it's potential,"The village it definitely a unique movie with fresh mixture of horror,thriller and drama try to create something new in horror film and it has a lot of great idea and potential to become a creative horror movie with it's own fresh thriller that he gave to his story and with great twist in it but because several flaw mostly in his cinematography that looks like an amateur shoot taken by guy whose done The Blair witch project especially some scene that will take some time later in the movie maybe because it seems that the DP wanted to create something different in his movie by combining old style and modern horror scene but turn out to be total failure for this movie some important scene are becoming blurry because of this and that makes the plot become lost and the character looks like confused with their own plot and the editing is also failed in middle of it started to looks like the Blair witch project combining with other old school horror movie the movie itself that started promising but due to lack of some of these major flaw M night has failed to capture his own well written story to the screen and eventually lead to a total disaster that destroy both of the story major twist and mystery that makes this creepy and mysterious in the first place and looks like a cheap horror movie near the addendum of the story and with some bad editing that made his own vision and the movie recipe turn to be destroy this movie potential but although of it disaster recipe at least the acting was great especially Howard who played the blind girl but with a kind and brave characteristic and to Jaqiuen phoenix as a very mysterious and very curious man that try to solve the town problem also for it support cast Adrien Brody did a pretty good job as a problematic village boy whose suffer a mental disorder and as the many other actor did a pretty good job too and in the end at least the casting and the beautifully musical score still save this movie from becoming a total recipe for disaster",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pleasantly surprised - enjoyable if predictable,"It's a shame so many people are criticizing this film based on its ""twist."" I think Shyamalan is a good storyteller in the classic sense that he's able to just make a good atmospheric thriller that holds one's interest. Some are saying he's a rip-off of Hitchcock, but Hitchcock's films were usually a bit more realistic and almost never supernatural (perhaps ""The Birds"" is the farthest he ventured into truly fictional horror, even ""Psycho"" was realistic - if not then, certainly now).""The Village"" is a good film. I thought the performances were fine, the direction was tight and suspenseful, and the twist - although I guessed it before the film even started - was still delivered well.Another painful thing about this film is that so many people were expecting a shock-twist, when in fact the twist in ""The Village"" isn't as gimmicky as one might expect. In fact it's not much of a ""shock"" or ""twist,"" it's more of a standard minor revelation in the film, and easily predictable.It's a testament to the story itself that it is able to be entertaining in spite of this. At least I thought so.I'm not a huge fan of Shyamalan, I didn't buy into the ""Sixth Sense"" hype at first and thought it was a fairly basic supernatural thriller with a one-time twist that was easily predictable. I liked it on repeat viewings, but at first I was disappointed.I saw ""Unbreakable"" and enjoyed it, but found it fairly dull at the same time.Then I saw ""Signs"" and absolutely loved it, which is ironic because a vast number of people seem to hate the film based on the single fact that its twist is unrealistic.I don't think that's always the case. Just like with ""Signs,"" Shyamalan builds his twist into something else - it's a metaphor for a larger picture. The final message I gathered from ""The Village"" is that you can't escape tragedy and heartbreak, it follows you everywhere, and it's an element of humanity that can't be broken away from.Not a great film but a fun one-time viewing with a satisfying conclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Underrated!!!,"The VillageI don't understand why this film isn't better rated. I heard that this film wasn't good, but I loved it. I don't understand why this movie is looked down at. This movie is grossly underrated. My opinion may have been effected by the fact that I didn't have any expectations what so ever regarding this film, but even so. I loved this thrilling movie. This movie is unpredictable, and that is something you can't see to often if you ask me. The colors in this movie is nothing less than stunning, Mr. shyamalan really knows how to use colors, as seen in the sixth sense and unbreakable. There is nothing to say on the acting part either. Phoenix, Howard, and Hurt play all as brilliant as the next.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What ARE Maltin And Ebert Talking About?!?!,"On a Monday night, as a sleet/snow storm loomed here in the NYC area, I watched another film from M. Night Shyamalan--my second Shyamalan film in two days, following ""Unbreakable""--and it was another one that I greatly enjoyed: 2004's ""The Village."" In this one, a small, rural, Amish-like community, in what would appear to be the late 19th century, lives in mortal fear of the surrounding forests and the creatures that inhabit it. The writer/director keeps the suspense ratcheted up fairly high throughout, leading to another of his patented surprise/twist endings. Actually, I knew what the ending was before I watched the film; as with ""The Sixth Sense,"" it is almost impossible NOT to have heard about this ending before going in. Still, that did not interfere with my enjoyment of the film, and actually allowed me to marvel out how adroitly the director plays fair with the audience throughout. The picture is gorgeous to look at in high def, and features a most impressive cast of pros: (Ron Howard daughter) Bryce Dallas Howard (whose performance I had enjoyed in the recent ""Jurassic World""), Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Jesse Eisenberg and Brendan Gleeson. I really don't know why this film has been so savaged by critics. Roger Ebert apparently detested the film, putting it on his ""Most Hated"" list, while the Maltin guide calls it ""downright ridiculous."" I suppose that the film is a bit contrived in parts, but that didn't take away from its artful qualities and ability to frighten, for me. Most assuredly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting thematic but failed to deliver..,"First the good. Even if it's far from perfect, this movie have something to offer to a lot of fans. And not only horror and sci-fi ones. First, there no doubt you will find some really good tension scenes during the 105 min of the flick length. And I mean really good and well filmed ! Watch for the one when they enter the caves to protect from the 'creatures'. You'll also find a couple of strong performances from solid actors and also a new actress revelation in Brice Howard. And, thirdly, let's also say that there's an really intriguing and mysterious plot that will keep you up awake for a big part of the movie. A story who revealed to be Shyamalan's metaphoric vision on the September 11th and the USA way of life. And he ain't so far from reality with his flick !The bad about this film is that it's too long and badly rhymed. Some choices made at the pre or post-production have probably ruined the success of a good but 'light' story about an interesting theme. And that, despite some good masterized scenes like i said earlier who made shyamalan technics shines. I personally think that a short film could have been a small 'chef d'oeuvre' while this big Hollywood production will still, in the end , not being considered to deliver for a lot of watchers. The idea you'll get after walking the cinema doors is that something should have been done in the wrong way... not a great dose of fear nor a good amount of fascination for an epic flick !",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The curse of the damned legend- a film worthy of both Oscars and Razzies,"Make no mistake, M. Night Shyamalan, the filmmaker behind The Village as well as the hits Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, has carved a niche in Hollywood that will still be relevant after his latest.  His style as a director is unmistakable, as he lays on the dread and suspense for the audience with his stories of the supernatural and citizens at the mercy of outside forces.  One problem though with Shyamalan's series of films since his monumental success with 6th Sense, is that either the audience expects a good twist or two in the third acts and Shyamalan sticks to this ideology, or he feels that he has to do it to keep the audience on edge.While it may be coarse to suggest that The Village would be more terrifying in its third act as something of an exploitation horror film, the way it turns out The Village becomes, well, sort of silly.  It's the kind of third act that tries to get the audience thinking deeper past the realm of a super-natural suspense thriller, but the logic behind it doesn't work.  To me, the screenplay is deserved of a razzie nomination.  On the other hand, at least half of the performances are better than expected by the main cast. Though some of them might seem to be over-acting (i.e. William Hurt), under-acting (Joaquin Phoenix), and only finding the balance in here and there (Adrian Brody's performance will disappoint those expecting him to astound as in The Pianist), at least one comes out with a slight breakthrough (Ron Howard's daughter Bryce, playing a blind character, with the only flaw in the performance being it's not always believable that she's blind).Shyamalan gives us these characters, some of them rather archetypal, and they all live in a Village that keeps everything hidden and darkened by the elders.  When one of them (Howard) has to leave, it leads to the climax, and the twists.  But the best side to the film, outside of the flaws in the story and acting, is the look of the film, the way the images are presented and cut together.  Even if Shyamalan doesn't have every bit of himself as he has before in the script, he does seem to have a distinct, intriguing style via the marvelous Roger Deakins and editor Christopher Tellefson.  Indeed, it was that end alone that kept me in my seat, and occasionally gave me some goose-bumps.  And yet, by the end of the film, I felt more cheated than surprised and ecstatic at what came as the finishing touch.  The Village is a mixed bag, worth checking out but not at the same time.

Decent movie but a total rip off of a book,"While the movie was a little short of my expectations, it was overall a very solid movie. I don't like that people are ripping the director. His first film, The Sixth Sense, was by far his best, but his other movies are still very solid. If it hadn't been for his first, people would be singing his praises even more.However, I thought this movie was a total rip off of a book a read a long time ago called, ""Running Out of Time."" Toward the end of the movie, I really starting thinking of the correlations between the two, and in the end, realized I was right.I still think it was a solid movie and recommend it to people, if not in the theatre, definitely when it comes out to video and DVD.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Still a Smart Movie, but We're Smarter Now","Most of us have seen director / writer M. Night Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE, and many have seen his other  widely released films. I've even seen his earlier gem, WIDE AWAKE. And I like everything I've seen. Let me re-state that, I love everything I've seen, until now. Everything in THE VILLAGE looked great, the actors were all in good form, and it even gives us something to think about. But I have to admit, this is his weakest effort. The problem, however, is not the movie we're seeing, but when we're seeing it.Mr. Shyamalan has taught his audience well. Ever since SIXTH SENSE, we've learned that when watching one of his films, any minute now (and certainly by the last few minutes), things will be turned on their head and some kind of clever plot twist will be revealed. Sometimes it's more subtle than others, and requires a little more focus, but it's always been there. And it's in THE VILLAGE as well (though I wouldn't give it away if you paid me real money - and shame on those who have).M. Night has affectively created his own problem, by making us smart to his plot trickery over the years. The bar is raised and he raised it. If THE VILLAGE had come out right after - or before - SENSE, I think we'd all be raving about it. But it's not 1999, and we've had quite a few twists and surprises from the director. Now we're prepared, we're looking, expecting it. We've learned his style, maybe some of us know it as well as he does. And that's really the issue.I think M. Night has done a great job of writing suspense stories, and in learning his style many of us have also learned to spot his hints. We go in focused and alert, with our thinking caps on so to speak, because we know it's not Explosion Movie Part 6. I believe it's this reason that left me with fewer surprises and less satisfaction walking out of the theater. The story - and again it's a good one - had me looking constantly for clues, and then just waiting for the confirmation of my suspicions; that's a lot less fun than what we all got at the end of SIXTH SENSE.All my whining aside, there are much, much worse films to see and I was still pleasantly entertained. I hope everyone still has fun seeing it, and it's still a smart film - he hasn't sunken to dumbing things down as yet. But I also hope Mr. Shyamalan clues into his own smart audience and figures out how to write a story that makes us think we're going where he usually goes, then doesn't. That's the one I'd like to see next, but that would be a big challenge for any writer. I do think he's up to that challenge, but time will tell. Until then, THE VILLAGE is still good (maybe great for some other director), but really not up to the M. Night standard. That bar, in my book, sits pretty high.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Virtue without courage,"Seldom do I wake up in the middle of the night and think about a movie. When I do, I buy that movie. I then ask myself why the film penetrated my imagination so completely and then set out to study every camera angle, every piece of dialogue, every character until I understand. Naturally, this is a time-intensive process but, thankfully, only a handful of movies have affected me like The Village has. I adore almost every aspect of this film; However, I wish to comment on one element that had great impact on me: M. Night made me want to live at Covington. The simplicity, the community, the peculiar but polite speech, the seeming virtue of the place caused a yearning within me. I wanted to be there. But after the second, third and subsequent viewings, I began to question my desire. Covington was a place of traditional values, where men were gentlemen and women were ladies, democracy mixed harmoniously with authority, a place aloof from crime and corruption and danger (somewhat). But in avoiding danger I believe the fictional town sealed its own demise: For all their apparent virtues, the citizens of Covington lacked courage. With the exception of Ivy and Lucius, the population had the moral stature of sheep. The children were taught to fear and to hide. The very foundation of the town was based on running away from problems instead of facing them. As C.S. Lewis once pointed out, ""...courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point... A chastity or honesty, or mercy, which yields to danger will be chaste or honest or merciful only on conditions."" The tragedy of The Village, in my mind, is the degradation of that moral conviction called courage that, unfortunately, negates all the intended good that the founders of Covington sought to create.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fan of m. night's but not a fan of this film,"The Village, the latest film from producer, director, writer and actor M. Night is a story about a small village surrounded by trees and mysterious creatures that roams the woods.  The creatures and the villagers live in harmonious peace as long as the villages don't ever enter the woods.  Ah, but something is a-foul here and, or course, that trust is broken.So anyone that is familiar with M. Night's films, they know there is a twist in the film.  When they reveal the twist in the films, I was thinking, so what.  There is nothing shocking, nothing unique, in fact the film is rather boring.  It is slow in the beginning, slow in the middle, had a couple of interesting points, but that is about it.  I mean, you are going to be sitting there and really not care.  They have the ever boring William Hurt who mistakes indifference for acting.  Joaquim Phoenix repeats his same sense of acting he used in SIGNS in this film and while it seems fresh in SIGNS, he style is quite boring in this film.  Sigourney Weaver is just a name in this film and completely wasted.  She isn't require to do much but be a familiar face you have seen in films before.  Adrian Brody does a good job, a bit over the top at times, but it's nice to see him getting more parts and he pulls his character off rather well.  The bright spot, the star of the film is Ron Howard's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard.  I guess those acting classes really paid off.  She reminds me of a younger Mia Farrow.But the main problem is the writing.  It is so uninspiring and M. Night's gimmick is getting kind of old now.  It is obvious that Alfred Hitchcock was a big influence on him in not only in film making, but now it becomes a game to see if you can spot the director.  Still, I cannot fault the young director because he is trying and he is different.  Unfortunately the advertisement for the Village is better than the actual movie.  I just wish the film lived up to it's potential.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Film that tests the viewers attention and forces them to think for themselves about the probability of something being believable or not. Clever and engaging.,"The Village is one of those films that comes very close to perhaps being one of the greatest ever made, it also comes close to being one of the biggest cheats ever put across in film and thus; comes closer still to being one of the worst ever made. I was undecided after viewing it very recently and I'm still undecided now ¬ñ maybe time will clear my mind and maybe my opinion will change somewhat. I'm sure there are people that hate The Village because people like to be shown things that they recognise and like to be told what's what; but not here as here, you have to exercise your mind.I'm all for 'twist' endings. I think the twist, when used correctly can be the one reason for a films greatness. Sometimes it's used well with The Usual Suspects being an excellent example as clues and hidden messages in something so immaterial as someone's eyes focusing on a certain thing can be the difference between knowing and not knowing. Other times, such as in De Palma's 2002 film Femme Fatale, the whole thing falls flat on its face leaving us cheated, angry and sad. The Village's twist works and if you watch it with no knowledge of it and without having seen any trailers or clips prior to the film; it really, really works.I didn't quite know what to think at the end of The Village. On one had, it's a very clever film that has you believe one thing, leads you down a path and then pulls out the path from under you but on another hand, it's a complete waste of time ¬ñ a mere exercise in 1890s mise-en-scene, cinematography and dialogue that is shot, edited and then has a silly revelation attached to the end. Shyamalan is no fool when it comes to hinting at his story. The film was marketed as a horror film but I think this was deliberate to throw you off. I was surprised at the different genres The Village seemed to fall into: there was the horror, of course but then there was the element of fantasy, look at it logically: It's 1890s America and all these people are living in fear of monsters that live in a nearby wood with no other community around for miles except beyond the dreaded wood. The people also seem too submissive to the monsters since they encroach and kill livestock and yet just like in Signs and Lady in the Water, people would rather run and hide than face them and fight ¬ñ similarly to what I said about Lady in the Water: the problem is nothing a 12 gauge wouldn't solve (or a similar firearm given it's the 1890s)The film also contains elements of the fantasy genre. When a character stated that she had her ""memories locked up in that box"", I thought ""how the hell do you lock a memory in a box?"" Given the what the film has us believe up until this point, I expected it to be this big, glowing ball of energy that rises up out of whatever it's in: how else is a 'memory' supposed to look in a physical form? From here, The Village becomes a love story very briefly with murder and heartache playing a large role. The film changes direction again: you don't get love stories in horror films as in depth and crisp as this one; another tick in the film's 'negative' column. But wow, was I wrong. The reason I mention all these things is that there is a logical explanation for it all and I knew there would be. The film isn't set in another dimension or another world, why would it be? It hasn't been established like it was in Lord of the Rings so you have to assume its here and now on Planet Earth. The Village looks like it has so many things wrong with it from frame one and yet thinking back after you know the ending, everything makes sense. Even if it seems bad and incorrect at the time, does it make it bad and incorrect if there's a reason for it? One example of what I'm saying can be seen in the character of Ivy Walker (Howard). A village elder sends her to the next town through the haunted woods but she's blind ¬ñ great idea, huh? Not only this but she doesn't set off at dawn to beat the dark and she and her accomplice stop when it rains instead of keeping going to avoid illness or the monsters. All of these things sound suicidal and at the time, I was wondering what the hell they were all thinking; and yet it all makes sense when you look back following the revelation: why would someone send a blind person on a dangerous mission involving cannibalistic monsters, shortly before it gets dark? The answer is not as difficult as you think.The Village is a criss-cross of genres; ranging from horror, thriller, fantasy, romance and possibly science fiction but it's not what you think since the film actually changes genre towards the end to something else that probably doesn't even exist ¬ñ that itself is an achievement. Despite the lingering shots of empty rocking chairs and bare trees blowing in the wind adding an avant-garde feel (but keeping you alert as you try and work out why they're there, pointlessly), The Village maintains concentration and attention throughout without being too un-obvious.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a disappointing exercise in oh so tired formulas.,"I really approached this movie optimistically, ""maybe Shyamalan has finally got some class?"" I'd hoped. The trailer looked great,the cast looked hot and the hype was there. For the first half an hour I was happily entertained, It all looked nice, I smiled, I laughed, I jumped in fright, this isn't so bad. Shyamalan really does have polished skills as a director and can create and hold tension like few others. I could (but won't) like so many others, go into great detail trying to rationalise and question the reality of the film. There's no question in my mind i found the premise absurd but I feel that so many people are missing the whole point by petty squabbling about it being unrealistic or predictable (I didn't see it coming too early, then again I do tend to go all passive whilst entertained). No, the problem wasn't with the directing, it is the writing. You see in my opinion there's one blinding error in the writing and when you see it it opens the whole thing up to it's hollow bones. I think it is this,he writes all of his films backwards from the twist. He paints himself into a corner with what he considers a great surprise ending, then goes backwards spending all the time in the film before the twist,simply arguing his way out of the corner. And that is just bad storytelling. Given this knowledge you can then watch the film again and see that almost every line of dialogue leading up to the inevitable twist is simply explaining away any questions about the validity of the twist. About as naturalistic as mj's looks and to be honest I was simply left cold and slightly angry. Gotta give him credit though he's made a career out of films which you can write in 30 seconds and simply fill out to 2 hours. I'd suggest letting someone else do the writing next time. Ha ha I really had you going there didn't I? Actually I'M M Night Shyamalan and this was all a big hoax!!! You fools!!!!! Of course I love this film! Oh will these twists ever get tiresome?

Ugh,"Such a shame. This was advertised as a horror movie, right? I am probably one of the easiest people on this earth to frighten, but I didn't get scared once throughout this whole film.Here's a short breakdown:Story: 4/10 Once again, such a huge, huge shame and waste. The story sounds very promising- an 1800s village surrounded by a forest containing monsters that will kill on sight. Thus they can not leave the village. Not as good as it sounds.Writing: 2/10 Godawful writing. The story is translated to screen terribly. I feel it would've done much better as a novel. The twist- if that's what you can call it- it revealed WAY too early int he movie and the rest that follows is just boring almost nothingness.Acting: 3/10 Not good either. Bryce Dallas Howard was just awful as Ivy. It may be just me (though I doubt it) but was she supposed to be playing a blind person? I didn't even notice that she was blind until one of the elders said 'BUT SHE'S BLIND!'Visuals: 7/10 One of the very few good things about this movie. The scenery and picturesque forest is easy on the eye, and I actually quite liked the brief scene with the contrast of the red flower and the yellowy ground.No, The Village is entirely awful, but it is stupid, boring, poorly acted and written and I wouldn't recommend it or watch it again any time soon.4/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
Liked it a lot,"There are many among you who will complain that this movie was not scary. In response to this, I ask you to examine Shyamalan's previous movies; none of them were really scary. His movies tend to consist of creepy plots with odd twists that sometimes have a tendency of falling off at the end. He seems to me to be a very talented and intelligent writer who suffers from disorganization. I work at a movie theatre and viewed this with fellow employees and out of all who viewed the movie, was the only one who liked it. All I can say is some people like the way Shyamalan writes and some do not.And the good in this movie will just plain pass by some.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Lots of great things here,"This is not just some film about some kind of Amish colony, or any group of religious society shut-outs. If there is any religion proffered by this ""Village"", it is not mentioned. It is not important.It's also not any kind of ""Horror"" film, which is what it was promoted as. Although it has it's suspenseful moments. These people are basically normal, except for a few things: They will not ever return to ""The Towns"" which is what they call the outside world, and they won't wear Red, or go into ""The Woods"".Or else, ""Those we must not speak of"" will come. Whoever or whatever they are, becomes something we in fact focus on, but in true M Night fashion, this is not what the film is about.What we have is a basically idyllic home for a group of people. The Elders have their secrets, and the young people are being given a set of ""Traditions"". But one kid, Noah (Adrien Brody) is a little different. He is referred to as ""An Innocent"" but it is clear even before we start seeing what is happening, he is not an innocent. He rocks back and forth in his chair as if Autistic, but he has speech. So, this character may have his own world in his mind which he lives in. We don't know much about that at first, but it is clear that Noah is a more complex individual than he lets on, and he is more intelligent than he is given credit for.The bright light in this film is mainly Bryce Dallas Howard, this was the first time I saw her in a film. She pulls off the Blind girl fairly believably, except her eye movement don't track a blind person's. A Blind person would not focus on anything- But that is a hard thing to duplicate if in fact you can see. Actually, Lili Taylor does a believable Blind girl in the 5th Season X-Files episode ""Minds Eye"", the closest portrayal I have ever seen - Her eyes wander off camera, never looking directly at who she is speaking to.The elder characters talk about people in their lives who had suffered violence, people who had been killed in various violent ways. There is more to this talk than just remembrance, it is an important point.In their artificial idyllic village, these people live as if in the 1800s, sans any modern medical technology. This is a point brought up a couple of times, by the character played by Joaquin Phoenix ""Lucius"" (Which may or may not be a reference to the film Gladiator where he had a nephew by that name) - He wants to go to ""The Towns"" to get Medicines. But the Elders give him all kinds of reasons why he can't do it.So we think this film is about these kids being raised to not depend on modern gadgetry and to avoid offending those that can't be spoken of, who live in the woods, so that is another taboo place. The entire younger generation of the village has been raised to believe in a set of Absolutes, you can't wear Red, you can't speak of the things that will come, and you can't go into the Woods. And, things happen that appear to validate these restrictions. So this false facade is upheld by a thin veneer of what Elder Walker (William Hurt) calls ""A farce"".A farce that if the kids knew about, it would destroy whatever sociological experiment is being conducted in The Village.And we think this film is about Lucius, who wants to marry Howard's character ""Ivy""- Until M Night's famous ""Reversal"" happens.It's at that point, Night slides in the reasons why the village exists, who the elders really are, and who the unspeakable creatures really are. But mainly, it's how a young blind girl can save the life of the one she loves, without the elders breaking any previous oaths they had taken. It's ""Yellow Riding Hood vs the Big Bad Wolf"" all over again, and ""Nothing is as it Seems"" as usual in Night's films.There are things Night likes to do as a Director, characters being shown in reflections in an object, which he does at the beginning of ""Unbreakable"", many other little trademarks, they are all here. Mainly there is wonderful imagery and rich character development, but the Village itself and the lifestyle of the people therein is the focal point of the film, it paid off that the whole cast was actually trained how to live in such an environment. You believe that they made all of their own clothes, they husband their own animals, they grew all of their vegetables, they made their own homes. If you can believe that, then the rest of the film falls into place.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A mixed bag, but still rather good.","The Village is by far the weakest of M. Night's last four films... but even with that, his latest tale is an engrossing, well acted picture.Yes, there is a twist and no it is not that good of one, but to me, basing the whole film on the twist is a crime.This time M creates a LOVE STORY.  While love has been at the root of his previous four flicks as well, this understated romance is far more moving than it's predecessors.  Joaquin Phoenix, as the stoic Lucius Hunt and new comer Bryce Dallas Howard as the breathtaking Ivy Walker create such a powerful bond of young love that this movie becomes a pleasure to watch.Add in the other great performances, the BEAUTIFUL camera work, some political questions and a few (and i do mean few) scares and you've got a movie that is far better than most.  So no, the village is not as good as i would have hoped... but it's still pretty damn good.(for anyone who remembers the scene in Last of the Mohicans when the younger sister jumps off the cliff... it's that kind of love.  Bryce Howard, daughter of Ron, is going to be a star... a very big star.)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This could have been an episode of the Twilight Zone,"This movie is overrated and way too long. It should have been made in the style of the wonderful TV series Twlight Zone. I think the writers of that series would have made an episode of 30 minutes with this story.I have seldom been so bored as with this movie. The clue was so clear, from very early in the movie, I really can't understand what all the hype was about. Series like Twilight Zone, Buffy and Angel have clues like this in almost every episode, and have better suspense.I did laugh several times. But I'm quite sure the makers of this movie did not intend me to laugh at those times.The acting was not too bad. But the actors had to work with a silly script.

B - O - R - I - N - G,"What tries to be a horror movie winds up being a horrible movie. What could have been a great thirty-minute TV episode is stretched into a long, boring feature length film with silly bumps in the night. This movie is not a thriller, is not frightening, and is not credible. It's childish. The script is laughable. The only redeeming factor of the movie is the great acting by Bryce Dallas Howard, although I was confused on whether her character was blind or not until later in the picture. When will Shyamalan stop writing the screenplay and let a professional handle it? Shyamalan had a great movie in Sixth Sense, but he's a one-hit wonder. He's had three strikes since then, and you know what that means. . .",,Anonymous,Mystery
Look deeper,"When this movie came out I went in cinema to watch it, and I didn't find it very interesting at first view. Then I watched it again on TV and it really intrigued me. Shyamalan is great director and people cannot expect of him to make movie like ""The Sixth Sense"" every time. ""The Village"" isn't definitely his best movie but this also isn't his worst movie. ""The Village"" has its positive attributes, like great entering and solid story but maybe poor finishing. Slow rhythm of the movie is great cause we really need to be drawn into the story on this way. I also want to say that this is no horror, it is more drama of people who live in one community on traditional way. Study of characters is great just like actors are (especially Bryce Dallas Howard). Shyamalan wanted to show the thoughts of the whole community we're talking about. They gave up from real world so they can create their perfect world. Even when someone gets hurt, he's only making a sacrifice for future of the society. The question that director puts in front of us is this: Would Lucius stay alive if Ivy wasn't blind or would elders let Ivy out for medicine if she wasn't blind? And that is the point of this movie.I recommend to watch this Shyamalan movie and then judge it. In my case after second view a whole new perspective was opened to me. To all second viewers: look deeper.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The story was also well-crafted.However, it was the plot twist that really made the film worse. (The one at the very end, not the earlier one)This felt kinda forced, and also dumb. However, since then, I have thought about it and the twist does make a bit of sense.

Somewhat.....disturbing.,"""The Village"" was actually not as bad as what people had told me. I enjoyed it quite abit....although, some of the conversations going on between the characters were a little off subject, if the film even had one. The music was twice as loud as the voices, which explains why I pretty much had no idea what was going on half the time. I don't want to give away too much of it, so I'll just say I'm glad that the producer kept it in reality, but at the same time I'm alittle upset that he did just that. Go see this movie and you'll understand why I say that. It had a twisted ending which is good, who doesn't like endings like that? If you go see this film, you'll find that you will be jumping at the wrong times. Acting was fine, story was disturbing but good, and the loud music in the theater kind of ruined it.

Utter trash,"The Village-*-Worthless- Directed by: M. Night Shyamalan. Written by: M. Night Shyamalan, Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Bryce Dallas Howard, Brendan Gleeson, Cherry Jones, John Christopher Jones, Celia Watson, Judy Greer, Jayne Atkinson, Fran Kranz, Michael Pitt, Jesse Eisenberg, Frank Collison.Director M. Night Shyamalan's downward spiral begins with this horrendous film that is absolutely preposterous and ridiculous in every sense of the word. The film details a village that somehow is alienated from society with people kept within the borders because of outsiders that lurk in the surrounding forest. The elders of the village refuse to let anyone outside of the borders even at Phoenix's demands.This is not only a silly plot but it is relentlessly downbeat with no factor of entertainment whatsoever. Shyamalan takes all the energy out of the film to meet his own demands to emphasize the villager's loneliness. I did not feel any loneliness from his direction and actually felt more entitled to leave this film than anything. The actors seem just as bored as the audience in reality. No one seems to be enjoying any of their roles.Shyamalan is intent upon making the same success that The Sixth Sense brought in for him. The elements that Shyamalan used in The Sixth Sense can be found though they are not even scarcely close to the sheer power his first spooky fest had over us. The end plot twist here only demeans the experience, rather than enhancing it. Shyamalan really should have identified that his talent as a director were virtually limited to one film.

"""A Very Special Halloween Episode"" of Little House on the Prairie","No SPOILERS (but truly, you'd have to be brain dead not to figure everything out while watching the movie)Perhaps the most laughable, implausible, asinine film to grace screens this summer.   This shamefully trashy and reactionary yarn about red cape wearing monsters threatening an idyllic Amish-like village is truly preposterous, interminably dull and its narrative `twists' can be seen a mile away. Imagine the silliest episode of Scooby Doo mixed with a `very special' Halloween episode of Little House on the Prairie.   The outrageous promotion of this world class turkey from this country's most self promoting, arrogant hack M. Night Shyamalan (who inexplicably and egocentrically seems to fancy himself a modern day Hitchcock) is really unforgivable.The hype for this thing is a surefire way to make it the big box office winner this weekend and I'm sure there will be plenty of groaning, bored and angry audience members tonight like in my screen who booed and hissed throughout the film's lengthy, incredibly dull duration.   I feel embarrassed for all the actors in the film having to speak the ludicrous dialogue and keep a straight face.  This is one of those incredible all star train wrecks that people will laugh about for years.    I'm still in shock that some of the actors in this film didn't laugh out loud at the screenplay.While I felt the 6th Sense was strong and well made I have not been much of a fan of M. Night's other films but THIS THING absolutely takes the cake.  I feel battered and robbed of ten dollars.    I can imagine the fat cat cackles of Scott Rudin and company as they howl it up this weekend in the Hamptons watching the box office receipts pile up before word really gets out.

Plot Twists are not the only genius of M. Night Shyamlan,"I have never been a fan of M. Night Shyamanlan. His movies are earnest and well-made but have always been too slow-moving and far out for my tastes. But I thought The Village was his best movie to date.The mood is like a Gothic fairy tale, but the monsters - or ""those we don't speak of"" - seem to symbolize the monsters we can create out of traumatic circumstances, as well as the lengths we will go to try to protect loved ones from fear and suffering. Shyamlan addresses this dilemma with a sensitivity that, while certainly not new, is never naive.While some might say the talents of an all-star cast was unnecessary, I think it was such talent that drove home the theme of this film and kept it interesting. That heavyweights like William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Adrian Brody and Joaquin Phoenix managed to be so effective in such understated roles was very refreshing and says a lot about their talent.Also, those who have become used to shock fests and outright horror will be disappointed because, although there are some genuinely creepy moments and one scene that's truly shocking, the creepiness is only a backdrop to a much bigger issue.Although I figured out the trademark Shyamalan plot twist before it was revealed, the final decision of whether or not to keep the Village secret was still a satisfying idea to ponder.In spite of some extremely cheesy creatures and some comparatively weak moments near the end, Shyamalan put great care into this work and definitely earned my respect as a filmmaker.I recently watched The Village again and enjoyed it more the second time around.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another nod to Hitchcock,"This film is a relatable human story wonderfully acted, beautifully shot, and brilliantly told, but not the film it was marketed as. It is NOT scary (though there are a few intense scenes), nor is it supposed to be, even though it was sold that way. This is another instance of Shyamalan paying homage to his film-making inspiration Alfred Hitchcock. ""Psycho"" (1960) was marketed as a Janet Leigh feature, using her in all the trailers and marketing campaigns, but barely 40 minutes in, she gets killed, because Hitchcock wanted to surprise his audience in a way they'd never expect.Shyamalan's first major film (""The Sixth Sense"") culminates with perhaps the greatest twist in film history, which meant audiences familiar with his work started expecting and looking for the twist in each of his films.To surprise viewers, the twist in this film comes long before expected (shot in haunting near-silence to leave the viewer wondering what even happened for several seconds). This is both a nod to ""Psycho"" (because of who it happens to) and a way to shock jaded audiences. Then, he adds a follow-up twist to advance the plot, followed by a final surprise near the end.Reviewers that don't like this film seem to agree that this wasn't the film they expected, but without preconceptions (and an attention span longer than what a Marvel Movie requires), this is a simply beautiful story of the brokenness and beauty of humanity. In John Hurt's words from this film: ""The world moves for love. It falls at its feet in awe.""",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I'd forgotten how beautifully written this movie is,"Looking back at the cast, which is an absolute powerhouse, I see why a horror movie has me holding a box of tissues. The lines are so powerfully delivered. I do wish that he'd been more inclusive in his casting but my assumption is that it's so the apparent timeline would be easily accepted. Though, I do think it would have made more sense to have people of other cultures and backgrounds as the story unfolds. Never been a fan of movies that pretend like the world isn't round. Other than that, it's beautiful imagery and writing. Definitely didn't deserve the poor reception, but it's probably because of how difficult it was to get out of Sixth Sense's shadow.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I enjoyed it and my only complaint would be that the story moved pretty slowly, but it was a good way to spend two hours. The acting, plot and soundtrack were all excellent. One thing I enjoy about M. Night's films is that there practically no explanation of what the movie is really about - you watch it and the story and all its mysteries unfold. 'The Village' is a perfect example of this. The film opens with a small community living their normal lives, except for that there's monsters in the woods. The plot centers on a girl that must go through the woods to the towns to get supplies. My favorite part of this movie is how it deals with disabilities and mental disorders. The main character is blind, and another character has a mental disorder. The theme of the movie was also thought-provoking. Is it right to run away from your own mistakes?

Those people are ignorant and bypassed one of the most powerful films of the year. And besides, the acting was magnificent. Bryce Dallas Howard, I must say, gave an Oscar- worthy performance. She is extremely talented and turned her role of Ivy into someone you can sympathize with and cry for. She gave enough to her character that nobody would leave the theater saying ""Ivy was obnoxious"", she was simply amazing. Each scene was so beautifully crafted and photographed that every one seemed like a Vermeer painting, if this film had come out closer to Oscar time, it would have probably nabbed nods for Art Direction, Cinematography and Costume Design.

Let's twist again...,"THE VILLAGE by M.NIGHT SHYAMALAN.End of summer, slow movie, lack of substance and everything wrapped together with a twist can only mean one thing, SHYAMALAN is back. They said if he wants to do horror he does the SIXTH SENSE, fancy super heroes...he does UNBREAKABLE and when he wants to do a shitty movie he does SIGNS, his movie career has gone downhill into oblivion as did my vote of confidence. ANGEL HEART and THE USUAL SUSPECTS worked because the story leading to the twist can stand on it's on feet regardless of the end so did THE SIXTH SENSE whose replay value went through the roof if only to check some loose ends. So now we are going deep into THE VILLAGE, the first ten minutes bring back a strong anxiety feeling very close to the panic attack wondering if TWISTA can possibly bores us to death yet again, then as the story unfolds fear turns into interest and then into fear again but because of the good reasons. A village surrounded by woods, something lurks in the dark but they won't bother us if we don't bother them, looks simple? believe me it is not. So we have the story, what else do we need? Actors, come in la creme de la creme WILLIAM HURT and ADRIEN BRODIE and top that with and almost silent performance from PHOENIX can we ask for more?... the cherry of the cake is newcomer HOWARD playing the blind girl that at some point will not only be leading the movie but also the audience into the darkness and finally the real deal of the movie, the village itself. We will soon discover that apart from the vastness of the ocean in OPEN WATER, walking the woods at night is the most scary thing to do, I know is irrational after all who is gonna be hiding there monsters? guess what, there are. Now the weakness... the monsters are introduced as ""the ones we do not speak of"", now this point can border the unbearable at some stages, wanting to slap a couple of characters, specially PHOENIX, well is always PHOENIX isn't it. Secondly Mr SHYAMALAN secret which I won't reveal let's just say that looks like he has work the story backwards closing every single detail.One thing is for sure this movie is not everyone you will either love it or hate it but the movie will grow on you if you let it. As for the director's trademark I can say without the shadow of a doubt that his cameo is the most ingenious ever, HITCKOCK or otherwise. Let's twist again... like we did last summer.***",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Powerful,Still probably my favorite of M. Night's films. An ode to the power of love in the form of a thriller. Beautiful and unique. It's worth watching for the soundtrack alone. But the less you know about it the better.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good film - but if you know the end it ain't so good...,"*No Spoilers*Seriously, I applaud Night for making such a movie.  I went with some friends and one of us knew the ending ahead of time - he did not like the film.  I started thinking of the guts it takes to make a movie that TOTALLY hinges on the twist near or at the end.  I believe that is the reason that alot of people will not like it.  If you know the end of the movie, it ruins it.  However, I did not know the end, and I really enjoyed it.  I figured out the twists right before there were revealed, and I now realize (for myself personally) that I don't mind being able to figure out the twists of a movie.  I really loved Night's movie ""Signs"", and interestingly enough, there really wasn't a twist.  I mean, from the beginning of the movie, it looks like the visitors are aliens, and that's what they ended up being. However, in ""Sixth Sense"" there was a twist, and it was brilliant.  I am looking forward to Night's next movie, and I don't care if he decides to put a twist in it or not.  He has proven to me that he can make a movie with or without a twist.  Pretty cool. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A Moving, Suspenseful  Film","I really don't understand why this movie got such mixed reviews. Upon watching again recently, I am still intrigued by it in many ways. The dialogue matches the tone that these characters would create in their conceived society- that of respect and honesty. The backstories of the ""grandmasters"" of the society is compelling and moving. I do not feel creating such a society from their traumatic experiences was outlandish at all.As for the ending twist, I think Shyamalan did a superb job. For one, I felt it was believable. This, for me, made it all the more intriguing. I'm not sure what audiences or critics were expecting or wanting instead. A sci-fi, improbable ending? Or were audiences disappointed because the ending wasn't scary enough or the explanation was too simple and logical?In the end, it's unfortunate that films such as this end up being underrated. Why is it that a director's follow-up film has to go above and beyond the previous hit, in this case, ""The Sixth Sense""? And if it doesn't, the director has somehow let us down and hasn't done his/her job? The film should be strictly critiqued on it's own merits, and this film for one, was greatly misjudged.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worst Movie Ever,"This goes down in the hall of fame for worst movie ever. Except for the cinematography everything else stunk. The script, dialogue, plot, surprise, etc, was dull, pointless and stupid. I want not only my money back by the hours I lost in seeing this piece of junk. A blind person should have gotten the role as Ivy, they could have done it ten times more believably and it would have given a disabled person a fighting chance. I think Adrian Brody's character could have written more convincing dialogue. And what the heck was with the color red? Who cares? I wish I had a clothespin to put on my nose.I should have seen Anchorman instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
