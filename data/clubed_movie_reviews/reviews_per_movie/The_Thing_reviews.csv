Today it's still one of the best horror films,"Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this. Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known. In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Who Goes There?...,"You're stationed at an isolated outpost in Antarctica when a helicopter arrives intent on shooting a dog it had been pursuing across the tundra. Things get out of hand and the occupants of the chopper have their ability to pursue curtailed, more permanently than they'd like. Not too long after this carnage it becomes apparent that the pursuing shooters had a pretty good reason for wanting to remove the dog from the land of the living as the dog turns out to have the same aspirations as its pursuers, albeit in various guises, transformations, metamorphoses and reconfigurations.While this was made in 1981 it remains to this day one of the greatest and most engaging pieces of horror movie making that has ever been created.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the Most Re-Watchable Movies Ever Made,"Classic and timeless that is now almost 40 years old. Great cast and character interaction, and covers the whole gambit of genre's (sci-fi, action, horror, thriller, mystery). There are even a few comedy moments, and with it taking place in Antarctica, it could even be classified as an adventure.

"""The Thing"" is John Carpenter's masterpiece and one of the best classic horror films!","A classic film. John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made - fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design.In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. I'll put any of ""The Thing's"" old-school effects up against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I could see ""The Thing"" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend? Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the guy/gal next to you really real?""Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.""John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense, claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score from Ennio Morricone! Awesome!!! 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good things come to those who wait,"* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing  today a highly treasured cult favourite  one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide) had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office rampage. Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was prepared  moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained such a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks' version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story ""Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper, compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today  18 years after  looks downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film, making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque special effects. Be warned  there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find them disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a crowd of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece, his own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it never barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of - DVD version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at a human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not the point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection, making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Finally getting recognition.,"I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this film was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look into the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear, lent not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct result he ""feels"" like a real person, rather than a hollywood ""all american hero"".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good Movie,"A very good thriller; gory but effective. The atmosphere of creepy revulsion and panic is conveyed very well.To me, the best line in the movie is delivered by Donald Moffat (as Garry), at the conclusion of the ""blood test"": ""I know you gentlemen have been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS F***ING COUCH"" A line delivered beautifully by the beleaguered and terrified character.Kurt Russell is good, however the ""rebel without a clue"" bit may be a little overdone (ditch the yosemite sam hat already...) Well-acted and terrifying, an effective movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Intelligent Splatter,"This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre. Don't miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Some things work, some things don't","The Thing is a monster movie with a twist. The monster could be the guy standing next to you. Or maybe the monster could even be you. The story unfolds at an American research outpost in Antarctica. Some crazy Norwegians show up, shooting at a dog. Before the Americans can ascertain what is going on the Norwegians are dead. Soon everyone will realize this dog is no dog at all. It's, for lack of a better term, a thing. This thing can take the appearance of other creatures it absorbs. It can become a perfect imitation of any living creature. So now how much do you trust that guy standing next to you? Paranoia overwhelms the group very quickly. This thing is, quite literally it appears, eating the group alive.Kurt Russell plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot who becomes the leader of the group as they try to stop the thing before it destroys them all. If they don't stop this thing in its tracks and it manages to make its way to civilized areas it will be the end of humankind. So some pressure on our little group then. MacReady is a take-charge kind of guy. But who's to say he's not a thing now? Certainly other members of the group have their doubts. Trust is a commodity in very short supply. Where the film fails a bit is in failing to really establish any characters beyond MacReady. A couple of them stand out because they're portrayed by actors we recognize, Wilford Brimley for example. But it's a largely faceless bunch, not a whole lot of personality in the group. And for a bunch of supposed scientists they're not the smartest group either.The movie has some decent twists and turns, leaving you guessing along with the characters as they try to determine who's still human. It's an intriguing story but it certainly would have grabbed you more if you really identified with all of the characters. As it is there are too many guys whom you really wouldn't care about should the thing make a meal of them. Characters, and the story as a whole really, too often take a backseat to the gore which director John Carpenter piles on liberally. If you're looking for a gross-out movie you'll find few better. The creature effects are very well done but maybe a little too repulsive for some people's tastes. A little more story, a little less blood and guts, probably would have served the film well. It is a very compelling story. You just wish the filmmakers trusted that story enough to allow it to carry the film. The paranoia, the mistrust, there's so much great tension there potentially. But tension loses out in the quest for gory, scary moments. In a movie such as this you want to have some good frights. But you want the scares to enhance the story, not overwhelm it. The balance in this movie is just a little bit off. It's an interesting movie but there is definitely the sense more could have been done with such a fascinating concept.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Flips the scenario round from the original to great effect.,"John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold. Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a ""what is in the shadow"" sequence, the film is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and see what happens indeed. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
More of a gross out film than a well-crafted horror.,"The Thing is a 1982 sci-fi horror film directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell as Mack MacReady, a researcher based in Antarctica and our protagonist in the film. Upon its release, The Thing was met with a lot of mixed reviews and overall a negative reception, however over the years has gone on to gain a cult following and a legendary status in the history of sci-fi, horror and cinema as a whole. While The Thing does have its moments, as in the grand special effects of the horrific, repulsive monster itself which still don't look particularly dated by todays standards and the great sense of vulnerability in our characters. It is in these characters that lies the problem. Not one of them is particularly likable or relatable, even Kurt Russell himself. You never get a great sense of caring or hoping for a certain character to make it out alive, rooting for a character just doesn't happen in The Thing. We are also left hanging in the balance by the end of the film with no real climactic epic fight or showdown. The Thing can be tense and generally scary at times, but in reality is a pure gross-out film rather than a well crafted horror. The music however is another strong point which does add to the suspense and the very clever idea of blood samples in the latter part of the film really has us guessing and wondering who is human and who is the monster. While I don't agree the statement that The Thing is one of the greatest horror movies of all time, it does have its tense, pseudo horror moments and shrieking horror soundtrack to build on this. Overall it does feel more of a gross-out, gore-fest with unfortunately unlikeable characters, some rushed scenes and disappointing third act which leaves it feeling incomplete, but with brilliant special effects. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The Thing holds up better and better every year,The Thing does a great job at holding my attention throughout. It has just enough to gross me out while making me wonder if the person next to me is an alien.The idea that this movie was made in the early 80s and it took years to be reevaluated before being well received just tells you how ahead of his time Carpenter is. Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors from the pre2000s and this is a good example of why.It's one of those special movies I can't get enough of. Every viewing feels like the first.

I worship this film. 10/10,"John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Right up there with ""Halloween""--one of Carpenter's best!","Remake of the classic 1951 ""The Thing From Another World"". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material--the novelette ""Who Goes There?"") and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding. There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off, heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material. I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful. You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with ""E.T."" and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be close to a facility to throw up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Interesting...but not brilliant,"This is an interesting film, mainly because it is one filled with some of the most disgusting special effects I have ever seen - though I admit that I am fairly new to horror flicks of this kind.What's good about it? For one thing, it is a very clever touch not to reveal who has been infected and who hasn't until it is absolutely necessary. It is completely impossible to tell who is who, and the suspense raises sky-high because of that.Also, the performances are actually pretty good, considering the cramped confinement of the set and the sparse and somewhat lame dialogue. These are ordinary men talking, though most of them seem to be more or less criminal in some way.The beginning is very clever, and it takes quite a while before one gets the hang of why these crazy Norwegian are so eager to hunt the dog with machine guns and hand grenades (!) that they injure one of the Americans in the process. Of course, the first time I saw it, I knew what was coming, but it makes it better nonetheless.I have a favorite scene in this movie, it is one I will remember forever: when the doctor is trying to resuscitate one of the team members, who has been infected, he gets his hands caught in some weird mouth that opens right in the guy's chest. That is awful. It doesn't matter much that the doc's hands seem to break off by themselves...What else? Well...it's a cult classic, and deserves it. Like many of those, it's very far from brilliant, but are nonetheless very good and entertaining to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The tagline is no mere jest,"""The ultimate in alien terror,"" it says. It's not wrong. This is it. This is the greatest horror film ever made. John Carpenter's A-#1.Cinema is full of great creature designs, yet The Thing bests them all. Every incarnation we see of the creature, and all the practical effects and set pieces that bring it to life, are the best that the industry has to offer. The most realistic CGI will never compete.The paranoia and distrust in the outpost is palpable. Carpenter crafts a tangible atmosphere of desperation and suspicion, from the unassuming beginning to the classic, ambiguous end--one of my very favorite endings from any movie, ever.Composer extraordinaire Ennio Morricone lends his great skills with a minimalist, synth-driven score that adds immensely to the building unease. It very well complements the performances of the excellent ensemble cast that bring every feeling of terror and wariness to life. Kurt Russell once again shines as Carpenter's lead, MacReady, and Keith David is superb as the antagonistic Childs. It's easy to overlook other cast members with smaller roles and less time on screen--even the unmistakable Wilford Brimley--but have no doubt, they're all just as good, just as essential to the picture.Once again: not only is John Carpenter a master storyteller, a fantastic director generally, but his greatest skill is in slowly building the tension and suspense in his pictures until the explosive finale. He does it so well that it's impossible for the viewer not to experience the same misgivings, the same sense of horror, as the characters on-screen--not because you're watching it, but because you FEEL it just as deeply.It's violent, it's gory, and broadly it may not be for everyone. But this needs to be seen by anyone with the slightest interest in horror, or creature features, or with a keen interest in cinema history as a whole. Similar stories may be told, but there are no and will never be any imitators.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
classic,"The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but only like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an alien lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact with, and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into manic paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one second do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any genre for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it will leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a man thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that has driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is a truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what would you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature waiting to feed on you, and take you over as well. The images, and ideals of this movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition it deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen.

Why The Thing?,"Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite movie. My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing! The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from N.Y.) In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to do with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting. I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day the last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even the great ""Das Boot"".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror movies: Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're not interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV and watch this miracle of a film.

"A Timeless Look in Paranoia, a Horror Classic","Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI, blue screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan of John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In 'The Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but only like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an alien lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact with, and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into manic paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one second do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any genre for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it will leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a man thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that has driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is a truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what would you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature waiting to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition it deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat inducing, gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Couldn't Be Better - One of History's Greatest Films,"I remember being encouraged to watch this in my mid-teens. Naturally, being a teen, I was reluctant to give anything from the 80s a try as I felt it to be a long gone ancient era. I was pleasantly surprised. The practical effects were a very welcome change to the cgi I was used to. They were done so well that I was at no point removed from the illusion. To this day, they're still the best I've seen. It's proof that if done right, practical effects such as animatronics will always beat out cgi.The movie is fantastic in every way. Kurt Russell is such a good actor that I'd have to class him as one of my favorites. Carpenter and Russell were a tour de force in the 80s creating both The Thing, and Escape From New York.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A serious contender for the best remake ever,"The Thing is not only a brilliant remake(which I was not expecting after seeing abominations such as Psycho and The Wicker Man) but it is also a brilliant film that seamlessly blends horror and sci-fi amongst other things.The atmosphere is especially what makes the movie so good. To this day, very few other movies have shocked, haunted or unnerved me as much as The Thing. The scenery, sets and costumes are eye-popping and the effects are brilliantly designed and suitably grotesque without distracting too much.There is also Ennio Morricone's most haunting score, a cracking script and a deliberately slow-paced but compelling story that is quite ahead of its time. Not to mention wonderful direction and credible and well-written characters. The acting is equally great, in my mind Kurt Russell has never been better, likewise with Keith David and Wilford Brimley has brilliant delivery of the lines.All in all, a brilliant film and one essentials and its genre(s). 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Commendable science fiction which works well until you place it under close scrutiny - whereupon the faults become all too clear.,"Based on the famous short story Who Goes There? (which was previously filmed as The Thing From Another World), this 1982 version of The Thing is an exciting and fairly gruesome slice of science fiction. It has its fair share of shortcomings, which I will mention later, but on the whole this is a commendable film.A bunch of US researchers at a secluded Antarctic base rescue a stray dog. Little do they realise that the dog's body has been inhabited by a deadly alien organism which can take the shape of its victims so that no-one knows it is there. Seems that some Norweigan scientists at a nearby base unearthed the murderous extra terrestrial from the ice, where it had laid frozen for hundreds of thousands of years. Pretty soon, the guys in the American research team are being infected by ""The Thing"" one by one.... but how can they tell who is who when it can imitate any one of them with such accuracy?The Antarctic setting complements the suspense perfectly. The isolation of a scientific station in the middle of nowhere is an ideal metaphor for the fearful isolation that each character experiences, miles from help and surrounded by other characters who may or may not be what they seem. Rob Bottin's make-up effects and Albert Whitlock's visual effects are memorably (and intentionally) unpleasant. And some performances, notably Kurt Russell as the suicidal hero, are absolutely spot-on. As I touched upon earlier, the film has a few shortcomings. There is never a satisfactory explanation as to how the alien actually infects its victims, and some moments near the end seem illogical (e.g. what's going on with A. Wilford Brimley's character in his last scene, and why does Keith David go running around alone knowing that the alien is on the prowl?) Also there are clumsy goofs - for instance, it is widely-known that Antarctica experiences six months of uninterrupted daylight and six months of uninterrupted darkness, so how come day and night occur on a daily basis in this film? The film is best enjoyed as an exercise in suspense and a show-stopping display of innovative special effects, but if you start to unpick the plot in closer detail the holes begin to show.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Quality does not Age,"This is one of the classic Guy films. Horror sci fi as it was meant to be - a real story with good acting. Giving us something missing from almost all horror movies - depth and character. Providing a much needed respite from the cardboard cut outs pasted and slashed throughout, that have been filling the genre for decades. Which has given this style of movie-making it's well deserved reputation and status - of being both Invalid and Not Art. Though John Carpenter himself has been one of the staunchest purveyors of such ilk, it is my humble opinion that he did well with this one, and maybe two others.One of the best uses of curious as a tool, it lures you in a bit unexpectedly with a somewhat whimsical, almost playful beginning. Rich in atmosphere, while stark in landscape - you find yourself as intrigued by the people as you are the monster. The remoteness of the region gives a true sense of the isolation of the real life McMurdo Sound Naval Station (as it was called when I was in the Navy) which is on the very southern tip of Ross Island in the Antarctic, and is the portal for all things going to the South Pole. I think now it's simply known as McMurdo Station, with the story taking place at a small satellite station outside (probably fictional), as McMurdo is mentioned in the film.Kurt Russell who started acting as a kid when I was a kid has never taken Hollywood too seriously, which I've always thought was pretty cool. He's done his share of trash films over the years, but there's been a handful of roles that have more than demonstrated his caliber as one of our great actors. His version of Wyatt Earp is by far the most recognized and almost as good as George C. Scott's Patton. I said almost. He's the center of a strong cast of seasoned actors with many recognizable faces and solid performances. I watched it last night with a good friend who had never seen it, and it was just as good as when I first saw it in the theater - almost 30 yeeeaaars ago. Add it to your library, you'll watch it many times . .",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Ridley Scott's 'Alien' at a Research Facility,"The Thing being the second John Carpenter film I've watched this week, I'm starting to notice why he's such a ""big deal"" in the film business, but I'm also realizing that his style may not be best suited for my tastes in film.The Thing is a remake of a 1951 Howard Hawks film, which in itself is based on a novella, and the film was once again remade in 2011. Ultimately, this story is widely popular. But the funny thing is, the story doesn't feel all that special or unique. The film adapts the ""whodunit"" or rather ""who is it"" movie trope that has been used for as long as films have been made. I don't have a problem with that, but I do have a problem with this film feeling like a rip-off to Ridley Scott's 1979 Alien film. Right down to the chest bursting scene.Some people may say that the original novella probably influenced Scott in making Alien, which may be true. But then why not change up a few plot points and shot selections instead of feeling overtly derivative from a film that is only a few years old. It also doesn't help that for all the blood, guts, jumps, and scares, we don't really get a look inside the minds of any of these characters. None of them are memorable, even Kurt Russell's flame throwing bearded helicopter pilot. Heck, we never even see the guy fly a helicopter.I hate to keep bringing up Alien, so I'll compare the recent movie, Life. That film doesn't have anything new to add to the genre of ""trapped-in-horror-thriller"", but it consistently entertains you because you get to know each character and you care about them. The Thing's cast consists of a dozen or so men ranging from 30-65, and I don't remember any of their names or backstories. Why? Because the movie didn't take the time to establish either.The Thing does do quite a few things well, though. The practical special effects are mind-blowing for a film from the early-80's. I would love to see some of the behind the scenes featurettes and how they were able to pull off some of the shots. If only the film didn't make me cringe every few minutes with its gratuitous blood spatters and gut bursting shots. The Thing also did a nice job at pacing out the deaths and jump scares where it didn't feel too overpowering at any one point but it also never got to the point of boredom either. Not to mention Ennio Morricone's haunting main theme that plays throughout the film. That will surely send chills down anyone's spine. So overall, The Thing is another Carpenter film to get a mixed response from me. He's a good filmmaker, but I highly doubt I will ever sit down a re-watch his films as religiously as some film fans do. Perhaps I'd like Howard Hawks version better.+Score+Effects-No character depth-Feels derivative6.4/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Must-watch for all horror fans,It's the start of winter. An isolation group of scientists at the United States National Science Institute Station 4 in Antarctica is interrupted by a Norwegian helicopter buzzing around. The Norwegians are throwing charges and shooting at a dog. George Bennings (Peter Maloney) is shot and Garry (Donald Moffat) kills the supposed mad Norwegian. Clark (Richard Masur) takes the dog in. MacReady (Kurt Russell) flies Dr. Blair (Wilford Brimley) and Garry to the Norwegian camp. They discover it smoldering and a place of massacre. Windows can't reach anybody on the radio.The makeup special effect is gruesome and astonishing. The pre-CGI real effect reaches an all-new high. The snowy atmosphere is stark.

Really good remake,Well this movie was very good for a remake usually remakes are way to different from the original and they make it more violent well this movie did do that but it follows the novel more the violence in this movie is very graphic and quite sickening but its a effective movie its john carpenter was a big fan of the movie because he used clips of it in one of his halloween movies. This movie did follow the original but it followed the novel much more because now the monster takes on the body of others whereas in the original it looked slightly like the frankenstein monster all in all this movie was really well done and a worthy remake but i have heard that their going to remake it again and i hope they don't do that because too many movies are being remade lets leave these to movies the way they are and don't remake then again.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the most overrated movies ever,"It is considered to be one of the best horrors of the '80s and maybe even one of the best horrors overall?! If that's true I do not want to see the rest of them. I cannot say it is complete crap, but it definitely is waste of time. Extremely overrated nonsense with no purpose. The basic idea is good, but it's not developed nearly enough. Characters are two-dimensional and stereotypical. The movie has no depth, does not provoke thoughts, cannot be more linear than it is, does not arouse any emotions, there's no tension, and finally, it is not even scary at all. There are movies that are very stupid, but make you crap your pants in fear. Stupid but with purpose. This one is not even that.

The ultimate in alien terror.,"A group of explorers in the arctic region have encountered a vicious alien organism that can consume a person and make itself a perfect copy. This is a classic horror film that is loaded with brilliant special effects and graphic violence that is a perfect way to spend a cold evening. Kurt Russel stars as a troubled alcoholic who takes charge and tries to find which person is really the alien creature. One of the most brilliant things about the movie is that it plays with the idea of not knowing who you can trust. I found it interesting that it had an all male cast, something uncommon for many movies. The acting is very natural and very realistic. This movie was surprisingly scary and the graphic scenes were surprisingly horrific. It's a dark, brutal, and claustrophobic sci-fi horror film that has stood the test of time from the genius of John Carpenter.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A cult favourite that has become a classic,"A dog is chased through the wide open snowy expanse of the Antarctic by men in a helicopter who attempt to kill it with a rifle.

The men of this outpost now try to discover what events led to this bizarre sceneJohn Carpenter's remake of the 1950 Howard Hawks original The Thing From Another World is a definite example of a remake that exceeds the original. With this film Carpenter upgraded the original with excellent use of very impressive practical special effects. These effects still look extremely good today thirty years on. But it's not just this that has been improved; the characters and dialogue are better, while the sense of paranoid mystery is an entirely new addition to the story. Despite all these aspects, it comes as a surprise to a lot of people that The Thing was a box office failure upon release in 1982. Even the fools at the Razzies jumped on the bandwagon and nominated Ennio Morricone's Carpenteresque soundtrack for 'worst musical score' – a frankly ludicrous decision. Anyway, it was only in the years that followed that The Thing built up a reputation as a cult favourite, to the point that it is now considered something of a classic.

It Never Lets Up,"I don't know if I could ever watch this film again. It's one of those where, once you get involved, you sit on the edge of your seat, feeling everything that befalls these poor men. If one wanted to create a hell on earth, this would be it. From the Norwegians chasing that dog, to a minute by minute effort to survive and save civilization from this horror. The special effects dealing with the aliens transformation are stunning, especially when one realizes it was 1982 and the CGI stuff was really barely a thought. We care about the characters but are not let in on anything, so when something jumps, we jump with it. If there is a criticism, there is no release from the tension. Even if one is able to relax for a minute or two, there is an atmosphere of threat over everyone.

You couldn't ask for better sci-fi horror!,"Another well-loved horror masterpiece from director John Carpenter is this unforgettable re-imagining of the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing From Another World.Scientists stationed at an outpost on the South Pole are terrorized by a mysterious shape-shifting alien.Themes of paranoia, the unknown, and isolation are very common in the horror/scifi genre and they are well utilized in this film. John Carpenter directs this film with gusto, giving it a terrificly haunting and bleak atmosphere. Ennio Morricone adds all the more to the atmospheric spookiness with his eerie music score. However, the best highlight of The Thing is undoubtedly the awesome special FX of Rob Bottin. Even by today's standards of CGI visual FX, the creature creations of Bottin are truly outstanding. This film was made nearly 25 years ago and still the creepy alien FX of The Thing manage to shock and thrill! An impressive feat indeed.Another highlight is the great cast of the film, the best of which is hero Kurt Russell in one of his most challenging roles.All around, The Thing is a stunning combination of moody atmosphere and out-of-this-world horrors.

Why do modern audiences so badly overrate this film?,"Maybe they're sick of CGI and fine the film's first rate practical effects refreshing? Could be, but the truth is all the criticism The Thing received in1982 is still valid. Messy, muddled scripting. Unfocused direction, lethargic editing and scoring, and unsympathetic characters make it impossible to create any real suspense. The effects are the star, and that never nade a Transformers movie worth watching. The best scene in The thing is the blood test sequence, and that's because the cutting of the fingers was simple and identifiable. It was human unlike the characters and certainly unlike the film.Dean Cundey's photography and Rob Bottins practical effects are brilliant, to bad they were surrounded by mediocrity in the other departments.Stick with the 1951 original.

A Good Movie.,"The film's proposal is similar to Alien's (1979) proposal: a group of people have contact with an alien being, someone gets infected and then it's a hunting game between cat and mouse.What I like about movies in the 80's is that filmmakers do not waste time with unnecessary things and go right to the point. There is no mystery here. A human among the group gets infected and the group has to know who became infected.Killing the Thing in the process, it is therefore necessary. Unlike Alien, The Thing tries to create an atmosphere of mistrust in the team, and this raises doubts, creating for this a great aspect in the narrative of the film, to see the human distrusting of each other between the group companions raises the tension to the limits. The tension of the film is constant and the characters are friendly enough so we want to know about them. Be concerned about their fate is good enough to care about these characters.The filmmakers do not try to put any political messages, nor do they want to manipulate the audience. It's a great and straightforward horror movie with sci-fi to mix. It is a survival movie at its best. Unlike Arrival, who tries to pass the message that we have to unite (all nations), otherwise We will not survive.There is something greater here in this movie. A great movie to have fun in the sense of the old B-movies, but also it does not forget that our most basic instinct is survival and when we unite, forgetting our differences (as a group of Individuals, not nations), for the sake of our survival and our well-being, the human race shines in the most intense sense possible. The cooperation between several elements, to come out alive from a complicated situation. No political messages or no unnecessary melodramas (aka Interstellar).I just think the ending was a bit rushed, and needs some more focus on the final elements (characters) of the group. But the filmmakers went straight into the action and the big explosions, unlike Alien, where the tension accelerates to the very end and never stops. On the contrary it accelerates and increases. In this case, I consider Alien a superior film to The Thing (1982). Nonetheless, this movie is still a great horror movie with sci-fi elements, which makes it a great survival film. It's a great film to have some fun.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Masterful horror,"The movie opens to a frozen wasteland of Antarctica, as we spot the lonely figure of a dog fleeing from its pursuers. It's a bleak, unforgiving setting and a perfect opener to this movie. The Thing, based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella Who Goes There? is one of the finest horror movies ever made. In a way it reminds me a lot of Alien, another masterpiece of horror. They both have an isolated setting where no help will be forthcoming, they both feature an attack by an unknown alien entity and they both have unbelievably good special effects, the sheer brutality, goriness and impossibility of which are the stuff of nightmares.The Thing adds the fact that its alien is capable of assuming other shapes, and the movie evolves to a tense hide and seek game and as the pressure rises, the group of scientists and researchers starts to crack. It's an intense experience with long scenes of unbearable atmosphere followed by short bursts of soul-chilling terror facilitated by the special effects of one Rob Bottin, a master of his craft.It's a well-told story, ending on a perfect note that isn't too uplifting, but neither is it a complete downer. Easily one of the best endings to a horror film I've ever seen and the rest of the story is told equally as well. Perhaps my only nitpick is that some of the characters and their actors aren't as strong as, say, in the Alien. There's perhaps one or two too many for all of them to get enough screen time to really shine. On the other hand, some are really good, like Kurt Russell's MacReady or Wilford Brimley's Dr. Blair.This is a movie that every fan of horror owes to himself or herself to see at least once. Its special effects are so scary that I actually wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's prone to nightmares. They're not nice to look at, they're not pleasant and under no circumstances should any child ever see this film. It's that frightening, that good at what it does.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The T One Dozen.,"Something feels wrong about this movie, there is something in it that is poorly done, something that fails to drive it. The cinematography is beautiful, the visual effects are outstanding, the music is impressive, even though it is very simple and a little annoying. The cast is good, some of these actors need no introduction. The idea behind the movie is very interesting. It is about an isolated place in a very dangerous environment where a group of people encounters an unknown alien creature that can imitate any life form and is a brilliant survivor. But something feels wrong. And that feeling is not a mistake. Something is wrong with the movie. And this is what it is.In ""Alien"", for example, we very quickly get to know the characters in the opening of the movie, before the big adventure begins. They are all together, they are talking to each other, discussing things in a situation that is natural for them. By the time the trouble begins, you care about them. The same goes for ""Predator"" where we get to see them all as one unit before something bad starts happening to them. ""The Thing"" is clearly a monster movie like the two mentioned above, only it fails at the character part of things. The trouble begins at the very beginning of the movie. And our heroes are thrown into danger with no real establishment of what they are, as people. Of course, later, we do get to know them a little, but the characteristics are so basic and simple, and the plot itself is surface level. The movie does not want you to think about any of it, it does not want you to be wandering around here as one of the characters, it only wants you watching. ""Alien"" creates a comfortable atmosphere for the audience before slowly leading you out of your comfort zone. ""Predator"" does the same. Both are smart enough to understand one simple thing.It does not matter what idea you have and how fascinating it may seem, it does not matter how good your movie looks, because the only thing driving any motion picture is the story that it wants to tell. And that, in turn, only works through character. ""The Thing"" however technologically sophisticated it is, fails in that regard, alienating the audience. This movie did not fail at the box office because audiences were stupid and mainstream. It failed because it was stupid and raw. It looks good and pretends to be smarter than it is. It also wants you to take it extremely seriously no matter how questionable or plain stupid the heroes may behave. Overall, a boring experience with a jump scare or two to prevent you from falling asleep.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"the most professionally astute horror film of the 80's, very entertaining","In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched, brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh, detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone. I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky, curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes. That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and atmospheric to a T.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
John Carpenter's The Thing is an entertainingly gore-drenched horror flick,"Having just rewatched Howard Hawks' The Thing from Another World, I finally decided to see John Carpenter's The Thing on the HD DVD my dad ordered months ago. In this version, the title alien starts to inhabit many of the dogs and people that are stationed in the Antarctic Circle. Among the crew: R. J. MacReady (Kurt Russell), Nauls (T. K. Carter), Dr. Blair (A. Wilford Brimley without his familiar mustache and glasses), Vance Norris (Charles Hallahan), Garry (Donald Moffat), Clark (Richard Masur), Dr. Cooper (Richard Dysart), and others. I'll stop there and just say how fascinatingly weird and gory this movie is. I mean from the dog scene to yet another creature-coming-out-of-someone's-body sequence, there's plenty of entertaining blood-drenched visual effects courtesy of Rob Bottin and Stan Winston. And the pulsating score of Ennio Morricone is positively riveting. I can't always make sense of the dialogue in Bill Lancaster's screenplay but as long as those monster effects come on, I'm never bored. So on that note, I highly recommend John Carpenter's The Thing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Even his minimalist Music that is usually so Eerie garners very Little Emotion because it is Overwhelmed by all of the Ugliness.The Cast and Atmosphere Suffer the same situation, Frozen Out of the Melodrama by a barrage of Excess Baggage.

Digging up schorched bones,"One of the biggest horror sci-fi treasures. Unbelievably chilling even after 40 years. Mystery, terrific acting, astonishing practical effects and dark, claustrophobic mood set by the plot and scenery are a founding stones for this masterpiece - and a lesson about passion and aristry for next generations.No stupid comedy fillers, you can see here, that dialogues have weight of people really terrified about situation which they have found themselves in, without easter-eggs, puns and breaking 4-th wall.As a separated laudation I'd like to thank Ennio Morricone for this minimalistic, cold theme piercing thoughout the film.

A Lovecraftian-inspired classic horror movie...,"John Carpenter really did manage to create something unique with this movie. And throughout the many years, this movie has proved again and again that it is more than capable of withstanding the test of time,And while the special effects certainly show their age, they are actually still good when taking into consideration the time in which the movie was made.""The Thing"" is driven by a good storyline, although it seems to have suffered somewhat at the cutting board and certain scenes seem to have been artificially reduced to save time.The movie could have benefitted so well from an extended version release. I am not familiar with any done, but of course there might just be such. They have just eluded my attention.The cast in Carpenter's ""The Thing"" from 1982 was good, and they each brought something unique to the movie.""The Thing"" is a classic by all means, and if you haven't already seen this movie then it is about due time to do so.

There's no other movie like this one,"John Carpenter's The Thing Is a great classic that not that many people have seen today and for those how have seen this you know what I mean. What makes this film so great is that its so different from any movie I have ever seen. For the most part horror films have bad story telling, bad acting and is usually just bad. Thats not The Thing, The Thing is really a true masterpiece. Everything about it is just perfect, the acting, the directing, the writing just everything about this movie is perfect. The best thing about this movie would have to be the atmosphere in this movie. It feels like your in the middle of nowhere and this thing is around imitating things. I mean it could be anyone it could be you and you wont even Know that its you infected. The musical score by Ennio Morricone is spectacular and one of the best ever. The main part of the score is just to very low bass notes that just puts you in the awkward feeling that you know something bad is going to happen.

"Forget E.T, The Thing is The Real Alien Film of 1982.","John Carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of Sci-Fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it to the extreme. A remake of the Howard Hawks produced 1951 original, Carpenter keeps the Cold-War themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the Antarctic setting. Carpenter's direction as always is excellent as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body takeover. But here and much like the work of David Cronenberg, Carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident, as through some fantastic special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore. However, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A masterwork of horror atmosphere and special effects,"No horror movie brings you quite the icy, venereal chill of John Carpenter's The Thing. It's an undisputed horror classic that has lived on since it's slightly anticlimactic, ill received release back in the 80's (people didn't know a good fright flick when they saw it back then, I guess). Nevertheless, it's a heart stopping odyssey of ambient antarctic unease, sickening, squirm inducing practical effects, and a veil of impending danger and paranoia that blankets both the characters and the viewer, like the thick drifts of snow that blanket the screen to gorgeous effect. The story by now is timeless: a team of antarctic researchers in a remote location come across a gigantic spacecraft buried in the tundra, and unearth a grotesque, frozen creature that upon being thawed, wreaks havoc on them and their facility. It's an imitator, this monster, and can hide in plain sight, within the flesh and blood of any one of their crew. This gives way to extreme distrust, mental unraveling and mutiny as it turns them against one another. For me there's nothing quite as iconic as the opening: Ennio Morricone's ominous, rhythmical score kicks in as we see two hysterical Norwegians in a helicopter, Chasing a dog across the frozen terrain. It's one of the most dazzling, evocative entrances to a fright flick ever filmed. Kurt Russell, in his whiskered, macho glory plays Macready, the head of the team. Russell is always solid, especially in genre stuff, and he's almost as distinct and iconic here as his Snake Plissken character. T.K. Carter, Donald Moffat, Keith David Wilford Brimley and more round out the rest of the team, and I won't mention standouts because they're all just fantastic and each play their part to a T. A huge highlight is the gruesome creature effects. When the it tries to imitate something and messes up, the result is a grossly misshapen slab of slimy nondescript gore, guaranteed to freak and gross you out in equal measures. I won't spoil anything with specifics, but the dog kennel and defibrillator scenes are time capsule worthy and should be shown in special effects makeup schools as a shining example. Carpenter pulls off the second absolutely flawless horror movie of his career with this one, not an easy feat, especially in this genre. All the parts fit together perfectly, resulting in as chilling sci fi horror for the ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Classic, one of the best","I think this is one of the best sci-fi horror movies ever. The setting is brilliant, the isolation is total and the paranoia feels believable. The creature itself without giving too much away has a very simple and understandable desire to survive. You can imagine if it had ended up somewhere less remote and although you get little information about its origins it doesn't matter because like the aliens in the movie Aliens you know enough about it to know it's damn scary.The effects have held up fairly well, there are bits that still make me jump but the point is that it's a very well told story and the characters are likable and though thinly sketched also feel like real people. I loved this movie and I have watched it many times since it came out, if you haven't seen it then treat yourself to a night of quality entertainment.I'd rate this gem as highly as Aliens, it's simply brilliant and the dogs acting easily beats most of Hollywoods current 'talent' hands or paws down.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This is how a movie is made,"I vote this movie ten out of ten because of the great cast and also the great suspenseful creepy feel of the film the whole deep undertones of the score of the movie keeps you very interested in whats going to happen next every time I watch it. You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror. He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to keep watching.You could really tell that there was chemistry on the set between the actors in this film. A perfect combination of great talent great directing and great film work. I always love revisiting this horror classic remake of the original black and white film. Has so much more power than the original because back then Hollywood was so afraid of the world and as I watch old films that are in black and white it's almost as though they dumb down the audiences even though they were much smarter than they thought. Hollywood was different back then they couldn't do anything remotely bold on screen back then because of being afraid it would get banned. Well in this version Hollywood has evolved thanks to movies like the Exorcist,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien. They have become much more liberal.That's the reason why this film works so well, it's because Mr. Carpenter took a movie and did the things that the original directors couldn't do like add gore and more abstract ideas because back then they couldn't. Another reason why it works is because it's a great story to tell, just ask the question what would you do in this situation stranded in the middle of nowhere being attacked by an organism that adapts to everything it touches. That's what makes this classic retelling so good it's just a movie that has a simple idea and let's the paranoia grow in your mind. Knowing that if the thing touches you your life is going to be mimicked into something that you do not know. I will always love this version don't care about future remakes won't watch it because they will just fill it with CGI and actors from popular teen dramas that's all Hollywood cares about now is how popular the actors are.They don't care about real story telling anymore all they care about is money and popularity. Screw that I'll stick with the classics until they realize what people like and crave so screw Hollywood they don't know how to make pictures anymore it's not about the art it's about cheap thrown together remakes and what makes a quick buck screw'em I'll just keep watching these great masterpieces when they still loved to make a great movie and put their heart and soul into it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A little underwhelming,"I'm actually very torn by how I feel about this film. On the one hand, I absolutely love this type of horror. And I thought that technically speaking this film was spectacular. Everything from the practical effects and the constrained location to the moody soundtrack and acting was spot on. But on the other hand, I just didn't feel much of anything while watching The Thing.Perhaps the biggest problem was my expectations. For years now, I have been hearing nothing but great things about this film and admittedly, my expectations were as high as they get. Also, I didn't really know what this film was about apart from some vague idea I had. And perhaps another problem was that I really wanted to like this film. But if I'm honest with myself, I ended up being a little disappointed.I just didn't find this movie to be particularly scary or tense. There are some incredible sequences such as the one where they test the blood. But for the most part, I felt like I was watching just a pretty ordinary drama with some gory practical effects that ended up doing quite little for me. And perhaps that is the problem. I just feel like I'm so used to seeing much more brutal stuff even on the news, that I just can't appreciate films like these as much as I should.Nevertheless, I'll have to rewatch this film in the future. Now that I know what it's about, I'm hoping that I can appreciate it more. Because The Thing is a movie that I would absolutely want to love. It does so much so incredibly right.For now, though, take that rating with a pinch of salt. I'm anything but sure about how I feel about this film and what I should rate it as. One thing's for sure though, Carpenter is quickly becoming one of my favourite directors and I can't wait to see his other films. And even if I didn't enjoy or appreciate The Thing as much as I perhaps should've, it is a movie that I will more than happily watch again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good but still prefer the original..,"The original 1951 version while dated has always remained one of my favorites. That movie approached it as more of a science fiction story than the horror movie that John Carpenter made.. While this 1982 version was not the exact same storyline, it took the premise of what the original offered then ran with it.. If you go back and look at the original what made it really stand out was the crisp and intelligent dialog that went on though out the movie.. The 1982 version seemed more like a bunch of cowboys on ice rather than intelligent beings and scientists battling a being from another world. Not to say that I didn't enjoy it but for me visual scares do not put fear into me as much as that of an unknown terror approaching. Carpenter's version had the visuals but for me lacked suspense and intelligence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Barf-bag splatter flick: Cult film but no classic.,"John Carpenter's update of 'Who Goes There' and 'The Thing From Another World' came out 31 years ago to seemingly little fan-fare and even less critical reception. Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.' released the same year was a more popular take on the alien invasion story. Apparently people weren't too keen on seeing hideous creatures from outer space wreaking havoc in the same way.Which is a shame, because 'The Thing' has a lot going for it. The opening sequence with a pair of Norwegians in a helicopter chasing down a sled dog, with the steady synthesized beat of the soundtrack, proves something eerie, and leads into a brilliant set up.Unfortunately, once things go wrong and sh*t hits the fan, the paper thin characterizations of the cast come to the forefront. All of these 'scientists' and researchers on this base are rather bland, and the viewer never gets a sense of having known these guys. For example, in 'Alien', you feel like there is real camaraderie among the crew of the Nostromo, with subtle rivalries and edgy small talk providing so much detail and backstory to their characters (much of it ad libbed). But in 'The Thing', you never get a chance to hear these guys talk, or develop as interesting human beings at all. The most you see is them playing ping pong or getting high. The only insightful one is Kurt Russell's ""Macready"". Everyone else is simply fodder for the alien.Carpenter seems to rely on mantaining the viewer's interest with the next highly inventive, but over the top special effects gore scene. Some say that ""the less you see, the more frightening it is"". Well someone forgot to tell Carpenter this on set, because each creature appearance is gooier and more in-your-face than the last. Even worse is the concept of the shape-shifting alien itself. It seemingly has the ability to transform into whatever shape with whatever powers it wants. A lot of it seems to depend on the amount of material (people) it absorbs, but in some cases the survival of the characters seems entirely arbitrary and not down to the rules that should have been established in the beginning. The main concept is that each piece of the alien is a living whole. But the film doesn't account for the idea that even the tiniest, invisible molecules that float through the air are part alien. And if the alien transmits itself through bodily fluids, why can't it just breathe onto someone and absorb them that way.Because of this and the weakly written roles, the atmosphere of paranoia and claustrophobia that should be developing is instead undercooked, and leads to many of the characters going crazy and acting unrealistically way too soon.It's literally only 10 minutes into the assimilation process, when one key scientist character realizes that mankind would be doomed within a year of the alien reaching the mainland. So what does he do? Round everyone up like a sensible person and try to weed out the alien? No, he suddenly destroys the radio and the helicopter, therefore dooming his companions to be trapped on a remote base with an enemy they can't see. Oh, and he tries to kill them all.Of course, the alien isn't too smart either. Rather than laying low and maintaining its disguise, it would rather transform at the most inopportune moments to get itself destroyed.Honestly, the film has little depth to its story or plot, and is really just a B-grade slasher flick, like Carpenter's last film 'Halloween'. With characters that seemingly want to die, how else could you describe it?",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
When the Remake is a Masterpiece,"In Antarctica, in 1982the team of the American Research Center witnesses a Norwegian helicopter hunting down a dog with a sniper.

The pace, editing, direction, performances and creature effects are all top notch.

In typical Carpenter style, the ending is so ambiguous that over the years I think I've probably imagined 10 different scenarios of what happens next.The critics at the time have been proven wrong (surprise!) as it has become a true classic of the genre and my love for it only grows with each watching.

Monumental classic in every sense of the word,"'The Thing' is a remake of the 1951 flick 'The Thing from Another World' and this must be if not one of the ultimate sci-fi horror classics. The movie is an intense monster feature directed by legendary horror director John Carpenter that's presented in a paranoid infused landscape of isolation and horrific sights with production drenched in an eerie foreboding atmosphere that's felt throughout its runtime.The plot follows an American research team stationed in Antarctica as they come across a disturbing discovery of a shape shifting alien being that starts to kill of the crew and assume their appearance of each victim.The real star of this flick are the outstanding special effects and the mind-blowing creature design that's wonderfully convincing as it goes from grotesque to disturbing with a wild array of morbid transformations that are genuinely unsettling and detailed to perfection. Everything works in this flick with the claustrophobic shots, the stunning landscapes and the incredible atmosphere that creates a thick ambiance, as well as the compelling mystery which is perfectly paced and keeps you guessing as to who has been consumed by the creature. The haunting original score by music legend Ennio Morricone perfectly reflects the paranoid delusion that's so well crafted on the screen and beautifully the synth scores with John Carpenters stylish filmmaking.The cast here are stellar with Kurt Russell taking on the lead role of RJ MacReady and of course being no stranger to John Carpenter's distinct style, he's fantastic in this role, deadly serious and extremely charismatic with that cool deadpan manner he commands your attention and truly shines in this iconic role. The movie's ensemble cast is what allows this movie to thrive thanks to the excellent characters. The standouts are Wilford Brimley as Dr Blair, Keith Davids as the cool and hot-tempered Childs, Donald Moffat as Garry, T. K Carter as the cook Nauls and Richard Dysart as Dr Cooper, this cast really does a remarkable job with the material as they each inject a sense of ambiguity to their roles.Overall 'The Thing' is just a pure masterpiece through and through, a true gem for any fans of horror and YES this is John Carpenter's finest movie of his directional career.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

He builds the plot well, meticulously setting the scene and ramping up the tension with good effect. The period where anyone could be infected / inhabited is particularly suspenseful.Excellent special effects, especially for 1982. Very gory, imaginative and realistic. Some of the images from the movie are quite iconic and will be familiar from pop culture, they've been reused so much.Ending is maybe a bit too ambiguous for my liking. While I don't generally like neat, happy Hollywood endings, this possibly went too much in the opposite direction.

Easily Carpenter's best,"'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or 'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York, Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing' came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra- Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best John Carpenter movie.'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly. There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie. He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie. The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status. The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror movies ever made.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

It's great on so many levels, I'm having trouble deciding what I will start with.All right, first of all, the story is great. We follow a group of researchers, on expedition in Antarctica, far away from civilization. The thought of being helpless in freezing cold conditions without the chance of getting any help is disturbing enough. And as an extra layer of complexity, we have the paranoia and mind-bending element of who-can-I-trust?. Since the group is faced with a never-before seen threat that spreads like a virus no-one knows what to do or who to trust. And the longer times go, and the more of the crew gets tainted by the alien, the more the paranoia grows.I think essentially why I love this movie so much is because I always try and imagine myself in their situation. Would I panic? Would I turn into MacReady or would I become ""the thing""? I get goose bumps just thinking about it.The score, for once not made by John Carpenter, is really really good. We usually hear Ennio Morricone's music in western movies, but he has done a tremendous job with the music to The Thing. Since the music is so essential to the feeling of a certain film, the composer has a crucial task upon him. Morricone made it with brilliance and finesse, and the mood of the picture hits you right at the first credits. Awesome!So the special effects might not be comparable with todays CGI technology. That doesn't matter, really, in my opinion. It's not only the realism in monsters that decide how good the scares are in all horror movies. Really good horror movies can always depend on the mood setting, the story and the (un)expectation from the viewer. And those things are all as good as they can be in The Thing. Also, the effects aren't bad to begin with, I just wanted to prove a point.The ending is fantastic. MacReady does the right thing, and ends the film being a hero. He knew his life (or any other's) couldn't be saved, but instead of crawling into a corner and cry like a little baby he did the only right thing. He went out and put an end to the whole thing by blowing up the place, leaving nothing but the bister winter to keep him company (and Childs who cared to show up some explosions too late). When the end credits roll I'm really impressed by this movie. It has me captured frame-by-frame all through the runtime every time I see it.The Thing undoubtedly has an important quality -- it makes you think and it makes you involved, and it makes you want to watch compellingly all the way to the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
why Oscars will never recognise horrors is EFFIN beyond me,"SMALL SPOILERS This film is an awesome film.AN - AWESOME- FILMNever mind the mind blowing, age defying special effects.Never mind the horror/sci fi concept of a creature that violently copies its' victims.Never mind the homage/remake factor of paying homage to 'IT CAME FROM...' style movies.THIS IS AN AWESOME FILM!The script is tight and gives a convincing frame to the visual shocks.The cinematography plays tricks and entices and confronts the viewer.The soundtrack is underscored, yet foreboding - enhancing the action.The performances are solid - swaying between cliché and convincing in a totally competent manner.It ticks all the boxes for an awesome FILM.Because it is an awesome film.First and foremost.Horror and sci fi are sadly sidelined.

You've gotta see this. Amazing on every viewing.,"I don't think there's much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said.This phenomenon of a picture has two main selling points:The magnificent practical affects that make a lot of recent stuff feel old fashioned. I feel like I could reach out and touch the things being show (and I could have if I was there). The technical proficiency and the grotesque imagination is perfect for anyone who obsesses over strange organisms. It's striking no matter how many times I rewatch it.The other selling point is that we have a solid piece of horror story telling here. In the isolated wilderness, the routine lives of some scientists finds something that they could never have anticipated. From the very earliest scenes with a helicopter shooting at a dog there is a feeling of unease and mystery that quietly festers among an oblivious crew (but who could have seen it coming)?It loses none of its power as it transitions from chiller, to science fiction masturbilia to taut thriller where you don't know who to trust.If you haven't seen it just see it. This will still be fresh 50 years from now because of its intelligent, folkloric writing and expertise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Enemy Is Us...,"Director John Carpenter's THE THING has lost none of its impact over the years. The groundbreaking practical effects set the standard for all ""monster horror"" films of the 1980's and beyond. In addition, the isolation, the barren, frozen surroundings, and the all-male cast, including Kurt Russell, Keith David, and Wilford Brimley, make the setting more like a prison than an Antarctic outpost. Cooped up together for months in this small, dull space, would be enough to drive anyone crazy. Then, add in the most dangerous creature ever to land on Earth, and all bets are off!The ensuing paranoia and terror find fertile ground in the minds of these men. When they should be banding together to face the threat, they are torn apart by something among them... in them... as them.From the classic opening, with the dog and that minimalist score, we know we're in for something different. Many critics hated this movie when it came out, probably because it was such a bold departure from the original movie. Some have since repented.The aforementioned effects, complete with insane, impossible creations in goo and slime, were certainly overlooked by the shortsighted. For fans, this is the True North of all practical FX movies. Carpenter's masterpiece...",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A masterpiece of its genre,"I watched this film for the first time in 2022, exactly 40 years after its release. John Carpenter has created a masterpiece that will last forever, partly because there are no CGI effects in this film, so everything seems more real and therefore scarier, and partly because film effects are outstanding. This film puts forth a lot talent in all departments but what singles it out for me is the story. It really jumps off the screen and let's you maintain a close relationship with the characters but also remain separate enough to just observe the situation. This atmospheric film will forever sink into the parts of your mind, and live in you without you even noticing ;)",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Thing,"The Thing is one of John Carpenter's best films, such a great achievement in special effects. Makes me wish films today were still this creative and practical without relying on too much CGI. The special effects look super gross and gnarly. The kills in The Thing are a thing of beauty, it is pretty frightening and holds up really well even by today's standards. The Thing is a great creature feature filled with tension and suspense. The movie builds slowly and creates a great sense of paranoia amongst the characters and has you guessing who is not human. Perfectly cast and love the setting in Antarctica. It's a pretty grim tale and isolating the characters in Antarctica makes their fates feel pretty hopeless. The drama in this is pretty compelling while Kurt Russell is the lead protagonist by no means is he a good guy and has flaws. This movie is about survival of the fittest and an all time classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A perfect movie👌,"The thing is about some guys at a base in Antarctica trying to find out who is the thing.The thing is a shapeshifter and it can be killed by fire.What i like about the movie is, the acting, all the actors are good ecpecially Kurt Russel, i love the characters they are all memorable and it's entertaining to watch them trying to find out who is the thing.The plot is great, the effects are probably the best part of the movie and John Carpenter was the perfect director for it.The movie is one of the few movies that i actually tought was kind of scary.There is nothing i don't like about the movie either so that's a rare bonus.🔪

Horror how it should be,"The 80s were a decade of pure entertainment. No dumb political ideologies, entertainment first, you could say. The Thing is such a movie because its primary. Intention is to entertain the audience with a compelling, tenseful horror story. And the movie does that very good. The great Kurt Russel delivers again with extraordinary acting. The setting is well choosen and creates, together with the maestro's brilliant score, a mysterious and dangerous atmosphere. The monster looks great, visual effects also deliver.So that's for the entertainment part. There is of course the other, deeper part of the movie, yet another feature of the 80s. If you think deeper the 80s will always give you moral lessons and, like in the Thing, an ending that lets you think about its meaning. This is what makes this movie a great horror film, because you do not really know if the monster is dead or oone of the two survivors.To summarize it up, watch the Thing, it's a classic that defined the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
How Is This In The IMDb Top 250?,"This could easily have been a Star Trek episode and have been wrapped up in half the time. If only they had a universal translator or spoke Norwegian! The Thing may have been state of the art in 1982, but it just looks cheap in the 21st century where we are used to awesome CGI effects.I cannot believe that these men are ""researchers"" – they seem more guys you would find in a police station, both the cops and the criminals. So, you can get high at the research station? And roller skate around it? Not very professional, indeed.Kurt Russell channels Escape from New York's Snake Plissken for John Carpenter who directed both films. How does Kurt's R.J.

"Like the scares and paranoia, but it peters out to the end","I first say this movie on a projection screen at a Take 1 arcade in the early 80's.  Can't believe I saw it uncut, either.  Perhaps the owners felt the sound from Battlezone and Pac Man would drown out the profanity from young ears.At the time, I certainly found it frightening, but with time, and repeated viewings, I have to wonder about some of the director's choices.  Could someone *please* explain to me why a civilian research station is heavily armed with firearms, not to mention flamethrowers?  I mean, c'mon, I can understand maybe a shotgun, but flamethrowers?  Were penguins that much of a threat to their survival?Yes, the original ""Thing"" from 1951 may not have the gore and body count, but you can't beat the fact that they were lightly armed, even for military personnel, and had to use what was at hand to battle the creature.  Here, whatever they need is thrown their way.  It's hard to beat the orignal folks fighting off the creature with buckets of kerosene and flare guns in a confined space.If Carpenter really wanted to impress me, he would have done away with the firepower and focused more on a group of lightly/unarmed scientists improvising their survival as in the earlier film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

So is the computer ""simulation"" calculating the risk that one of the members in the expedition is infected, and how many hours until the entire world population is wiped out.I rented it to be scared, but there wasn't a moment that I was scared or even excited.I give the team credits for the special effects, but that doesn't make up for an uninteresting story and the above-mentioned laughable parts.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Milestone,"This is a note-perfect film, from beginning to end.

You did see it parodied on South Park (perhaps) last night, but in the context of this paranoic film, it's the best scene of many outstanding scenes.I've had the pleasure of seeing the 50's original on the big screen. John Carpenter purportedly idolizes Howard Hawks, but he surpasses his hero with this ""remake."" The 1950's version is something special, a time-capsule treasure of Hollywood's yesteryear - Carpenter's The Thing is the essential telling of the story.Enjoy for all the years to come.

John Carpenter's masterpiece of paranoia!,"Unfortunately I spend much of my time berating John Carpenter in regards to his recent lazy and mediocre efforts. What a refreshing change it is to relive his earlier  seminal work and remember just why he once had a reputation as one of America's most exciting and inventive film makers! 'The Thing' is quite possible the best movie Carpenter has ever made, and sadly it seems, ever will make. He is at the height of his powers with this dark, tense and claustrophobic thriller, and is blessed with a superb ensemble cast, and (a rarity for him these days) a decent script will believable, fully rounded characters. Kurt Russell gives his best work for Carpenter here, in arguably his strongest performance to date. The supporting cast is flawless, and includes fine character actors such as Wilford Brimley ('Cocoon'), Keith David ('Dead Presidents'), Richard Dysart ('Being There'), Richard Masur ('Who'll Stop The Rain)', and Donald Moffat ('The Right Stuff'). I highly recommend the DVD version of this movie which features one of the most entertaining and informative commentaries I've ever heard. (from Carpenter and Russell) Much maligned when it was first released, 'The Thing' now looks like a masterpiece of paranoid science fiction, one of the very few remakes that surpasses the original version, and absolutely essential viewing for any self respecting horror or SF fan. It really doesn't get much better than this! Highly recommended!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"""And it's gonna get a hell of a lot worse before it gets any better!""","A helicopter chases a husky across the frozen landscape of Antarctica. The two Norwegians chasing the dog seem intent on killing it. The dog makes a bee-line for the American science station in what appears to be an attempt to seek safety. But is that really the dog's purpose? The Americans discover the dog's true mission only after it's too late.I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I hadn't seen The Thing since its initial theatrical run. Because so much of the movie had slowly slipped from my memory, I have never placed it on a ""favorites"" list (until now). In fact, I had forgotten more of the movie than I remembered. I can promise that I won't wait another 23 years for my third viewing. The Thing is a no-holds-barred journey though some of the best that sci-fi, horror, and action have to offer. The movie never lets up and rarely gives the viewer a chance to catch a breath.If you haven't seen this movie in a while (as I hadn't), the special effects will surely have stuck with you. They're gross, disturbing, and an excellent argument against the overuse of CGI in horror movies. Rob Bottin should have won an Academy Award for his special effects work on The Thing.But it takes more than effects and gore to make a ""good"" movie. It's the interaction between the characters and their real feelings of mistrust that elevates The Thing to the lofty status it has achieved. These are men who have worked together in extremely close quarters with little outside contact. Trust is important in this kind of atmosphere. But when it becomes clear that there may be a problem with various members of the group, they're quick to turn on one another to save their own necks. The paranoia is fascinating to watch.As far as I'm concerned, The Thing's ending is perfect. Too many movies attempt to spoon-feed viewers the answer to every question raised in the movie. The Thing leaves you with as many questions as it does answers. Good call, Carpenter!I only have one minor quibble with the movie and it's based as much on my recent viewing of The Thing from Another World as anything. Try as I might, I can't help compare the two movies. I would have really appreciated a better opportunity in The Thing to get to know who these men are. The characters can be described as paper thin. The 1951 movie was more character driven, and as a result, I cared more for the characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Good Horror in its Purest Form,"I just finished watching John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" for at least the 25th time. I've been a huge fan of the flick since the mid 80s (I had a mad teenage crush on Kurt Russell at the time, thanks to ""Escape from New York""), and I considered the John Carpenter / Kurt Russell association to be a winning one.I'm not shocked or horrified by the gore anymore, but that's only because I've seen it so many times. The gore is totally believable, and slightly understated (considering the subject matter), and there is no end to my amazement that it's just as good - if not better - than the cookie-cutter CGI horror flicks that have been released more recently. This movie holds up to anything recent in the genre, and will probably continue to do so for quite some time.Russell does a great job (as he always does, regardless of the Grizzly Adams impression in this one), Keith David (I'm a big fan of his voice work) is outstanding...Wilford Brimley was a bit of an odd choice for this flick, even though he does do a good job. You think of the Quaker Oats / Diabetes Test Equipment guy playing that sort of role...it's a bit of a head-scratcher.My point, I guess, is this: I've seen this movie many, many times, and it still holds my attention. No sexual tension, no political intrigue...just a bunch of guys playing with flame throwers and bad-tempered aliens. And the ending is phenomenal!!!!!! The only reason I didn't give it a higher score is because there are obviously many movies out there that ARE perfect 10s, such as: Hitchcock's Rebecca, the LOTR trilogy, American History X and the Shawshank Redemption. But John Carpenter's the Thing is definitely high on my horror list! Though it isn't my perfect 10, I still give it 2 thumbs up from my thumb and my other thumb. There you have it.

Sci-Fi / Horror that hits all the right chords!,"At a remote Antarctic research station a twelve-man American research party encounter some crazy Norwegians chasing a dog near their campsite. After shooting one of their team members, the Norwegian is shot dead. Trying to discover what made them turn out like this they head to their station, but instead they find something of unknown origin slightly burned up outside in the snow. They bring it back to find out that it's some sort of alien form that's fused together human parts. After more research into it they find out it was buried in the ice for centuries and that it's an aggressive shape-shifter. Soon enough it starts imitating the inhabitants of the base. Causing strained tension and hostile confrontations as everyone starts to turn on each other.Halloween might have been my first John Carpenter experience, but it was this one, which blew me away and got me really into the horror genre. ""The Thing"" used to always get played on late night TV and I never missed the opportunity to sit up and watch it. I always believed that it's the best time to watch this cult classic and on this occasion I did the same again, but I had to watch it on DVD this time around. Since this basically bombed at the box-office, because of the bad timing of its released. With it coming out straight after 'ET'. Pretty much it was suicide. But gradually over the years this has deservedly become a cult favourite through video amongst horror and Sci-Fi fans. The film still holds up remarkably well today and surely was unfairly dismissed when it came out. Also the poster artwork for the film is one of the best I've seen. Carpenter was on a great trot at the time and definitely was at his pinnacle, with such films like 'Escape from New York', 'The Fog', 'Halloween' and 'Assault on Precinct 13' coming before it.'The Thing' is a experimental remake of Howard Hawk's 'The Thing from another World', but instead Carpenter was far more faithful to John W. Campbell's story ""Who goes there"", by getting the alien to conceal itself inside it's victim and never seeing the being in its natural form. Compared with the walking vegetable that had a striking resemblance to Frankenstein in Hawk's version. It's hard not to compare the two, with each one having a stronger point over the other, but for me I have to go with the '82' version. Anyhow, I just gotta say I love the burning imprint of the film's title in the opening. That scene alone sends chills down my spine and tells you what's to come.The story is far from groundbreaking, but the same can't be said about Rob Bottin's daring make-up effects, which simply are astoundingly revolting. Even today they still hold a huge amount of impact in creating a horrific vibe. Really, these grotesque monster effects are incredibly menacing and freaky, but heck these creations are ugly. The gore is worked in rather nicely, with enough blood splatter involved. Like I said the story isn't something out of the ordinary, but the paranoia part of it is beautifully constructed. This is helped by a well diverse group of moody characters that start losing it slowly and Carpenter turns up the notch by seemingly tightening the confines, where the feel of isolation and tension is sustained to the very end. I thought the ambiguity of the conclusion was fitting enough to the overall context. Claustrophobic brilliance on Carpenter's part. Even the story can be class a metaphor about trust and how it's not so easy to come by now. Carpenter creates a very sombre and downbeat atmosphere that goes very well with the cold conditions of the setting. Underneath it all it has an apocalyptic awe about it, where it looks like there's nothing anybody can do about this concealed being. What complements the chilling feel of dread is Ennio Morricone's throbbing score that's simply sublime in awe. The score packs a real unsteadiness and showers the flick with such vigorousness. Pretty much it does alienate you to what's happening on screen.The performances are reasonably solid, though nothing really to write home about. Kurt Russell is perfect as the lead figure and his charismatic presence proves it. The rest are nothing more than pawns in this game of control. They do seem a little bit more one-dimensional, but still they give such raw performances that add more to the realism factor. Also the chemistry between the men is quite believable. Although, one thing that kept on bugging me, was why they would go off alone when that creature is on the loose. Although that helped on the red herrings and crackling suspense. Where the film stumbles a bit, can be found on the script. The characters were more full and dialogue less stilted, in Howard's film. That's were I thought ""The Thing from another World"" really had the wood over ""The Thing"". It built more on the characters. But saying that there was enough suspense built up and sardonic wit in the dialog here. The heated dialog did really warmed up proceedings. The production design is perfect in every inch. From the assured cinematography with many neat angle shots to the creepy, but authentic looking station and its dark and freezing corridors. Another thing to touch a nerve were the echoing sound effects, with the gusty wind making a big impression and the eerie howling from the thing just makes your hairs stand up. Carpenter's ace direction manages to mix gruesome images with psychological elements to achieve an sensational viewing that makes you grab hold of anyone/anything tightly and leaves you with some memorable sequences fresh in mind.A definite Horror / Sci-Fi milestone. Sure it isn't flawless, but it's crafted with a passion to shock, but also compel.

Standing the test of time,"I saw this for the first time this morning. Obviously I'd heard of it years ago, it being generally held as a classic and all, but had somehow never had the opportunity to watch it until I was loaned the DVD. Not being a massive fan of John Carpenter's work (Michael Myers and Snake Plissken don't really impress me) I wasn't expecting much, without even considering the 80s music and effects. However, in honesty, I was pleasantly surprised. Whilst too many years have passed for the effects to scare or horrify, they at least manage to stay the right side of laughable, so there was no unintentional comedy. The cast was well chosen and stuck to their jobs, and the film was pleasingly bleak and effective. I am not sure that it is quite the classic that I'd been led to believe (maybe you had to see it in '82?) but it is a good solid movie, and worth a watch for anyone else who has gaps in their film history.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"""What you fear most.. is among you""","Long story short: I had large expectations for this film. It's been coined one of the scariest films of all time. The Shining and Exorcist are also coined the same thing, which are actually scary. It had a great plot. I loved the whole mystery thing it had going on, not knowing what 'it' is. And it was made by John Carpenter. He's the director who has created the iconic character of Michael Myers and made the classic horror film. So with all these added up, I was really excited to see what was to come. It had all these things that had it coming, but here's the biggest shocker: it was horrible.The Thing has all the components of a horror film, and the strangest thing is that it uses them, but for what reason? So the beginning was done fantastic. My expectations were huge, kept me wondering what this film could do. Ready to be scared off my seat. But maybe my expectations were too high.. Carpenter thinks he can create an eerie feeling throughout the entire thing, which he's half right/half wrong. The sense of paranoia IS there, but it just dies down every time something happens. Carpenter also takes the gimmicky effect of gore itself, and uses it to make these far-fetched images, that he thinks will scare us, but then comes off a bit silly. One scene was this guys turn into some crawling creature, which way back in 1982 would surely look stupid. And it does. And Carpenter's vision of aliens itself are just absurd. I imagine aliens as short, green fellows with one eye and a laser gun; the stereotypical vision of them. Carpenter thinks they are shape-shifting guys that we never get to see. And that's the problem with me. Carpenter uses the gimmick to not show the aliens, which sort of comes of as a mixture of stupid and curiosity, but for me? I sat in half-confusion, half-bored. There was no sense of tension between the characters, and the slow-burn pacing never helped either.So I wouldn't recommend The Thing. It's cracked up to be one of the greatest horror films of all time, but it never ever shows this. It's was boring, slow, pointless, and tension-less. It's not even one of those horror films that you want to watch with your friends, because all you would be doing is watching the gross-out scenes that seamlessly go nowhere. If you loved Halloween, and hate the gimmicky effect of gore, The Thing will be hated by you. If you hate Halloween, love gore, love horror movies that come out today, then this is your sort of film. I didn't like it, my opinion, my fact. The end.4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A dark calculating plunge into the depths of human fear and paranoia,"The first night I watched this film I had a genuine nightmare. No film before or since has given me nightmares and this illustrates how powerful this dynamic film is. The setting is isolated in the wastes of oblivion, the music a echo to the primal heartbeat of human fear, the violence and gore gritty and realistic, the absence of special effects for the better. But what I find so brilliant about this film is its systematic annihilation of one of the core human emotions which is trust. This film brilliantly replaces this void with pure and undistilled paranoia, and in the context of this film this becomes far more powerful than any other weapon to terrify audiences. Combine this with the perpetual mental and physical isolation that this film creates and you have a masterpiece of not just science fiction horror but of human fear. And will leave you looking over your shoulders for what lurks in the darkness - Trust me.If you liked this try the shinning 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely amazing entry without any real flaws,"A group of scientists at an Arctic research base find themselves under attack by a shape-shifting alien creature that mimics anything it touches, leading them to struggle to know who's-who in the fight against the creature.This is a wonderfully impressive and utterly fun entry, with a lot to love about it. The fact that it manages to capture an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere, from the extreme isolation of the situation to a series of brilliant set-pieces at the end to ensure that it'll be impossible to determine who's what when it comes down to figuring out the identity of the alien in disguise amongst them. Chief among these, and a film highlight in its own sense, is the classic blood-test sequence, which is just marvelously done and never once gives away it's secret twist, which is highly creative and makes the film all the better when it's followed by a scene of incredible imagination with its disembodied head gag. It's a running theme throughout the film, of intense suspense followed by rather impressive special effects to punctuate it, all done convincingly and never really allowed to dominate one way over the other in the film. It's action is unparalleled, as the finale is a huge fire-filled battle in the basement, and it's never clear who will win out, and earlier battles are just as impressive as the film utilizes a rather oft-overlooked technique of making something to be feared known to loose in a situation where they can't escape, using the situation to its advantage throughout and never letting it go. Even the gore is impressive, offering tons of splatter to shoot across with reckless abandon and making for a never-ending series of great kills. One of the most impressive films in the genre.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and animals-in-peril",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Near-perfect horror,The shots are perfect. The build suspense with their slow tracking and are perfectly planned with a great beginning and ending. This has to be one of the nicest shot films of this type. It started using the surround a lot but slowly became quite front-heavy. The sound was lacking in dynamic range and sounded eighties in the technical quality. The music was mostly really good but occasionally a bit dated. Dialogue was perfect except afore-mentioned technical problems. This is the definition of paranoid suspense horror. It builds on an idea into terror with perfect film-crafting. The acting is amazing and each character is distinct. The special effects are real and harrowing. Some scenes are so intense that it is almost impossible to take! A near-perfect horror that transcends its b-movie roots.,9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

My favorite horror movie of all time.,The story is done really well and is developed throughout. It's interesting with a movie about a alien parasite that imitates other organisms and the characters trying to stop it. The creepiness factor works really well on how its mostly paranoia on how the characters starting to learn that they no longer trust each other due to one of them being a imitation. We see how the characters try to figure who is a imitation and how to survive against it. And they make a couple of good decisions throughout that helps them stay living for a while. The atmosphere works out well with it taking place in a isolated environment with no way on escaping and how cold is it. Also the movie have a lot of suspenseful moments in it and makes the climax really enjoyable. One thing this movie does is having mystery to it. There's about four scenes that left a mystery and it's never revealed who or what happened in that current scene. It works really well over the atmosphere of the movie and its really fun to come up with theories for each of these mysterious scenes and try to figured out what really happened.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
a seminal gore-fest that beckons a glut of imitations in the years to come,"Turning Antarctica into fire and brimstone, John Carpenter's analog-era paranoia horror classic THE THING boosts a smorgasbord of eye-popping special make-up effects predominantly fashioned by a 21-year-old Rob Bottin, these human-things, dog-things, assimilated by an unknown, amorphous alien life form, aka, the thing, are gooey, gross-out but also drolly camp without a sinister layer of menace, the truth is, once the thing reveals its true color out of its host's body, most of the time, it is too maladroit to escape from being incinerated by flamethrowers, so the imperative for it is to hide in plain sight among its human hosts, a group of a dozen (male exclusive) American researchers stationed in their secluded antarctic base, and waits for rescue team to make it pandemic.Once audience inures to its animatronic gimmicks, the movie's scary quotient begins to lessen (save for Morricone's minimal, ominous score) and what Carpenter plays up is the burgeoning distrust among those Yankees under the bleak, claustrophobic circumstances, yet, character-molding is not right up his alley (Ridley Scott's ALIEN 1979 is a far superior antecedent), ergo THE THING is considerably deficient in ammunition of imploding conflict and treachery, and high on explosive ruckus after survivors are routinely rubbed out by ringing the changes of optical spectacles, no one is safe apart from the top billed Kurt Russell, as the helicopter pilot MacReady, who is granted with a protagonist's halo and inexplicably brainy enough to float the idea of testing remaining crew's blood to identify who has been infected, on account of the thing's innate survival instinct. However, there is a loose end in the extrapolation that MacReady has been assimilated on the ground of his torn clothes, which goes unsolved.THE THING is Carpenter's foray into studio filmmaking and it relishes in its dazzling production value, its refrigerated setting in L.A. is a huge project and the matte painting of the place where the alien life first crashed on earth significantly enhances its filmic quality, although ineluctably, an analog proto-computer is a dead giveaway of its time and superficially deployed in spoon-feeding us with information such as how fast an apocalypse is at stake if the thing gets out of the station alive.Lastly, Carpenter discloses his ace in the hole in the end, when two survivors seem to calmly wait for their slow death from cold in the now blown-up site, an ambiguous gesture may or may not intimate that one of them is infected by the thing, which beckons various theories from cult followers after its initial tepid reception, in hindsight, THE THING, a seminal gore-fest that beckons a glut of imitations in the years to come, is arguably Carpenter's best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Classic John Carpenter Masterpiece,"The Thing is a claustrophobic, paranoia-driven horror film that follows a crew of American scientists trying to fend off an extraterrestrial monster before it picks them all off, one by one.The film is incredibly grounded, in a way that increases the horror and tension surrounding our main cast. In the beginning, the story takes its time, building on the threat and fear of the creature. But this slowly transitions into a paranoia-stricken thriller that has everyone painted as a potential threat. This worked really well, keeping the audience constantly on their toes not knowing who to trust. Throughout the course of the film, there is not an incredible amount of action. The movie thrives on the tension that slowly builds through the characters distrust, but this lends itself to making the more action-packed scenes that much more effective. The prosthetic and prop department did such an incredible job on the effects. There are some really twisted scenes combining body gore and genuine horror that was ahead of its time.Technically, this film is superb. The acting is great all around, but Kurt Russell shines in this role, taking over every scene he is in. The score is subtle but adds a sense of ominousness to the film that I really appreciated. Cinematography is top notch, with some impressive set designs and creative shots that create a great amount of immersion.Overall, this film is amazing. Although it does impact me as much as Halloween did, it is still an instant classic that should go down as John Carpenter's 1B to his Halloween masterpiece.Score: 91%

The Thing,"The Thing, the 1982 film by John Carpenter came highly recommended from several close film sources in which I trust. It is a horror movie, it's directed by a horror master, what's not to love for a fan of the genre. No one was more surprised than me that The Thing couldn't even hold my attention, necessitating 3 viewings before I could complete it. Mental note: if you fall asleep during a movie not once, but twice, it just may not be the film experience for you. I persevered, however, because I truly thought I would appreciate the film. The film stars Carpenter's most often collaborator, Kurt Russell as a researcher stationed in Antarctica that is suddenly impacted by an alien life form. A seemingly engaging premise left a lackadaisical impression and further left me with the idea that I may not like John Carpenter as much as I thought I did.During the first ****amn week of winter, a team of American explorers in Antarctica are shocked to find their base being swarmed by a Norwegian helicopter from a nearby base. When the helicopter crashes, the American team goes to investigate only to discover everyone at the base dead or missing. The team does find something of interest, however, when they happen upon the burned remains of an unidentified creature. The team gathers the charred remains, and take it to the base with them where they deduce that it is an alien life form. The most shocking aspect of the remains are that the creature can assimilate into any lifeform it inhabits, and it inhabits like a virus, easily spreading to person to person. The implications of this discovery mean that any member of the team may be inhabited by The Thing, creating tension between the group as they each struggle to distinguish between the unaffected members and the ones The Thing has taken over.I don't even know where to start here. I'm not typically a science fiction fan, and this film had a much more sci-fi than horror feel to it. As far as Carpenter's other work goes, I've only seen Halloween and Big Trouble in Little China, hardly enough examples to lay blame with the director. The narrative seemed to rely largely on an ominous feeling that was never properly established. Maybe my main qualm lies with the poor title. I do know that this film is a remake, I have never seen the 1951 original, but in Carpenter's film, I never knew what I was supposed to be scared of. A shapeshifting organelle that inhabits its host without them knowing is a good premise for a fearful mood, but it never materialized as such for me. There seemed to be several opportunities for more (or better) scares that were not seized upon. I'm so disheartened to learn that the directors I thought I enjoyed were really just responsible for one or two films that I enjoyed rather than the director himself. Wes Craven immediately comes to mind as I have now seen a few of his films, none of which replicating the magic of the original A Nightmare on Elm Street, for me. Of course, I must see more of Carpenter's work before writing him off, but The Thing isn't the film to convince me to put any of his films at the top of my watchlist.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (1982) is a great movie. Tens, disturbing, excellently paced, solidly acted with great music and terrific sense of location and unforgettable practical effects its a film i watched many times and will continue to do so for years to come. Rewatching it recently on a new 4K UHD disk i found this movie to look and sound better then ever.I don't think that reason of why ""The Thing"" flopped back in 1982 was a bad timing. I think it would flop even today in 2024 if it would have been released for a first time now. The fact that a sequel / prequel ""The Thing"" (2011) flopped in movie theaters (which i did enjoy a bit honestly) just shows that people don't go watch movies like this a lot. But its a perfect film to watch it at home, and when the Halloween season comes - ""The Thing"" (1982) is a great movie to return to.Overall, there isn't much to add to praising this classic. Its a great film because of many reasons - one of the most involving and claustrophobic thrillers of all time. Its a highly rewatchable classic that should be in a collection of any movie lover.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Who is who,"John Carpenter remade Howard Hawks 1951 sci-fi film, The Thing From Another World.The film starts in the icy plains of Antarctica as a man in a helicopter is try to shoot dead a runaway dog. The dog survives as it reaches a base where some American scientists reside, the Norwegians in the helicopter do not.The dog is in fact The Thing, a being from outer space that arrived in a space ship some 100,000 years ago and remained buried in the ice in Antarctica. It looks like the Norwegian base camp uncovered it to their cost. The Thing can ingest and then assume the form of any living being whether human or animal.In some ways John Carpenter's film is similar to Alien as the members of the base camp will be knocked off one by one, not helped that they seemed to be left alone or go out on their own too many times so they can be taken over by the shape shifting creature.The film actually starts out slowly and the characters are painted in broad strokes, in short thin characterizations. There are no female characters in this film but there are two black actors in the cast, one rather stereotypical who seemed to have walked in straight from the hood listening to Stevie Wonder. Rather a few of the characters including star Kurt Russell did not convince me that they were research scientists.What the film did have was gross out special effects that would had scared the hell out of people in 1982, it certainly scared me in that era. Stretchy body parts churned inside out, gore galore, hands being severed, a head sprouting legs and walking off like a spider.What you get in grotesque special effects you lose in a coherent narrative. The film failed at the box office when the film was released but later acquired a cult following.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"even if you don't like it, you'll be mesmerized","This is one of those movies that even if you aren't a die hard fan of it, you'll still find it hard to turn away from. It is hard macho action and hard macho science fiction, and it does Carpenter a lot of justice I dare say. The old version of the Thing had an appeal to it, but so does this one. And this one I dare say has a lot of grit and excitement to it. The premise is an isolated Arcitc (or is it Antarctic? Who cares)) science team finds a frozen alien and inadvertently bring it back to life. In this version the ""Thing"" is very high on the evolutionary scale, and very tough to deal with. Each cell can act on its own, but also must respond to the other cells. I know it doesn't make sense, but it makes for one *$#* of an adversary you don't want to tangle with. It eats you and then copies your DNA so that it becomes an exact replica of you with even your memories. How can you beat something like that? Well, Kurt Russell finds a why. He drinks vodka at it! And then he gets flame throwing units to burn it. But which people are real and which are ""things""? You see the dilemma. And the script plays it for all its worth, and I dare say it plays it very well. An exciting thrill ride. The characters ring fairly true, and Carpenter, as usual, does his characters much better than most directors. I could nit pick at one flaw. It didn't ring true when a certain character froze and refused to burn up a thing, who even in human form was abusive toward s him. There's my one nit pick. Not bad for over a dozen characters in a full length film. If only other directors and writers could keep it down to one nit pick. There is a question at the end, as to whether one of the survivors might be a ""thing."" A good ambiguous ending, and enhanced by good selection of music. I think the sound effects unit deserves much praise for this film. The first time I watched it, and I've reinforced that opinion over later watchings, I thought the vodka drank by the characters at the end proved they weren't things, since alcohol kills individual cells, and the ""thing"" would not be able to tolerate it. Indeed, I believe the alien had to have a stronger weakness than just fire, or it would have taken over much easier. It did have to choose hosts that were alcohol free, because since it couldn't drink liquor, it might be found it too easily. And yes, there are no women in this movie. Which makes you feel like your watching an old war movie. Must say it is very exciting, and very mesmerizing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the most overrated films of all time,Right there are two films that i have seen SO FAR that are so overrated it is unbelievable and them two films are Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre which is probably the worst film of all time in my opinion and The Thing. The Thing is a 1982 film directed by John Carpenter (who i am a fan of) it stars Kurt Russell. The story is an alien crash lands in the middle of winter in Antarctica or somewhere i can't quite remember and it can take over the body of anyone or anything. It takes over anyone who poses a threat so it ca wipe out the enemies around it so it has won and has no more enemies.**/*****,5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

It has just the *perfect* amount of 80s cheese, without being campy.Perhaps I am biased as I love the snow. If the cold frightens you this movie will really play into that fear.

Legendary director John Carpenter uses every part of his immense talent to produce a true classic that just seems to get better with age. The camera glides from scene to scene & creates a magnificent atmosphere filled with paranoia & dread. The make up effects are a true delight created by Rob Bottin who produces some of the best effects you are ever likely see on film. On initial release The Thing was a box office failure mainly due to E.T being released at the same time which took over everything in its path.

One of the creepiest thing I have ever seen!,"This is one of the more horrific alien-themed films I have seen, a story where a team of scientists in Antarctica faces an alien who changes into the shape of living things it infects.This movie's plot is straight to-the-point with no fillers, however, the pacing is a bit slow due to the lack of character emotions and development. But, the horrifying appearances of the hideous-looking alien thing and its attack on the hapless humans make the film tense and intriguing at times. The plot element of the scientists attempting to destroy any traces of the alien before it spreads its infectious toxin to the rest of the world is an exciting one.Aside from the alien plot, much of the film has a gloomy atmosphere setting and uninteresting, bland-acting, characters that didn't carry the movie much and rendered it boring at times.

An overdosis of special effects,"In 1938 John Campbell Jr wrote the horror / science fiction novella ""Who goes there?"". In 1951 Christian Nyby adapted this novella loosely in his film ""The thing from another World"".Book and film are situated on Antartica, where a scientific crew discovers an alien (""the Thing"") that has been frozen for thousands of years. Once thawed the thing turns out to be really hostile. The location of Antartica meets a basic requirement for horror locations, it is impossibe to flee. We also see this requirement (in the form of a terrific storm) in films such as ""The old dark house"" (1932, James Whale) and ""Key Largo"" (1948, John Huston).""The thing from another World"" became one of the favourites of John Carpenter and can even be seen on television in one of the scenes of his movie ""Halloween"" (1978). In 1982 he made his own adaptation.""The Thing"" (1982, John Carpenter) is more true to the original novella than the 1951 version. In Carpenters film the Thing is capable of cloning his prey. This leads to mutual distrust among the members of the expedition. Who is still a human being and who has already been overtaken by the Thing? It is the same distrust and uncertainty that plays a major role in ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" (1956, Don Siegel).The weak spot of ""The Thing"" (1982) is the excessive use of special effects. Special effects in which the most bizarre body parts suddenly appear out of the normal body of an infected person. Special effects that are spectacular but have been done better in ""Alien"" (1979, Ridley Scott).So ""The Thing"" (1982) combines a few standard elements from earlier horror / science fiction movies (restricted environment from ""Key Largo"", distrust and uncertainty from ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" and special effects from ""Alien""). It does so in an intelligent way, but doesn't add much original elements of his own.I am therefore not so sure that I appreciate the 1982 version above the 1951 version, as the IMDB ratings seems to indicate.The monster is more convincing in the 1982 version, while in the 1951 version he is little more than a big man in a scary suit.The characters however are more interesting in the 1951 version, some characters in the 1982 version being little more than food for the Thing.In a way this is remarkable because the element of mutual distrust is giving possibilities for interesting characters. Possibilities that a film like ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" makes better use of than ""The Thing"" (1982). ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" scarcely uses any special effects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A cult horror classic,"It's not so often I encounter the chance to revisit a classic on the big screen yet yesterday I had that privilege to watch John Carpenter's cult horror classic 'The Thing' at the Cineworld Cinema near Piccadilly Circus.The film begins in the midst of the Antarctic snowfield where a helicopter is circling an American research base chasing down a husky with a sniper. When the helicopter crashes and the pilot is killed, the passenger survives only to continue his mission of pursuing and killing the dog and in the process shots one of the members of the research team to get to the dog. The gunman who appears to be Norwegian is shot down by the captain of the base as he obviously appears to be steered crazy and incredibly dangerous.When they eventually find out that this dog isn't what it appears to be, two members of the team, one being MacReady (played by Kurt Russel who gives a fine performance here), goes on a search for the Norwegian base to see what clues they can find. When they do find the abandoned base, they find a large block of ice which looks as if something had been frozen in it for centuries and a half burnt corps that looks like something they've never seen. Of course this corps is brought back to the base, and after a few autopsies are made, one of the doctors makes the shocking discovery of a creature that imitates cellsWhen one of the members of the base is left alone with the remains of the creature, another team member enters the room only to discover the creature is not dead and is now in fact imitating a member of the team. When help comes forth, the creature has almost finished the process and looks exactly like the team member except for a few last features.This is where the tension really begins; paranoia hits everyone and hits them hard. Did they kill the creature? Are there any remains of the creature left? If so, has it taken shape of any other team members? Who is human and who is the creature? Who can they trust? You can even feel the tension in the atmosphere of the base, the silence, the darkness, and the reactions of the team members when they suspect another team member.If one person gets out of their sight for an instant then that person is automatically a suspect. The best example of paranoia is shown by Dr. Blair played by Wilford Brimley who delivers the best performance in the film. He discovers that if this creature reaches civilization, it will eventually imitate mankind little by little and this drives him over the edge and wants no one from the base to escape for the sake of mankind.I felt quite fortunate as to have previously visited Howard Hawk's original Sci-Fi classic 'The Thing from Another World' which is quite an impressive film especially for 1951, did not feature a shape-shifting creature, instead it featured a gigantic creature that required human blood in order to reproduce. The director John Carpenter, being a fan of Howard Hawks did not try to copy the original; instead he went back to the original novel 'Who Goes There?' by John W. Campbell Jr. from 1939 which did feature a shape-shifting creature, thus making the film more tense and more suspenseful.John Carpenter has never been known for his character build up; in fact the villains in his movies are usually mindless and lack emotion or personality as shown in this film and many others such as Michael Myers in his merciless masterpiece 'Halloween', the car Christine in 'Christine' or the zombie-like ghosts from 'The Fog'. But he is famous for his tense scenes and his dark and creepy shots as hardly any of his movies contain more than ten minutes of daylight. This is a well paced, well shot film and with these sorts of movies, that's rare.Watching 'The Thing' again I couldn't help but be reminded of Don Siegel's Sci-Fi classic 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' from 1956, where a doctor in a small town practise finds numerous patients of his claiming that their relatives or close friends are not who they seem to be but in fact impostors who look exactly them. These two films feature the same sort of paranoia, only John Carpenter makes the decision of showing the shape-shifting commence by using extremely grotesque and gory special effects. Although I am not a fan of grotesque special effects, especially as over blown as they are here, John Carpenter's version of 'The Thing' still succeeds as a haunting tale of paranoia and is a highly entertaining and action packed sci-fi film that is sure to entertain even if it's not as great as Don Siegel's classic.Upon the film's release back in 1982, the film did not do so well in the box office, maybe because it came out only two weeks after the phenomenon 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' or maybe it's simply due to its extensive use gore and violence which it earned it an ""R"" rating by the Motion Picture Association of America. It instead went on to become a cult favourite and is now considered to be one of the best and scariest horror films ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
What a surprise!,"I was not expecting to like this film at all and I think I might have seen it before and hated it, but I watched it in the day so that it wouldn't scare me too much (Which was a mistake because the sun was shining on the tv and it was a very dark film) and actually I quite enjoyed it. As I say, it's not really my type of thing, as I'm not a horror fan, but I'm trying to branch out with what I watch and thought a 40 year old horror shouldn't freak me out too much?
I have to say though, that the special effects were actually very good for 1982, as I looked over my pillow trying not to see too much.You can't really fault the acting or the direction or the story. I suppose you could say that it's a bit typical by today's standards with few twists or complicated plots and it was easy to see what would happen, you know who isn't going to die and so on, but for back then I think it really worked.It would have received a higher score, but my scores are based on what I would rather see the most and it has some big ones to compete with.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Only has one actual reason to watch it.,"I don't really have much good to say about this, because I went in with a high bar, this movie is supposedly one of the best horrors and is rated very highly here on imdb, and I see it mentioned in pop culture everywhere. So there I was..excited to finally see this classic.This movie, aside from the stunning practical effects, is a dud. It's characters are flat and boring, you care for no one, the music is mediocre, the script is muddled and messy with plothole galore. The characters felt like robots, not real people, no heartbreaking reactions when there college's die a horrible death, not being impressed by the thing, like seriously, there wasn't once someone cursing about how messed up the situation is.. how?!?! The characters deal with the thing as if it's something normal and totally realistic to exist in their world.The only real reason to watch this, is for the practical gore, because still to this day it's gross and vomit educing. It's done with so much detail. You'd think all the budget went there. Seriously phenomenal, and what the movie (rightly so) is most famous for.But aside from that, nothing to see here.Also...what was up with that Norwegian sniper with his absolutely hilariously terrible aim?! Takes you out of it right away.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I only give 10/10 to a handful of movies,"The Thing truly is the ultimate in horror. The special effects are perfect, the best I've ever seen! It's a movie that scares you with little to no jumpscares because it presents you with superb visual effects that will make you look away at the horrific mutated monsters, the chilling and claustrophobic environment and the uneasy feeling of distrust regarding all characters in the picture. You never know who's human and who's pretending to be human and you never know what is lurking inside, what the infection is, where it is, what it is doing when it might be right in front of you, etc. It's right there, haunting and destroying you but you can't see it, feel it, hear it, touch it.

Truly frightening,"I've seen this film a number of times now and It never get's old. Having grown up with the semi new era of movies. I haven't watched a whole lot of older movies that date as far back as The Thing. I consider this movie to be a contender for one of my favorite movies though! Strong cast, the effects are great for its time and it over all holds it's creepy atmosphere it set out to have. I would recommend this movie to any horror movie buff, that love the whole monster/alien theme. The Thing does it, and it does it well. I am pretty excited for the prequel coming out next weekend. I really hope it holds up to this masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Just edges out Alien as the finest Sci Fi/Horror film ever made,"This is, and will likely remain, one of my favourite movies. It's as near perfect within it's genre as any movie I've ever seen. The cast, the sets, the script, the special effects: all excellent.To my mind, there are two ways to make a really entertaining horror film. Play it straight, or throw in a heavy element of comedy. This movie plays it straight right down the line, although that's not to say there aren't a few laughs to be had, there are some classic lines of dialogue.The movie's soundtrack and score establish a sense of foreboding from the get go, and as the characters witness one scene of unimaginable horror after another, the fear and paranoia grows palpably. The imagination and thought put into the special effects lifts the movie to a level as yet unsurpassed, Rob Bottin deserved an Oscar for his work here, with an honourable mention going to Stan Winston who stepped in to alleviate the workload, providing a particularly memourable scene.I can't believe I didn't see this at the cinema at the time of it's release. This is partly down to the critics, who should hang their heads in shame for panning this film. But beyond that, the trailer was awful, failing completely to convey the brilliance on display here.Another criticism levelled at this movie is there are no female cast members, but there really wasn't any need for them. The last thing this movie needed is a romantic sub plot.Much as I love Alien, I prefer this. To quote John Carpenter, this monster isn't just some guy in a suit. This is the best of the best.You've probably seen this movie already, but if not and you like horror (particularly of a Lovecraftian flavour), I urge you do so at the earliest opportunity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Enigma From Another World,"It didn't age too well, in my humble opinion.

Yet, it's a classic!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I Love John Carpenter,"The Thing (1982), is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell, as the leader of a crew stuck in Antarctica in the first week of winter because an alien has made its way into their base, kills anything it touches, and can only be destroyed by fire. It's based on the John W.Campbell short story ""Who Goes There?"" The film is awesome.The Thing is an extremely claustrophobic, tense and frightening story, with fantastic acting, perfect direction and brilliant animatronic/models, that made the cast feel sick to their stomachs when they first saw them, and I don't blame them, they are extremely realistic, detailed and scary. They are used in the best way possible.As said earlier, the acting is brilliant. The casting of Kurt Russell as R.J ""Mac"" MacReady is perfect, he is great as a brave but cautious leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible. Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage, giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along with Alien. 10/10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Still worth watching for any horror fan.,"""You think that thing wanted to be an animal? No dogs make it a thousand miles through the cold! No, you don't understand! That thing wanted to be US!""I'm definitely going to see the upcoming remake of The Thing (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, 'nuff said) so I thought that it would be wise to see the 80's remake (the original movie came out in the 50's) before hand. And I'm glad I did. It may be a little dated by today's standards, but it's still a solid exercise in paranoia-fueled monster movies.An isolated Antarctic research station on the cusp of polar winter becomes a battleground for a handful of people and a terrifying alien. One that has a unique ability that quickly causes the humans to not be able to trust one another. They have to remain on the lookout for danger from their fellow humans, as well as the creature.The two aspects of The Thing that are most worthy of mention are the gory and impressive special effects, and the believable tension between the actors as they realize that there is no one they can trust but themselves. The creature design for the Thing truly is memorable, and if you have an aversion to copious amount of blood or tentacles, this will be a nightmare for you. The dynamics between the characters is what most of the story focuses on, and without that, this would just be a mindless movie about people being killed. But instead, it almost becomes a race between the viewer and the characters to figure out who is a threat and who (if anyone) might survive this whole thing. Pretty cool.I think if you're a fan of movies like Alien, you'll like this. It doesn't quite have the timelessness of that movie, and it's not quite as frightening, but there's a similar vibe that the two share. If the upcoming remake is at least as good as this one, it'll be worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Disgusting,"An alien with the ability to take the forms of humans and animals infiltrates a scientific outpost in the Antarctic. This big-budget remake of the 1951 film proves that bigger isn't better, marred by poor acting, directing, and script. Carpenter thinks that slimy creatures and graphic mutilations are entertaining, but it's just disgusting. There is no subtlety at work here. This film has parallels to ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (the original) and ""Alien,"" but one of the reasons it falls far short of those landmark sci-fi classics is that there's little build-up of suspense. The characters are one-dimensional. It's all about special effects.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not just one of the best horror films but one of the greatest films of all time.,"I will try not to repeat the points made in the many excellent reviews above, but on viewing this over the last few years I have come to regard it as a truly outstanding film, certainly a classic and arguably deserving a position in the pantheon of greatest films of all time. The original was also fine, but like Shakespeare, Carpenter and his colleagues have taken an existing plot to a new level. There are no weaknesses in cinematography, acting, effects, human drama or science fiction concept. There is a certain amount of shock effect, but an impressive feature is the additional horror produced by the concept of the predicament of the ice station crew and by extension, humanity. The obvious comparison is with ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", and I would be hard put to insert a credit card between them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The Best Masterpiece of Horror.,"John Carpenter is always my favorite directer with along with Guillemo Del Toro, Stephen Norrington and Fritz Lang. The Thing is an great movie that ever made in 1982 and still had it today. The Thing is a first movie in the Apocalypse Trilogy, which continued with Prince Of Darkness and ended with In the Mouth of Madness.The Thing is widely regarded as one of John Carpenter's greatest masterpieces, and I would personally consider it a contender for the title of the best horror film ever made. It didn't always receive such a rosy reception, though. It was released in theaters just weeks after Steven Spielberg's much more blockbuster-friendly E.T., and its theatrical performance and initial critical reception weren't anything to write home about, the movie had became a beloved cult classic over the years.The movie is a remake from 1951 The Thing From Another and was directed by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby and adapted from a John W. Campbell short story; however, implicit Lovecraft allusions abound.The Thing. The story concerns an alien creature found frozen in Antarctic ice that can absorb, digest, and then imitate perfectly any creature that it comes into contact with. What follows from its discovery is a classic meditation on paranoia, punctuated by some of the best practical special effects ever put on film. The Thing is a remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks film The Thing from Another World, which was itself based on a short story by John W. Campbell called ""Who Goes There?""Once it is revealed, the titular Thing is almost entirely unknowable. Not only is it alien in the most literal sense, but it's also outside of normally understood biology, genetically dissimilar from all life on earth. When discussing how the Thing can do what it does, or how it can live after being frozen for so long, one of the characters (played by Kurt Russell) says, ""Cuz it's different than us, see. Cuz it's from outer space."" And that's about all the more understanding of its reasoning the characters ever get. Though the creature can obviously speak perfectly when it is imitating one of the humans, it never explains itself.The Movie is awesome in every way with an strong story, great actors and with great special effects. If you a john carpenter fan (just like i am) this movie is perfect for a horror movie night.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"What to do, when you can't escape or trust anybody?","First time round, in 1982, this was a scary movie. Having seen it again, recently, it's not as scary as, say, Hallloween (1978), Alien (1979) and others. More importantly, nearly thirty years later, it's now much easier for me to spot the shortcomings of the narrative.But, I'll ignore those so as not to spoil the story which I first saw in the 1951 version (largely produced by Howard Hawks). For its time, that also was a scary movie (for a ten year old) which also served as a political metaphor about the dangers of the Soviet Union and communism. This 1982 version, however, avoids that trap by eliminating all of the military aspects so prevalent in the earlier version.Essentially, the story follows the book written by John Campbell quite well (unlike the 1951 production), showing how a particularly vicious alien attempts to take over and literally absorb – into itself – the scientists and support personnel at an American Antarctic base station. In a series of graphically violent situations, we see how the alien infiltrates and, when finding one of the humans alone, attacks, envelops and eventually takes on the physical appearance of its victims.Hence, creeping paranoia and mutual distrust invade the humans. And, very cleverly, the script and direction make sure that, as viewers, we can never be entirely certain about the true identity of each character as the story reaches its inevitable conclusion – and, by implication, beyond.The special alien effects are still worthy of special mention, particularly as it was all done without any help from CGI. The early scene in the dog pen, when we first see the nasty beast, can never be forgotten, I think; the destroyed Norwegian base camp is suitably spooky and scary; and the scene where MacReady (Kurt Russell) conducts his own blood tests to weed out the good humans from the bad ones is a tour de force in suspense. Added to all of that is Ennio Morricone's brooding, throbbing, menacing sound track – pervasively shadowing the action, its beat emphasizing the time ticking away as the desperate men battle each other and the alien.Arguably, this is equally a movie about terror as much as horror: the terror of the malevolent unknown, and the horror of one's fellow man taking on the guise of that malevolence. To cap it all, there is no escape, even for the survivors – who may or may not be human anyway. Make your own assessment if you see this movie from John Carpenter, one of the true masters of terror and horror.Recommended for all lovers of sci-fi who like to be scared witless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Flawless Horror Classic. Carpenter's Greatest Film.,"John Carpenter's The Thing is in my opinion the Greatest horror film ever made. A brilliant mixture of great direction,acting,special effects,score and screenplay making this a all time classic horror film. This is Carpenter's greatest film and It's not only my all time favorite Horror film it's one of my favorite films of all time period.The Thing tells the story of 12 researchers in a u.s outpost in Antarctica with nothing really happening until the researchers discover that an alien that came to earth years before is stalking them and killing them and imitating them. Which raises the question:Who can you trust?Released in the Summer of 1982,John Carpenter's The Thing came out at a bad time having been released three weeks after Director Steven Spielberg's Blockbuster E.T. The Extra Terrestrial a much lighter take on Alien life and The Thing was ignored by audiences and hated by critics. Thankfully,The Thing has become a Cult Film and is now considered a classic and one of the best Horror films of all-time and the praise is rightfully deserved. The Thing is a film I love for many reasons because it brilliantly works as Horror film and Remake. One of the reasons I love the film besides the direction and special effects is the paranoia aspect of the film and when the characters stop trusting each other and start wondering who's human and who's not and Carpenter creates a dark end of the world feeling where the end will come from either aliens or man's own disturbing self destruction. The film is scary and frightening not just because of the effects and atmosphere but because of the characters and how they react when the alien invasion happens. It's very believable,scary and gives the film it's edge. This film was released before AIDS and HIV was more known around the world and Carpenter's film could be a metaphor. Even though The Thing is a Horror film,the issues and themes of fear,paranoia and distrust is still relevant in today's world.The screenplay by Bill Lancaster is superb and well-written giving the film and characters great lines and dialog. We don't know much about the characters and who they are but,we know them well enough to feel sorry for them and don't paint the characters as faceless victims. The snow and cold adds to the dark and frightening claustrophobic feel of the film and you feel isolated like the films characters where you feel that there's no where to go and no salvation for the men. The only film that can match the chilling and dark atmosphere is Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Both films in my opinion are the two of the most terrifying films ever set in the winter and make me never,ever want to stay in a house or a hotel by myself in the snow. The Thing also succeeds as a remake and one of the rare occasions where the remake was different and better than the original.Where in Howard Hawks The Thing From Another World the alien was a big and large Frankenstein-like creature,The Thing in this film looks different every time it transforms so the alien can look and different and sound different each time and it's very inventive and terrifying. The Thing was the first in Carpenter's great apocalypse trilogy which also includes other Carpenter classics Prince Of Darkness and In The Mouth Of Madness. While none of these three films have nothing in common in terms of story lines or characters the thing they all have in common is the concept about the end of the world. The Thing is my favorite and the best of the trilogy because of the storyline themes,characters and great ending which has been discussed for many years. The Thing also moves at a fast pace and never slows down until the very end. The violence and gore in the film are intense and brutal truly match the horrifying tone of the film and the violence happens you as the viewer will feel it and will be disturbed. The ending of The Thing is uncompromising,dark and will have viewers talking about the ending for years,leaving you with many unanswered questions than easy answers and wouldn't fly in today's Hollywood and it's one of my all time favorite movie endings and one of the reasons the film is truly brilliant and why I love The Thing.The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Kurt Russell is excellent as R.J MacReady,the man who becomes the leader when things fall apart. A.Wilford Brimley is great as Dr Blair the doctor who goes crazy. Keith David is wonderful as Childs and is tough as nails. Donald Moffat is effective as Garry bringing depth and sympathy to the role. T.K Carter is great as Nauls and brings some humor to the film. Richard Dysart(Dr.Copper),David Clennon(Palmer),Richard Masur(Clark),Charles Hallahan(Norris),Thomas Waites(Windows),Joel Polis(Fuchs)and Peter Maloney(Bennings)give great performances as well.The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant because Carpenter is always moving the camera giving the film a since of dread,eeriness and doom of not knowing what's going to happen or where. Great direction by Carpenter.The score by Ennio Morricone is frightening and scary and matches the dark,grim tone of the film. One of Morricone's best scores.The special effects by Rob Bottin are excellent some of the most ingenious,bloody,gory imaginative effects in film history. Shocking,surprising and unexpected,Bottin's effects set the standard for make-up effects still hold up years later.In final word,John Carpenter's The Thing is a flawless Horror classic that is amazing from beginning to end and is a film that belongs in every Horror fan and movie buffs collection and is John Carpenter's greatest film. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

John Carpenter's Sci-Fi/Horror Masterpiece,"When I first saw this movie at the ripe old age of 9, I was beyond terrified. John Carpenter's sci-fi horror masterpiece about a shapeshifting alien gave me nightmares for years. After another 30 years and about 50 more viewings, it isn't frightening to me anymore, but that hasn't diminished the value of this tense and suspenseful classic. The critics liked Starman more, and Halloween was more influential, but The Thing is John Carpenter's best movie – no frigging contest. Considering how many great movies Carpenter made in the '70s and '80s, that's saying a lot.In the late '70s and early '80s, the horror genre hit its peak. Ideas were still fresh, but the taboos that kept the truly horrifying movies like The Shining and The Exorcist off the screen were gone. Young directors like John Carpenter brought inspiration and energy to the medium. Without $100 Million CG animation budgets, directors were free to focus on storytelling and script. This is the stage in which the film industry found itself when Carpenter made The Thing. The script is almost air tight, leaving virtually no plot holes or loose threads, other than a couple of mysteries that are better left unanswered. The cast was perfect, and the direction was excellent. Most of the actors were no-namer types who didn't do much after The Thing, but there are no weak performances in this film. The soundtrack is also a huge asset to the film. I still get chills whenever I hear it during the introduction and over the closing credits.Best of all is Rob Bottin's absolutely incredible work on the film's visual and special effects. The monsters don't get a ton of screen time, but when they do, they are gruesome and horrifying. The practical effects in the movie still trump any computer generated garbage that has been made in the past 15 years. Although they are a product of a wild imagination, the monsters in the movie seem incredibly real, and because they seem so real, they are also threatening. In the recent 2011 prequel, the monsters simply weren't as scary, in large part because you couldn't shake the idea that you were watching a high-tech cartoon.The movie begins with two crazy-looking guys hunting a dog from a helicopter, shooting at it as it flees across the Antarctic. It is one of the best opening scenes of all time, drawing you in immediately. There is a whole rich backstory at work, and at the start of The Thing, you get to see the aftermath. After the dog incident, the story unfolds almost like a Lovecraftian version of ""Ten Little Indians"". Once The Thing is first truly revealed, the rest of the movie is filled with tense paranoia and fear. Adding to the tension is the extreme isolation of Antarctica, and the knowledge that nobody can come to rescue the scientists. All the while, we realize that these men are not the only ones in danger. If the Thing kills them all and escapes the continent, the world is doomed. At one point, The Thing also gives you the best jump scare in the history of film. I have introduced this movie to about a half dozen people, and the ""test"" scene has made somebody jump out of his or her chair every time.Another of the great qualities of this film is the memorable cast of characters. Even though there are lots of them, they all look, sound, and behave differently enough for you to get to know them almost immediately. After only one viewing, you can probably remember that there was the cowboy-ish MacReady, the cook on roller skates, the guy who loved dogs more than people, Wilford Brimley going crazy, the doctor, the weak-willed radio operator, the crazy guy, and the big tough looking black guy. Unlike almost every other horror movie with a body count, every death feels significant, because even minor characters are well developed.In my humble opinion, The Thing is one of the Top 10 greatest movies ever made, and the #1 movie of its genre. This is why the movie has such a strong cult following despite its lukewarm reception on release, and why if you see it for the first time, you will probably still enjoy it even though it is 30 years old. If you want to see the best of the true horror genre (i.e. not the idiotic slasher genre misclassified as ""horror""), The Thing is absolutely essential viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Classic. film,"Classic film. Too much VFX I think. One upshot of this decision was in handing total creative licence to special makeup effects creator, Rob Bottin. Having cut his teeth the year previously on 'The Howling', this former apprentice to Rick Baker both thrilled and appalled audiences in equal measure with his nightmarish visions. Though a little dated today, these still retain the power to shock, and deserved at least an Academy Award nomination. In spite of Bottin's laudable workmanship, what they did earn at the time was both a notoriety which deflected attention away from the film's strengths, as well as a period of hospitalisation for Bottin out of pure exhaustion. A further critique aimed at this production was a lack of sufficient characterisation, though it could be argued that with a plot so driven by suspicion, the audience's lack of in-depth knowledge of individual characters adds further to the tension. It is clear that the screenplay, penned by the son of Burt Lancaster whose only other screen writing credit was for the light comedies of the 'Bad News Bears' franchise, is as much of a psychological thriller as it is a visceral horror story. As Carpenter himself later commented: 'The paranoia is the glue that holds the movie together'. This is gradually racked up by the director before reaching its apogee in the film's most acclaimed blood-test scene. It is also supported by Ennio Morricone's throbbing baseline soundtrack, which was so unfairly nominated for a 'Razzie'. Many have questioned the plausibility of the actions of the men trapped on the base with this shape-shifting presence, forgetting that the latter's arrival sharpens the level of mistrust and friction which had been building throughout the team's isolation from the wider world. As such, the alien interloper in its desire to survive at all costs is able to exploit the breakdown of discipline as the team's fragile relationship is tested to its limits under siege.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Now I know I'm still human ...Or am I?,"It's the antarctic, it's an American research centre and it's f**king cold outside. However, when a rival Norwegian research team turn up shooting at a dog, it looks like they've gone stir crazy and are put down for their own good. However as time progresses it becomes extremely apparent that they were very much in possession of their faculties and were not only fighting for their survival but for the survival of the human race.This is the start of John Carpenter's masterpiece (Rather then Halloween) and the film is made memorable for two things, first the effects, that never cease to amaze and dazzle the viewer in their complex and unending ability to shock, terrify and bemuse. Let's get something right that Spielberg recently had a bone with over the first three Indy films. matte paintings that look good are fine, CGI that looks like a play station game is not. The effects in this film are real, you know you're looking at something real and this makes for a film that is all the more unsettling.Next the acting and the script. In this film we feel the sweat and unpleasant camaraderie that people cooped up in this kind of environment feel. There are uneasy alliances and downright detestation of some people, they're not friends they're colleagues and it shares with Alien the distinction of putting these human relations in perfect transfer to the big screen. The script and acting make the effects real because you believe in how the people are with each other. Its ordinariness makes it real.For those of you who have not seen it watch past the first 30 minutes when you might think you're watching a kitchen sink drama in the Antarctic. Trust me, it's worth the wait.Nuff said Em",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A masterpiece of filmmaking.,"What can I say about John Carpenter's magnificent The Thing that has not been said already? It is a masterpiece of suspense, paranoia and dread. . Why does the film work so well you ask? The setup is standard stuff, establishing that the characters are isolated and can expect no help from the outside but it is the realization there could be an alien among them, and any one of them might not be human, is what launches The Thing into a spiral of escalating tension. The quest to identify the alien consumes about half the movie's running time, and includes several red herrings and the gripping blood test sequence in which MacReady uses a hot wire and samples of everyone's hemoglobin to clear some members of the crew and damn others. The final confrontation with the alien, despite providing the most grotesque special effect of the movie and allowing plenty of pyrotechnics, is anticlimactic. Then again, after the extended suspense of the middle section, it's hard to see how any resolution could rise to that level. This is great filmmaking and the Thing came during Carpentar's most fertile period as a filmmaker. Kurt Russell shines as do the rest of the all male cast. If you enjoy horror, suspense or thrills than this movie, more than thirty five years old is unmissable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Who can you trust?,"What fuels ""The Thing"" is a feeling more than an idea. After establishing the characters and the premise that any one of their colleagues could be an alien impersonator, the plot takes a predictable line, as character after character's humanity is tested. But what kept me engaged was feeling the need for a community. Kurt Russell's MacReady maps out the lay of the land for us, but then needs to determine who he can trust. Poor judgment here could be fatal. His methodology to determine who is human and who is not is simple, but we soon learn that the answer always changing. An ally now may try to kill you an hour later. A great theme given today's political struggle to accept refugees while faced with an attitude of xenophobia. Considering the ""aliens-as-us"" premise, Carpenter sketches out the characters well, and they are convincing, given the extreme circumstances of the story. Although the pre-CGI special effects may seem dated now, they are still effective and make your skin crawl. I recommend this to a new generation of moviegoers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of he best sci-fi horror films ever.,"The opening sequence is remarkable, tension, curiosity build up as the Norwegians in the helicopter hunt the dog, mess everything up when at the US base and blow the helicopter to pieces. Death, horrible death, now figures at every step of plot development. The movie is mostly interiors as the base personnel and the alien battle for survival. Outside is the deep freeze, and certain death. Inside is confusion and violence, and inevitable death, though the hopelessness of the situation, death for all humans and the alien is not revealed until the end. There is no happy ending, only destruction and suicide. The cast are impressive, the special effects convincing. I rate this as as one of the best of the sci-fi horror genre. It still makes me jump after seeing it at least a dozen times!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"John Carpenter's Best Film, At Least Critically","In Antarctica, there is a science station where Americans run experiments... but more often than not just get drunk. One day, a dog and a group of Norwegians shows up... and thanks to poor translation skills, the Norwegian is killed. Soon after, a horrible fate in unleashed upon the American station... one by one the crew become suspects in a very heinous string of murders. Who is the killer or killers?I like many -- perhaps most -- of John Carpenter's films. The original ""Halloween"" and ""They Live"" are amazing. Pretty much the bulk of his work pleases me (with a few exceptions). And ""The Thing"" is among his best, which both fans and critics alike seem to agree on. You are working with horror, which Carpenter excels at... and you are working with isolation fighting against an outside enemy (which we have seen in ""Assault in Precinct 13"", ""Pro-Life"" and elsewhere). And we have the ideal Carpenter cast: Kurt Russell as R.J. MacReady, Wilford ""The Beetis"" Brimley as Dr. Blair and Keith David as Childs.This also brings Carpenter and Dean Cundey together again. Cundey has said, ""John and Halloween really kicked off my career."" This was their fourth film together, but their first big studio (Universal) production. It was truly a passion project for Carpenter, who idolizes Howard Hawks. The Hawks version of ""The Thing"" appeared in ""Halloween"", ""Assault on Precinct 13"" was more or less a Hawks remake, and now he had the opportunity to tackle this. And wow, they did a bang up job, surpassing the original (though the two are different enough that they can both be appreciated in their own ways).The suspense and isolation work to bring the film to a crescendo of horror perfection. And science fiction fans will love it, too (the border between the two is danced upon quite heavily). But what really makes this film the masterpiece it is -- and what will make it never remakeable -- is the special effects. If you have read enough of my reviews, you will know my strong dislike for modern CGI effects and their ""cartoon"" quality. Here, we have a prime example of what I would rather see in a film: good, old-fashioned effects. More realistic than the cartoons and just visually stunning. I have no idea why they started doing things differently, but every film since ""Jurassic Park"" has let me down in some way. Rob Bottin is quite possibly the greatest effects master in cinema history.My one concern with this film, and it is very minor, is that the characters are not easy to keep straight sometimes. This goes away with repeated viewings, but aside from the main characters, the secondary characters just seem to blend together. One guy looks sort of like another, and trying to keep the names straight will take a little focus. Some of them do not appear on screen for more than five minutes or have more than a line or two of dialog, it seems. But what good is a killer if you do not have people to kill?Beyond that, what to say? Keith David and Kurt Russell? That does not sell you? Adrienne Barbeau as the computer voice? A dog that kills people with its tentacles? Even the Internet Movie Database seems to think this is one of the best films ever made (well within the top 200) so I am going to go so far as to recommend it to non-horror fans as well. There is just something very tight about this film.Appropriately, Scream! Factory has pulled all the stops and released the film as a double-disc Blu-ray. With a 2K scan, it looks better than ever. We have commentary tracks with Kurt Russell, John Carpenter and Dean Cundey. And plenty of interviews, both new and vintage. If there is not already a book about the making of ""The Thing"", someone could probably develop one based solely off the material on the set. It is, without a doubt, the must-have Blu-ray of 2016.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Stuck on a remote station in Antarctica with... The Thing,"RELEASED IN 1982 and directed by John Carter, ""The Thing"" stars Kurt Russell as the helicopter pilot of an eleven-man crew at a research station in Antarctica who encounter a ghastly shape-shifting alien that perfectly replicates the appearance of its victims.This is basically a sequel to the 1956 film and even includes footage from that classic sci-fi/horror. The creature is unconventional to say the least and this adds an eerie component to an already otherworldly and confined Antarctic setting.There are no females and therefore no romantic complications. The characters are thin so the story focuses on the thing and how the crew tries to track it down and eliminate it, if they can. The nature of the gruesome entity, how it functions and how it can or cannot be killed leaves you with a lot of questions. The ending is haunting.""The Thing"" may not be as great as gushing devotees insist, but it's solid sci-fi/horror with some pretty horrific scenes, although only one really creeped me out (the blood scene) while another made me bust out laughing (the torso jaws).THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 48 minutes and was shot in Alaska & British Columbia.

No other movie captures paranoia and desolation like this,"The Thing is a long time favorite movie of mine. I originally saw it in the cinema in the 80s and it scared the crap out of me. As it made such an impression, I've seen it many times since, and found that I never got sick of watching it. The score by Ennio Morricone complements the desolate scenery so well, and in my opinion, no other film captures the sense of paranoia, where no one trusts anyone else, and we as the viewers are equally left in the dark.The practical special effects by Rob Bottin mostly live up to the test of time, and you can easily forgive the shots that don't due to way the entire film is crafted. I believe it is an unrecognised classic and I can see why they tried to tap into the magic with the more recent prequel (worth watching, not quite as good, but even more horrifying!).If you consider yourself a film buff, you should see this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"Carpenter actually managed to make his ""The Thing"" far inferior to its predecessor , the 1951 ""The Thing From Another World"". If you have read my comment on the latter you may know what I'm talking about, but the fact remains that you cannot make this sort of movie based purely on some cheesy monster, it has to be character driven first; that's why ""Predator"", the whole ""Alien"" franchise and some other monster movies work. And what does ""The Thing"" have to offer; well not much; Kurt Russel is his hillbilly self, taking the leader role from the very start and the rest of the cast doesn't amount to much either. The best part of the whole movie is the opener which really got me thinking and hoping what Carpenter had in store, but it just proved to be a disappointment. The movie also excluded some of the best scenes from the original, like showing  the discovery of the space ship. The 1951 movie made that scene very thrilling, showing less than more, making the viewer yearn for a glimpse but never getting one. And don't get me started on the monsters; the comments I read from the IMDb users make you want to think the effects are better and scarier than anything you've ever seen, but the honest to God truth is I'd choose even the original creature from ""Alien"" any day. There are just so many things popping and bursting out of those creatures it's hard to swallow, and the head-turn-to-spider scene is a real gem when it comes to idiotic comedy. Plus it shows just how much the special effects creators were influenced by ""Alien"" which came out only a couple of years ago; the thing even lived off of the same thing, it needed a host and then it just ate whatever it could find. There were even similarities with the whole blood scene; alien's was acid, this one just lived forever and didn't like fire. I thought Morricone's score was quite good, the whole 5 minutes of it which I'm guessing is one of the reasons it got a Razzie nomination. Ha. Overall, a movie that doesn't pay much tribute to the original, nor does it manage to surpass it, not by a long shot. Not enough atmosphere, a poor script and a bad climax don't amount to much and probably the most inventive and positive thing in this whole mess is the very ending, which reminds us ""The Thing"" is definitely a Carpenter movie, sadly just not one of the better ones. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"One of my favorite horror films of all time, the best monster cretaure flick John Carpenter's classic masterpiece","The Thing is a classic film and in my opinion without a doubt one of my personal favorite horror monster creature flicks of all time. John Carpenter's best movie in my opinion! Some people don't like this movie I don't know why I love this movie to death! To me it is better than Halloween (1978) that movie get's all the praise but The Thing get's hate from harsh critics and reviewers on IMDb. I don't get the hate because I love this film to death. The Thing is the third ultimate John Carpenter / Kurt Russell collaboration between two working together. One of the best monster horror movies I have ever seen of the 80's. It is in my top 10 favorite horror movies of all time. I Love the great 80s classic horror movies and The Thing, it is a great classic sci fi horror movie by John Carpenter with Prince of Darkness.The Thing is a remake of the 1951 movie The Thing from Another World which this remake to me is much way better, more atmospheric and creepy than the original. Kurt Russell's best performance ever, he looks great and very clear on blu ray in HD with a great cinematography worth getting for any horror fan. I love it, I love this movie to death. The movie begins in Antarctica during winter 1982 in the opening scene we see two Norwegian pilots hunting a sled dog in the helicopter. They land in American research station and Norwegian accidentally throws a grande and blows up his helicopter. Than Norwegian fires with his rifle and shouts at the Americans, they don't undestand what is he saying, later he is killed in self defence by Garry (Donald Moffat). When researchers invevestigate what happened they discover an alien burried under the snow over 100.000 years. The sled dog they bring in the station, turns in to shape-shifting alien that assumes the appearance of the dogs and the group is firing with the rifles at the thing, Childs (Keith David) one of the members torchers the monster with flamethrower. It turns out that there are more shape-shifting aliens out there in the base and they assume appearance of the men. Now group has to fight for their survival. No one trust anyone anymore. They have to figure it who is human and who is not a human and a shape-shifting alien, while The Thing keep killing researchers one by one and wreak havoc terror.I love this movie to death, I love the FX and special effects for the Alien thing. Creature effects were degined by Rob Bottin and Stan Winston was brought in to help complete the effect. It was operated on a raised set with puppeteers working below. Stan Winston worked on Aliens (1986) creature effects and desigen and Leviathan (1989). I love the custom and great effects for the creature it is not dated people who are saying those harsh things about this movie I disagree with them! The effects hold up great nowdays for this movie! Visuals and lighting, the story, the idea are great and they are briliant! This movie is great till its day, I am glad the The Thing get's fanbase. John Carpenter's favorite horror movie of mine from the 80's an end of days on an apocalyptic way. Prince of Darkness is my number one Carpenter movie this is my second favorite one I just love this movie to death, it is amazing!The cast everyone in this movie is great: I love R.J. MacReady played by Russell him self it is my favorite character. It is a bad-ass character. Clark played by Richard Masur I love him because he love dogs, I am a dog lover my self. When MacReady fiers at the dog and kills him Clark shouts NO and he stopps MacReady. He love dogs and I respect him so much. Childs played by Keith David was awesome, he reunited in 1989 with John Carpenter in movie They Live. Windows played by Thomas G. Waites I love Windows he was great. I love Garry played by Donald Moffat with a gun he was excellent. Nauls played by T.K. Carter was great I love the cast evan Norwegian actors are great. Great music score by Ennio Morricone who wrote several music scores for the movie. Carpenter loved his music score.This movie come out three years later after the realese of Alien (1979) and in my opinion The Thing is better than Alien (1979). That movie is overrated but it is a classic and it is great. But just like fans are saying that Alien is a masterpiece, well The Thing deserves to be called a masterpiece too. I love the script for this movie writen by Bill Lancaster. Great dialogue and great lines.This movie belongs with Aliens (1986) that I just love to death I love this two movies and it is one of my personal favorite horror films. The Thing is a classic masterpiece by a horror master John Carpenter. I recommend this movie to any horror fan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Come in without Expectations.,"When I viewed ""The Thing"" for the first time at 16yrs it scared the living daylights out of me, and I had trouble sleeping for days afterwards. However, My 6yr younger brother, watched it a few months later and was not at all scared by it. I don't think there is such a thing as ""scariest movie of all time"", for sure some are scarier than others, but when it comes down to the best scary movies, some will affect more than others because of their inherent content. Some people think John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is terrifying, I didn't find it scary in the least, but it is a very good movie none-the-less. I recommend knowing as little about the thing as possible, and not expecting it to be really scary, just enjoy it for what it is; a well-mace piece of sci-fi horror.I won't say anything about the plot, especially any of it's revelations, it
is best enjoyed going in blind. This is not a fast paced movie, it takes it's time to develop and if that bugs you, don't watch, but it is this slower pace that can make it creep under your skin, the shots are often lingering on the creatures, and we are able to spend a decent amount of time with each of the characters in the film simpler because of it's limited cast and location. The arctic location makes it feel bleak and desolate just by nature, and also gives it a vast sense of hopelessness.I enjoyed many of the characters, from Mcready's crustiness, to Window & Palmer's sarcastic nature, to Blair's intelligence and paranoia, to Rawls incessant music and rollerskating. The characters are all distinct and likeable, even if not all of them are necessarily compelling. This is something that really distinguishes it from most sci-fi and most horror films.The score is always effective and interesting, it is one of the best scores of any movie I can think of, and is integral to the overall success of the film, it is never over bear and always adds to the moods of the moment within the film.The cinematography is beautiful, especially the arctic shots, and there inside shots are well-done, they set the claustrophobic mood right out of the gate, often making the cramped quarters seem even more cramped, even in the larger open areas, even outside, simply because of the below freezing arctic temperatures.If this movie doesn't scare you, hopefully you can at least appreciate the effects in the film. One of the greatest achievements of this film, is the practical effects that pushed the boundaries of those effects to their limit, and with a $10,000,000 budget($33,000,000 today), it has the budget to allow this, unlike most sci-fi/horror films, which have tight budget constraints. The effects are grotesque, but not so much for the sake of being grotesque, but rather by necessity, this is one case where a more is more approach actually works, each grotesque sequence often topping the next. I am always amazing, every single time, by the effects that were achieved, now some 36 years ago.The 2011 ""The Thing"" prequel really proves just why practical effects often work so much better than digital ones, the digital effects often are to fast and jaunty, and over time, tend to look cartoonish; even mediocre practical effects do not suffer from this as much as digital ones. This is exactly why there has been a move back towards practical effects recently, they will almost always look more real. I believe both have their place, but in some movies, they have no place at all, and the original thing proves this, the only place the original thing may have benefited from digital effects, is in the last 20 minutes.We only ever know as much as the characters in the movie know, and that isn't much, so if that bugs you, you probably shouldn't watch this. This is a who-dunnit in a way, and things do not wrap up in a neat package, not at all, why this will drive some crazy, it is one of the best things about the movie, you never have all the answers, and you never will.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

You get a quick idea of the characters and then you go straight into the action and don't stop. Nice mix of science to the pot gives it great believability and plausibility.

"Thrilling and intelligent, though some loose ends and missing explanations.","Carpenter is one of a king when it comes to movies, he does his thing here with some well done directing that really grabs to your back and hangs on, the silent scenes of the long halls only supported by gothic and mysterious music are definetely the best side of this movie, silence can scare.The movie follows a group stationed at a research facility in the antharctica (Spelled correctly? Probably not :), one day two men arrives in a helicopter apparently hunting a dog, they appear crazy and are shooting at the dog without thinking, after hitting one of the men of the facility they shoot the strangers. After going through the information gained from their corpses they travel to their camp and discovers it more or less ruin and burned out, returning to their home they put the strange dog into the kennel where it kills the other dogs and turns out as a monster, an investigation is set upon and the dead dog is investigated, it shows that the dog was controlled by an organism able to imitate other organisms to create a perfect copy, from here, the movie begins.Carpenter showed with Halloween already that his is one hell of a horror director, his strength is that he goes for psychological horror mixes only by a little gore, i hate the gore part of horror movies as it often appears un interesting and in the long run just plain boring, but Carpenter does this differently, he doesn't show to much of it, but still a little to disgust us, his unique style, that has however been copied a few times, is shown very pure here, with the many silent runs through the slim corridors, down creepy halls, with the classic horror music pumping through your vanes.The acting is pretty good, i wouldn't say that there are any of these that does a terrific job, i didn't feel that way at least, there are many main characters, which makes it a little confusing and also hard for one individual to stand out, even if Kurt Russell has the main part, they're all a bit above average but all fades a little to the background as there are so many different persons to focus at.Even though this is without a doubt one of the classic and memorable psychological terror movies, there is no doubt that it is flawed as well as beautiful, there are several loose ends and just generally things that i felt could have been explained better, in the start of the movie it paces very fast through the start of the movie, where i would have preferred a slower introduction that explained better what was really going on, but later on the story sums up rather nicely and does create a rather thrilling and entertaining movie.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
John Carpenter....,"Was on a hot-streak when ""The Thing"" came out.  He had Halloween, a landmark film for horror, the very good ""The Fog"" and the cult classic ""Escape from New York"" under his belt, so he tried his hand on sci-fi/horror combination (two genres which he knew best).The thing succeeds because people like to see gore, and while that concept was sort of new to Carpenter (earlier movies were almost goreless), he succeeds in making one of the gorest films in history.While the movie sometimes moves at a glacial pace, the story is well developed (like an X-files episode), the characters are at least identifable (sometimes, movies with alot of people in situations, I sometimes forget whose who!).  Not really scary, there is a lot of suspense and tension built up, because1. The people don't know who the alien (thing) is and2. They don't seem to like each other and would have no problems blowing each other away.For a good movie (skip the popcorn on this one), with the right mood music, darkened lighting, plenty of gore and tense atmospherical cinematography, try out ""The Thing""",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
There's a reason this film originally got poor reviews ...,"As to how this movie became a cult favorite is beyond me ..This film not only lacked in imagination and was filled with dull moments, but there was nothing tense nor suspenseful about it.The special effects were good enough for its times, and the ambiance was fantastic and essentially the plot focused on paranoia is a good one..but here lies the problem ...The suspense and tension was not cleverly executed, it was dragged down making only the top notch special effects pop.The film did not have a single female character which could have added a romantic element, no absolute humor and no fear factor aside from the ugly 'thing'.Bored through most of this dragged dull mess i regret investing a single second.

another gushing fanboy reaction,"Over the years this film is up there with ALIEN and DAWN OF THE DEAD as the horror movie I have gone back and rewatched the most times. There's just so much to appreciate. Much like both of those films, it is not strictly of one genre. It is a horror film as well as a psychological paranoia thriller, an explosion and gunfire-filled action movie, and a plausible science fiction movie. On top of that, it vaguely realistically depicts life in an antarctic research station, a setting that has not yet been fully explored to my satisfaction. There's a few goofups there such as an antarctic base housing a subterranean generator room (wouldn't they be concerned that such a thing would melt the ice out from under the buildings?).It's the mindblowing special effects that make this film so memorable. Body horror and transformation effects have never been so gooey, gross, and realistically done outside of one or two David Cronenberg career highlights. Much like Cronenberg, Carpenter complements the effects with a grim and uncompromising tone that never falls into camp or forced comedic relief. Thankfully there is zero romantic subplot at all to get in the way of things, which focuses the film in a way that few horror movies do. Sure in ALIEN and DAWN, characters seemed to have preexisting relationships but none of it drew particular attention away from the horrific goings on. The characters here feel a little underdeveloped on first viewing but they feel like real human beings with realistic reactions to their surroundings and little expository dialog.My favorite characterization in the film goes to The Thing itself, which acts more alien and animalistic than aliens in any other film. When we think about how contact will go with an extraterrestrial organism, it's easy to make it either fully hostile or friendly and all-knowing, without fully examining the middle ground that it may be even more fully evolved to focus exclusively on its own survival. It doesn't really care about communication or technical achievement. It's just out to defend itself at any cost.This gives rise to many intriguing concepts that the film hints at; what is consciousness if an alien can replicate and project the personality of a human so easily? Is someone infected or replaced by a Thing even aware that they are no longer human? Is the Thing more like a virus or a collective animal such as a Portuguese Man-o-War with certain cells' sole function to perform specific tasks (such as stinging or ""taking over"" other organisms)? What we see the creature do leads to more and more questions, which leaves the door wide open for further explorations of this universe through novelizations etc., an abhorrent prequel, video games, and, best of all, our own imagination.The Thing is an intriguing, shocking, and exciting film. It's hard to find a lot of flaw in it outside of a few banal lines and continuity goofs here and there. My main complaint is that didn't go a little further in depicting alien behavior and could have used a much more clever finale than the somewhat disappointing standoff that we get. It's almost as though the budget ran out or the crew and screenwriter all just collectively got tired toward the end of the process after creating so much brilliance for 90 minutes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

True this film is very close to my heart....

A Cold Case of Terror,"John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is a shocking horror movie.  The special effects may not be up to par compared to what is possible in movies today, but there are still chilling elements.  For one thing, Ennio Morricone's intense score sets the creepy tone, with chords that suggest a pulse or a heartbeat.  Then the scene in which the men's blood is tested to see if any one of them had been infected by the Thing, that will shock you.  Beneath it all is a study in paranoia.  Who can you really trust?  This just might haunt you more than anything else about the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Just not all that scary to me,"I did find this movie entertaining but it never created the depth of fear that's been ascribed to it.

The one movie that stuck with me.,"I first saw this movie when I was 10 years old. My dad owned it on VHS.He told me it was the scariest movie he'd ever seen and allowed me to watch it with him that night. I grew up watching everything. I wasn't worried. Well I was wrong.After the movie was over, I just sat on the couch trying to get my thoughts together on what I had just watched. I remember my dad telling me that my face looked very pale and blank. I was terrified.Oh, and we had a Siberian husky. Who slept with me every night. That night and a few after, she did not.This film is more then a horror movie. To me, it's a reference point. It's how I grew to be almost obsessed with the horror genre.This movie, even though it was made in the 80's, will still scare the hell out of anyone, even today. This movie is still very much relevant and the effects can't be matched by most movies that are being made today.Lastly, people say the Exorcist is the scariest movie ever made. It's not.

CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...""I know I'm human. And if you were all these Things, then you'd just attack me right now. So, some of you are still human.""This is one of the very first horror movies I ever remember seeing, and I loved it back then. I just re-watched it again tonight, and I still love it. I don't know why, but I've always had a soft spot for a good horror movie that is not only taking place in an isolated location, but one that also takes place during the winter. Maybe I have Kubrick's version of ""The Shining"" to thank for that, since it is the first real horror movie I've ever seen, if you don't count ""Psycho"". But, when I first watched ""The Thing"", I was glued to the screen. The house could've burned down around me and I wouldn't have cared. Nothing was going to break me away from watching that movie.Our story begins in Antarctica, where a Norwegian helicopter chases a dog to a nearby American research station, trying, unsuccessfully, to kill the dog. When one of the Norwegians opens fire on the men at the station, he is shot dead and the dog is taken in. Little did they know the danger that was hiding inside of the dog ... but it doesnt' take long for them to find out. An alien has found its way to earth, assimilating anything it comes into contact with and then imitating them, in the form of a perfect likeness. Soon, it is a game of survival and paranoia with nobody to trust and nowhere to go.This film has some of the most memorable moments in horror history as John Carpenter has given us a true classic in the genre. It wasn't very well accepted upon its release with most of the critics dismissing it as trash. But, if we listened to the critics, then ""Star Wars"" would never have been a hit. The special and practical effects were 2nd to none at the time, with excellent work by Robin Bottin with his various creature designs that were used in the film. Though some of the characters weren't fully fleshed out, the acting was solid, especially by Kurt Russell in the lead role. The tension felt real.I'm a huge fan of Carpenter's work, and this is hands down one of his best films. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but it is damn close. As I was watching this tonight, it realized it had been too long since I'd last seen it, which was literally years ago. This should be a once a year thing, it is that good.

Overrated,"I don't really understand what all the rage is about. I found the story fairly slow moving and the ""Dark Star""-esquire crew is in the way of creating a real threatening atmosphere. I find that odd as that has always been Carpenter's strong point, particularly in Assault or The Fog. Whereas the violence in the Fog is all inside the viewer's head, here it's right on the screen. I guess it's slightly unfair to judge with hindsight as the special effects are made less spectacular by the fact that we have seen them in Alien. What puzzled me most was Morricone's soundtrack which sounded is exactly like the music Carpenter himself composes. Why hire someone to copy you? All in all, I find Carpenter's first big studio film highly overrated.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Maltin's wrong,"Maltin is completely wrong when he says the effects in this '82 remake of the '51 classic overwhelm the suspense here.

Paranoid and suspenseful,"This film is hot on the heels of Alien (1979) with an otherworldly creature taking over a small crew in a limited, isolated environment.

This contributes to a sense of paranoid mystery that burns slowly from the beginning, starting with the Norwegians trying to kill a dog which puts everyone on alert. From there, everyone goes insane as they are picked off one by one - but they do not know whom is affected! The special effects of the creature makes it completely disturbing and revolting, while the setting is inhospitable and harsh. The he characters are quite stereotypical unlike the ones from Alien, but the acting is still great when it shows the paranoid panic and violence that afflicts the crew when they scrutinise the creature and each other.

One of if not the best horror movie ever.,"John Carpenter's The Thing does everything right. Brilliant casting, haunting atmosphere and it leaves you with many unanswered questions.

The Thing,"As remakes go, this is one of the better ones that I have seen - though I still prefer the degree of menace generated by the 1951 iteration. A man in an helicopter is shooting at a lonely mutt amidst the antarctic wilderness when it arrives at an American scientific base. An accident ensures the inhabitants cannot interrogate the pursuing Norwegians and a quick visit to their nearby camp shows that disaster has struck. A large block of hollowed out ice suggests, though, that they may well have made an unique discovery - especially when they find some smouldering skeletal remains. Back at their own camp - along with their new charcoaled find - things get back to normal until the mysterious dog is put into the cage with the others and all hell breaks loose. It is soon clear to ""Mac"" (Kurt Russell) that they are dealing with something extremely strong, adaptable and ruthless. Can they survive? The visual effects here go a long way to compensating for the rather lacklustre acting - Russell isn't really very good - and the claustrophobic antarctic settings and howling winds add a richness and sense of peril to this superior horror story. The fact that the creature has a sort of Azazel-like ability to transfer from any life-form to another, and to more than one simultaneously adds some decent jeopardy to the plot, too, as neither they nor us know who is to be trusted right until the ending. This is certainly one of John Carpenter's better efforts - and is well worth a watch on a cold winter's night!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Thing is a bloody disgusting groundbreaking masterpiece that reinvented cinema and reminded everyone that true fear lies in what can't be seen.,"The Thing might be the greatest horror creature film ever made. In an age where aliens were cute and friendly like E. T., John Carpenter's The Thing depicted a disturbing, grotesque creature of nightmare responsible for some of film's most terrifying body horror. The Thing was so far ahead of its time in horror and effects that it brought the terror into reality. Carpenter's brilliant decision to set the film in the frozen wilderness of Antarctica deepens the isolation and paranoia of every second. The practical effects are unbelievable and so impressive, allowing the actors to interact with the horror and make their performances that much more genuine and frightening. The Thing personifies paranoia as Kurt Russell's MacReady attempts to discover who is alien and who is not, with disgusting and disastrous consequences. Carpenter's The Thing is a gut-wrenching horror masterpiece that deserved so much more acclaim and recognition than it received upon its release.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Still my favorite movie of all time.,"Horror and thriller doesn't get any better than The Thing. There are so many great aspects such as how the people die, how the people turn against each other, and how the people reflect on what could happen next.However, the part that makes The Thing such a gem is that the characters don't make any dumb decisions. If they do, it's either a very minor mistake, or it doesn't factor into the group as a whole (like when Fuchs follows the thing outside. We don't actually know what happened to him, but he was found burned). The smart decisions are what keep the characters alive, but the thing is so powerful that it can work its way through it and still penetrate them. In the end, however, the thing is outsmarted, blown up, and only two people survive (one of them could be an imitation).",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A character study in paranoia.,"John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" isn't so much a horror movie as it is an in -depth portrait of human paranoia and the unconsciously manipulative effect situations can have on us all. By no means is this film an essay. It is a gut-wrenching mind game of second guessing and graphic violence that, quite frankly, shocked me upon initially viewing it. It's a scary movie of the first order, one that understands the difference between what is really scary and what is simply there for it's own sake. This remake of ""The Thing From Another World"" (which actually more closely resembles the novella ""Who Goes There?"") isn't a favorite of critics. There are reasons for this, although the artistry or effectiveness of ""The Thing"" have little to do with them. This movie has several strikes against it. Strike one: it is a remake, and one that dares (God forbid) to be a different film than it's predecessor. Strike two: graphic gore typically strikes professional critics as gratuitous regardless of the context it holds in the film. Already, this film is on shaky ground. Well, I personally have made it a rule never to take anyone's word on a film other then my own. My word? This movie isn't perfect, though in watching it, you're not looking for that. Perhaps that last sentence needs amending. It perfectly does what it intends to do: scare it's audience. One of Carpenter's finest.  I loved this movie.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Great singular examples of craftsmanship in an otherwise vapid film !!!,"'The Thing' was one of those big cinematic blind spots for me. This film like many cult classics didn't enjoy critical or box office success at the time of its release, but has gradually over the years become a very popular and loved movie. This was my first viewing of the film and my review is based on a single viewing.I don't think it is possible to watch 'The Thing' and not get reminded of Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. Both films came out in round about the same time within a span of 3 years. Both films are about a team of people isolated in the middle of nowhere being hounded by an alien monster. However, 'The Thing' didn't impress me anywhere near as much as 'Alien' does every time I watch it.Let me first point out the elements of the film that I liked. The practical effects that are on show in the film are some of the best ever put on screen. There are moments of sheer terror due to the convincing nature of the practical effects. Another positive aspect of the film is that John Carpenter really knows how to build up the tension. He knows how to subtly move the camera or hold a shot for just the right amount of time to create a sense of dread in the mind of the viewer. Another great aspect of the film is the dog that we meet right at the beginning. Carpenter somehow got the dog to perform as well as any animal I have ever seen perform on screen.My problems with the film stem from the lack of depth in the script and lack of depth in the characters. 'Alien' works so well because it has so much going on underneath the monster film surface. It is a commentary on the gradual loss of human qualities in the age of capitalism along with the exploration of disturbing themes like rape and unwanted pregnancies. Unfortunately I did not find any subtext in 'The Thing'. I have read some articles where people have tried to find an allegory for the Cold War, but I just didn't observe any depth in the screenplay to think along those lines.Another huge problem is that I found the characters to be very bland with no depth what so ever. In 'Alien' we don't get much back story about the characters either, but Ridley Scott used multiple scenes where we found the characters engaging in small talk and being as realistic as possible allowing us to relate with them. 'The Thing' has almost no quiet scenes where the characters are talking about ordinary, banal stuff. That just didn't make the characters interesting enough and since the characters weren't compelling enough, I found myself losing interest slowly and at the climax of the film I really got bored.As I wrote earlier, this review contains my opinions about the film after watching it once. I might change my stance with subsequent viewings. But right now, I have to say 'The Thing' left me underwhelmed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Thing... The Best.,"Hands down - The Best.I created this account while watching it for the eleventeenth time... And it gets better with every viewing.

In fact, this film has the finest performances by every actor in the ensemble.I don't want to write anymore because I'm still watching it!

"""Why don't we wait here for a little while...see what happens.""","John Carpenters' intense, grim, shocking, and garish monster movie has transcended its poor box office performance back in 1982 to take its place as one of the great experiences of its kind, and one of the directors' finest achievements. A more faithful adaptation of the John W. Campbell, Jr. short story ""Who Goes There?"" than the 1951 Howard Hawks production ""The Thing from Another World"", it gets a lot of impact from the central conceit of the story, dropped by the makers of the Hawks movie.Here, the rampaging alien has the ability to assume the appearance of any living thing that it consumes, leading to an overwhelming sense of paranoia as the men of the story have to come to terms with the reality that they can't trust each other any more.The Antarctic setting is perfect for such a story, with our characters completely cut off from contact with civilization, isolated and forced to work to save themselves. While the story is an extremely serious one, with a tone of dread established immediately, there are memorable doses of humour at select points that provide much needed and highly amusing relief. Ennio Morricones' subtle, scary music, unfairly nominated for a Razzie at the time, is appropriate to the story. Carpenter collaborates with a first rate creative team (especially production designer John Lloyd and cinematographer Dean Cundey) who lend their considerable talents to make an incredible looking movie. Carpenter uses his standard Panavision aspect ratio of 2.35:1 to arrange people and objects within the frame to great effect. Makeup effects expert Rob Bottin creates one of the most striking monsters to be seen in the science fiction genre, displaying a delightful macabre imagination all the way through; the scenes are now indelibly etched in the minds of those that have seen them. (Stan Winstons' contribution, done as a favour in order to help Bottin with the workload, should not be overlooked.)Carpenters' frequent leading man Kurt Russell delivers a superbly understated performance as the reluctant hero MacReady, and receives rock solid supporting performances from a well chosen cast of familiar character actors - Wilford Brimley, T.K. Carter, David Clennon, Keith David, Richard Dysart, Charles Hallahan, Peter Maloney, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, Joel Polis, and Thomas Waites.Carpenters' somewhat slow pace - at least in the early going - allows the creepiness and sense of mystery to really take hold until the nature of the threat is finally exposed. The story devastatingly illustrates just how ugly things can get when a chain of command is broken and a group of men start to mistrust and fear each other. (It's a brave move on the part of Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster to exclude female characters, something that wouldn't fly nowadays.)No matter how badly this may have fared both critically and commercially back in 1982, its following has done nothing but grown stronger in the over 30 years since its release. It represents a great effort from everybody involved.Nine out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A textbook example of suspense and horror,"Much as Star Trek: Nemesis was released terminally close to The Two Towers and fell well below box office expectations, Universal chose to try and kill the then-rising star director John Carpenter's career by releasing The Thing a mere two weeks after a little feel-good piece called E.T. It is somewhat funny, the spin history can put on things, because now as a Lucas-like special edition has failed to reinvigorate interest in the family-friendly box office hit, The Thing has found a new life as a cult piece. This is not to put down Spielberg's career-building piece, as it is a well-made film in its own right. But years after I have forgotten Spielberg's effort, and dismissed it after he tried to make even more suitable only for infants, I still remember the mood it put me in, the first time I saw The Thing, and watched as the creepiest score I have heard in at least a thousand films played over elegantly understated credits. Put simply, The Thing should be shown to film-making students as an example of how you build suspense.The film starts out innocently enough, with what appears to be a husky running from a helicopter as a (lousy) sharpshooter tries to kill it. Running and flying into an American research station, the husky tries to bond with the present staff as the sharpshooter emerges and tries to warn them in broken-sounding Norwegian. As the helicopter is accidentally destroyed and the sharpshooter shot dead, the husky works its way into the confidence of the camp, eventually placed in the kennel at the insistence of one of its edgier residents. The new husky soon reveals itself to be an alien creature, not that this is any surprise to the audience. As the alien absorbs the other huskies, the men at the research centre are fortunate enough to get to it before it finishes. Whether one of them has already been absorbed before two of them pay a visit to the station the Norwegians came from is a matter of debate, but things take a definite turn for the worse when they bring back some artifacts from the site.Screenwriters like Ehren Kruger could learn a lot from The Thing. Although the scenario itself is incredibly harrowing, especially when you consider what could happen if the chameleon found its way into civilisation, its the details that make the story what it is. One of the men, considering the what could happen question, destroys every means the team has to call for help or leave, cutting them off completely. While most of the others do nothing quite so dramatic, their anatognism towards one another makes scenes that would normally be test patterns into something that may make viewers bite their nails. In contrast to the The Thing From Another World, this tension comes from the important fact that destroying the evil alien is almost secondary to identifying it. And in one of those happy coincidences, the scene where our hero does learn to identify the alien is far from the end of the tension. In point of fact, the scene in which he administers the test to identify who has been absored is unequalled in American film when it comes to tension. I still leap out of my seat in the quick shot where the ""infected"" blood sample is tested.Although it is generally bad for a film to rely on its special effects, both the story and said effects are top of the line here. The Thing was the eighth film on which Rob Bottin provided special makeup effects, and is among the films cited when his godlike reputation in the field is discussed. Regardless of whether one considers makeup effects an extension of special effects or otherwise, both can be summed up as an art where the goal is to fool people into believing they are seeing something they're not. I doubt that anyone is going to believe they are seeing an alien organism of any kind until it becomes commonplace, but like the acting, writing, and music, Bottin's artwork is a wall in a tense atmosphere that dares the viewer to look away. As in all the best films that ask the viewer to accept unreal elements, The Thing does this the right way, by suspending disbelief in graduating steps. By the time the most outrageous unrealities are unleashed upon us, we have been so drawn into the world of the story that there is no going back. It never ceases to amaze me how much the filmmakers of the 1980s could get away with in terms of stretching reality compared to their present-day cousins.This would be (at least) the third of many collaborations between Kurt Russell and John Carpenter. The two never work better than when they work together. Russell has shown a number of different modes under Carpenter's direction, from the loud arrogance of Big Trouble In Little China to the hoarse understatement of Escape From New York. In The Thing, Russell starts at the latter end of his acting spectrum and ends a couple of steps toward the former. Not that Russell is the most versatile actor in the world, but this film calls for an everyday man type, and Russell more than fits the bill. The audio commentary recorded for the Laserdisc goes into the less than noble motivations the men have for being at the research station, and Russell is best among this cast at giving the viewer a character they can see the events through the eyes of. Not that the rest of the cast let the side down in any way. Everyone from Wilford Brimley to David Clennon gives their character all three dimensions, and the story benefits enourmously from it.I gave The Thing a ten out of ten. In a season of remakes for the sake of remakes, see this for an example of a remake done right.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
It's your thing,"Sci-fi horror isn't really my thing but I did enjoy John Carpenter's stylish and exciting re-make of a 1950's Howard Hawks production (which I haven't seen). Sure the plot looks very familiar, Alien gone south, but the freezing climate and remote location of the Antarctic fit the ""nowhere to run"" scenario just as well as the moon.After the arresting opening, which introduces the vastness of the frozen wasteland of the region as a helicopter for some reason chases a husky dog over miles and miles until it reaches the American scientific exploration base, the film settles into the again familiar ""and then there were none"" plot line as the alien entity starts to prey on every living thing in the camp.The film benefits, in my opinion from its lack of major star-power, thus providing a more communal feel among the menaced men and making it harder to guess who, if anyone will still be standing at the end.The special make-up effects are absolutely terrific, making for many ""don't look now"" moments. Carpenter keeps us in the dark, literally, as almost all the attack sequences take place to gloomy backdrops, aided in this by Ennio Morricone's brooding and atmospheric soundtrack. The acting is good, strong ensemble stuff, although some of the characters fir me lacked individuality. I'd also slightly criticise the ending as being inordinately stretched out and lacking the climactic finish I think the previous tension merited.Nevertheless this was at least as gripping and exciting as any of the ""Alien"" movies I've seen, plus the similarly themed ""The Abyss"". In fact, make my aliens bloodthirsty rather than cuddly any day of the week.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Nice and simple (also somewhat positively nasty),"Nice old-school horror/action movie with silly special effects and clumsy characters, who somehow end up contaminated backstage and turn their back in really inopportune moments to get jump scared by the alien ""Thing"". Nevertheless, I successfully suspended my disbelief, and ""The Thing"" actually turned into pretty good experience!The less fortunate characters get consumed by the Thing, which then assumes their appearance and personality, indistinguishable from the original. BUT we don't know who are the Thing and who are the paranoid people acting out against their teammates out of fear. Really great touch, I always psychological suspense instead of simple bool and strings. The Thing looks silly, but the ooze and blood are real nasty and make it terrifying for to OCD brain.As a side-note, the film probably would benefit from charismatic characters deeply connected to the murder victims after living/working with these people for years, HOWEVER, if the screenwriters had failed with character development, ""suspending-the-disbelief"" stuff wouldn't be in the cards (the tropes at least provide some foundation). So the lack of character is for the better!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"""The Thing"" makes ""Alien"" look like ""Barney Goes To Outer Space""","I swear I thought ""The Thing"" was a thousand times scarier than ""Alien"". The orginal movie is kind of boring. It's a classic, but this is one of those rare occasions the remake is needed. Besides the awesome effects, the acting is phenominal. Kurt Russell is amazing. How everyone just turns against each other was so natural. The make up was incredable. I couldn't believe that this movie was made in 1982. I think ""The Thing"" is very under rated in it's 7.8 star status. I think it should be higher. Maybe even reach up to the top 250. I'm not kidding, I loved ""The Thing"". I would recommend it.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
It's been a while since I've typed this line in a review: an old horror movie without cheese.,"Let me get this out of the way: I am not a biased fan of this movie. I did not grow up with it, I did not see it once, get scared, and then love it when I was older, and I did not watch it with any hype or weighted opinion whatsoever. I'm not really a John Carpenter fan. I am a hardcore horror fan who has seen the majority of what the genre has to offer. I am an adult, and I watched this last night, 9/17/08. I'm not sure it's possible to find an opinion that is more unbiased than mine when I say: The Thing rocked.First and foremost, the reason The Thing works is because it does not bash your over the head with a block of cheese, unlike most ""classic"" horror movies. Some of the effects are a bit outdated, despite what the lifetime fans would have you believe, but not so much as to look cheesy. At all. There is very little gorenothing that the average parent wouldn't let a 8-year-old seeand the gore effects are also outdated, but it doesn't take away from the movie. I just found it downright refreshing to watch a movie that didn't try to kick me in the balls. I've watched so many ultra-gory movies lately, The Thing made me remember what it was like when movies didn't use gore to make the viewer feel like crap, but instead used gore as part of the actual story. It's the perfect movie to watch on a snowy night with your girlfriend/wife or your kids.The reason The Thing isn't cheesy is because it submerges you in atmosphere and suspense and mystery, then it punches you. The creatures are not generic whatsoever, and some of them are downright weirdly awesome. (Spider-head, anyone?) The plot is pretty generic, if you can even call it a plot at all. Here is one of the greatest movies of all time, and it does something that you wouldn't expect: it doesn't really have a plot. No, The Thing is true survival horror. There is nothing here except the desire to survive, and that is the only plot. The opening scene hints that the creatures are aliens, but, really, the movie never says much about their origins other than that. Watching this movie is almost like watching people in an arena try to surviveyou don't watch it for the story. What makes The Thing original and different from the other movies like it is the small details, like setting, the creature designs, the characters, the ending, and so on.People who get bored with this movie don't understand suspense. I can understand that, because in the generation that we live in, suspense is dead and buried. Suspense has been replaced with either (1) lame action, or (2) lame dialogue scenes that ""build characters"", even though the characters are pure clichés. Suspense is the feeling of ""I know everyone is going to die . . ."" that you get before anything happens. I can count the amount of movies that get suspense right on one hand, but The Thing honestly pulls it off. If you're a fan of suspense moviesand no, I don't mean Wolf Creek, I mean like AlienI do not know why you haven't seen this movie already.Then there is one more thing I need to mention: The Thing isn't Alien. It never will be Alien. It is not quite as good as Alien, though it has more action. It is, however, the only movie I would ever mention in the same breath as Alien, because it does come very, very close.Overall: This is by far the best Carpenter movie I've seen, and one of the few movies I've ever seen that understands suspense. It's easily one of the best horror movies of all time, and I'm saying that as someone who find most ""classic"" horror movies pure cheese. Watch this movie. Watch it now.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Let's see what happens,"And there is a lot to see - no pun intended. Mainly the special effects of course. Practical effects and they have aged as fine as anything can age. Then there is also the music - fantastic (and John Carpenter let someone else help him - Ennio Morricone to be exact). So having fantastic people in all departments is something that always helps. Behind the camera (Winston, Morricone, Carpenter himself and many more) and in front of it.But I got quite ahead of myself. The movie can be considered a remake of sorts - although it is quite different than the movie that was made many decades before this hit the screens - again no pun intended. The story is strong enough and I do like the original movie too, but it was made with different intentions. You actually will not find many people comparing or calling this a remake. If you search for The thing remake you'll find the 2011 movie - which is not a remake. It is meant to be a prequel to the Carpenter movie.Well this all may be too much to comprehend, but the one thing you need to know: if you can stomach it (this is quite brutal and scary, so not for the faint of heart), this is the definitve The Thing movie that exists, which is based on the short story ""Who goes there"".I could write so many things ... about the thing - but I'll leave it at that - I just will not be able to give you an ending as great as this movie has in store for you ...",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An actual good representative of the Horror genre,"Most horror movies will have dumb characters to make their scenarios seem helpless and therefore ""scary"". This horror movie has smart characters, attempting their best to be rational in a troubling and isolated place, and unlike most horror movies you can tell this one focused partly on the mental state of a group of people in a horror which makes it all the more realistic. The paranoia is relatable. The ambiguity is intriguing and will make you debate with whoever you watch or talk with about the movie. By far one of the most well done horrors.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Trust no one,"I really liked the movie, it's a classic that is definetely a reference for many other movies. For me the strong point is the script. We don't know who to believe, and we really find ourselves in a situation similar to the characters in the film, where no one can trust anyone. Visually, it's not a film that has aged as well as contemporary films of the genre, such as Alien (1979), but it's far from bad. What I like most about this film is the ending, which leaves the mystery of what actually happened hanging in the air, generating discussions and theories from fans, who try to find answers to questions that will probably never be answered.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
John Carpenter's The Thing is a Masterpiece (full stop),"So initially I wrote this (kind of) short review:Though I love E.T. (also at the time) The Thing was the thing for me, absolutely 100%Where E.T. today feels more like a Muppet Show (the plastic like E.T. is no longer as believable has he was in the 80s) The Thing still holds up against time in a rare and wonderful all men cast and a Kurt Russell playing chess with a computer, having a long strong drink when needed.This is a man's and a big boy's movie. And for this reason alone no man should ever miss out on this film.Maybe John Carpenter felt under pressure and had a hard time making it (so I read somewhere). But looking back there is no doubt in my mind, now as then, that The Thing is a wonderful Masterpiece (big thumbs up from me).And that was the reviewBut IMDb need more words to accept a review, so therefore I will continue:When The Thing first came out I was already the biggest John Carpenter fan ever on planet Earth. So no wonder that I went for the first screening a Friday at 12:00 noon at the (at that time) second biggest screen in Copenhagen, Denmark (Palads cinema screening room 1).Dolby Stereo was still a new thing back then and when the film faded up in a hand held panoramic wide shot of the cold ice at the South Pole together with the heartbeat drum of Ennio Morricone the tense atmosphere was set and ready. I knew from the first twenty seconds of the film that I was about to watch a Masterpiece and I also knew that I wasn't going to be disappointedIf you have never watch The Thing and there is a given chance (somehow) that you in the near future of your short life will have the chance to watch this Masterpiece on a big screen in a cinema, you should wait for this option rather than watching it on DVD or whatever digital media you can find. That is if you want to experience the initially Oomph that this film's first scene brings to its audienceIn any regards all big boys and men should see this MAN FILM !!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I love it!,"This is easily one of my favorite movies. The building dread throughout and the acting are all great. The way ever character is written and the uncertainty played throughout is great. The practical effects are amazing and this movie is just all around amazing. I don't fully know what else to say about it, it's just an amazing movie with so much ambiguity. I could watch it again and again. Even through the slow parts of the movie, it picks back up shortly after so it's not that noticeable. Even though this is a remake of The Thing From Another World (1951) it's great and not really a remake at the same time. I love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Among Carpenter's films, this is his personal favorite.","This movie still resonates 35 years after it came out. Released during the year of ET and other huge summer classics, it failed to connect with its audience due to its graphic imagery and desolate setting. It was also a remake of a cult movie that was featured in Carpenter's most successful movie, Halloween, during a pivotal scene in that movie. It would find new life on home media during the holiday season and became a cult classic in its own right and ranks among the greatest horror films of all time. The visual effects, soundtrack, acting, and cinematography are top notch. The budget of this was more than his previous films combined!!! I suggest you get the Scream Factory collector's edition, since it has a treasure trove of special features, a restored 2k print of the movie (Arrow video in the UK has a 4k print coming out in the fall) along with a newly mixed 4.1 track from the 70mm Dolby Stereo six track reels, and a reversable slip cover that is common with Shout blurays.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A review from another world,The Thing is an absolute classic combining body horror with intense thriller to make something that stands out in every aspect.The Idea is that the thing organism absorbs a living organism and copies it perfectly to blend in with its environment and assimilate all other organisms while hiding among them just a single cell from the thing is a creature in itself that will fight to survive if separated from the main body nothing organic is safe.The movie takes place in Antarctica in a small research base where a small crew become infected the trouble is who has been assimilated and who hasn't who can you trust when your eyes can't see the threat.The intense thriller aspect is done very well as knowbody knows who to trust and could transform at a moments notice people become paranoid and violent and fight or flight response kicks in.The body horror and gore effects for the transformations into the creatures is very graphic and detailed made with practical effects that look so real and well made better than any CGI could ever be.The cast is great Kurt Russell is iconic in this movie and the dedication from the actors and crew is amazing.If you haven't seen The thing by some miracle I strongly recommend you watch it even if your not one for horror it's hard not to appreciate a movie so well made and spine chilling.Just a suggestion to anyone who watches the movie on Blu Ray the main menu screen shows small cuts from the movie in flashes and it shows a lot or key moments that spoil the film so if you plan to watch the movie on Blu Ray I suggest making sure your ready before putting the disk in and when the main menu starts pressing play on the movie ASAP as you can use the pop up menu to put the subtitles on and change the language and such without having the movie spoiled for you enjoy it spoiler free.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"A Masterpiece Of Unrelenting Terror, Nail-Biting Suspense & Omnipresent Paranoia","A masterpiece of unrelenting terror, nail-biting suspense & persistently looming paranoia, John Carpenter's The Thing is one of the greatest films of its genre(s) that presents its esteemed filmmaker at the apex of his talents for the remarkable simplicity with which Carpenter succeeds in infusing the storyline with a chilling sense of dread, tension & uncertainty right from its opening moments and then effortlessly sustaining those vital horror elements throughout the film's runtime is no mere achievement in itself.Set in Antarctica, the story of The Thing follows the crew of an American research facility whose expedition is interrupted when a couple of seemingly delusional Norwegians barge into their station while pursuing & shooting a dog, and are killed in defence. But when the dog mutates and reveals its true identity, the crew deduces that they are being confronted by a parasitic alien lifeform that assimilates other organisms and in turn imitates them perfectly. With no one really sure of who's human & who's the imitator among them, paranoia develops within the group.Directed by John Carpenter (the mastermind behind Assault on Precinct 13 & Halloween), The Thing is without a doubt my favourite film of his. The plot creates an atmosphere of impending doom right from the beginning as we can sense that something is definitely not right with the dog, and thanks to the minimal but menacing track that accompanies that sequence, the build-up is quick & effective. Bill Lancaster's screenplay deserves a mention too for it retains the mystery from start to finish, keeps the premise unpredictable & although the characters aren't fleshed out that well, they do have an identity.The technical aspects further help in setting the film's desired tone & atmosphere, starting with its isolated set pieces that have this sort of a raw, unrefined feel to it which, in addition to its remote location, cleverly brings the element of claustrophobia into the narrative. Cinematography makes excellent use of its camera for the wisely chosen angles, minimal lighting & slow but fluid movements encapsulate the whole picture with an unsettling vibe which only amplifies as the story progresses. Editing is carried out in a very methodical manner as it allows the suspense to settle in at its own pace and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats throughout its 109 minutes of runtime.The work in the special effects & make-up department might have been groundbreaking during its time of release but it looks a tad dated now and at times, unintentionally funny as well and yet it fits & work in favour of this narrative for the most part. However, the most impressive aspect of The Thing in my opinion is its background score, composed by Ennio Morricone. What's amazing about the soundtrack is that it sounds exactly the way Carpenter himself would've scored it, with simple, synthesised tracks that help enhance the sinister mood of the picture and elevate it to a nerve-wracking level. It's quite possibly the best John Carpenter score that wasn't composed by John Carpenter.Coming to the performances, Kurt Russell spearheads the rest of the cast with a good show and plays the role of the research team's helicopter pilot. The script doesn't delve into the background of its various characters but it does give each one of these scripted people their deserving moment on the screen. There is much similarity to Ridley Scott's Alien as far as its casting goes for each character has a role to play here and even if we don't get to know enough about any of them, their predicament and the situation they find themselves in on the isolated continent is deeply felt. Also, both Russell & the rest of the supporting cast do well with what they're given and deliver truly convincing performances.On an overall scale, The Thing is as suspenseful as any cinema can get. It deserves to be ranked amongst the greatest horror films ever made, has aged amazingly well over the years despite its dated effects and still remains John Carpenter's finest directional effort to date. It may not be scary on a visceral level but its tense ambiance, claustrophobic setting & the omnipresent danger of the unknown can run havoc on the senses plus it leaves enough pieces for viewers to put together once the whole story has concluded. Immortal for its contribution to cinema, absolutely living up to its legacy, and continuing to inspire & influence modern chillers, John Carpenter's magnum opus is one chiller no horror fanatic should miss out on. Strongly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Nightmarish special effects highlight this decent film.,"John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is the type of movie where the special effects (by a young Rob Bottin) make the film.  If the film did not contain the gory, slimy and disgusting images that are seen it would be a dull, albeit semi-suspenseful flick.  The film stars five or six of the best character actors in Hollywood (Richard Masur, Donald Moffat and Keith David) on top of a slightly generic Kurt Russell performance. All in all, no viewer could ever forget the kind of fun this alien creature has with its human hosts.  It literally tries to become the organism it ""absorbs"".  And some characters get it BAD.  These scenes of terror are truly disturbing, especially for a younger viewer - which I was when I first saw it.  I really won't go into details here, but let me just say that Mr. Bottin's creative genius makes this film exceptional.  He must've had a great time designing these 'things' we see on the screen.

The Thing not as good as Alien,"Early Carpenter movies seem to find a particular niche and exploit them to their very best. I'm thinking of Assault on Precinct 13 (drama); The Fog (Ghost/thriller); Halloween (slasher/terror); Escape from New York (Sci Fi/thriller) and of course The Thing (Pure Horror);although ever since then he seems to have lost his magical touch.For a start, the original Thing from the 50s is a better movie because it relies on tension rather than out & out gore. In addition The Thing has been compared to Alien, but again the latter film has the edge because the gore is limited to our imagination while focusing on what's-around-the-corner scenario.Having said that, the story & characterisation are both very good. Russell seems to be enjoying himself as the anti-hero, more so than he did in the Escape films.Rob Bottin's special effects are truly amazing pre-CGI, and all the better for it. Although on the down side, I felt Ennio Morricone was the wrong choice to write the score - far too understated & amateurish. Morricone works better with orchestral scores and not messing around on synthesizers and samplers.The ending too was poor. Too many loose ends and disappearing characters. Bit of an anti-climax for a Carpenter film  then, but is still recommended especially in DVD with widescreen pro-logic.***/*****",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I can't get enough of this movie. Love the outdoor footage and the monsters kick ass.,"I remember peeking into this movie in the movie theatre when I was too young to see it- and seeing the most famous scene right at that moment. I was both shocked and scarred and excited at the same time- this was a movie that had just short circuited me- I had to see the rest of it!And I did- and I have watched it several times since then. I have also watched the interviews with the director etc...Carpenter has made some CRAP films in his day. This is not one of them- and in the interviews he blames short schedules and low budgets for the crappiness of some of his films (not in so many words) and judging by this masterpiece of science fiction horror I think he's onto something. Give John Carpenter enough time and money to do it- and he'll do it right!The Thing is based on a science fiction novel called ""Who Goes There"" and was inspired by Carpenter's repetitive viewing of an earlier film of the same title- but this version is a thousand times better, scarier, and also much more true to the original written story and it also captures such an awesome feeling of isolation and spookiness with the scenery and the camera angles and lighting.What can I say- it's a masterpiece.PLOT: A number of scientists and their support team are out in the arctic doing research- one day a crazy Norwegian shows up wanting to kill a friendly dog. They keep the dog.big mistake. What ensues next is a captivating tale of horror and suspense with special effects that still hold up to today's standards- more than 20 damn years later.I can't praise this film enough. It is a classic for the genre that has already stood the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The penultimate film about terror and fear through paranoia,"The easiest kind of horror these days are obviously cliché fests overloaden with cheap jump scares. All of which require little in the way of intelligent writing or cohesive storytelling. The Thing (1982) however, takes us back to a time when psychological and intelligent horror films were in abundance, and this is definitely one of the best in that regard.The Thing is undoubtedly one of the scariest movies ever made. There are very little cheap jumpscares, since The Thing focuses on the most difficult kind of horror to create; The psychological. The scare-factor in The Thing is simply because of the combination of excellent framing, eeriness in atmosphere and ofcourse the haunting soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. The extremely disturbing roar for 'The Thing' also contributes to the terrifying feel of it. All of these factors give the audience an uneasy and on-edge feeling that both enhances the tension significantly and creates a haunting atmospheric feeling. Ofcourse the practical effects ( Possibly the most discussed and praised aspect of The Thing ) are also a significant factor in the creation of actual fear and disgust throughout this film. When comparing these special effects to those of a later prequel, The Thing (2011), a painstakingly obvious verdict is that the latter's overuse of CGI really looks phony, ridiculous and not at all scary in any way. You could call the practical effects of The Thing (1982) absurd, and that is exactly what it was going for. The practical effects look disgusting, haunting and menacing. Besides which, the 'Thing' was shown far too often in said prequel, as opposed to the little screen time in this particular film, which significantly drains the tension as the psychological side of a largely unseen 'thing' is about the most intelligent feeling of unease one could get. That is why this is more than just a mere 'monster' flick, as the emphasis is on the tension and paranoia instead of the actual gore.As stated before, the original soundtrack by Ennio Morricone is an absolutely haunting piece that breathes fear ridden atmosphere like no other. A sense of hopelessness, paranoia, and a literal mimic of a human heartbeat are all present in the score. The opening scene of a helicopter attempting to shoot down a dog/wolf while Morricone's score is playing is quite possibly one of the most absorbing, haunting & beautiful opening scenes ever made.The acting is excellent, which is ofcourse a pretty rare thing in a horror film. There isn't a single weak performance visible, and a unique stand-out has to be the half dog, half wolf actor Jed. Never looking at the camera or crew, while maintaining this sense of alienism in him ( Especially the scene where he is first lead to the kennel, followed by his haunting wall-stare ), truly make it seem like this is the actual Dog-thing. Characterization is not as thorough and in depth as for example Alien (1979), but none of the characters are forgettable and each acts according to their personalities. Most of the characters are shown to be resourceful and intelligent, since they quickly figure out the Thing's intentions and origin, as opposed to the usual stereotypical horror dumb characters. There might not be much interesting in terms of the narrative itself, but The Thing's strength comes from the way that the situations themselves are filmed, and director John Carpenter purposely left a lot of key events off-screen, to feed the eager anticipation of the audience even more, and leaves us wondering, just like the characters, who to trust.With very little over the top exposition and a superb flow of visual storytelling ( Like the scene in which 'twoface' revives and assimilates someone, which is shown with a slight movement beforehand while blood starts dripping down, as opposed to ham fisted dialogue ), The Thing is indeed an intellectual piece of horror filmmaking, and Carpenter was ofcourse one of the best in the business at this regard. There is a lot of purposeful ambiguity ( Especially in the much discussed final scene ) which only enhances the paranoid and unknowing feel the audience receives.The Thing is one of the most frightening films ever created, and does this through superb direction and tension building, extremely disturbing and terrifying practical effects, but above all, the creation of paranoia and inner fear and mistrust. When you analyze the situation our characters are in, there are very little films that have a more terrifying premise, since this alien organism is disguising itself as a normal human being, and could be anybody next to you at any time. Thus it is definitely one of the greatest horror flicks ever created.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Pure horror,"Horror, like hot sauce, is a kind of self-indulgence. It's considered part of the sport to try to push the envelope, be it a seared mouth or a heart attack. I think John Carpenter has designed a movie for the audience who says, ""C'mon scare us to death.""Every element of this movie is exquisitely crafted -- from the soundtrack to the cutting and pacing to the uncompromising, unrelenting savagery -- all packaged in sharp, handsome photography and skilled acting. The buildup is a crescendo of violence and gore.But what's the point of all these fine production values? A message? Existential dread? Survival? Compare this one to Alien. Both climax with the hero calling out the great terror. Like cowboys. You know, the outlaws move into town and kill everybody until they meet the lone hero in the final showdown. Here, the story is just a vehicle for the real purpose of this film: pure horror.Almost 30 years later, and John Carpenter's The Thing is still the scariest movie I've ever seen.

"Good horror, but flawed. Others may have appreciated the film more, but those are not me. Recommended to fans of thriller, horror and gore movies","It all seemed like a normal summer in the Antarctic Mountains, when all of a sudden; a strange man appears in a helicopter, trying to shoot down a dog with a machine gun. The scientists spending their time at the houses in the Antarctic shoot the offender. But, why was he shooting at the dog? Well, apparently some creature was unearthed from the ice (or something like that) and came to terrorize the humans. This is no ordinary creature though. It can change its shape into the victims that it has killed. (Does that make sense?) If it kills somebody, it can look like them, and possibly speak like them! It sounds pretty similar to the villain in Terminator 2: Judgment Day! Well, if you have heard of the monster, than it becomes way too obvious about why the man was shooting at the dog.But, don't worry. To counter the predictability of the first scene, ""John Carpenter's The Thing"" brings many moments that are, well not as predictable. These are the good moments. These are also the moments when the audience suspects that one of the people was infected by the creature, and therefore, the audience is subjected to guessing who it is.While the film is fairly un-predictable, these moments have their flaws. The audience is left guessing whether the person is Childs, Blaire, Clark or somebody else. This would be nice if we actually knew who they were! The characters hardly stand out from one another, and there are just way too many of them! How is the audience supposed to follow? This leads to confusion, which also makes the film less enjoyable to me. Plus, every moment of thrill is way too short for my enjoyment. This adds to the displeasure as confusion and boredom invade my enjoyment.But, the moments of thrill, while short, are fun. No, they're not so thrilling that you hold you're breath and refuse to stop watching, but they are pretty fun. After all, it is directed by John Carpenter, who made Halloween and The Fog. If you are a hardcore fan of thriller and horror films, or a hardcore fan of gore films, you should probably pick this one up.7/10Good: Thrilling movie, with nice twists here and there.Bad: Confusion, boredom, short thrills and way too many characters",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Thing of Nightmares,"You know what I appreciate most about this film? The title. There are hundreds, if not thousands of movies out there about foreign creatures and a lot of them have the name of said creature in the title: Gremlins, Ghoulies, Critters, Alien, Leprechauns, Pumpkinhead, etc. This movie kept it--as they say--100 (or as we said when I was young, ""real""). They didn't know what it was and I know that when I don't know what something is, it's a ""thing"".The movie was as good as the title. This was a quality production for 1982 and one harrowing situation. Imagine being stuck in Antarctica, nothing but ice and polar bears around for hundreds of miles, incommunicado with the rest of civilization, a deadly storm brewing, and a creature in your midst that consumes its host and assumes its identity. I, for one, would be scared to death. If it weren't for everyone else having the same fears I'd have thought that cabin fever had set in and was causing me to be paranoid.""The Thing"" played out exactly how it should have.

Great special effects but...,"I've wanted to see this movie for years, after hearing good things about it and seeing clips online of the awesome special effects. And the special effects are great, of course. But I was otherwise disappointed in this film. I was continually taken out of the movie by the sheer stupidity of the characters. None of the characters feel fleshed out or real, more like the chess pieces on a screen Kurt was playing with at the beginning of the movie, bouncing mindlessly place to place until they're all taken out. In fact, that chess scene is a pretty good summation for the movie: Kurt Russell makes countless stupid mistakes with a cocky, condescending grin, and when he realizes how badly he's messed up, he destroys everything.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The plot concerns an American team stationed in Antarctica that suddenly find an alien creature that imitates other life among their midst. One by one this alien entity starts devouring the team. Kurt Russell is in sublime form as Macready the station helicopter pilot and the only one with balls and a rational outlook.

I had forgotten how brilliant this movie actually is.,"It had been quite some years since I had last seen this movie and the earlier brilliant and fresh movie version ""The Thing from Another World"" from 1951 was more fresh on my mind. I think I can say that ""The Thing"" is actually even a better movie. It's a great horror with a touch of science-fiction.To put it boldly, this movie is like ""Alien"", only set at the Antarctic. It has the same sort of atmosphere, build up, look and of course a killer alien on the loose. However this is not an ""Alien"" clone. The movie is just too good for that to call it one.I think I can say that this is one of the most paranoid movies ever made. It's actually quite easy to make a good and effective horror movie once you know to create a certain level of paranoia into the movie. In this movie you just never known who the alien is, which makes you very uncertain of things and makes you literally trust no one or his motivations throughout the movie. With this given element the movie knows to build up a great tension and atmosphere for the movie. It's horror elements mostly gets feed from these elements and it's what makes ""The Thing"" such a superior and classic movie within its genre.You really have to give John Carpenter credit for this movie. He has done lots of classic horror movies throughout his career but this one perhaps is his most brilliant one. He builds up the movie extremely well and very effectively. What also helps with this are Ennio Morricone's moody musical score (while normally Carpenter composes the music himself for all of his movies) and the camera-work from later Oscar-nominee Dean Cundey. Why doesn't he do horror movies anymore? Now days he mostly makes bright looking, happy movies, while in the past he did the camera-work for some fine and classic horror flicks, including ""The Fog"" and ""Halloween"", which also got directed by John Carpenter.It's also a quite gory movie to watch. The still at the time very young Rob Bottin did a very good job with all of its make-up effects. Some truly gory and unexpected things are happening throughout this movie, so know what to expect.It also knows to remain a realistic movie throughout, even though it of course doesn't feature a very likely main plot. It's because of its directing handling, acting and its writing that the movie works out that way.The movie doesn't feature many characters and also no big names playing them, except for Kurt Russell of course. This also keeps the movie realistic and keeps all characters on the same level. It helps for the atmosphere of the movie, since you also don't know who is going to die next and where and how. It increases also the overall paranoid feeling of the movie.A brilliant classic atmospheric genre-piece!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest horror / sci-fi films ever made!,"John Carpenter out did himself with this film, and I really don't think that he will ever be able to top this scary little film from 1982.

"A landmark achievement in practical effects, but doesn't rely on its viscera to replace its suspenseful underlying narrative.","This suspenseful picture horror is a landmark achievement in practical effects and most of its gooey, grisly and generally gruesome creations still stand up today, finding a perfect mix between straight-up gore and the uncannily surreal. Its precisely because these disturbing images are not used as crutches for the taut, tense and ominous narrative that 'The Thing (1982)' holds up to scrutiny and remains such a foreboding and thrilling watch all these years later. The flick keeps you on your toes because its underlying premise means that anyone could be the eponymous 'Thing' from another world. Carpenter wisely never reveals exactly who the creature is until its too late. It really is a piece with brains as well as brawn, one that doesn't mind taking its time and earning its eventual shocks. Its brilliantly ambiguous but low-key ending deserves to be as debated as it is. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Thing is a complex creature this thing...,"John Carpenter's The Thing I found very slow to start off with in the beginning and it takes its time in getting to the point of the film. It was lucky it finally got interesting at the half way hour mark because I was starting to wonder exactly what all these guys were doing in the Antarctic.The Thing is a horror movie that relies on sudden shocks and visual effects that take a shape shifter into some bloody but sometimes amusing territories. The title is correct as you don't really know what this Thing is - at first it looks like some really warped spider then the next thing its something else.The characters in this film - to be honest I really couldn't care less about any of them and who died because that is the whole point of the film - to get down to the 'who dunnit' or in this case 'who is it' mystery. And it sometimes gets confusing because you never know who could be it - and it doesn't really explain itself well enough to give you enough clues and hence comes off randomly sometimes.But I will say that it is a fun sort of plot and this 'Thing' is given quite a casual treatment in its entrance. It isn't dramatic but it is a shocker - those poor dogs in particular - and hence builds up suspense quite well and you never know what is going to come around the next corner.It's not really Halloween, but it sure has a thing about it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The special effects really are very good, they're convincing, creepy and all kinds of disgusting. Not only are the special effects great, but the storyline itself is pretty entertaining and suspenseful. Although of course the characters never learn their lessons and always underestimate the thing by splitting up, doing things by themselves etc. Other than that The Thing is quite a good eighties horror film.

Blah.,"An ultimately bland, dull, and pointless exercise. As slow moving as 'The Big Chill,' John Carpenter's version of Campbell's classic 'Who Goes There?' is more faithful to the monster but ultimately as thrilling as a term paper.While the Howard Hawks film re-wrote the monster into a simple marauding, though intelligent being, at least that film built a sense of menace and a hurtling momentum to its story. Carpenter's version is slow, talky, dull, and punctuated only by over-the-top silliness that shows his puerile obsession with gore-puppets. The 'paranoia' of people who may not be who they seem plays much better in 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' or 'Planet of the Vampires,' or even in Campbell's own story. This version is simply so slow, the characters so stilted, the story so jumpy and plodding that the final act of the film is a relief, not an experience.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Paranoia in Antarctica,"""Paranoia, paranoia, everybody's coming to get me!""

After his 1978 movie ""Halloween"" where horror pictures proved that evil will never die, Carpenter takes evil to a whole new game.Set in the Antarctica region where like ""Alien,"" nobody would hear anybody scream, a group of researchers doing God-knows-what happen to stumble upon a Norwegian rifleman shooting at a dog where after the gunman is shot down, questions are being asked by the group including the no nonsense pilot R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell) in which they see more what they bargain for.During the film after an attack scene involving an alien dog, the investigation group fears that something has hit them and will never get out. Paranoia leads to fear, fear leads to questioning and those seeking questions will finally have their answers.John Carpenter's The Thing is a ""don't turn off the lights"" movie where even during it's time despite the fact that E.T. hogged all the credits, it proves to be a classic thriller from icky special effects to make you either scream or shield your mouth to scenes that you'll remember in your nightmares.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Nice and estimable horror/thriller competently directed by John Carpenter who provides a punchy suspenseful Sci-Fi .,"The Thing (1982) deals with a lonely group (Kurt Russell , Charles Hallahan , Donald Moffat , Wilford Brimley , Richard Dysart , Richard Masur, T. K. Carter, David Clennon) of scientists who discover bizarre events , as the research bunch are menaced by a shape-changing . Antarctica: an extraordinary continent of awesome beauty . It is also home to an isolated outpost where a discovery full of scientific possibility becomes a mission of survival when an alien from outer space is unearthed by a crew of international scientists. The shape-shifting creature, accidentally unleashed at this marooned colony, has the ability to turn itself into a perfect replica of any living being . It can look just like you or me, but inside, it remains inhuman. In this thriller The Thing , paranoia spreads like an epidemic among a group of researchers as they're infected, one by one, by a mystery from another planet. But it is about to wake up. When an alien frees from its frozen prison , the protagonist (Kurt Russell) must avoid it from killing them off one by one at a time . And in this vast , intense land, a parasite that can mimic anything it touches will pit human against human as it tries to survive and flourish.One of the great Sci-Fi classics , the gradual built-up suspense is quite superb as when the monster is shown largely to create a real menace¨. Monster movie in which an alien menaces an isolated scientific community , that looks and feels just like a stunning remake . This exciting film packs chills , thrills , guessing , paranoia , absence of all characterisation , spectacular FX , including a loathing chest-burning scene . It takes a liberal stand in exposing the tension of men when confronted with a weird being .

It contains thrilling and intriguing musical score by the great maestro Ennio Morricone .

"Ahead of time, probably from outer space","Stumbled on it exactly on Kurt Russel's birthday and thinking about all the references and praising talks my finger clicked on the play button. From the mere beginning with a glimpse at the intro I knew that I am in for a treat, but I didn't even know how delicious it might get.Following the plot germination, I was confused and thought that it is a complete mess: puzzled would have been the mildest word applicable. Then in a few steps my brain started working to uncover a chain of reasons that created a vision of something much more horrible than would even appear on the screen. This throttled the tension and the movie shifted the gears higher.It is without a doubt hard to go past the plot, but the phenomenal thing is the actual Thing! Oh boy, if you tell me that 1982 couldn't give the thrilling visual effects I might agree but as for the practical side it kicks even modern films right in the jam with a superb jab. The detailed atrocity gives you the disgust and earns John Carpenter the highest respect even thought of.The actors slide into a frame like Cinderella's foot into the shoe sharing the exact emotions you would have facing the situation that has a potential to break even a potent human brain. The iconic clothing and style sticks to the imagery and adds that sense of outlandish realism the boosts the sensation.Getting myself together after the end I could with utmost certainty say that 'The Thing' is an ultimate tribute to the horror movie industry and should be studied as an example of supreme dedication to achieve the ideal scare.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The 1951 Original Vs The 1982 Remake,"I feel it is appropriate to use John W. Campbell Jr.'s 1938 novella, ""Who Goes There?"", as a baseline by which to compare the two films that strived to bring it to the screen; that is, ""The Thing(From Another World)"" released in 1951, and ""The Thing"" released in 1982.  Keep in mind that I consider Campbell's tale one of the best sci-fi horror stories ever written, and that it would be quite a feat to successfully adapt it to cinema. The 1951 film, directed by Christain Nyby, deviated so much from the story that it is difficult to draw many parallels between the two.  In the story, the alien is a 4 ft tall being with three red eyes, rubbery,blue,wormlike hair and multiple razor- sharp tentacles.  This alien ""chameleon"" is so intelligent that its species figured out long ago how to imitate any living creature through DNA duplication and replication.  This uncanny, insidious imitation extended to the personality and mind of it's victims.  The end of the story further highlights its superior intellect by featuring a strap-on anti-gravity device powered by a small atomic generator that it had built within the mere span of one week by scrounging spare parts at the compound - coiled wires, radio tubes, coffee-tins, glass, magnets, leather and cloth belts, etc.  The alien was killed before it could make it's escape and eventually imitate the living composition of the entire planet! In the 1951 film version, the alien is portrayed as an 8 ft tall hairless Frankenstein-like humanoid, with flesh of a vegetable- like quality which needed blood to reproduce itself through seedpods.  The film is standard horrorfare, with the expedition crew uniting together to fight and destroy the alien menace, which they eventually did, via electrocution.  The alien is not characterized as particularly intelligent, rather as a rampaging, blood-thirsty monster; making it hard to imagine such a brute was advanced enough to participate in interstellar travel.  So while, ""The Thing(From Another World) featured excellent direction, acting, dialogue, score and so forth under the watchful eye of producer/shadow director, Howard Hawks, I feel he took artistic license and deviated too much from Campbell's story. There was suspense and terror to be sure, but it lacked the pervasive paranoia that Campbell conveyed so well in ""Who Goes There?"" In sharp contrast, director John Carpenter's 1982 version, ""The Thing"", both brilliantly captures the alien's insidious chameleon-like powers (through Rob Bottin's effects) and the paranoia it induced amongst the expedition's crew.  Instead of bonding together as a cohesive unit as in the 1951 film, to fight a readily discernable foe, they fragmented in the face of a remarkably cunning enemy capable of imitating any one of them; they become deeply suspicious and paranoid of one another as any of them could be the alien in disguise, and they literally ask, ""is it really you, WHO GOES THERE?""; echoing the name of the novella's title.  This situation runs counter to classic character development, as how could anyone be stable and well-defined with their core-identity as such risk? Who's who? who's the good guy? bad guy?  Perhaps a little unsettling to viewers and critics.  I think this film has received a  battering from movie critics because they were weaned on relishing a steady, inexorable buildup of suspense and an inevitable resolution.  However, in ""The Thing"", this suspense is permeated with a claustrophobic paranoia and sullen dread, generating an atmospheric ambiguity - something the critics weren't comfortable with, hence, rejected. Combine this ambiguity with the critic's aversion to the graphic special effects, wholly appropriate to the storyline, but misinterpreted by them as ""gratuitous violence and gore"", then one understands why ""The Thing"" got butchered in the reviews. Here, as in the Campbell story, MacReady is the acknowledged hero, even before he tested himself as human, for we instinctively knew he would be.  However, in the story, MacReady, with the aid of several genuinely human crewmembers, kills the alien and in doing so, literally saves the planet. Whereas, in the 1982 film, MacReady, valiant as he is, just isn't powerful enough to stop the alien. Thus, the open-ended ending; the lack of closure being a disappointment to me; I immediately thought ""sequel"", but have yet to see one.  Also, keep in mind that in the story, the alien starts and ends with his original form, whereas in the 1982 film, the alien never has a definitive original form, being relatively amorphous throughout. In the final analysis, I like both of these films, in spite of their shortcomings; namely, the 1951 film's failure to adhere closely to the story, thereby failing to capture the essence of the imitative alien and paranoid atmosphere it generated; and the 1982 film's failure to remain faithful to the story's optimistic ending. Actually, both films stand up fairly well when referenced to Campbell's chilling tale, and even better when viewed as stand-alones. One thing is for sure, both films have earned a secure place in my video collection.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
John Carpenter the thing,"This is John Carpenter's best syfy horror movie of all his horror movies. The thing by John Carpenter has the scariest moments that I relish.

The Thing attacks with its gory visuals,"I must say that after seeing the three brilliant and scary interpretations of John W. Campbell's story 'Who Goes There?' – 'The Thing from Another World', 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and 'Alien' - I sat on my couch to watch 'The Thing' with a bit of skepticism. However, as I knew that John Carpenter is a cult director in the horror sphere, I was definitely ready for a good scare, filled with a decent level of blood and gore, and maybe not too much of a genuine story.The first thing that the viewer sees is a spaceship traveling in the galaxy near Earth. Fast- forward a few hundred years: Antarctica, exactly in the middle of nowhere. In the enormous amount of pure-white snow, we observe a helicopter coming in the distance, trying to shoot a dog. But why do they want to catch an innocent creature so badly? That we actually won't find out (yet), as the dog runs towards an American station, and after a chaotic couple of minutes and a few gunshots (and dead Norwegians), it is finally safe in the arms of confused Americans.This is the moment when all the fun starts. It's like a game of cat and mice between the 'thing' (no one knows what it truly is, as it is able to morph and take shape of any organism that is nearby) and all the researches. This insatiable creature is able to thaw out at any moment, killing a person, absorbing him and then imitating in the most perfect manner. Nobody can be trusted anymore. The people become overly suspicious and paranoid. And up until the very last moments there aren't any special ways of finding out who is human and who isn't.Unfortunately, the main drawbacks of the movie are the superficial characterization and highly unreal behavior of all the frightened men. Even though they realize that they are in grave danger, they sometimes act as if their main purpose of being inside the base was to actually get attacked from behind and murdered. What's more, at times it's even hard to grasp how many people are actually dead and it somehow takes some of the fun away. Carpenter didn't put a huge emphasis on the portrayal of his characters; he much rather wanted to astound us with the very realistic special and visual effects, which are actually quite scary and gruesome.I mean, even though there are some terrifying scenes of gore and pure repulsion, they probably won't be too expressive for regular viewers (or will they?), and exciting enough to stimulate the blood lust of all the hardcore horror fans. Great music score by Ennio Morricone only increases the mood and the overwhelming suspense of the story.However, even though it has some minor flaws, it still is a great and thrilling picture, and it stand out from the huge crowd of many dull and muddling horrors that came out in the 1980's. Dare to watch The Thing, and it will certainly satisfy all your bloodiest desires.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Carpenter's best film. One of the best films of the 80s. In a word: amazing.,"John Carpenter is a master of the medium of film, and specifically the widescreen format.  This is quite apparent in his 1982 remake of The Thing...  He bypasses the Howard Hawks original, taking only the name, and bases his film on the short novel that Hawks' film is based on: Who Goes There? by J. Campbell.Carpenter's visual composition, editing, pacing, and characterization are nothing short of flawless.  He handles themes of identity, isolation, and trust without becoming overtly preachy.In short, the film is beautiful. It is now available in widescreen on VHS and DVD so I suggest you only watch that.  It deserves to be seen in all its claustrophobic glory.(NOTE: If you're a fan of special effects, this film should be number one on your ""must watch"" list.

Nice Sci-Fi Horror Movie,"This was a very interesting movie.  The movie had a lot of great moments and also it got really enthralling.  The thing was really well done (for the time that they actually filmed this) and pretty disgusting if you ask me, but I guess that was the look that the directors wanted, something that could be almost unbearable to see.  The monsters seem to come out of some other movies like Alien but it wasn't the same thing.  The only thing that the movie could have done better was the performance of Russell, I don't think he is a bad actor, I just thought that the character that he portrait did have a resemblance to the character that he played on Escape From New York and L.A.' and so on, but that was the only fault that I found.

Undeniable ends,"The Thing is certainly a creature to fear. Its transformation capabilities yield it one of the strangest yet most powerful weapons introduced to the horror genre.

From its awesome opening sequence to the ominous ending, ""The Thing"" is an atmospheric and cold journey through a siege against the unknown, masculinity in crisis, distrust, and, to this day, the most amazing practical effects galore.John Carpenter's initially underappreciated horror gem is perhaps not exactly flawless, but it is, in my opinion, one of the very best exercises in the horror genre of the 20th century. Taking place in a remote research outpost in Antarctica, ""The Thing"" executes a kind of a haunted-house atmosphere and finds the horror in the tension between the all-male inhabitants. The Thing is found (well, the Thing finds them) and an icy bucket of fear, stress, paranoia and distrust is thrown onto the characters. On one hand, the characters are not very deep or multi-dimensional, Kurt Russell's MacReady has as much character as Clint Eastwood in most of his westerns, who is merely a clever and brave hero figure with good morale; on the other hand, during my every watch of ""The Thing"", it has never mattered much. As far as I'm concerned, there's no space for more. Although ""The Thing"" is most likely best known for its special effects, I think that the horror and atmosphere exist there independently, a work of a great director at his prime. The special effects are the tastiest cherry on the cake ever - gory, gooey, macabre, highly creatively and professionally made, the kind to remember and get impressed at every next visit. On top of everything, the cast seems to be enjoying their every minute & Ennio Morricone delivers the least Morricone original score ever, and makes it as disturbing as the film demands..
Whenever the topics of wintery, gory, sci-fi or 80's horror movies get brought up, or the theme of best horror movies ever for that matter, ""The Thing"" is one of the first movies popping up in my head. Thank god for John Carpenter. If you somehow haven't seen it yet, December is the time. My rating: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Simultaneously scary and fun thriller manages to send shivers down your spine.,"A thoroughly enjoyable horror masterpiece conceived by the one and only John Carpenter (HALLOWEEN, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK). THE THING is a great horror movie with plenty of spine tingling chills, and much genuine suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. State-of-the-art special effects and make FX provided by Rob Bottin (ROBOCOP, TOTAL RECALL) help propel THE THING above the usual films of the science-fiction/horror genre.""The Thing"" has been discovered by a dozen explorers at the Arctic. They've made a startling unveiling of a mysterious life-form...but little do they realize the destructive capabilities of this creature. This alien creature is so malevolent that as it mutates, it assimilates the form of its nearest, most unlucky victim. Later, the creature masquerades itself as whatever the life-form it has consumed and deformed. The leader of this expedition, Kurt Russell (STARGATE, SOLDIER), must deploy the explorers into employing ways to stop this alien mutant before it's evil spreads into worldwide, global proportions.  However, as the toll rises, any one of Russell's colleagues...may in fact, be part of the demon already...THE THING is an engrossing horror film with some of the most grotesque special effects seen on the screen. The literally eye-popping effects include melting faces, cremations, walking heads, deformity, heads bursting out of stomachs, and other sequences too gruesome to print in words alone. THE THING though, has been sadly criticized by film connoisseurs as merely exercise of disgusting special effects.  In my sincere and humble opinion, THE THING is a film with more substance than what most movie critics have said.This film is a parable.  The expedition must learn to trust one another and stick together in order to essentially survive. Another interesting aspect about THE THING is that this movie shows what would happen if fear and isolation conquer a whole group.  The consequences are devastating, people end up fighting each other and debating violently, instead of trying to work together to alleviate the problem.  This film conveys a lesson saying that trusting one another and teamwork are the two main components for survival against the odds.  Without those two traits, then everything else, even technology itself...is meaningless...THE THING is a great movie to watch in the dark during midnight. You will be guaranteed to jump out of your seat at least a few times.  THE THING delivers its fair shares of shocks and jolts.Although the story-line in this film is not very efficient, it doesn't distract from the tension and suspense of this movie. If you enjoy truly frightening horror films with AWESOME special effects, then THE THING is a highly recommended movie perfect for you.WARNING: If you have a modicum of squeamishness inside you, then steer clear of THE THING.  Otherwise, get ready for an exciting and suspenseful presentation.  Plenty of effort integrated into this film, thanks to the direction of John Carpenter, and the believable performances of the main characters including Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart, and the rest of the cast.RATING: **1/2 out of ****.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good Compared to 1980,"At the beginning of the movie, it was a fiasco that he wrote in Antarctica and 10 minutes later, Norway was mentioned. It would be correct if Greenland was written instead of Antarctica.The movie was shot very well compared to the years it was shot. Whether it is image quality or effects, it is very good compared to 1980s. But the movie didn't sound too scary to me. I wish it had a bit more mystery and fear weight.The actors especially deserved the role of Kurt Russel. While watching the movie, the audience is also paranoid, unable to understand who is the Thing inside.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Good movie,"«The Thing», undoubtedly, is not a boring film. Actors coped with their roles brilliantly and transited a heroes' hysteria that keeps the audience in suspense throughout the film. Right to the end you try to guess who became «The Thing» and who have saved the human qualities. Besides, stunning special effects create a sense that the monsters will come out of the screen. I sure, the main idea of the film is about how simply people can leave their friends for saving their own skin. But there is a thing that disappointed me: lack of a good soundtrack. I need something more then only couple of two terrifying melodies which we can hear in almost every horror film. All in all, film «The Thing» is not bad – in my opinion, it will be interesting for those who prefer to pull the nerves.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Wilford Brimley with a gun,"Wilford Brimley seems to be of a dying breed in movies. Gruff old dudes who seem to eat drywall nails for brunch only sleep for half an hour a day cause it cuts in to their drinking time. Lee Marvin may be dead, Clint Eastwood may be playing nice guys with hearts made of pure gold, but there's still this early 80's gem and Wilford Brimley long before he was hawking life insurance off the back of a horse.The movie serves as an exercise in paranoia and if you can figure out who's who in the movie than you are truly more sober than i. There's a pretty good amount of violence and the special effects are way better and more invented than the cheap and easy CGI that any half-assed movie contains nowadays. It may be nostalgia to say that the movies have loss the quirky inventiveness needed to think up solutions to all sorts of special effects problems, but there it is.John Carpenter does a good job of pacing the story and action just right and Keith David as always adds a great supporting roll.give 7 out of 10 raise it to 8 if you've got some alcohol",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A near flawless film...,A near flawless film on all technical levels as well as story and acting.It is sad to see that this was one of the film's that caused John Carpenter to become disillusioned with art of film making due to it's reception.But I am also glad to see that this is one such work of Art that will undoubtedly stand the test of time considering the Legendary status this film holds for Horror and Movie fans alike.I believe I am very fortunate that The Thing was my first of Carpenters work and Cosmic Horror a double dose of delight for my first foray.To say that this film had such an amazing impact on my life in turns of writing and my literary interests and to say that this film grabbed me from the opening of the movie till the end of the movie and did not let go throughout its run time are both understatements.Never in my life have I experienced something like it during a Movie watch.Endlessly rewatchable even if the mystery is revealed at the end of your first see through.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

How on earth could it have been improved upon?,"It couldn't.From the cutting dialogue to the super special effects this film was a joy to behold throughout. The immediate feel for the bitterness of the antarctic, the affinity for the characters that is built up at the base level before the real action heats up and the cunning finale combine to make this one of the most memorable and enjoyable films around.Up against a long list of films that have attempted to exploit the theme of visitors from another planet, The Thing comes out on top and laughing. Who can forget the perfectly timed dialogue and the chilling special effects? Special effects that are a lot more impressive than the computer generated images that we get to see today. I for one found some of the most enjoyable aspects of the film to be the way that we were introduced slowly to each member of the crew, and the way that they all had some distinctive character traits. This wasn't just a senseless bloodbath-come-slasher-horror flick. This film had feeling. Emotion.I truly can't recommend this film highly enough. I have yet to see anything in it's class that comes anywhere near to matching, let alone bettering, the near perfect acting and timing utilised in this cunning polymesmeric feat of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

John Carpenter classic that you can't go wrong with,"A John Carpenter classic that you can't really go wrong with. It is honestly hard to really find anything wrong with this one. Even Kurt Russell's silly prospector hat just fits right in with all the other elements that make this movie a classic which I rewatch every year. It has aged incredibly well probably due to the fact that it relies mainly on the setting and environment for a lot of it's atmospheric suspense. We essentially are given a ""anyone could be the killer"" combined with ""alien monsters are taking over the planet"" story which are perfectly fit for each other.

Another Awesome Carpenter Cult Horror With Amazing FX,"Great gory horror fun.I love this film, the whole creepy atmosphere & dark cinematography by the legend Dean Cundy is superb & the awesome music by Carpenter is excellent & of course the AMAZING practical FX & the awesome casting.........except it's missing the perfect guy for this film the legendary Horror icon TOM ATKINS!!! It makes No sense as to why he's not cast? I mean he was good friends with John Carpenter at the time he had just starred in carpenters The Fog (1980) & Escape from New York (1981) & Tom said in an interview that he had discussed how much he loved the 50's original film & so did carpenter, so they talked about the movie & John must've known how excited Tom would have been to be apart of it & yet he cast every other guy but him? Makes No sense & Tom Atkins would have lifted the movie even more in quality, he would have been the best in it!!! Anyway that was a huge missed opportunity.The cast is an ensemble cast of know the face actors & Carpenter regulars, i love the paranoid mood of the movie & the thick Atmosphere of dread that hangs over the film, this is one of Carpenters best films!!!I used to watch this on video & absolutely loved everything about it & i still do!!! ""The Thing"" yes it's a classic gory horror film & many class this as Carpenters masterpiece, my personal fave carpenter movie is ""THE FOG (1980)"" but i can see why many love this great movie, it's in my top 5 of Carpenters films & in my all time favourite top 20 films list.The always great Kurt Russell (a childhood hero of mine) gives an iconic performance & has created another Classic character as he did in other John Carpenter films such as ""Escape from New York"" & ""Big Trouble in little China"" as we know Carpenter & kurt work perfectly together.Kurt Russell is awesome,cool & iconic as ""Mcready"" & the location is isolated & scary & like i said the fx are amazing so much better than the silly cheap looking c.g.i today!!!I love John Carpenter films & i consider him my favourite Director.Check out the equally excellent ""The Thing"" 2011 prequel, it's just as great & surprisingly still very atmospheric & exciting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Unfortunately, Sci-Fi doesn't get much better than this","Ironically, what makes John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" such an entertaining sci-fi film are its genre-defying elements of mystery, suspense, and tight plot structure.  It puts to shame such films as ""Aliens"" or ""Armageddon"" that are content to inundate the viewer with special effects while their plots revolve around stunts that butcher the laws of physics, testosterone-laden one-liners, heroes equipped with enough artillery to conquer Iraq, and pathetic attempts to inject ""meaning"" into the barrage on screen with ""emotional sequences"" that only serve to further insult the intelligence of the audience.   The supreme tragedy, of course, is that these kind of lobotomized movies are also the most popular.  I think that there is a cause for this, although it isn't very comforting.   There is an increasing trend in our culture to passively ""surrender"" to the media -- to immerse oneself in the images we see without dedicating a single brain cell to comprehending the statement the work is trying to make.  This mindset is becoming increasingly dominant in all arenas; even the once-hallowed print medium is being diluted, thanks to the abominable ""reader response"" theory that pervades our schools and the ""tabloid brigade"" that lines our magazine racks whose mentality appears to be infiltrating the once-venerable mainstream press.  Nowadays, we just flip the switch and put our minds on ""pause.""  Is ""The Thing"" a ""good"" movie?  For the rare individual who still values his faculty of reason, a more appropriate term would be ""entertaining.""  Its plot keeps one guessing, its ending is uncompromising, and it has some redeeming statements to make about human paranoia.  Upon subsequent viewings, one begins to note a conspicuous lack of depth in the acting, but the taut storyline remains compelling. Of course, ""Citizen Kane"" it's not, but then again sci-fi never was a thinking-man's genre...",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

I watched this movie once when I was a kid, and it didn't give me chills or any kind of horror vibe, it was just boring... so I watched it again in 2023, and now I am pretty sure it was a waste of my time.

The story which is indeed a re-make in some regards, is by Bill Lancaster, and is extraordinarily well done. It's a familiar sci-fi/horror plot premise, but never done as well it is here, or since. It keeps you guessing right up until the end, and I don't exaggerate.The effects by Albert Whitlock and Rob Batitin are extremely bad ass, all before the times it got so easy with CGI. It's grotesque and beautiful all at once, being one of the high-points in effects history. The stop motion animation is one of the best of its kind, and continues to terrify. And to top it all off the legendary composer Ennio Morricone does the score.

"I LOVE This Film, one of the 25 Best Films of all Time!","I cannot believe I never added my two cents about this film as yet!This is one of the best films of all time. Many critics and movie-goers alike talk of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" for setting trends and being ""his best work"". Those folks have not seen this version of ""The Thing"" because it is right up there with ""Halloween"".John Carpenter's work shines in this film. He took a film that was already made and instead of ""re-making"" the film, he made the book the first film was based on! Brilliant.The casting of each man was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, made me scared, made me guess, made me laugh, made me question, even up to today ""who goes there?"" in that film. This film had no Hollywood sweetie pie or funny-type ending, and what a bold move not to have one in 1982. Another brilliant move.I was at the screening for this film when I was on vacation in Southern California. The audience at the screening went wild! I carry those memories for years, it was so much fun! We all thought that there was no way on God's green earth this film was not going to be a hit. But by box office receipts, it was a dud because of ""ET, The Extra Terrestrial"" and ""Poltergeist"" two very good family oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came out.This film was what I, as a horror film adult buff was looking for, a horror/thriller with an adult script, and real adult actors. Not kids playing adults. Not little Miss ""big-breasted"" scream-queen of the day running around screaming for titilation BUT real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear. Heck, being a feminist, I didn't even MISS women in this film! And good for Mr. Carpenter by not putting one in there, it really wouldn't have made sense! (Unless, ""The Thing"" was actually feminine! Something to think about!)I saw special effects of that time I had never seen before, I saw makeup that made me sit up a few nights. This is what horror/thrillers of today are missing. Today, the Directors wimp out. Today, the Studios wimp out. Too much CGI and not enough belief, too much CGI and not enough story, not enough imagination. You leave the theater and in a week -- or less  -- you forget about the film and move onto the next grand film opening. This one stays with ya. That's one of the marks of an excellent film.On many reviews I've written how now paying $10 for a film is horrid. For films like this one, you'd pay it and not feel slighted. This film is NOT for everyone.I find it horrific that they lable this film a ""cult"" film. I find that the audience is broader than many would lead you to belive and although not a commercial success in 1982, this is an example of how releasing a darn good film on the wrong date can make a darn good film look bad. After John Carpenter's film, many people copied many techniques, make-up, special effects and story lines from this version of ""The Thing"".I am now excitd to go on record and state that this film is one of the best films of all time, very much under rated.

Not everything is confined inside the buildings all the time. Action steps outside a little which feels like danger is not as controlled and might actually get out of there.Another thing is that since the action happens on Earth, albeit on a very remote place, it seems like horror could have an immediate, quick and devastating effect on the entire population.

One of the great horror films,"This is one of the best horror film ever made and I am sad that by the time this was released, it receive almost negative reviews.

The direction of John Carpenter is great at this film. The cinematography of Dean Curry is also great. Performance by the actors (especially Kurt Russel), the practical effects, pacing, everything is just great.
According to FilmRadar, a YouTube Channel, there is a lot of ways that The Thing use to exploit the fears of the audience. The use of setting is one of those ways the film uses. The film is set in Antartica, a place that is so cold and very remote. The setting gives the characters a sense of isolation, the feeling of being unable to call for help.The setting also gives a sense of ""claustrophobia"". The feeling of being trapped in a confined place. Also one of the thing that this film uses is ""paranoia"". Since the organism can perfectly imitate the host after it fully assimilates it, the characters (and also us) don't know who to trust. Another thing that is uses is ""the fear of the unknown"". Since we don't fully understand on what even this organism is, we don't know what is will do or what it truly is. Another way is the use of ""phobias"". The creature can look like a dog (cynophobia), it can have spider legs (arachnophobia), it can have a serpent-like tail (ophiodiophobia), the creature even looks bloody (hemophobia), etc. It's this that why The Thing works in a lot of ways.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Where does that thing get the energy to morph like that? Where does it get the food to bulk up so quickly? How come it has so many ways of eating humans, and yet it never devours them completely, or maybe it doesn't need to because it insinuates itself into the body, but then why does it keep popping out like that? Why does it have both tentacles and arms in the end, and one misshapen head in the end, but then some kind of dog body coming out of it's middle? How would something like that have lived on its home planet?Anyway, the best scene in the movie is near the end, where three guys are tied up on a bench and one of them starts morphing, then the others start yelling and trying to get away. And the overall theme of paranoia and mistrust keeps it interesting enough to be viewed about once every 10 years. I give it 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
What an ending!,One of the best endings to a horror movie ever filmed.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Were not getting out of here alive, and neither is that ""Thing""","***SPOILERS*** As the film ""The Thing"" opens we see this sled dog trudging through the vast Antarctic wasteland of ice and snow being chased by a helicopter. Opening fire on the dog the Norwegian pilot, Larry J. Franco, seems to be terribly agitated at the dog escaping his rifle fire and then opens up a grenade canister and throws it at the fleeing canine.After what seems like forever the dog reaches the US scientific outpost #31 and as the men stationed there run out to see what's happening the pilot starts shooting and throwing grenades all over the place like a man gone insane. He's then shot and killed by Garry, Donald Moffat, after the crazed pilot earlier ended up accidentally blowing up his helicopter with a loose grenades.Finding a partly burned map of the outpost that the dead pilot came from Dr. Copper, Richard A. Dysart, together with US Army helicopter pilot MacReady, Kurt Russell, fly out to the place only to find it burnt-out with everyone there frozen or burned to death. By MacReady and Dr, Copper taking back one of the dead bodies to be examined they brought,together with the runaway dog that was already taken into in the US encampment,into play one of the most hideous monsters that was ever put into a motion picture. A monster that laid dormant for tens of thousands of years until the Norwegian Antarctic expedition dug it out of the ice and inadvertently released it. A horror that within three years could very will wipe out the entire human race by first replicating and then destroying it.Unlike the original 1951 movie ""The Thing from another World"" the John Carpanter directed films storyline follows very closely the famous 1938 Sci-Fi short story ""Who Goes There"" by John W. Campball that both films were based on. Surviving through the process of replicating itself in it's host body ""The Thing"", after wiping out the Norwegian outpost, turned itself into a sled dog and then ended up getting into the US base #31.At the base ""The Thing"" started to take over the bodies of first the sled dog and then the men stationed there by initially infecting them in order to enter their system. Then, like an unending row of domino's, ""The Thing"" goes from one person to another until ""It"" destroyed every living thing, human animal and plant, on earth.Looking something like a cross between a giant spider and octopus ""The Thing"", when it was in it's natural state, looked like a nightmare that came straight out of hell. But when it infected and took over someone on the base, and hid itself inside the persons body, it acted perfectly normal and human until the opportunity presented itself for ""It"" to strike again. It was only too late that the US military men and scientists at the base-camp began to realize that once ""The Thing"" got into their camp the only way that it could be stopped was for them to destroy everything living that it came in contact with, the entire base-camp with them along with it. Not making the same mistake that the Norwegians did by unknowingly allowing it enter their encampment and then later escape, after wiping them out, and continue it's murderous rampage on earth.With the fires that were started by him and his men, battling ""The Thing"", slowly burning themselves out MacReady and Childs,Keith David, the last two survivors of this inferno wait for the bitter minus 100 degree Antarctic winter to set in and thus put them out of there miseries. Shearing a bottle of R&B whiskey to numb their senses they both sit and wait for the end to come knowing that with their actions they put an end to ""The Thing"" and it's ability to use them to farther it's demonic goal in destroying all of mankind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"""The Thing"": A Masterpiece of Suspense, Tension, and Thematically Rich Sci-Fi Horror","""The Thing,"" directed by John Carpenter and released in 1986, is a sci-fi horror classic that deserves a strong 9/10 rating. This film tells the story of a group of scientists and researchers who are stationed at an Antarctic research facility, and who are forced to confront a terrifying and unpredictable creature that can mimic and assimilate other forms of life.One of the film's greatest strengths is its masterful use of suspense and tension. Carpenter builds an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty from the very first scene, creating a palpable sense of danger that only intensifies as the film progresses. The creature design is also top-notch, with the Thing's ability to take on the form of its victims lending a sense of unpredictability to the film's scares.Another standout aspect of the film is its ensemble cast. Kurt Russell gives a standout performance as the film's hero, R. J. MacReady, and the other actors, including Wilford Brimley, T. K. Carter, and Richard Dysart, all deliver solid performances that help to bring the film's world to life. The film's script, by Bill Lancaster, is also well-written, with sharp dialogue and memorable character moments that help to flesh out the film's world and its characters.The film's practical special effects, created by master effects artist Rob Bottin, are also noteworthy, lending a tangible sense of reality to the film's otherworldly creature. From the Thing's grotesque and inhuman transformations to the film's unforgettable, fiery finale, the effects work is a testament to Bottin's skill and to the art of practical effects.Perhaps most impressive, though, is the film's thematic depth. At its core, ""The Thing"" is a film about trust, paranoia, and the fear of the unknown. It speaks to the human tendency to mistrust one another, especially in times of stress and fear, and it grapples with the idea of what it means to truly know someone, even those closest to us. These themes are woven into the fabric of the film in a way that makes the film's horror all the more impactful, lending the film a depth that many horror films lack.In conclusion, ""The Thing"" is a classic of the sci-fi horror genre, a film that stands the test of time and continues to scare and captivate audiences nearly four decades after its release. From its masterful use of suspense and tension to its standout special effects and its rich thematic depth, ""The Thing"" is a film that truly deserves its place in the pantheon of great horror films. If you're a fan of horror, sci-fi, or just great filmmaking in general, ""The Thing"" is a must-see. I give it a strong 9/10 rating, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thrilling and thought-provoking horror experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Thrilling and Gory!,"It's a rare movie that can combine horror with psychological thriller. A good film accomplishes one of those things. A great movie does both.This is a great movie.As iconic as some of the scenes are for their shock and gore (the defibrillator paddle scene is one of the greatest in film history IMO) you forget how tense the drama builds as these men are isolated in Antarctica till spring convinced that one or more of them could be a thing. The blood test segment is the climax and it's just superb.Everyone involved in this film did tremendous work. From John Carpenter (who is one of the top directors of all time IMO) to the cast led by Kurt Russell and Keith David (what that voice!!!) in his major film debut.One last thing about The Thing - the special effects are amazing. In our day and age of CGI it's hard to wow an audience anymore (because visually, everything is possible now).

What's the hype?,"People rave about this film. These people all saw the film when it came out back in the 80's. I am 24 and I was bored all the way through. The premise was promising however it was pulled off slowly and was very underwhelming. The film is full of cliches and felt more like a cheesy action film. The 'serious' parts were cheesy and the 'scary' parts were funny. The effects can be excused as it is an older film, but I was not scared once in this film. Is it just because I am used to better effects in modern films? I don't think so, I really enjoy early 20th century horror films. Again not scary, but the story is gripping. I really struggled to finish this film. In my PERSONAL opinion, I would recommend avoiding this film, and really don't understand why it is so popular.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
convincing and marvellously horrible experience,"This is really quite splendid and it is evident watching it once more, this time on Blu-ray, that it will easily bear multiple viewings. What happens and the order that it happens in matters less than the whole believability of the situation and the grittiness. This may not look like the kind of crew you might expect to find at an American research station at the North Pole, but they are a likeable bunch. The dialogue is good, with the rapport and humour in abundance, despite or because of the pending doom. Then there are the special effects, different every time and mind boggling and the degree to which we buy into these transformations figures heavily when the guys partake in the blood testing. A fantastic and central sequence where we believe nobody knows whether they are possessed or not and feel their individual fear as the Russian roulette type ritual is undergone.

underwhelming,"The Thing has an interesting start as a man makes a determined effort to kill a dog. It's a disquieting scene, creating a sense of mystery. The movie continues its sense of disquiet for a while, letting you worry without quite knowing why.Unfortunately, after that the movie becomes focused on special effects and explosions. The characters are generic, the story is a little muddled, and some of the most effective scenes are also the least realistic.For me, the most interesting thing about the movie was how much Kurt Russel looked like someone from the band the Bee Gees. I always think of his as Snake Pliskin, but here, in spite of an authoritative role and bushy beard, his baby face and blow-dried hair make him look like a Hollywood actor pretending to be a tough guy. I wish they'd made him a little scragglier.To be fair. I didn't care much for the original movie from the 1950s either. So perhaps this is just not the story for me.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Landmark in Horror Cinema,"The film was overall quite impressive. However, while watching, I couldn't help but think about Alien (1979). There are noticeable similarities between the two, but The Thing manages to stand out with its unique theme and atmosphere. The concept of ""mimicking appearances"" is a groundbreaking idea that has left a lasting mark on cinema history. This theme is so impactful that it can even be seen in modern TV shows, movies, and animated series.One of the film's strongest elements is undoubtedly Kurt Russell's performance. As the lead, he delivers a fantastic portrayal, bringing depth and intensity to his character. Unfortunately, the supporting cast doesn't quite reach the same level, with some performances feeling lackluster at times. Despite this, the film's gripping atmosphere and tension remain intact.The visuals and special effects are, for their time, quite satisfactory. They are neither groundbreaking nor disappointing-they capture the essence of the early 1980s perfectly. The grotesque design of the creature and the use of practical effects heighten the film's tension and horror to an incredible degree.The atmosphere is relentless, never giving the audience a moment to relax. The sense of isolation within a remote research station is masterfully conveyed, and the paranoia that permeates every scene is palpable.Is The Thing a masterpiece? I'm not entirely sure, but it's undoubtedly a must-watch for fans of the horror genre. This film has cemented its place in cinematic history, and its influence is still felt today.

John Carpenter's Masterpiece,"John Carpenter is a genius. Halloween and The Thing are like my two favorite horror movies, and I prefer The Thing. This movie does what a lot of modern horror movies try to do, which is to have distinct characters and have us care for all of them. In The Thing, Carpenter (with the help of the screenwriter) has us get to know every single character, without it being redundant or boring. We know every character so when one doesn't make it, we know who it was. The practical effects are remarkable, and it is a creepy movie. It's creepier than most horror movies today. It is a highly underrated movie, and it did not get that much appraise during the time. Kurt Russel has a strong performance and Ennio Morricone's haunting score and theme really helps.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Suspence, claustrophobia and breathtaking effects in a film stigmatized the horror cinema and not only. 10/10","John Carpenter's remake, which basically the only connection it has with the '51 film is that they are based on the same book. In fact, Hawks was based on Campbell's book ""Who going there?"", while Carpenter is the one who brought it to the big screen.Our story begins like this. A husky is being chased through the frozen mountains of Antarctica and is being chased by two people who are chasing it in a helicopter, trying to kill it. The dog manages to reach a camp where a group of people come out to see what's going on. In the panic they kill the two helicopter crew members, injuring one of their own team. The dog is saved and the footage showing it roaming freely in the camp and socializing with the team members makes us believe that the dog...Carpenter foreshadows what is to come. We soon learn that the dog is a carrier of a deadly alien virus, which takes the form of the organisms it invades until it changes into its true form to kill whatever threatens it
When the team members find out, they begin to doubt each other and whether the one seeing is healthy or infected by the murderous alien. What follows is a peculiar sci-fi psychological thriller, with the elements of ""whodunit"" mutated in the case of ""whoisit"".The research team consists of 12 people. 12 actors on one set - every director's nightmare. But Carpenter handles his characters with characteristic mastery, giving, with the help of Bill Lancaster's amazing screenplay, his excellent cast the space and time to develop them and give them depth and substance, thus helping the viewer to enter himself. In the impasse where the heroes are and to feel their despair. Kurt Russell stands out in the lead role, who gives here perhaps the best performance of his career.He avoids the bad scene of the pompous and arrogant fake brat, playing the reluctant hero, who doubts his ability to handle the situation and the humility he brings to his character makes him all the more believable. Worthy of mention are the mechanical effects used to make the alien monster, perfectly rendering its form: And it is a sample that a science fiction film can be very scary and effective without the use of digital effects. The gray photography, the narrow corridors and claustrophobic rooms, the heroes isolated from the world and thus cut off from any hope of salvation, combined with the evocative music by the great Ennio Morricone, give a dark atmospheric thriller, a modern classic, always unsurpassed . For me it will always be right up there with the pioneer Alien.A trully masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

I will never understand why this was once hated.,"Back in 1982, John Carpenter made a sci-fi horror film, a remake of a flawed yet beloved cult classic from the 50's. It bombed horribly, mostly due to poor marketing, but critical word of mouth didn't help. It was panned by critics, who called it one of the worst films of that year. But then, like a phoenix from the ashes, the home release of the film allowed people to actually see it.It was then that everyone, including these critics who condemned it, realised that The Thing is one of the best films ever made!It is the perfect set up for a horror story. A handful of men at a small research base in Antarctica, during a blizzard, are attacked by a shape-shifting being that could be anybody and anytime. Everyone gets paranoid and isolated as nobody knows who is human and who is the thing.Cabin fever and paranoia play a huge part in this film. It feels so claustrophobic and isolated that it is uncomfortable to watch even without the gruesome monster popping up at random points. We follow Kurt Russell, but do we know he is actually still Kurt Russell? No we don't. That's the genius of the film.Carpenter, as much as I love his films, tends to direct in a workmanlike style. This one feels more finely crafted than his usual output. That isn't a slight against the likes of Escape from New York or They Live, it just means that The Thing feels more special. There is not a flaw to be found in the execution here. The characters feel like real people, played excellently by some of the best character actors of the time, and the atmosphere is relentless, aided by the films excellent musical score.You can't talk about The Thing without mentioning the effects. Rob Bottin made some of the best effects of all time in this film. It isn't just that it's all practical (something the prequel discovered to its cost), it's that they are even better than most other practical effects. How each is used and shot is masterful. They were seen as too repulsive that it made critics overlook the rest of the film, which now should be taken as a compliment.The only reason I can think of for The Thing being as panned as it was is that critics and horror (much like comedy) have never really gone hand in hand. Similar, though less severe, examples belong to such classics as Alien, The Shining, Gremlins and Predator. I guess, particularly at that time, blunt and gruesome was seen as artless trash. It isn't much of an excuse, but it does fit.The Thing is a near flawless masterpiece. You are doing yourself a disservice for not watching it. Just like David Cronenberg's The Fly and Chuck Russell's The Blob, it blows its original out of the water. Terrifying and compelling, it will stay with you forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

I wish I hadn't.
The characters were emotionally stunted, two-dimensional stereotypes, and their dialogue consisted mostly of insults, profanity, and grunts.

The effects of the creature are great, no CGI here, all practical and it holds up quite nicely which makes it all the more terrifying. The acting is great and every man has a different personality, though it lacks character development. Love the fact that it takes place in Antarctica, cut off from the rest of society, and with few weapons, only one really works against the monster.

Carpenter's Greatest Achievement,"Upon a recent rewatch--I'm reminded why this movie is one of the Sci fi/ horror greats. I've probably seen this movie 20 times or more over the last decade and it never fails to deliver. When a research team stationed in the Antarctic is attacked by a neighboring research facility - - they are forced to confront an alien that could be hiding in plain sight.The viewer is left with an enjoyable ride as the paranoia in the team hits a fever pitch-- who is the alien? As well as who is the next victim? The isolated setting, the cold visuals of the Antarctic only serve to strengthen the fear. The soundtrack is minimal but visceral enough to highlight the tension. The SFX are top notch as practical models were the order of the day... Having watched a recent film, I am still impressed with the hard reality of the models.... The viscera is all too real.The story is based on the old ""The Thing From Outer Space;"" however, it shares more with Lovecraft than it's 1950s camp horror. The feelings of dread and the fear of the unknown drive the film--it is still a joy to watch almost 30 years later.I cannot recommend this movie enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

i rewatch this movie after years of watching it the first time, and i was blown away by the visual effect, especially during the time this movie came up, casting was good and i jumped a few times during the jump-scares scenes.This movie did well when it comes to ""Horror"" and i wasn't bored as i am watching it, unlike many other Horror movies which make me yawn.I understand this is one of the many 80s classics and i maybe give the new one a try and see for myself if its actually as bad as people say.Overall i enjoyed it, and highly recommended it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Amazing,"The special effects hold up phenomenally and managed to really gross me out and creep me out in 2023, that alone is impressive, the story is also extremely interesting and gets tense very first, the firs half hour or so can be a bit slow but the characters are mostly enjoyable enough and the story is intriguing enough for you to get to the good stuff, once the movie really kicks of it gets good the scenes are some of the most terrifying things I've seen in a movie. My biggest flaw with this movie is while some characters get developed and all have personality quirks that make them stand out, they're not all very well developed we only know much about 3 of them and the other 9 mostly just have their personalities and tbh we still don't know much about the characters in general no backstory or anything. That being said I think it helps the tension be more scary as you have even less an idea on who it can be. Very good movie massively recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An exercise in how to create a growing sense of paranoia and tension,"In a remote research station in Antarctica in 1982, the members of its team unexpectedly encounter the inhabitants of a neighboring Norwegian research station, who are trying to kill a dog that has escaped from their base. After killing the crazed Norwegians, the shaken research crew flies out to their base only to find all of them are either dead or missing. All they find are the remains of an unknown creature that the Norwegians had attempted to burn. It soon becomes clear to them all that what they have found is an alien life form. However, before long it becomes terrifyingly apparent that the creature can take over and copy other life forms, and that it spreads from one person to another like a virus. Before long paranoia takes hold of the team, whose trust in one another swiftly deteriorates, and terror descends upon them.An adaptation of John W. Campbell Jr., novella Who Goes There? The Thing had been originally loosely adapted into the 1951 science fiction-horror film The Thing from Another World. Several directors would be considered before cult movie director John Carpenter who had gained critical acclaim for his low-budget 1978 horror movie Halloween. Starring Kurt Russell who had only just previously worked with Carpenter on the science fiction action film Escape From New York, the movie features what was at the time a relatively unknown cast of actors. It, like Halloween, has a basic premise, which relies heavily on an ever-pervasive sense of dread, and a sense of cloying paranoia. It probably comes as no coincidence that the movie was released just a few short years after Ridley Scott's 1979 Science-Fiction Horror classic Alien. Indeed, it may be said that Carpenter may have taken some inspirational cues from Scott's masterpiece. Both have remote secluded settings which add a degree of claustrophobic tension into the mix. Quentin Tarantino himself has cited The Thing as having inspired his debut masterpiece Reservoir Dogs, with its themes of paranoia and the use of a small backdrop.Similar to 1956's Invasion of the Body Snatchers directed by Don Siegel, the movie relies on a growing sense of inevitability and dread, as each of the movie's 12 protagonists succumb to the paranoia that begins to swallow them. Its intense, somber atmosphere is echoed by Ennio Morricones' intense and eerie synth score. As with Halloween, Carpenter knows how to pull his audience's strings so before long they're looking over their shoulder, or looking around every corner long after the movie has ended. He makes excellent use of the minimalistic aspect of the movie's setting, with its closed-in environment adding to the ever-increasing anxiety of his characters. It's to the movie's testament that its amazing, eye-popping practical effects from Rob Bottin still hold up to this very day. When the Thing reveals itself under its human guise, the scenes of it contorting and twisting or detaching itself from the rest of its physiognomy are a true work of art. Carpenter also allows for subtle touches of subtle, dark humor while never undermining the movie's grueling intensity.In the role of R. J. MacReady, Russell is in typically dry and sardonic territory and brings just the right touch of wry bravado to proceedings. Essentially becoming the alpha male of a group of men, who have begun to turn in on themselves. He's given fine support from a cast that includes Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Keith David, and Donald Moffat.Both a commercial and critical flop on its release, and it perhaps wasn't helped that it had to contend with a certain Extra-Terrestrial, it has eventually been evaluated and given more of the kudos it deserves. The Thing is something of a seminal piece of film-making and a solid lesson in evoking atmosphere and a palpable sense of paranoia and dread. It along with Aliens stands as one of the cult iconic Science-Fiction Horror movies of the 80's.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Quality Sci-Fi Horror from the 80s.,"Similar to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, John Carpenter's The Thing was pummeled by negative reviews upon release by critics, only to later gain much love and appreciation. Unlike with The Shining, The Thing isn't bogged down by unlikable characters and scenes which don't advance the story in important ways. Kurt Russel always seems to be a huge presence in his films. His likability always makes the movie itself more likable. The whole cast deliver convincing performances. This movie doesn't hold back on gore and suspense. The paranoia is real as everyone is suspicious of each other not being human. The need for a strong leader arises and Kurt Russel's character is the obvious man for the job. Even so, the fear and lack of trust creates tension between the characters and apprehension in the viewer. This alien monster puts an abundance of blood, slime and grisly images on display. So much so that the initial shock factor proved to be a bit too much for its viewers in 1982. Even all these years later, the special effects hold up well. This movie has a lot going for it. I believe it will only continue to age well as a classic science fiction horror film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An Absolute Masterpiece,"My favorite horror movie of all time, an entertaining masterpiece with Carpenter at the top of his game- The Thing is by far the best remake of any film ever made and is easily some of the best work I have ever seen on screen to this day. From its insane all-out practical effects to Russell's stellar performance, there is absolutely nothing to not love about this film. The cinematography is incredible, and the setting provides a perfect background for the claustrophobic events that happen on screen. Kurt Russell is fantastic as always as the films obvious standout, as well as the rest of the stellar supporting cast- especially Keith David. The special effects are glorious and a pure example of why many Horror films lack the scares and timelessness that films like this do- and honestly prove to hold up better than the already dated CGI effects from the 2011 version. As I said before, Carpenter and Producer Debra Hill are at the top of their game in this one and are able to craft a story that is not only endlessly fun to watch and see unfold but endlessly suspenseful and emotional to watch as well. In my book, it's the best horror film ever made, and I honestly could never get tired of watching it.My Rating: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I simply don't get it...,"It moves like a virus.. It could be anyone... Suspense?

Flawless Classic?,"Pre-CGI, The Thing, in my perspective, delivers a pure artistry of film not seen in any other timeline than of the few movies that came out in this era of mastery of effects with the use of computers.
Never lending a dull moment, the viewer gets to experience the suspense and thrill wrapped about the idea put into sound and audio. Over the top imagination inspiration. Not jump scary, I actually laugh when I saw the freaky parts. Will we ever see anything like this again? Well, that time has passed.

Legendary,"One of the most creepy, atmospheric, and ahead of it's time movies ever made. The practical effects were amazing, the creature was freaky and shocking, and the characters were well acted and written. The mystery develops slowly and it becomes more intense over time, and by the end it's chaotic and terrifying. It blends multiple genres together amazingly and is one of the most underappreciated classic horror movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An Excellent Horror To Remember,The story itself being revolved around a group of scientist mixed profession personnel in a facility what feels like the Arctic wasteland we see something different and unknown and the true horror is what is it? The fact we see this disguised entity at the beginning of the film automatically gives you that anticipation and later suspicion.The special effects is it's top quality and a work of horror art. The creatures were brilliantly built and dressed that would make many scream and run out of the room. The cast are well placed even if for that moment they weren't as acknowledged in the industry they make their character believable even if it's subtle.This is the right formula to fear factor.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Ever Lovin' Stalk-Eyed Thing,"Oh man this lives up to its reputation. In spades. 1982's Thing is a filthy beast all dripping slime and snarling and snapping with wrong distorted tentacles. The claustrophobic framing, the chokingly linear pace, the evergreen score and effects. It's wild to me that this was hated so much on the initial release but then I suppose the future tends to look like that, overwhelming and terrifying, and in making the Thing, Carpenter inadvertently smashed that rarest of filmic achievements, something that just doesn't age. The tension and explosion stuff is extraordinary and the sense of panic is palpable. I was right to avoid this for so long out of fear.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
As frightening as Sci-Fi/Horror gets,"Over the years, each & every friend, family member and acquaintance I've happened to talk to about this movie, has raved about this film. I've always concurred.In a word, creepy. Anything you can't see allows the mind to conjure. As it should be. Whatever it is though, it is certainly malevolent, and in a big way. It is cunning, incapable of compassion, and goes forth with a steel resolve.Morricone's music is perfectly unsettling throughout.Talk about a piece perfectly fitting; Morricone paints a musical portrait of the snowy landscapes. The music is so foreboding. And it foreshadows the (possible) doom of the crew. More than that though, the score really personifies the (non-person) evil presence. It's so effective, what should be the pristine white beauty of the landscape, feels instead, like a bleak & contaminated graveyard.I don't like spoilers much, and if I did reveal specifics of the story here, I'd be doing the film an injustice. It's basically a ""You had to be there"" situation.All that said, it's the creepiest"" movie I've ever seen, in and out of this genre.Carpenter direction is just plain excellent. Actors are great as well.Lastly, my favorite line comes from Richard Maser, who just witnessed 'an event' and who replies to the question 'What is it?"", with ""I don't know, but it's weird and pissed off"".No monster movie ever gets a 10. It's kind of ""Not allowed"". In fact, for those reviewers who are averse to horror, the ceiling is maybe 8, and then it gets marked down from there.This flick is a 10. Like other reviewers so aptly point out, this movie is extremely affecting, and gives the viewer an unsettling feeling that sticks with you a while. Really well done.Bob R.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A masterclass in atmosphere and suspense...,"Based on the novel 'Who Goes There?' by John W. Campbell, the Thing is a sci fi psychological horror like no other. Set on an American research base deep in the Antarctic, the crew there encounter an alien creature that can mimic other life forms, and mimic them perfectly. As the creature slowly begins to take over the crew, they have to put aside their mistrust and paranoia to find a way of stopping it from reaching civilization. But when you can't tell who is human, and who is not...who can you trust?I originally saw the Thing a long time ago, and at the time I appreciated its tone, atmosphere and special effects... but it never really struck me as anything more than a good film I'd probably not watch again. Recently however, I found myself caught up in online discussions about the film, praising its intriguing plot, deconstructing its mysteries and calling it a masterpiece... so I picked up the 4K version and watched it again. Oh. My. God....I must say that I usually find John Carpenter a bit hit and miss, but dear lord is he on form here. The film expertly crafts a forboding atmosphere of paranoia and dread, serving as a sci fi horror whodunnit, of sorts. The characters are all completely believable as they gradually turn on each other for their own safety, and when one is revealed as an alien you immediately think back to when they could have turned, and who they have been in contact with. The film is loaded with clues, mysteries and red herrings, and picking it all apart is half the fun.As for the other half - the horror.... and boy does this film deliver in spades. The practical creature effects look absolutely incredible, even today... and you can tell effects lead Rob Bottin put his heart and soul into this project (quite literally, he ended up bring hospitalised due to malnutrition and exhaustion after working on this film practically non-stop for 18 months, he even slept on the set!) and that combined with Ennio Morricone's creepy score providing the film's heartbeat, the tension never lets up. You never know when the creature will appear, and when it does it's always a gut wrenching cacophony of shrieks, gore, slime, tentacles and face chomping.The best thing about this film though, is trying to work it all out, and even today fans are still picking this film apart as they try to unravel its secrets. It is an absolute travesty that it bombed upon release, both critically and with audiences... to the point where it almost ended John Carpenter's career. The world clearly just wasn't ready, but now we are, and I have to say that The Thing is an absolute masterclass in atmosphere, effects and tension... that somehow gets better the more you watch it. A legitimate contender for the greatest horror film of all time, and is an absolute essential watch for fans of horror.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Repugnant remake does boast macabre showmanship...,"John Carpenter's nightmarish variation on the well-regarded 1951 chiller ""The Thing From Another World"" features a colorless cast of macho dullards led by Kurt Russell who tangle with unseen enemy at an Antarctic outpost. Overloaded with gross-out special effects, the movie seems destined to appeal mainly to connoisseurs of splatter-cinema (and, in that regard, it was somewhat ahead of its time). Carpenter, working from a weak screenplay, does all he can to raise shudders with the minimal material, but his atmospherics are disappointing, as are the performances. Still, the outlandishness of the violence stays with one--it's memorably disgusting. *1/2 from ****",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
That is the way to end a movie,"Every single living THING is fighting for survival. No exception here!All components of the movie blends together to build a masterpiece:
Location - distant with harsh environment
Characters - everyone is with own individuality
Atmosphere - tense and desperate, leading to impasse
Music - Ennio Morricone
The foe - manage to oppose the characters against each other.The story line is composed by alternating slowly building pressure scenes with fast action shots. I like that the characters are with own individuality , equally strong and there are no hero with super powers. They are confront with something way bigger and only thing they have is to stay closest and work together. When the story goes you are building personal connection with characters, diving deeply in movie atmosphere and start to think you are one of them.

Competent characters making competent decisions in the face of an alien threat, something the Alien franchise sorely lacks.""The Thing perfectly balances tension, paranoia, and horror, creating an atmosphere that grips you from start to finish.

The cast, despite most of them being relatively unknown, all played their roles in impressive fashion. The music set an eerie tone full of dread and unease. The set was so sick, I love that it was all practical. And the effects! Oh my god the effects were top tier, especially considering the time period this movie was filmed.

Heres the Thing,"I caught this on the big screen when it came out and I watched myself at some point actually gripping the armrests of my movie seat. I was eagerly looking forward to this being a die-hard fan of the 1951 version that I have seen countless times and will see again. I like this movie because we got to be one of the boys in the film and because of that, we closely follow what they do and say and care for them. That's the idea! When the movie takes off, it is hard to determine who is who and when but one doesn't have time to figure it all out. The intensity prevents that and before we know it, we went along for a thrill ride! Kudos to everyone involved and a hearty well-done. I have a small gripe about this and the 2011 film. In the 1951 version, the head scientist goes without sleep for days during the whole ""thing"". I get it too. Who would want to sleep with this type of discovery. Also worth mentioning is they don't waste anytime trying to access the spaceship. Both the 1982 and the 2011 completely dismiss both the spaceship for exploration purposes and more investigating of the ""THING"" . Now ask yourself, wouldn't you want to see the inside of a spaceship from another world? Its weapons? Food? Clothing? Endless items? Finding and exploring the ship is one thing and understanding what we find is another. Who could sleep? Both films avoid going there. Shame too. In any event, the premise remains and holds like no other: A spaceship and its occupants. What do they want? Where did they come from? Wow! I like to eat while watching and this movie is good for a meal, a tasty drink and a decent snack of choice. Sunflower or pumpkin seeds work very well so that you don't nail bite or get antsy. Get started and watch The Thing! In fact, I am going to watch 1982 movie right now (umpteenth time)",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Terrible,"The ending of this piece of trash ruined the entire movie, which, in itself was not that good. If you want to see the REAL ""Thing"", go watch the classic film from the 1950's. Now that one was scary and with a decent ending. John Carpenter may be great but, in my opinion, he totally missed it with this one and wasn't even close to the '50s version. In the original version, everyone in the theater, both kids and adults were on the edge of their seats and everyone was talking about the movie after they left the theater. This version started out much the same as the original one but deviated, dramatically, as it progressed. I saw the original as a kid and it scared the heck out of me. I even had nightmares about it that night. The only thing I might say about the original is that it was in black and white and it MAY have been better had it been in color, which was not that common back at that time. This one should have had a totally different title because it really was nothing compared to the 50's version. I've never understood why screen writers, producers,directors, etc. think they are better than the original. Boo-Hiss.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Best Horror Movie I have ever watched,"Throughout my life I have seen many horror movies and I have played many horror video-games so I am not that easily scared from horror movies (or video-games). But The Thing made me feel truly scared after a long time.So why is it so good? Well I will try to say why without spoiling the movie. First of all the characters. The characters in this movie take most of the time (if not all the time) smart and good decisions in order to defeat or hide from the Thing. The movie doesn't spent time talking about their heritage or their family status and I think that's better from making us feel bad about them when they die. Also the performance of the actors is really good Second the story. The story develops really well but I am not going to say more about it in order not to spoil the experience. Third the atmosphere. The movie takes place in a research facility in Antarctica which make's the atmosphere more scary because you know that whatever the characters do they are truly alone and helpless while being miles away from civilization.And last let's talk about the main star of the movie The Thing. This creature is the most scary and the most disgusting thing(pun not intended) I have seen in my life and from what I said at the begging you can understand that this says a lot. I am not going to say what it's this creature main ability but I am going to say that: when it transforms it makes you disgusted and afraid. This movie has the guts to show you the transformation of The Thing in full screen and with every detail. What makes it even more scary it's the fact that the whole Thing is practical effect. I kid you not, the guys that did the effects made everything from the ground up without the use of CGI. Whatever you see, no matter how hard it is to believe, its indeed not cgi. Well, that's everything I have to say about this movie and I want to believe that I convinced you to watch it the movie without ruining the surprises. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Novella to One of the Best Horror Movies Ever,"John Carpenter takes a brilliant concept and lanches it ten fold. This movie scared me for such a long time after the first viewing then to learn that it was not only a remake but an adaptation as well it blew my mind. When talking about some of the best horror movies ever this movie comes up on several lists even all of the way at number three. This in my opinion is one of a few films that surpasses the source material.
The film opens in space and shows a ship being pulled into the atmosphere and thus the movie begins. After the title opening a dog is seen running in the snow from a helicopter that is shooting down at it, It goes to a camp of twelve men who all seem a little bored and a little anxious to leave, Things only go down from there for these men as the begin to loss complete trust in one another Already things are shrouded in mystery and it escalates dramatically as the movie progresses. To say anymore of the plot would spoil the movie as knowing as little as possible gives the movie a huge advantage to frighten the viewer. 
Some of the aspects and themes that contribute to what makes a horror movie for me are something unknown that lacks normal human morals, panic by the characters, isolation, and a large lack of knowledge of what to do and what is going on. These are all aspects of this film from start to finish. It hits all of the right notes and makes a constant level of mistrust and lack of knowledge. This can not be done without good direction and great acting. The cast is a group of just men fourteen men in total, the two Norwegian men and then all of the Americans, This is a big change from the novella as there are thirty-six men but this way the men have some character development and are fleshed out, so when things start to get tense in the film and you don't know what is going to happen you care for each person their. This is not only done by the acting but by how Carpenter set up each scene and leaving all of the windows open so that you feel the same mistrust that the men at the facility feel. Some of this and more themes lead to this film surpassing the novella. I watched the film before knowing about the novella so going into this film with not knowing what to expect and wanted to be scared and I can say without a doubt I was, from the mystery to the stunning practical effects this movie is one of the best.
Every aspect of this movie felt real, from all of the costumes to the practical effects of the beast and the setting, it feels as though I am watching these events first hand. The setting of the film is one of its strongest points, stranded in the middle of a desalite continent with no where to go as the storm covering the glacier would kill you within the hour. It creating such a feel of isolation for these men as they could not escape this thing. This film is probably most famous for its effects. They are perfect. A question was asked about how the effects look today and if they hold up, I heard some people mention that they are dumb looking now but I guarantee that if they were in the presence of the thing they would turn running with their tails between their legs. They are so real and terrifying that it has become one of the most renown horror movies of all time. 
There is a definite main character of this story, R. J. McReady, as he takes charge of the group and it follows him, but not for the entire film. This film follows a handful characters to expand the view of the mistrust. Even if it is just with a character for a moment it gives a look to what they are thinking and feeling, adding some small things to each of the scenes brings it so much further than the novella was at. Like the scene when McReady goes to ask Blair a question in the shed and they open the little hatch in the door to see him and there is a noose hung by Blair at the table and it is never mentioned, and Blair walks by it not even looking at it. I thought that this was brilliant and it brought a lot of mental distress his character, even though he just walks past it and asks to leave. This sort of pain can be seen in a lot of the characters as they are having inner conflicts not knowing if some of their best friends have been taken over by this monstrosity. 
One of the most prominent themes of this movie is mistrust. The men all have their composure and are level headed until they get to the Norwegian and realize something very bad is going on. Soon after that everything starts to fall apart for the men, as they can't trust each other at all in fear that the person they are standing next to might not be a person. This leads everyone to be very upset and even to do rash things throughout the film. This same feeling is felt for the viewers as you have no idea if any of the characters are themselves or not. 
John Carpenter's The Thing is one of the best horror movies of all time. It far surpasses all of the source material. The film as a whole was almost perfect with a few technical flaws here and there concerning time lapsing, not knowing how much time has gone by when they find the tunnel and the amount of fuel they have for their flamethrowers. Other than that I thought the movie was great and I would give it an A on a letter grade scale from A+ to F. I gave it 10/10 on here but I'd give it a 9 and a half if I could do halves",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Probably the best horror film ever made?,"My freshman year of college we had a film appreciation class and for horror week our professor said we should vote for Halloween, Jaws, The Shining, Sinister, or The Thing. The Thing was the only one I had never even heard of, and the premise sounded super interesting, so we decided on that one. I don't know why this film isn't on the same popular level as The Shining or Jaws when it really should be. The Thing is absolutely terrifying on every single level. The practical effects are AMAZING and they look super realistic. It blew my mind because I thought the film was made in the 90's, not 1982. However, what I think is even greater is the story. The idea of being trapped in a building with no escape and your with a bunch of people and one of them is a killer but you don't know who? Terrifying concept!!! It was great to see all these palatable characters turn against each other in a realistic way. They weren't just cardboard stereotypes, they were realistic and interesting characters and it was scary to see them decay to paranoia. I was at the edge of my seat trying to figure out who was lying, and whenever an alien was revealed I nearly died from the shock. It's a shame that critics bashed the movie back in 1982 because it was too gory for their snobby old stomachs to handle. Who cares about the gore? The effects and gore are super good, but the real scary thing here is the tension. The Thing needs to be a lot more popular then it is. I had never even heard of the film before my film school and that's a huge shame because The Thing is now one of my favorite movies. I'm a senior in college now and I've seen it at least 10 times and own it on Blu-ray.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Carpenter's masterpiece of paranoia,"Though it didn't attract audience and mostly received bad critics,John Carpenter's The Thing is now considered as a masterpiece about human nature and paranoia.At least,it's a masterpiece to me and it's one of my all time favorites.Carpenter creates a chilling atmosphere which he does best and he focuses on twelve men working in a research station in Antarctica with nowhere to run.When they find an unknown organism,they took it to the station with the hope that they could've made the discovery of the century.But when the frozen organism is thawed out,the trouble begins.From that point,the movie gets very different from it's predecessor which was a Howard Hawks (Carpenter's favorite) production.The thing was a monster in shape in the original film and the crew was fighting against something they could see,but in Carpenter's version,the thing has a deadly weapon;it can imitate any living creature it wants.After they learn the terrifying truth about their guest,the crew loses trust for each other and this keeps the tension always high.Members of the crew fall apart and they begin to accuse each other of being an alien instead of acting like a team.With this masterpiece,Carpenter accomplishes what he always does once again;he scares us to death.While doing this,he also shows what a human being is capable of(lies,mistrust,even murder)and how easy they can forget some basic moral values when they feel they're in danger.Kurt Russell stars as R.J.MacReady;the helicopter pilot who tries to hold the men together in order to fight against the thing and gives one of the greatest performances of his career.The cast also includes some well known character actors like Wilford Brimley,Richard Masur,Keith David (also appeared in Carpenter's They live),Richard Dysart and Donald Moffat.Unlike his other movies,Carpenter didn't compose the music.The music belongs to a legendary composer;Ennio Morricone(you know who he is)and it provides a great support.The movies great special effects were made by Rob Bottin and his work is still remembered as a milestone.The Thing is a masterpiece from a master film maker and will always remain as one of the scariest movies about human nature.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Incredibly revolting film,"I've only seen one other film that affected me as badly, and as permanently - Pasolini's ""Salo"". There, the film was revolting for a reason. Here, it is just revolting, badly written, and badly acted. Nothing but pure shock and gore and the most repulsive special effects I've ever seen. No story, stupid characters, and patently ridiculous. There are ways to be frightened, but this is about as entertaining as mutilating yourself.I swore when I saw it back at its release that if John Carpenter had been in the lobby of the theater, I would have punched him for making me feel so thoroughly disgusted. That still holds true. Whatever else good he may have done, I have never been able to have any respect for Carpenter after seeing this.

Claustrophobia does not diminish with age,"I remember seeing this film in the mid eighties and it wasn't the gory effects that left an impression on me.
It was the sense of being caged, just like the men trapped in that snowy wasteland with only paranoia and fear.
The production design, the direction and the Ennio Morricone score build up and up, adding layers until the tension is almost unbearable.
I rewatch this movie at least once every year and it has not lost any of that anxiety inducing quality.

Overly dark remake of classic 1951 sci-fi thriller,"We know that John Carpenter revers the original ""Thing,"" directed by Howard Hawks back in 1951.  For one thing, he's said so but it's also playing on the TV the kids are watching in Carpenter's original ""Halloween.""  Too bad Carpenter was unduly influenced by Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" because this film's tone comes off a shade heavier than the atmosphere on Jupiter.A good cast is generally wasted in a treatment spoiled by Carpenter's penchant for excessive violence.  Maybe we've got a creature with mind-numbing power and a real threat to the human race but there's no dramatic build-up, no interplay between characters, absolutely no humor--in other words, a good time is had by none.Would have liked to have seen a story unfold like the original instead of the steady series of blows to the gut that Carpenter delivers.  He had all the pieces here--U.S. Antarctic post finds Norwegian camp destroyed near their discovery of a spaceship in the ice.  Thing terrorizes US camp.  But, whoa, we go into horror overdrive and everything goes downhill.  Should do it again and get it right.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The Thing hosts the best use of practical effects I've ever seen.,"I knew I was in for a good time due to the massive cult following, but damn I was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. Having watched the sequel/prequel first, I was aware of the story and concept. A remote research facility in Antarctica is invaded by an otherworldly organism that is able to imitate other cells. Not everyone is human, so the remaining workers must figure out who to trust. That is where the horror and thrills arise. Push aside the gruesome, terrifying, hideous looking aliens that are constructed to precision for now. It's the isolation that sends chills down the spine. An enormous sense of claustrophobia where trust issues are the major concern. The characters are well established, well developed and well acted enough to, finally, create an involving story. Seriously, the plot is so welcoming that it invites you to figure out who might be ""The Thing"". Tense, gritty, dark...just how I like my horrors. Now we can throw in the inventive practical effects to enhance the film onto a-whole-nother level. Wow. It was so disgustingly delicious that I had to rewind back, hold up my phone on snapchat, and record those scenes so that all my friends can appreciate what I went through. Even the cries that ""The Thing"" yelps is nightmare inducing. John Carpenter's direction was slow, but it worked! He took his time to bring life to the characters and to create the chilling tension. I found the scene transitions slightly basic and jarring, simply fading to black. Also the ending was a tad underwhelming, was hoping for a final minute twist or something. But these are small nitpicks. The Thing has stood the test of time and is still engaging as it was when it was initially released. I've finally watched it, and suggest you all do the same as well. I won't look at huskies the same way now...",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Great setting, fantastic effects","An intelligent and reasonably tight story set in a research outpost in Antarctica, where scientists have inadvertently dug up some form of parasitic, shapeshifting alien out of the ice. It quickly becomes a study in paranoia, where behavior amongst the men becomes a game as difficult as that chess match against the computer Kurt Russell has early on: if one of your colleagues may not be what he seems to be, what's the best move? Attempting to determine who it might be, and selectively isolating him? Destroying everyone so that you might survive? Attempting to use reason and science in a helter skelter, chaotic situation? I loved the setting and the very cool ways in which the thing manifests itself, which at the time seemed so excessive that it turned reviewers off, but which today appears highly creative and refreshing in light of modern CGI, at least for me. There may be a couple of moments when one wonders about character motivations and it's a pretty simple story, but the latter keeps it focused, and the pace of the film is good. Kurt Russell and Keith David stand out in the cast, which also includes A. Wilford Brimley and Donald Moffat.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"One of the best, if not the best Sci-Fi Horror film.","I first saw this in the theater at its initial release in early 1982. This is definitely a testament of how horror films should be made. Although their is copious amounts of gore, it never lags in suspense, good acting, taut plot buildup, and enthralling drama. This is a time when CGI was nearly unheard of and special effects and horror make-up were made from scratch in an artists studio. Yes, they literally had to build and create tangible/three dimensional puppets, robots and props to enhance the movie monsters and horror effects. By the early 80's there were several notable horror make-up artists that earned the majority of the business. Therefore, they were at the height of their craft due to competition and a deep appreciation and desire to explore the depths of their creativity that the imagination could fathom.The drama is also excellent as the story envelops e are immersed in the crew's journey and struggle to examine what is happening to their camp due to this alien intelligence that has invaded upon them. Kurt Russell is simply great as the unshakable MacReady. The rest of the cast offers some good performances as well.What makes this movie so frightening is that eventually the crew members all become feverishly suspicious of each other as this inevitable terror befalls them. They must decide to either collaborate or fight each other in order to survive. Being stranded in the desolate arctic snow is claustrophobic enough; but add the ominous and elusive alien presence with the growing resentment and distrust for each character and we are left with a confounding morass destined for doom. A sequel to John Carpenter's version was made in 2011 and is supposed to be the backstory to his version. These two movies should never be confused for the 2011 version is far inferior and lacks the good acting and character development. It also relies to much on the usage of CGI to be taken seriously.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Timeless Masterclass in Sci-Fi Horror and Practical Effects,"Near perfection movie. As good as any film of this genre could get. The plot is enchanting and captivating. From the very start, Carpenter nailed creating a mysterious atmosphere that stays with us throughout the film. One of the most fascinating aspects of 'The Thing' (1982) is that it's the precursor to many other films, since it is groundbreaking yet remains unique and timeless.The use of practical effects is so meticulous and impressive that it makes the movie a true masterpiece. The film legit makes a case for practical effect superiority over CGI. The handmade visuals of the Thing reflect the sinister nature of the threat unfolding before our eyes. The practical effects are far superior compared to their contemporary counterparts. The events take place in a linear and stimulating way. Most of the plot points maintain the uncertainty, ensuring that the audience stays on their toes, which is a distinct feature of good quality movies.The film has one of the best opening scenes in filmmaking history. The Arctic theme, isolated from civilization, adds more to the already strong sense of desolation. The sense that the Thing is so far yet so close at all times stays with the audience until the very end. The protagonist has depth and serves as an antithesis to the Thing. This was done by making Kurt Russell as humane as possible. Speaking of characters, great acting all around. An all-male, military-like setting complements the theme of the movie.The directing is superb, especially when it comes to shooting foreshadowing scenes or the dog scenes in general.Attention to detail is just on a different level. It has several iconic scenes. The sounds in the film are striking, the soundtrack is well-picked.Another beautiful screenwriting indicator is that how the threat the Thing poses, overtime undermines the antecedent hierarchy among this group of researchers.One downside is that some questions are left unanswered; however, they are more like an extension of the mysterious aura of the film rather than plot holes. On the other hand, it is said that there was intentional ambiguity in certain foreshadowing scenes, which is another indicator of how detail-oriented the making of this movie has been.And the only negative note is that at one point the pace of the movie surges and we suddenly end up at the climax. Despite the charm of fast resolution the film passes on a significant opportunity to unfold even more schemes and action. Lack of female characters could also be pointed out. Seeing different dynamics due to female presecence could have been intriguing. Neverthless, all-male cast goes so well with the theme of the movie that even though female abscence is noted, it's not a significant shortcoming.The Thing (1982) never ceases to be intriguing at any point. Involves several action scenes.In short, a well-crafted masterpiece with first-class production, a captivating sci-fi leaning toward horror. Excellent work.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The most effective practical effects ever put to film,"Simply put, John Carpenter's ''The Thing'' is my number one movie of all time, and the creature feature benchmark that I compare all others to. It is one of those movies where, no matter how many times I watch it, there is never a single thing I would want to have been done differently.From the score, to the cast, to the practical effects - which I consider to still be the most effective ever put to film - The Thing is a masterpiece of horror cinema, and one which proves that a B-Movie concept can spar with the greatest movies of all time when it is carried out with the respect and love that it deserves.And The Thing is a movie which I personally believe achieves something which very few horror films ever have, particularly monster movies: It is crafted and filmed with such a level of respect, that it moves beyond the realm of simply scary or disturbing imagery, and into the realm of presenting the audience with something so indescribably alien, and so transfixingly different to anything seen before it, that you simply cannot look away. This is something which continues to inspire my own work, wherein I always aim to present my audience with a monster worth looking at and imagining. After all, if a movie doesn't treat its monster with effort and respect - why should the audience?",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

MY REVIEW: The Scary Thing!!,"The Thing. Sounds scary, right! Yeah, it is scary, mysterious, thrilling sci-fi horror classic. The plot is one liner, scientists in the Antarctic are confronted by a shape-shifting alien that assumes the appearance of the people that it kills. The special effects are perfect and have not dated at all even after more than 30 years. It builds the tense atmosphere from the very start and helped by hell like stormy chilling weather of Antarctic and thunderous background score. All actor act well and Kurt Russell as lead does his job right. There is loads of blood bath and brutal killings by the scary thing. The open ending takes the movie out of ordinary and leaves you wondering why there is no sequel at all of this classic? Nevertheless, until they could think of worthy sequel, enjoy this timeless sci-fi horror classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Extremely Gory, But Extremely Intelligent","In an era where nearly every great horror film of the 60s and 70s is being remade for audiences weaned on horror flicks of today that are not too terribly good, it is instructive to look back at John Carpenter's 1982 opus THE THING, which itself is a remake--of a childhood favorite of the director's, Howard Hawks' 1951 sci-fi/horror classic THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE. Although Carpenter's film was not initially that big a box office hit when released in mid-1982, it has since garnered a very large following.In fact, Carpenter's film is less of a remake of Hawks' film than it is a reworking, as he goes back to the original idea posited by the source material, namely the John W. Campbell story ""Who Goes There?"", in which a US scientific crew in Antarctica is menaced by a shape-changing alien thawed out from the ice after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who had starred for Carpenter in the director's 1979 TV movie ELVIS and the 1981 film ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, heads a cast of stalwart character actors, including Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart, and Richard Masur, in this tension-filled exploration of paranoia, as the shape-changing ""thing"", which first comes to their camp in the form of a guide dog a Norwegian team is trying to kill, takes over each of them one by one. It isn't long before everybody in the camp begins to mistrust his fellow man. The ending of the film, in which Russell and David are the only ones left, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity akin to the similar codas to both THE BIRDS and STRAW DOGS.Almost universally, when the subject of THE THING is bought up, the emphasis is on the extremely gory special effects make-up and alien designs created by Rob Bottin, who had worked with Carpenter on the 1980 horror classic THE FOG, and on Joe Dante's 1981 werewolf film THE HOWLING. These effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic, and even today, they can also be quite stomach-turning. But all of this would make Carpenter's film nothing more than a high-end splatter epic if the direction, the story, and the acting weren't up to snuff; and thankfully, each of them are. When he's not concentrating on the enormously gruesome transformation sequences, Carpenter builds suspense in the same Hitchcock-influenced way that informed his previous films HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, with cinematographer Dean Cundey's prowling camera-work, particularly through the corridors of the station, a significant help. The acting enhances an already-fine screenplay adaptation by Bill Lancaster; and we are also given a taut score by Ennio Morricone, whose work on director Sergio Leone's classic 1960s Italian spaghetti westerns is well known to all, including of course Carpenter himself. THE THING also features additional fine visual effects from Albert Whitlock (who worked on many Hitchcock films, including THE BIRDS), and Roy Arbogast, who worked on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and JAWS 2.Carpenter's film was not the success it could have been because Universal chose to release this graphic shocker a mere two weeks after it had released Steven Spielberg's far more family-friendly E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (not surprisingly, critics and audiences at the time favored Spielberg's excellent film over Carpenter's equally excellent but exceedingly different one). Also, most of the horror film box office business in 1982 was going to another Spielberg-produced film, POLTERGEIST. As a result, at a cost of $15 million, THE THING suffered from lack of attention in its time.Over time, however, many have come to see Carpenter's film for what it is--an extremely gory but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, done with a great deal of flair and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia at the heart of its story. Though it is still quite gruesome, THE THING should be as much remembered for the skill by which the story is put together as it is for the gory alien designs and make-up effects; for it is the storytelling skill and the suspense that make it so memorable in the final analysis.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Boring Characters,"Alright. I went into this movie with some expectations, especially because people often say that it is one of the best horror movies. I understand this movie was made back in the day but the monster, alien thingys did not scare me at all. They were gooey and I guess gross in a way but not frightening. So I quickly gave up on actually expected to be scared by this movie and just carried out for the suspense which it also lacked. It just felt entirely too predictable. You could tell who was who and even how the characters would act just by looking at them. The movie gave the characters no real backstories, motives, fears, families, favorite foods anything. I feel like each character was given 2 personality traits and thrown into the movie. I won't call out the characters for acting stupid at times, cause it's a scary movie, but what bugged me was that they seemed completely unafraid of dying (at least how I would expect). I understand being hysteric in their situation but the only 2 emotions these characters showed were hysteria and anger, If I had been in this movie I would have thrown up, peed my pants and balled my eyes out within like 10 minutes. I did not care if any of them survived or not. It was kinda boring and I wouldn't watch it again. I did like the soundtrack, the scenery of the movie, and it had a plot that made sense, I think it really just lacked good characters.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Best practical effects ever in a horror movie,"The Thing is a masterpiece of suspense and gore. It's about paranoia, and there's plenty to be paranoid of in this movie.

You gotta watch it. It is without a doubt Special effects master Rob Bottin's greatest work. It's amazing what people came up with before computers replaced almost everything with CGI. All the monsters are real, in the sense that everything you see on screen is really there. So real in fact that even though it was made in 81-82, they still look better than everything today, even 30+ years later. this is my favorite horror movie of all time. The cast is great, the direction is fantastic, the score is absolutely creepy and memorable. I watched The Hateful 8 recently and recognized some of the music from this movie straight away.

Campbell's original story did all this better,"John Campbell's 'Who Goes There' is one of the best golden age sci-fi novellas, and after the somewhat silly vegetable-man of the first Thing movie, it would make sense that Carpenter's more faithful adaption would be better. Alas. More effective, yes, more appealing to modern audiences, yes, a better movie, no. For once the initial critical response wasn't that far off the mark.It's true that the movie is too much in love with gory effects.It's true that the characters are mere meatbags to be mutilated and killed, completely lacking (even before the descent into madness) the camaraderie seen in the original Howard Hawks film. Though Carpenter runs around trying to give them things to do they are essentially doomed from the alien's first arrival. The blood test to figure out who might be alien ends in complete disaster since even a Petri dish of blood can somehow explode into a mass of mutating organs. Using dynamite is even more ridiculous since, if every individual drop of Thing blood has its own 'mind' and autonomy, then blowing it apart would only result in many more chunks of Thing crawling around. The flamethrower is probably the best bet, if they could only figure out where to use it.So what is left? An effective atmosphere of paranoia, interspersed with a few moments of empty suspense and much outlandish gore to leave the adolescents gawking. It can be admired from a distance, I suppose, but as a story, as something the viewer can really latch onto, it falls flat. Carpenter's hipster nihilism defeats him in the end, for if nobody and nothing really matters, why should I care?",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A must see horror film,"A seemingly harmless dog runs into an American research station on Anatarctica pursued by men in a helicopter, that seem to have lost their mind, and are intent on killing as if it were the some terrible monstrosity. The Americans have no choice but to kill the crazed men, but out of curiosity as to what caused their bizarre actions they go to their camp which is completely wrecked and containing a mysterious canister found in the snow. Unable to make much of the situation they go back and put the new dog into the kennel with one they already have and... horror, unlike no other, begins.The horror of the film is a mixture of sickening gore and eerie atmosphere that John Carpenter used in films like 'Halloween."" The two elements, under Carpenter's direction, work very well with literally frightening results and the ""thing"" of the title is an organism (for lack of a better word) to be reckoned with. It is virtually indescribable, even to one who has seen this film multiple times and that is what makes it so good. A similar film, 'Alien,' three years before this used the same formula or darkness and setting to create tension and the monster was also elusive, but here, the Thing isn't just elusive and predatory. After watching the film you should know what I mean.Essentially this film is a near perfect balance of psychological as well as visceral horror. The tension of the film is only equaled by the terrifying carnage and that, my friends, makes for one horror film that you cannot afford to miss. 10/10Rated R: graphic violence/carnage, horror, and profanity",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

There's a reason why The Thing is praised by many critics and considered to be one of the best Horror movies ever. It's visually repulsive, in a good way, thanks to the isolated setting in Antarctica, fantastic make-up and practical effects. In fact, this may be my favourite Horror movie ever based on practical effects. Personally, I prefer practical effects over CGI. A good combination of both works as well. The Thing remains complete as both a Horror and Sci-Fi movie.Besides being eye candy, the paranoia caused between the researchers is something well executed. It's by no means deeply layered or complex. In fact, it's rather straightforward but just like the researchers you try to focus and pay attention to all the little details as you're trying to figure things out for yourself. Each scene made me wonder: ""What would I do in this situation"", which is something I happen to like. It's safe to say that there were no holds barred when it came to imagination.

Wow!,"John Carpenter's The Thing is an amazing (horror) movie. With an outstanding cast, unbelievable special effects, an eerie Antarctic setting and a creepy score, The Thing is one of my absolute favourites and one of the most gruesome, scariest horror movies made!After a group of Norwegian scientists uncover some sort of aircraft in Antarctica, a deadly shape-shifting alien escapes. A group of American scientists are also in Antarctica and soon enough the alien has found them and begins to wreck havoc on them as they each get more suspicious as to who is human and who is the Thing!This is a remake of the black and white The Thing From Another World. Although it takes more from the short story 'Who Goes There?' John Carpenter has created a timeless sci-fi/horror classic.The cast (Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Donald Moffat and Charles Hallahan) are great as the scientists who soon begin to turn on one another. The special effects are the highlight, though. They are outstanding and are much better than any CGI you'll see. They are sickening and not for the weak-stomachs out there. The score (although not done by Carpenter) is still very much like him, it is eerie and it sets the mood perfectly. The Antarctic setting gives the us a feel of isolation and the' can't escape' feel.Surprisingly, this didn't do well when released. Probably due to Spielberg's friendlier E.T. But today the cult status and fan base is huge and it's thought of as one of the greatest horror movies ever made.

Perfect mixture of pure shock splatter horror and creeping dread,"The perfect mixture of pure shock splatter horror and creeping dread layered on top of suspense. Not sure what else I can add to the discussion at this point in the film's history.How about this: I think MacReady dumping his drink into the computer, after he loses to it in chess, is a foreshadowing of the human ability to fight its own programming. As in, willing to sacrifice himself in order to contain the Thing. He would rather they both lose than someone win. It's a classic film theme, the indomitable ineffability of the human spirit and free- will, that Carpenter knows better than to underline. It's there if you want it.Also those practical effects. My lord. They don't get any better. They still astonish me every damn time I see this movie. Anyone saying otherwise is a techno rube. Shiny? Not nearly so much as CGI. Dead eyes? How else would they look? Tangibility is believability especially when talking about something that has never existed. Who are you to say it wouldn't look and move like this?",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Has Gotten Better With Age,"I was very late to the party in terms of seeing this movie. I had only recently seen John Carpenter's original Halloween as well. That being said, this movie still blew me away.For a movie that came out in 1982, nothing in the film seems dated and every scare is genuine and effective. Kurt Russel is as engaging as ever as R.J. MacReady and the rest of the cast also do a great job as an ensemble. Furthermore, this may also be John Carpenter's best movie overall. It's a tough call with other films like Halloween, They Live, or Big Trouble in Little China in his filmography but it is definitely up there.Despite all the impressive aspects of the movie previously mentioned, the greatest part of this film that easily holds a candle to it today are the special effects. The makeup and effects are astonishing and possibly some of the best of all time. Pair these effects with a simple but effective score and you get some substantial scares that still work today.Overall, The Thing is easily one of my favorite horror movies of all time. The only one that comes close for me is The Shining. The Thing also includes one of the best movie monsters ever and is a horror classic that can be watched over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Flawed Classic,"John Carpenter's The Thing is rightfully called a classic horror film. The scares and tension hold up, the ambiguity associated with the film begs interpretation, the acting is solid, the setting unique, the pacing excellent, and the cinematography good. Hats off to this movie, at a time when it was popular to use horror movies to punish promiscuous, mean, or stupid teenagers and adults, the Thing threatened a group of grown, intelligent, good men. Despite making all the correct choices, these brave men were still killed one by one by the creature.Of course, the film is probably most famous for its ahead-of-its-time practical effects. I would agree, they were good for the time, despite a lot of the effects being outclassed today. Need I remind you that a lot of the effects were slow or slow-moving and accompanied by long, horrified reaction shots of the men. How much scarier would the spider- legged head been if it went scampering quickly away?Also, the movie feels a little inconsistent. When the blood test is taken, one guy looks nervous, even though he obviously knows he's not infected. When Bennings is killed, somebody, i think it was Garry, says ""I knew Bennings all my life"" despite the inhuman scream that Bennings uttered as he died, his warped hands. Also, is the Thing an organism or virus? It's referred to as an imitation at times. How does it replicate the host's memory? Why did the Thing reveal itself as the dog?But hey, these are just nitpicks. It's a really good film, if a little old.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A bloody mess and too gross-out for its own good,"so i just rented this movie, I'm only 22 but being on the internet hearing so much about this horror movie ""the thing"", i knew that despite me hating bloody/gory movies, i was eventually gonna have to see it. well this is my take: sure it was creepy and pretty disturbing effects and the tension and paranoid feeling is OK (although done better in older scifi films like ""body snatchers"") but lets face it, this movie was and is a cult movie. no way this was ever going to be a mainstream film. and today, movies like this that are old and gross seem to be very popular in todays goth/punk culture of death, anyone notice? no wonder its got such a (highly undeserved) rating on IMDb! older movies from the 70's/80's that are known to be gross and twisted with those supremely gross special effects are actually more popular now then they were back then. i think its just a stupid trend and shows was perverted times were are living in. movies like the thing, army of darkness, Texas chainsaw massacre, Halloween etc (just look at all the new remakes!) are all more popular now then they were back in the day. and no greater example of this then the Thing. i think its just a really lame trend that needs to go away and fast! this movie was a onetime view and nothing more. certainly not something you can watch 20+ times unless your like a sick freak or something. seeing ppls heads getting torn apart and see poor innocent dogs getting brutally attacked by some idiot monster (guess there isn't intelligent life out there huh?) just isn't my idea of a good time at the movies. movies IMO are meant to make you feel good or if anything, have the good guy win in the end. but movies like this are dumb and depressing. i don't need real life fear in movies, unless i know the good guy is gonna kill the evil thing. i just think movies like this are too gross for there own good. i mean, you didn't see movies like this in the 1950's or even the 60's that much. pretty scary when you think that you can get away making disturbing movies like this, and they are even worse today! thanks to movies like the Thing and even Alien, we now have these insanely graphic gross-out movies by the ton. well, you can be sure i will never give them the time of day. I'm not a fan of ultra scifi cuz most of scifi tends to be creepy, gross and depressing with always a question to things. i don't like that, reminds me too much of real life. but there are some ""alien"" movies i really do enjoy, like Independence Day, Star Wars movies, Predator (which although it has SOME blood, its certainly not over the top gross like some of these others). but overall, not a big scifi fan, and the thing is just too gross for anyone IMO. only the most depraved of people would actually enjoy this kind of movie, along with the evil dead and other films of that ilk.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Thing is a splendid presentation of horror at its best.,"John Carpenter has always been a director of many talents, bringing forth some of the most creative and scary films ever to grace the screen, like Halloween, In The Mouth Of Madness, The Fog, and Christine. But he broke the mold when he made The Thing, and the result is probably the greatest monster movie in history. Sure Jaws was great, and so was Alien, but The Thing blows them all away. It's about a twelve-man research team that unwittingly takes in an alien organism that has been frozen in the ice for over 100,000 years. As if things couldn't be worse, this alien can shape-shift and ""absorbs"" its victims, so no one in the camp quite knows who is real and who is ""the thing."" Rob Bottin's special effects for the film are probably its ground-breaking achievement, for it was the first movie with a really gross-looking monster, and the monster effects still look great even today. Ennio Morricone's chilling score, Dean Cundey's beautiful photography, and John Llyod's incredible sets all help contribute to the eerie mood of the picture. Not only that, but the cast does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned, Carpenter was at the peak of his skills when he made this film. It was rather disappointing to find out that it didn't do that well at the box office, but at least it can have a nice long afterlife on DVD market now. So, I don't know what else I can say except run out and buy this wonderful film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One Of The Best Films Of All Time!,"Well the thing what can i say. One of the best films i have seen and i have watched a lot of films. The story is well written, the characters and acting are well performed by Kurt Russell and co. and obviously the direction by The Master Of Suspense John Carpenter is superb. I cannot give it a perfect 10 out of 10 because i don't think that any film deserves that but i can recommend it extremely high and say that despite it maybe looking a bit dated effects wise the story will live on forever. The suspense is wonderful because of the enclosed area that the scientists inhabit and the feeling that no one can truly trust each other is unbelievably intense. Although i have said that the effects now maybe slightly outdated i also have to put that at the time they were stunning and the effects designer Rob Bottin should get an honourable mention for making the creature seem terrifying and at the same time with the weird shapes and forms that the 'Thing' had become in the past visually stunning and intriguing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not just your average sci-fi/horror,"John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made. Sadly as with most Carpenter movies go it is also one of the most underrated movies being panned by critics shortly after it's release for a reason that is almost pathetic. It seems that at the time people were overwhelmed by the idea of the ""good"" alien. An idea spawned after the success of ""I.T."". And the very thought that a movie dealing with aliens could deviate from that idea was regarded as heresy. Human ignorance is truly a frightening thing, people need to judge films for what they are not for what they want them to be.""The Thing"" itself is an interesting study on human paranoia as members of a U.S. Antarctic base discover the presence of an alien being (refered throughout the movie only as a ""thing"") able to imitate any form of life. Not knowing who might or might not be the creature, we see how every character reacts to the situation. There is no mass hysteria or panic just a slow and gradual descent in to chaos as more and more people turn up to be... not quite human.Carpenter succeeds into elevating this movie into something far more than your average Sci-Fi/horror. There are no ""whats behind you?"" jumping moments here. Instead relying on an intense atmosphere of mistrust and pre-apocalyptic despair along with some nicely balanced moments of visual terror with no small thanks to Rob Bottin's impressive creature effects, he gives us an experience not matched by many other horror films.Instead of just throwing facts and plot elements at our face Carpenter offers us a much a more gradual and delicate approach. By implying a sense of mystery he gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret-ate what has transpired in certain scenes, while giving enough plot to those who are not so fond of interpretation in movies.Ennio Morricone's score works all the way. It's minimalistic and depressing sound perfectly fits the movie's overall tone. Although I've always wondered how would it have sounded if Carpenter (he has been known to compose all of his movies's OSTs except this one) did it? Characters while not as deeply developed are still memorable thanks to the good performances of the actors especially Kurt Russel who plays the ""down-out"" apathetic helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady. Its worth noting how his character transforms through the movie. From his disregardful ""don't give a ...."" attitude in the beginning, to that of a unifier and leader of the group of men who try to fight ""the thing"". But even with that said, there are no false heroics here, there are no ""laughing at the face of death"" moments and there certainly isn't any sort of comic relief, the movie keeps its atmosphere from the very first scene to the last. Speaking of which, here once again Carpenter keeps his tradition of creating a powerful ending.Quarter of a century after its release ""The Thing"" doesn't feel dated. And with the disturbingly growing use of computer-generated effects it feels even stronger then before because it shows the life's work and dedication of human beings not computers. Combined with its openness for analyzing it gives the viewer a lot more reasons to watch it for a second or third or fourth or ... time. A masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Waste of time.,"The internet had led me to believe that The Thing was the scariest movie ever made, and to say that I was disappointed would be to give this movie too much credit. Sure, it's somewhat suspenseful, but only in the sense of ""When is something going to happen?"" And then when something does happen, it's just not scary. It's merely gross, and usually also laughably cringe-worthy.Apparently, I have to use up 192 more characters, so I guess I'll make fun of the special effects. I mean, this was 1982, so I wasn't expecting much, and I don't hold it against the movie. But watching 40-year-old creature effects and imagining people being scared of them is pretty funny.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Effective!,"A group of researchers stationed in Antarctica is being relentlessly pursued by a shape-shifting alien that can take on the appearance of its victims. John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is a gripping science fiction thriller that surpasses its 1950s predecessor in terms of terror. The film is packed with engrossing suspense and boasts some truly remarkable special effects.The stark, frozen landscape contrasts the feverish paranoia experienced by the team members, who are constantly on edge, unsure of which of their fellow crewmates will suddenly transform into a grotesque monster. The movie is masterfully executed, and the excellent screenplay immerses the audience in the story, making them feel as if they are part of the team, trying to identify the ""thing.""All in all, ""The Thing"" is undeniably one of the top horror films of the 20th century!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Ultimately creepy and unsettling,"Before this adaptation of John Campbell Jr.'s novel, ""Who Goes There?"", came The Thing from Another World (1951). Many people liked it at the time for its effects and thought provoking story line. But, I'm not sure if anyone suspected someone could overpass it. John Carpenter, the director of famed slasher movie Halloween (1978), takes on this project and executes it without a hint of weakness anywhere. At least none that I could see which seemed like a real flaw.The story is about a group of scientists in Antarctica than happen to come across a perplexing and dangerous threat. The threat is a creature of unknown species that has the power to perfectly copy the DNA of any organism it comes in contact with. Because of this, it allows the creature to devour its prey very easily. Over time, this creates high tension amongst the men because no one knows who is really themselves. However, the one individual who does his best to keep his cool (pardon the pun) is R.J. MacReady played by veteran actor Kurt Russell.It does not surprise me that Russell is in this film. Russell began working with John Carpenter back in the TV movie Elvis (1979), and they continued to make movies together since then through the 1980s. Along with Russell is Wilford Brimley (better known for having a mustache but shaved for this role), Richard Masur, Keith David and so on. Through the whole film, each actor gives their best performance in displaying the sheer terror in not knowing who is human and who isn't. But like most fans, Kurt Russell is the star of the movie and he puts in the best out of all performances because he's able to keep calm.Besides Kurt Russell, another notable part of this film is the overall set design and special effects. There are only a few places where a viewer can tell that it's not real but it won't matter because it will complete the whole picture. As for creature effects, Stan Winston is the main reason why everything worked so well. The gore is absolutely horrendous. It's not like tons of blood are being thrown everywhere but it's not pleasant either. The sounds are just plain icky and imagery is gross. Oddly enough, what impresses me even more, is that by the end of the film, the viewer still won't be able to give a good description of what this creature's original form truly looks like. It really just is, ""the thing"". There's no other way to explain it.The final touch to this film that really strikes fear into most viewers is Ennio Morricone's haunting film score. The instruments that play a big part in each track are the harps, flute, violin and bass notes that repetitively beat in the background. If that kind of music were to be played on a dark night in an alley or dim lit subway, I would feel very uncomfortable. But the reason why it is so much more effective in this setting is because besides the base that is man made, where else can one run? Antarctica is no beach walk. That's the scary part. This movie isn't in it for the jumps and shouts - its goal is to make you feel terrified. A true horror piece.John Carpenter's version of the 1951 film increases the gore, the terror, the musical dynamics and brings in a great cast to boot. Not for the queasy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Enemy Within,"Trust has became a scarce commodity, because of the simple fact we never really know a person, because in reality it's impossible to know a person fully, there is just always something to hide.This film is my favorite film from my favorite movie director John Carpenter as well as my favorite horror film and favorite films in general. The film really helped pave the way for the way we look at most horror and suspense films but also was an inspiration for video games like ""Dead Space"", parts of ""Resident Evil"". It's also a prime example of a remake when done the right way, don't get me wrong I like the 1950's film it's good in it's own way but I love the 80's version more because of just that being good in it's own way, a way I just like the most.There is so much I really love about this film, I love the creature effects from one of my favorite make up/effect artists Rob Boltin as well as the late great Stan Winston. I liked seeing the dolperganger alien whenever it pops out it just seems to always transform into whatever the heck it's suppose to look like, it just seems to be a mixture of things, their slightly inspired by the monster from H.P. Lovecraft's stories which always had bizarre otherworldly monsters.I love the location it really sets up a atmosphere of fear and isolation. The music from Enccio Morone is excellent, it's one of my favorite horror scores ever, the theme song is memorable it just has that evokes the feeling of cold lonely fear. But most importantly it was in the suspense which is the best thing and a common thing with Carpenter.You are just on red alert throughout the whole film, because the danger doesn't let up even in it's peaceful moments. I actually jumped a few times watching this movie and that was a great feeling that I don't get often. Like that infamous blood test scene, I was at edge having both anticipation on who the Thing is but at the same time scared of the possibility of the Thing.You really feel just that sense of paranoia. From the enviorment which feels palpable, just the cold, darkness, and sheer isolation knowledge that these people are in the middle of nowhere and there is no one out there to help because their miles away. There is also the fact that no one can really run or even hide, because you really can't get out of the facility there is nothing out in that envorment to run to, you'll freeze to death in mere minutes. And due to the Thing being anyone along with how small the facility is it leaves few places to really hide. So it leaves you with that sense of doom and dread because of the lack of those options.It's true these characters don't have much depth and you don't get to really know most of them despite some personality on them but that's the point. Even though these characters all live under the same roof you can see their all not really close, and it just goes to show that just because your in the same enviorment doesn't automatically mean all will be friends, it's like with the high school and collage I've been to there are hundreds or almost thousands of people that I pass by or go to class with and barely know a mere fraction of them.Though a couple of characters stand out for me mainly MacReady and Childs played by two favorite actors of mine Kurt Rusell and Keith David. Both just have some of the best lines and both are proactive in the situation, I like how both are scared but their don't wimp out against danger they fight back, let alone that really is the only option available. Let alone both are likable and easy to emphasize with a bit because both are bored and just want to get the heck out of the facility. I don't blame them, I might just go nuts being there to long without a anime convention or girl around that can really suck.The Thing itself it an enigma, we don't really know it's motives or if it even has any. Nor does it seem to have really a true form since it can replicate itself by being viral. I even like how it behaves which makes it feel all the more real, despite primal it's capable of intelligence it was able to fly and tried to rebuild it's spacecraft after all. It's also kinda like a game hunter, the Thing doesn't really do anything at first but you know it will once it's moment comes, the humans it imitates are practically it's camouflage which is it's edge, and what makes it a hard opponent to nail. Did the Thing come from another planet we haven't discovered or may'be another galaxy. Was the alien suppose to be some kinda scout for invasion of Earth or could it of been some sort of bio weapon some alien race created to help destroy Earth's inhabitants. I don't know your theories are as good as mine, but that makes the creature all the more scary.This film was an acknowledgment of cold war paranoia as well as paranoia of disease in the 80's decade but I also feel it's relevant today with our decade with our war on terrorism and chemical weapons/disease epidemics. The main theme is about distrust of our fellow man, how it is not the enemy seen that will destroy people but it is fear of the stranger that becomes our undoing.It's not the enemy that you see that should be fear, it is the enemy unseen.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
My All-Time Favorite in Horror/Sci-Fi,"With the passing of time, I increasingly appreciate the privilege I had in viewing this film on first release at the Cinema. That experience remains implanted in my memory.The only disappointment (at the time) was how quickly the film came and went, with little fanfare and seemingly poor box office receipts.It's gratifying to discover that Carpenter's The Thing has since gathered a well-deserved cult following - proving that I wasn't on my own in appreciating what a masterpiece of horror film making it is.One rarely mentioned aspect that adds credibility (in my view) is the all-male cast. Admittedly, it wouldn't hold up in this day & age, but back then it was a fairly realistic portrayal of Antarctic research stations being almost exclusively male operations. It was a different world back then.The ever-increasing tension between the characters was fantastically well realised. Of course, the groundbreaking special effects are a major part of the experience and contribute to the viewer's rising apprehension as the story unfolds. I feel they still hold up, with arguably greater impact than modern day CGI.Overall this film, along with a select few others (Alien & Aliens come to mind) set the high benchmark for the genre of horror/sci-fi.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
If this isn't my favorite horror/sci-fi film of all time,"It's in my top 3! I have had it on DVD for years, but I'll never forget seeing it when it first came out in the early 1980s. It scared the bejeezus out of me, and to this day after multiple viewings is still chilling (pun intended).I've never been as huge of a fan of John Carpenter as a lot of folks are... I do admire his originality on many films and he is a master at creating an atmosphere of suspense, but this is absolutely his Citizen Kane.You all know the premise, but one area that I really enjoy is the solid character acting. All of the actors (with the exception of Kurt Russell, and he's never done anything better than this) are generally well-regarded and very experienced character actors (many primarily from TV), and they are very believable and just do incredibly professional yeoman-like work. I particularly enjoy Wilford Brimley as the scientist Blair.Also as others as pointed out the HP Lovecraft influences are there, and I feel that perhaps more than any other film captures his style of slow realization of impending doom and otherworldly horror.A rare ""10"" in my book, and is absolutely a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Finest of horror films!,"I had no problem whatsoever giving this horror flick 9 stars. The rating pertaining to the fact that this is, without a doubt, one of the finest sci-fi horror films ever produced. Carpenter takes us on an intense psychological thrill ride that easily stands up to the test of time, as does all great film.Kurt Russell plays the lead role with such relaxed intensity, suffice to say, this has to be his finest performance EVER in a motion picture. Had Kurt over the span of his career procured more roles similar to this he would have easily been considered one of the finest character actors in the history of film, guaranteed.Unfortunately Russell chose such parts as that of 'Captain Ron' or the zaney jack of all trades in 'Overboard'. Sealing his fate as a mediocre comedy actor at best.'The Thing' proves otherwise and leaves us longing for a Kurt Russell RE-DO where Kurt would choose his roles far more carefully in turn leaving us with a legacy rather than a laugh. After viewing Russells stellar performance in this film to say its a crying shame or a case of unrecognized talent... would be an understatement.It must be understood that this film is far more than sci-fi horror it also covers the full gamut of human emotion that takes place when one is cast into a hopeless and desperate situation while being cruelly isolated by uncompromising conditions.John Carpenter, Kurt Russell and the supporting cast(who happen to be magnificent as well) more than achieve their goal of 'bringing us there' with an intensity only such classics as 'Alien' could possibly boast.This film was not given its due by critics upon release. However I would be willing to bet since that time many producers-directors of horror and psychological thriller alike have used it as a scale by which to measure their work.Considered a cult classic. Be sure to rent(or buy) the revised version. Don't expect modern day special FX to carry this one (oh no this film is far too good for that!). Its the stellar acting, isolated settings and interesting storyline that bring this one to life. By far some of the best acting in horror film history. Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Greatest piece of Cinema ever made,"""The Thing"" is the first movie to truly terrify me as a child. I grew up watching Predator and Terminator, but this was different. It wasn't the creature, or the idea of being taken over that frightened me, it was the atmosphere. The film has a sense of isolation and fear that no movie has ever come close to. All of the characters take their roles very seriously and you feel as if you are alone with them in Antarctica.

John Carpenter's best,"""The Thing"" is John Carpenter's best movie. Merging his talents for tension building and shocks with decent production values he turned out a perfectly crafted sci fi / horror movie.By filming in truly difficult conditions he creates a very believable isolated research base which sets the tension before anything has even happened. The ensemble cast work well together with Kurt Russell proving a charismatic leading man even under all that beard.By building the tension slowly with moments of gory horror (courtesy of effects meister Rob Bottin - currently directing Freddy vs Jason) Carpenter creates a movie that has rarely been matched. Considering this came out the same year as ET it could not be more different!Worth a watch / rewatch. 9 out of 10.p.s. the DVD is excellent.

It has a good, suspenseful story, great acting from interesting characters, and even better special effects. There are some moments in the movie that still make my skin crawl. The best aspect of The Thing is that it seems very realistic. The characters look and act like real people would if they were thrust into this situation. It also withstands the test of time. In my opinion, it is still the scariest and most realistic horror movie I have seen.This is the only movie I would give a rating of 10.

Lacks the creepiness of the 1951 version but nevertheless it's a fantastic visual ride,"The staff of an Antarctic research post discover that an extraterrestrial is around that can replicate any living thing.  It's powers are extraordinary and the staff find themselves in a fight for survival.This remake of the classic Howard Hawks film `The Thing From Another World' takes the guts of that story - improves some things but loses others. Obviously the film greatly improves the special effects and frights provided by James Arness in 1951, however it does so at the loss of some of the suspense of the original.  This still has a great feeling of paranoia about it that filters through everything.  The story is basic but it has plenty of chills at the start, but once the effects start we see everything and it's more gross than chilling.That's not to say the effects aren't good.  They still look good now - despite being 20 years old!  It's telling of how much work went into this to reflect that effects wizard Rob Bottin was checked into hospital with exhaustion once the movie was finished.The cast are all pretty good.  Russell is a good lead, although this is more of an ensemble piece than a star vehicle.  The cast are gradually whittled down until they reach the ending that is not only downbeat but subtle and intelligent.  It's flawed if you think about it too much but it works really well after so much gore.Overall it'll never have the classic status of the original but it is definitely a good example of a modern sci-fi that is almost as good as Alien in terms of atmosphere and thrills.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

An under looked horror classic that puts contemporary horror movies to shame,"Denounced as a forgettable Alien ripoff by most critics upon release, (A frankly unfair claim considering the only thing the two films share in common are isolated settings and a murderous alien that infects people) , The Thing, is a remarkably well made sci-fi horror film, that is nether too thoughtless and gratuitous or too pretentious and inaccessible the twin pits of cinematic failure that all too many horror movies fall victim to. The effects while aged by today's standards hold up well and in some cases remind us all that sometimes good oldfashioned conventional effects, plus good editing and directing can surpass all the computer generated effects in the world, but the real meat and potatoes here is the story telling and the suspense. John Carpenter superbly crafts a story that keeps the audience as off balance as the characters are, by not laying all cards on the table at once and dropping the trump cards in an unassuming timely manner.The setup is well calculated and executed, the all male cast(another point of contention upon many critics at the time of its release used to condemn the film despite the fact that: 1. given the setting it makes perfect sense and 2. It serves a storytelling purpose as it helps to set the mood of the piece), their stark characterizations (we are really only introduced to the characters within the confines of their daily grind and the increasing dire circumstances they find themselves in),and the Antarctic setting all serve to establish a very bleak tone from the get go and as the insidious, amorphous Thing, rears its fearsome shifting forms(quite unexpectedly at times)its gets all the bleaker. But its the Thing's very nature really drives this home. As the Thing can infect and perfectly imitate any organism it comes into contact with, effectively destroying and undermining the ability of the research stations remaining humans to fight and survive as they can neither afford to remain too close to their fellow man nor allow let them out of sight lest they really be a thing. Trust is a commodity they can't afford to have but they cannot hope to survive without it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

the Rob bottin show,"The Thing is a horror SF mix classic that you must have seen at some point in your life , loosely based on the 50's classic (The Thing from Another World) but actually quite a different story.This time the alien can more or less take any form it wants (the perfect imitator)
and the focus is more on: who is real and who is a monster.Kurt Russell plays Macready and is actually by far the best known name of the entire cast,
the rest is relatively unknown.The atmosphere that is created is the strong point of the film, threatening, claustrophobic and distrust among each other, the threatening atmosphere is excellently created by Carpenter's perfect soundtrack, which is very simple but extremely effective.Rob Bottin provided the make-up effects and I don't have to say much about that, with the few resources they had they recorded a few legendary effects,
the chest burst scene is of course the most famous, in short, top creative work and another proof that CGI is in this case inferior

One of the best Horror films ever!,"John Carpenter's The Thing takes the original story ""Who goes there?"" and updates it to the 1980's. However, because of the isolation in the Antarctic, the time could almost be anytime. John Carpenter uses every ounce of his prowess to turn in a creepy, exciting and horrific thriller in which the monster could be anyone or anything. This movie received a lot of bad press because it came out right after E.T. Everyone was looking for a friendly alien at this point and the malevolent shape shifter from this movie was not well received. Well, the hell with those people. In the years that followed, viewers saw this movie pop up on cable and were astounded at the pure genius behind it. This movie was made at a time when there was little or nothing in the way of CGI effect. Each and everyone of the creature effects was constructed out of real stuff by effects expert Rob Bottin. The cast is perfect at every turn and Kurt Russel is bad-ass just like he was in Escape from New York.

It was boring, though the idea was good and special effects too. But still, I didn't like it. Maybe it was the actors, maybe the directing... The dialogs were dull and stupid and the characters too.

A shape-shifting alien, with no clear hope.A creature that mimics the living, and hides within,

No one can be trusted, as suspicion sustains.No weapon or tool is enough to stop this foe,

""The Thing"" never stops, it just goes down.A horror classic that will never grow old,
A disturbing masterpiece, with a story that's bold.As the credits roll, we're left with a bitter reminder,

Outstanding - the greatest alien horror film ever,"I first saw this film accidentally when they showed it on TV and I was up far too late... I really lucked out there though. It's truly incredible; from the location (as isolated as it's possible to be on this planet; it made ""the abyss"" look like ET in the council swimming pool), through the interesting characters (Keith David is especially good as the reactionary Childs -""What if we're wrong about him?"" - ""Then we're wrong."") and the effects (more yucky than Alien).Moreover, however, the real tension and fear in the film has nothing to do with the effects. It's the people you start being scared of; knowing that one of them may - or may not be - ""All they appear to be"". It's certainly got the feel of ""who goes there?"".The soundtrack is great; it really plays up the isolation, fear, and gravity of the situation.Finally, the epilogue scene really, really cuts.

One of the best (and most influential) horror movies of all time,"There is no question about it, THE THING is one of the best horror movies ever made.  This film is the culmination of director John Carpenter's talents; a truly horrific tale that will keep you up at night.An isolated Antarctic research station is the site of the film, where a skeleton crew of biologists and researchers find that a shape shifting alien is among them.  No one can trust anyone as the monster purposely pits the men against one another.The monster is downright scary to look at, and monster creators Stan Winston and Rob Bottin uses their special effect skills to the max.  Kurt Russell is in top form as the voice of reason (or the closest thing you can find to one in this place of terror).  Keith David and Wilford Brimley are also excellent standouts in this talented cast.Ignore the fact that the film originally bombed at the box office; that was due to E.T. opening before it and changing the image of aliens into a more family friendly appeal.  I have never seen another film that has captured paranoia so well.  This truly is one of the finest films the horror genre has ever produced, and you can tell by how many times is ripped-off (THE RELIC, DEEP RISING, VIRUS, etc) that it is highly influential.If you haven't seen it, you're missing one of the finest scary movies ever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

One of the best horror films of the last millennium,"Watching John Carpenter's The Thing, I was reminded of how good a filmmaker he used to be.  In the 1970's John brought us Assault on Precinct 13, Elvis and one of the most profitable and copied films of all time, Halloween.  In the 1980's he was involved with no less than 8 films including Escape from New York, The Fog, Big Trouble in Little China and Starman.  However, it was his 1982 release of The Thing that is most revered in the new millennium and now it is re-mastered and re-issued on home DVD.Based loosely on the original 1951 film, Thing From Another Planet, John Carpenter set out to remake the film keeping only a few of the original ideas in tact.  To ensure success, John assembled an A-list of B-list stars including Wilfred Brimley, Keith David, Richard Mauser and Richard Dysart and circled them around best friend Kurt Russell (Escape from L.A.) in an isolated compound in the Arctic.The film begins with an encounter with a Norwegian group of men who are trying to shoot and destroy a dog from their helicopter.  The chopper is soon destroyed and the Norwegian killed, so Kurt (Mac) and the others set out to discover the origin of their visitors.  Upon arrival at the Norwegian camp, they discover dead frozen bodies and a block of ice that seems to have transported something to the compound.  Outside, they find the burned remains of a creature that has human-like qualities and they inevitably bring this hideous piece of flesh and bone back for examination.It's not long before the dog they took in exposes itself to the group as an alien lifeform that can take on the identity of another being, and soon one by one, the humans become victims and hosts to the alien's intentions.Shot almost 23 years ago, I am amazed at how the special effects still hold up today.  The creature effects by Roy Arbogast (Jaws, Return of the Jedi), have not been bettered by new technology and the scene where Norris (Charles Hallahan) has his chest collapse and literally loses his head and we watch it grow spider legs and run out of the room, is as potent and memorable as John Hurt's creature birth in the original Alien.This movie had a lot of things going against it in 1982.  It had a cast that consisted of only men (not one woman appears in the film), it had effects deemed too gory for the times and most importantly, it was released the same year as Steven Speilberg's cute alien movie E.T.  However, where E.T. ,upon present day viewing, shows signs of dating and blue screen special effects, The Thing continues to show like it was made just yesterday with precision and craftsmanship.  The movie has a sense of claustrophobia and urgency and its end, which is far from Hollywood typical, might leave room for a sequel possibility, but not with the same cast of characters.  I also appreciated that John Carpenter did not fall prey to the typical horror film ending that we are now so accustomed, where just when you think it is all over, the killing entity gets one last cheap fright out of the audience.The 90's and post 2000 have not been kind to Mr. Carpenter.  He has directed such stinkers as Ghosts of Mars and Escape to L.A. and Body Bags, and John's reluctance to work under the Hollywood umbrella of a major studio and budget now show with his cheesy effects and locations.  However, he and Kurt Russell can look back proud to the summer of 1982 when they put one of the best horror films in history on celluloid.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Possibly the best remake ever,"The Thing is a truly terrifying movie that holds up extremely well over the years due to the incredibly innovative work of FX man Rob Bottin. Bottin proves in this film that great prosthetics, puppetry, and automation are superior to CGI in terms of producing profound horror for the viewers. There are so many moments in this film that will leave your jaws on the floor even after the 4th, 5th, and 6th viewing. Complementing Bottin's stellar effects work is a strong cast, masterful editing, and superb, suspenseful directing by John Carpenter. While the movie is definitely a horror film, it delightfully morphs, at times, into a great ""whodunnit"" murder mystery with many shocking twists. The erosion of trust between the main characters and the chaos this creates is pulled off wonderfully by Carpenter. Throw in a super creepy score, a great opening and closing sequence and you've got a horror classic. Look for some solid character acting from the great Keith David and Wilford Brimley, as well as a gritty, dark turn from Kurt Russell as the lead.

Classic Carpenter,"Aaah...The Thing.To see a horror film in which not only is every character over the age of thirty, but distinctly UNattractive, makes a refreshing change, and reminds me of those distant times when actors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters, rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over-styled parodies. And there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending, or cameo celebrity appearance, or lame pseudo-romantic subplot.And I REALLY miss on-set physical effects; with all those 20 year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics. In the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, An American Werewolf in London, The Thing, The Company of Wolves, A Nightmare on Elm Street...what an era for horror effects! And don't get me started on the death of matte painting. The matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless.What do we have now?

Still squirm-inducing 29 years on,"Isolation. Paranoia. Fear.These are the typical key words used to describe John Carpenter's sci-fi fright-fest 'The Thing'.The standard plot synopsis normally reads; Antartic research team terrorised by shape-shifting alien.What's not so easy to convey is the sense of unease that permeates throughout the movie, from the opening scenes of arctic desolation and that menacing bass-thrum, to the unsettling and downbeat ending.This is genuine, stomach-curdling sci-fi-horror, which effectively translates an ever-escalating sense of fear for the characters amidst the claustrophobic settings of the research base.Little needs to be said of the well-documented special effects, which may still be considered a bar for non-CGI creation, and where acting and pacing are concerned, not a foot is wrongly placed.It's not without some consideration that I award this film a top score, for even today, having watched it recently, I'm still gripped by the taut atmosphere that veins the whole movie.I can think of no other film that inspires such a sense of foreboding or menace, and very few that deliver on such sudden bursts of visceral bloodshed and outright horror.A true classic for anyone with an interest in being scared.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The Thing Analysis.,"Very good........ I think after 23years I may be close to fully understanding the film. The first to be infected/ imitated is Palmer..... When Nauls is told to turn the music down by Bennings, the suspect dog is looking for a host to hide within. We only see a shadow as he turns to the doorway to see the dog but I'll explain why it has to be Palmer. Until the ""blood testing"" scene Palmer shows no sign of infection, then just as he's blood is about to be tested, he shows the look of ""my game is up""..... he transforms to take Windows and both are destroyed by flame throwers. So how does the Thing remain living? After it takes Palmer it can rely now completely on the diversions of the others' to remain anonymous, no-one suspects that someone else could be imitation (except Blair but not for very long) for he is quickly overtaken... as he analyzes the dogs' remains he unwittingly uses his pencil to point out that ""That's not dog. It looks like dog. But it ain't dog. It's imitation."" Then touches his lips with the same pencil- he has started to transform from that very moment. No- one realises at that time. Blair begins to destroy the camp and shoot up the place to limit the chances of outside contact or escape for anyone, but it doesn't like the Antarctic either and has to leave to survive, and so dismantles the chopper to construct his own means of escape. That is another story how Blair can orchestrate his imprisonment so he can remain alone to engineer plans for departure out of that hostile land in which survival comes from residing in the humans or dogs which are offer no protection at all to the Arctic conditions. Both Man and Thing are equal here. Both have to fight to survive here. Not only the environment but each other to live on........anyway, We see Blair running from the helicopter, then again prior to taking Garry thats it he is part of the 75% he computes at the beginning. The computers..... we know The Chess computer is a cheat? It makes mistakes....can Blairs computer be as unreliable? Think about that one. His ploy is to remain totally unsuspecting to all, whilst destroying the camp, the transport, the blood stocks. He also sets up his only threat, Macready, by placing his torn clothing around the camp, Blair left Macready's cabin light on as well. I have more to discuss about The Thing. The fact it wasn't a hit was because it wasn't a fairytale, where everyone lived happily ever after. It looks like no-one lives even the Thing. No-one won the battle to survive. Or did they/ it? I like to think Macready remains human, he has to be when no-one is left to fight, he still continues to finish off The Thing.... with ""...k you too!"" and some dynamite. But if Childs had seen Blair in the final scenes there is a real chance that when he goes outside to investigate that Blair deals with him there. So Macready is a doomed human destined to be frozen with or as a monster. Regards Marty. P.S John Carpenter offers us a chance to look outside the box and think about what we see.

Everything in the movie is just ""meh"" in my opinion. The dialoge is rather strange, there is a lot of cussing and most of it feels rather misplaced or goes nowhere.
If you take into account that Alien came out 3 years BEFORE this movie, the creature effects are just aweful. Sometimes there are ""okish"", sometimes they are just bad or nonsensical and you often ask yourself: ""Why would the creature do this?"" Or ""Why chose this form?"".
I don't know what else can be said. There are no climaxes, no real surprises, the story is already known, the effects are just bad considering what earlier movies could deliver and the acting is okish at best. If you don't have high standards, don't expect much from a horror movie, this will fill a cold rainy sunday evening, but that's about it.Comparing this to Alien is like comparing Star Wars the original trilogy with ""Message from Space"".This is just plain and simple a mediocre monster horror B-movie from 82.

This masterpiece gets 10/10 hands down. In my book, still unbeatable decades after it's release. I really can't say anything else about this movie. If you haven't seen this classic, and you're tired modern ""horror"" movies, try something different for a change.

Bleak and cold,"Well, another movie that I first enjoyed when I was little. It is indeed among the horror movies that subtly changed my perception of life and death. This and ""The fly"" have emotional values for me; unlike ""The fly"", this one is much rawer and colder. The atmosphere is the opposite of any drama-influenced movies - even the characters are cold and unsympathetic; there's barely any emotion in this movie (and in a good way of course). Extreme paranoia, bleakness, hopelessness and resignation are dominant here. Human psychology is yet again being explored.
Kurt Russell fits perfectly here and it's probably his best performance in his whole movie career - an emotionless and calculated badass that uses logic in order to solve everything.
""The thing"" also proves that CGI does not belong in the horror movie business.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"John Carpenter's ""Thing"" Is No ""Halloween""","The man who showed the world how scary a movie he could make with nothing more than a shoestring budget (""Halloween"" in 1978) demonstrates that less can be more when it comes to making a horror movie that will truly scare you.John Carpenter gets quite a bit more money to throw at the screen and uses it to create all kinds of nifty makeup and creature effects in his 1982 cult classic ""The Thing,"" but it's the movie's quiet early scenes, before anything much is actually happening, that are the most unsettling.""The Thing"" isn't exactly a remake of the 1951 classic ""The Thing from Another Planet,"" though it shares the source material of that film. It's a reinvention and is largely better than the earlier version. Kurt Russell and a group of scientists working at the North Pole become prey to a shape-shifting alien that has the ability to look just like any one of them, and the real tension in the film comes from the mens' increasing inability to trust one another -- after all, who's an alien and who isn't? This adds an effective punch of psychological complexity that was missing from the 1950s version, which presented itself as a straight-up monster movie. In John Carpenter's version, the paranoia and claustrophobia that develops from being trapped in your own worst nightmare are as scary as any of the oogie-boogies running around in the snow.But the film relies too much on its gross-out effects, which no doubt looked state-of-the-art in 1982, but which look silly and dated now. Carpenter didn't take to heart the lesson he taught audiences in 1978 -- that a person's imagination is going to cook up something ten times scarier than anything a filmmaker can actually show you on screen.This is a worthy addition to the horror canon, but its quality has been overrated by fanboys.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

John Carpenter's sci fi/horror masterwork!,"Kurt Russell and John Carpenter collaborate again in this frostbitten masterpiece of extraterrestrial terror. Kurt is the lead and the film contains an excellent ensemble all male cast. In this horror/science fiction story and sausage party, our cast and film makers deliver the goods. They are a twelve man research team in Antarctica and have discovered that a shape shifting alien is capable of imitating anything and infects and imitates its host. If it reaches civilization, it could mean the extinction of all life on planet Earth. The special f/x by Robert Botin are state of the art and truly remarkable. The tone of the film is stark, apocalyptic and dead serious. The atmosphere is cold and tense, enhanced to great effect by Ennio Morricone's brilliant score. Performances by the cast are very solid and another one of my favorite actors Keith David also appears and gives our lead, Kurt some competition as alpha male of the show. Keith David also worked with John Carpenter on They Live, another classic and huge favorite of mine. This was the first film which John Carpenter refers to as his apocalypse trilogy. The three films have nothing to do with one another, but deal with a potential end of the world situation in different ways. The other two films are Prince Of Darkness and In The Mouth Of Madness which are both very good as well. The Thing is one of his best films and you can feel the coldness and isolation as this group of men struggle for survival on this Antarctic glacier.

A masterpiece of horror which rates high against other genre classics too.,"A great film, truly chilling and gruesome, a true work of horror with an element of sci-fi thriller thrown in! I remember this film from my youth and watching it recently I confirmed that that film knowledge (lines, scenes, etc.) never really went away - they just lie dormant in my mind waiting to be reanimated.The minute the film starts events are in motion, all the way through it, right until the second the credits roll. An alien parasite/monster has infected a human host and taken its body, wearing it like a shell or a mask and taken it for a walk. It manages to get into a US run, scientific station in the frozen wasteland of Antarctica. The American scientists are about to get cut off from society due to adverse weather condition - little do they know, of what is trapped in there with them - a shape shifting evil alien that can take on the form of its victims and shapeshift at will. The film primarily uses Kurt Russell as its vehicle and he puts in a great performance, as does the entirety of the cast for that. Stuck in a remote location with an unknown killer they all come across as authentic.The strength of this film has been proven time and time again. During the year it was released it bombed, people were more interested in ""E.T."" and nicer films. Fast forward ten years - this film still has a following, and it's grown too. Fast forward another ten years and yet more fans and followers, and the film is still adored. If film is art and all good artists are looking for their one masterpiece, then this cult film has to be John Carpenter's masterpieces. The chilling synth soundtrack, works, it's spooky and more so - with the film emerging the viewer in the action, its believable to think hat this is the only musical score we have access to when locked away in the Antarctica.When I started writing this reviews I swore that I'd never give a ten out of ten because that would indicate perfection, and to my knowledge and beliefs there are always things that could improve - with everything. This film however, pushes that believe to the limit. In its horror genre this scores damn high, when compared to films in other genre's too - this still scores highly! I'm going to write 9 out of 10 - but then I'm going to have to run away and take some deep breaths as this pushed my rating rationale to the limit. It may even have broken me for today - Film fans, you cannot go wrong watching this classic masterpiece - it still stands tall nearly 40 years later!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Right Movie at the wrong time.,"Back in the mid 70s into the early 80s, John Carpenter was making a great name for himself doing independent films such as Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween, The Fog, and Escape from New York. It was only a matter of time when a big studio was going to jump on the ""JC"" wagon. In comes John Carpenter's Thing. His most ambitious project possibly to date.The movie was amazing, although it was loosely...key word loosely, a remake, you wouldn't even notice. It's a completely different beast from the 1950's version. It plays more on the tension of atmosphere, betrayal, mistrust, oh and really remarkable special effects for it's time. Just one problem.... It came out a week after Steven Spielberg's E.T. The thing was unfortunately a flop at the box office. If only it were release at a different time, I think it would have really boosted up John Carpenter's career greater.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Traumatized me as a child,"This is definitely one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.  Even with the now outdated special effects, it has enough momentum to send grown men fleeing from the living room.

A group of researchers are stationed in the Artic and come across an unworldly presence which has been dug up from years of dormancy beneath the ice.  The acting is really superb and the starkness of the surrounds really sets the tone of mistrust between the characters.

The Thing Reviewed in 2011,"Is the strangest thing I have ever seen! John Carpenter's sci-fi horror film about a mutant molecular cell that once it comes into contact of any living entity manifests itself, transforming and imitating the original DNA of that being. 'The Thing' as it becomes known is capable of assuming the physical and mental characteristics of anyone it chooses or to put it simply, an alien life form in disguise! Many top critics have missed the mark in their reviews of this film, although most being from when it originally came out. The public nonetheless knows a classic when they see one and that's why this film has developed such a long legacy and rightly so. The story is plausible if a little thin at times but the continuous 'guessing game' of who is infected keeps the viewer on edge, building up to a wonderfully tense moment in the film I like to call, 'the blood test'.This is the first time I have watched this film and what is great is that even by today's high standard of modern technology, the special effects are smashing and holds strong within today's market. The aliens are designed brilliantly, totally realistic (if that's possible with aliens?!) and gross out scary. I felt at times nauseated but that is the hallmark of this movie's intent. Everything from the opening credits to stage sets is very artistically designed so any remake of this remake would be very hard to beat in terms of creativity and visuals.Where the film slightly disappoints is emotionally, with little viewer-character sympathy. I didn't really feel any empathy towards any of the guys involved however I could definitely understand their feelings of paranoia in the 'who to trust' scenario. Also, as there are no females cast in the film, women viewers may find caring about the characters hard to come by. Having said this, the movie does achieve its main aim, which is to provide the horror and not character development. There is no bad acting only stereotypes which some people dislike but Kurt Russell as Mac does a fine job.When a solitary movie has an 'open' beginning and unclosed ending like this, the viewer is left with intrigue and wanting more which always is a good sign. Yet nowadays everybody wants to have trilogies and quadrilogies settling for quantity rather than quality. So it's not surprising that I have read there is a prequel & sequel in the pipeline, with the latter being undertaken by John Carpenter. Sometimes trilogies can be good, wrapping everything up nicely, filling the hunger, and as the possible sequel will contain the same team- I'm hoping they will look at this film as the stepping stone, correct the weaknesses and raise the bar. However the one thing that is for sure, no matter how many transformations The Thing takes on...this... is where it ultimately took hold!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"In Carpenter's Masterpiece, 'Thing's Truly are Seldom What They Seem!","John Carpenter's The Thing is one of those beloved relics of the '80s that was considered a game-changer for creature-features. Viewing the movie thirty years removed from that era, the ideas it presents remain as alarming as ever; this is not a thriller in which ordinary beasts seek to destroy a gathering of unsuspecting victims, but one in which they take on the traits of earthly organisms and walk among them as part of a convincing ruse to adapt to a new foreign environment.Ominously bland shots of the Antarctic profile introduce us to R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell), a pilot with an American research crew who, along with a gathering of other morose men, is about to be involved in one hell of a tricky predicament. The marvelously disconcerting prologue suggests so, of course, as a handsome Alaskan malamute (with a little more sobriety than typically seen in dogs) gallops across the Antarctic tundra, a nearby helicopter full of eager Norwegians pursues it, hoping to shoot the animal dead in its tracks. That grim pursuit takes them right into the base of the American researchers, who respond with confounding resistance. An explosion and an assassination later, the American crew takes the dog in, only to discover too late that appearances can be deceptive. It turns out that the dog is indeed the alien creature that has assumed the guise of a dog. It soon proceeds to infiltrate the unsuspecting crew members of the camp, and the good guys try to figure out which of them may have been compromised.Throughout the course of the movie, a lot of terrible things happen to this ensemble of characters while the monster in its fuzzy new form snuggles up to its fresh banquet of victims. What it does is the unthinkable: consume people and then essentially take on their characteristics, allowing them to move undetected amongst others. When this knowledge is shared with the scientists, ensuing hysteria overwhelms their need for survival, and inevitably the movie becomes a cat-and-mouse game in which it's not just about how to destroy the fiend, but where to find it and who to trust among the ensemble of wary survivors.Carpenter's thriller is a masterful exercise in claustrophobic suspense, far superior to other sloppy efforts that have saturated the market with a relentless supply of bloodthirsty monsters jumping out from the shadows: a peerless masterpiece of retina-wrecking visuals (with remarkable special effects). Carpenter capitalizes on the dramatic possibilities inherent in the contrast between the cramped interiors of the station and the vast expanse of the wintry landscape outside. He uses this disparity to amazing effect to create an atmosphere of testosterone-fueled paranoia. The strong cast brings the somewhat underwritten characters to vivid life.Though are eyes are horrified and our hearts often unsettled, we watch on as if hypnotized by an unfolding nightmare from which there is no turning away!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Classic Cold War Science Fiction,"As a teenager, seeing this movie in the theater in 1982, I was gleefully ecstatic about the gore factor in this movie. The nightmarish body props coupled with artfully selected sound effects put this film solidly in the ""hard R"" category -- and my younger brother and my cousin's squeamish reactions bore that out. Unfortunately, at the time, the critics couldn't see past this, and The Thing was panned and then forgotten.But 20+ years later, the violence scale has slipped enough that when you get past the ooze and the blood and the ripping teeth, you're left with a model of paranoia-packed, ""who-can-you-trust?"" invasion-type Sci-Fi. The cast's performances and the taut dialogue really string you out then leave you hanging -- in a great way. And Ennio Morricone's understated score perfectly seals the deal. Carpenter should have called him up when he started production of ""The Mouth of Madness.""If you're looking for a good Cold War alien yarn, and you want something a little harder-edged than ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" but didn't enjoy the remake, give ""The Thing"" a spin.

The Thing (9/10),"In numerous interviews John Carpenter has pointed to Howard Hawks as his favorite director, so it comes no surprise that he wanted to pay homage to his film ""The Thing from Another World"". Thus, Carpenter directed The Thing, alongside a stellar team behind the scenes that include Rob Bottin (special effects) and Ennio Morricone (music). Kurt Russell stars as the stoic R.J. MacReady, a scientist stationed in remote Antarctica. The setting, Antarctica, has really never been seen in a horror film, so with all the snow and cold, it provided a great hopeless dark atmosphere. The cast around Russell were also suburb with all delivering great written dialog.

Excellent. One of the best films of John Carpenter.,"Carpenter's 'The Thing' is a remake of the 1951 film 'The Thing from Another World' produced by Howard Hawks, a classic horror film which did not lose its intensity and appeal, even after so many years.The story is about the men of an American arctic base (scientists and other personnel) who witness an invasion from a extraterrestrial being (The Thing). The scenario is based on the story 'Who Goes There?' by J.W. Campbell. The story line is similar in both movies with the men fighting for their lives inside a claustrophobic and remote environment.Nonetheless, a number of differences between the two movies are evident. Hawk's film is fast-paced and events unfold around a people versus 'monster' story. Carpenter's film, instead, is slower and takes its time to develop. Carpenter also creates a strong disbelief and suspicion that the person you see is not what he appears to be. The 'Thing' is a foe who attacks from the 'interior' and not from the 'exterior'. The men in the base are more vulnerable and their fight is more desperate. Special effects are simply amazing and show us the alien being in a grotesque and horrifying manner that the human mind cannot easily comprehend. And that's precisely the problem: it takes time for humans to understand the nature of the extraterrestrial threat. A 10/10 from me.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The great horror called The Thing!,"The best thing about the thing is that the thing can look like any living thing. John Carpenter's 'The Thing' is the best scifi-horror movie after Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. I haven't seen any other film by Carpenter but now I am keen as 'The Thing' portrays his talent exponentially. The amount of suspense that gets built here is monumental and that's the ace-point of the film.The film is set entirely in Antarctica where the researchers encounter a strange alien creature called 'The Thing' that can mimic any living thing.It kills the person it copies before taking the form. The cold and isolated location on Antarctica where the events take place induces the scary atmosphere. The music is even more haunting. There is lot of gore so have a strong stomach. Seriously, the detailing is too much. There are many moments in the film where no one has any idea whom the thing has mimicked and the suspense is at its peak.The only major problem with the film is that its doesn't induce varied characterization. There are 12 researchers and none of them stands out among the rest.I don't mean the acting was bad which by the way was excellent, but all of them have similar expression there is no unique character.Also some more interesting sub-plot development was possible which I would liked more, anyways the film is kept tight.The Thing is a must-watch for horror fans and rest can also give it go if they can handle the gore.RATING:[4/5]",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Finally saw the uncut version - oh my God, what have I been missing out on!","The other day I finally saw an uncut version of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". I had had no idea what I had been missing out on. This movie has up and away the best special effects that have been created during the 80's! The best thing, though, is that ""The Thing"" also has an interesting story to back up the gory moments.Even more so than its elder brother ""Alien"", John Carpenter's movie creates a tension of suspense that has yet to be rivaled by a similarly themed sci-fi/horror-movie. Up until the very end the director makes great usage of the basic premise that a monster from outer space can disguise itself by taking on the form of any living being. The movie is tense and tight all the time and with Kurt Russell it's got a badass-hero, too. Still, Carpenter never falls into the trap of making any of the characters in the movie a stereotypical cliché of the 80's like so many later flicks who stole from ""The Thing"" would. There is almost no moment here where you can only shake your head because of the obvious stupidity of some of the characters' actions.So, having seen the real, the untouched version of ""The Thing"" I have to say that I think this is John Carpenter's best movie and one of the most effective horror movies of the 80's period.

A claustrophobic and grotesque cult classic,"The Thing is an intelligent blend of sci-fi and horror which is now a cult classic.This is about a group of scientists working in Antarctica. Eventually they find a husky which appears to be infected with something far sinister which begins to spread.The movie's main focus is its special effects. Despite the fact that they are over 30 years old, they still look just as grotesque and disturbing today as they did back in 1982. Because of the special effects, several scenes have become iconic. The most famous one being the chest defibrilator scene which was really unexpected.The movie shows us how the scientists quickly turn on each other after they discover that the thing can look like any one of them. The viewer keeps pointing fingers throughout the film and it's a surprise every time one of them is revealed to be infected.The movie's ending is ambiguous and it has inspired a lot of discussions and debates in social media sites. Its ending leaves plenty of room for re-watching the film to look for clues you might have missed your first viewing. I'm not going to spoil anything but it is quite a shocker.The tension is cranked up more since the characters are cut off from the outside world. This concept was borrowed by ""Alien"" and it heavily influenced ""Aliens"". Unfortunately, this movie failed at the box office probably since it was released 2 weeks after ""E.T.

Kurt Russell and others are on a scientific outpost there when they come upon some remains of something they can't quite identify.As I said it's not the plant man of the first film. Instead it's like a parasite invading the human or at first canine hosts which are the expedition's sled dogs.

The example of what a remake should be,"I never watched the original and didn't know that this movie was a remake until years after I watched it. I watched this when I was 9 so I had a different perspective of it than I did when I was in my mid-30s. I must admit some of the graphics it didn't age very well but that's only because of the development of CGI which has caused this genre of movie to go far beyond what it could have in the early 80s.It's set in Antarctica during winter over, when you can't leave because the weather is too bad to get in or out. There is a group of men at a science station with some dogs which I assume are for sledding. A dog runs into their encampment from the Norwegian camp next door. They take it in but it turns into something else and the men think they've killed it but have not. The figure out that its alive and can vary in form and take on the form of one of them. They decide to try and ferret out the alien by using a blood test which was successful (and iconic).While this movie does violate my rule of movies in that a movie should have a beginning, middle and end, this movie doesn't have an end (it just stops) but I didn't mind it. I'm not sure why, I guess because I watched it and decided I liked it back in 1982 so I'm allowed to pardon movies I like.Should you watch this, yes, knowing that the 2017 remake (prequal?) is a remake of a remake and that this movie, what ahead of its time at the time it was made.

A Chilling Masterpiece,"The film ""The Thing"" by John Carpenter made a powerful impression on me. It's not just a horror movie; it's a true atmosphere of paranoia and distrust, where every character seems suspicious. Carpenter masterfully creates a sense of isolation: the desolate Antarctica, the cold, and the absolute unknown.I was especially impressed by the practical effects-they are done by hand and look scarier than modern CGI. Every time ""The Thing"" revealed itself, I was left with chills. The film not only scares you but also makes you think about how easily trust can be shattered.

Great Horror film,"*Chilling Masterpiece:
John Carpenter's 1982 sci-fi horror classic, The Thing, remains an unparalleled masterpiece of suspense and terror. This cinematic behemoth has captivated audiences for decades, solidifying its place as one of the greatest horror films of all time.*Unsettling Atmosphere and Tension*From the opening scenes, Carpenter masterfully crafts an eerie atmosphere, plunging viewers into the frozen vastness of Antarctica. The Thing's setting, a remote research station, becomes a character in itself, amplifying the sense of isolation and vulnerability. As the story unfolds, Carpenter's direction expertly ratchets up tension, making every creaking door, every eerie sound effect, and every character's nervous glance feel ominous.*Groundbreaking Practical Effects*Rob Bottin's groundbreaking practical effects hold up remarkably well even today. The Thing's creature designs, particularly the iconic ""Thing"" itself, are both terrifying and mesmerizing. These effects not only revolutionized the horror genre but also continue to inspire filmmakers. The seamless integration of practical and makeup effects creates an unsettling sense of realism, making the creatures' appearances all the more chilling.*Gripping Storyline*Based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s 1938 novella ""Who Goes There?"", Carpenter's adaptation remains faithful to the original while introducing his own twists. The story follows a group of researchers at Outpost 31, who discover an alien entity that can assimilate and perfectly imitate living beings. As the team tries to contain the threat, paranoia and mistrust spread, leading to a desperate fight for survival. The Thing's narrative is expertly paced, balancing action, suspense, and character development.*Strong Ensemble Performances*
Kurt Russell shines as R. J. MacReady, the rugged and resourceful leader of the group. His performance is matched by an impressive ensemble, including Wilford Brimley, T. K. Carter, and Keith David. Each character brings their own distinct personality to the story, making their eventual fates all the more heart-wrenching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Nearly scuttles itself in the first ten minutes,"Absolute classic, but it starts off cheesy, right from the title sequence.Showing the flying saucer right at the beginning gives the wrong expectation of the plot. But worse, a ""flying saucer"" was incredibly cliched in 1982, even more than now. But far worse, it looks like the Jupiter 2!The second big problem is the Norwegians after landing the chopper. It gets borderline slapstick. Tossing the grenade back instead of the pin, destroying the chopper. Then the Norwegian marches through the camp and is shot, again in a slapsticky way.I get the idea, it's to show the Norwegians have lost their minds for some unknown reason. To me, it seems like the Norwegians following and shooting at the dog from the chopper quite effectively conveys this. I don't get paid the big picture bucks, but I would have had the chopper never land (they are terrified of the dog) and they just scream at the Americans as the dog runs to them when they start petting and protecting it. Then, the chopper crashes for some reason.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"You don't just hand out 10s to merely ""really good"", but to what you consider as legendary!","This is (hands down) my absolute favorite horror film of all time. The day I'd get to watch a new horror top The Thing, would be a day to celebrate.I almost never hand out 1s or 10s. I find it ridiculous when I see people handing out 1/10 while they still can name things they liked in the movie or 10/10 while finding several flaws, but still like it more than most movies.I admit, that if I'd watched The Thing for the first time in the present, I'd probably not go for a 10/10. But I still remember the impression it made on me in my younger years and I still feel that same vibe every time I rewatch it. Sure, newer horrors with better VFX has come out ever since, but they've all lacked to a greater or lesser degree of The Thing's soul. The actors, the setting, the psychological aspect of the horror and its story still holds up perfectly. As much as it's based on the book Who Goes There by John W. Campbell, there are lots of Lovecraftian elements added to the horror. This movie is as much a creature flick and a psychological horror as it is a sci-fi horror, and even though the movie The Mouth Of Madness was the more obvious love letter from Carpenter to Lovecraft, The Thing still feels a lot closer to the ""cosmic horror"" aspect of Lovecraft's dark world. I don't have problem's with remakes in general (I don't count John Carpenter's The Thing as a remake, since the movie that came out before The Thing was extremely loosely based on Campbell's book), but I really dread for the day they remake this one. I'd rather see them use the raw footage from this one and only remake the visuals that might feel outdated these days. I still think the VFX work well enough even to date, considering the The Thing is just as old as I am.

Outdated,I watched this because it was on Amazon video for Halloween.

I also find it very strange that there are zero women in this film considering women of been a part of Antarctica expeditions for very long time. Kurt Russell must've been very popular at the time but he really didn't add anything to this movie and what was the dorky hat he was always wearing that would provide zero warmth in those conditions..

"Effectively Creepy and Intense, Carpenter's Antarctic Alien Attack was Unappreciated in its Day","It's surprising, in retrospect, that The Thing wasn't better received by contemporary reviews. Granted, it faced unusually stiff theatrical competition in E. T. and Blade Runner, both less than two weeks old, which certainly stole a great deal of its thunder. At the hour of The Thing's opening, Spielberg's family-friendly blockbuster had already established a popular, positive outlook on alien relations (basically the antithesis of The Thing's overwhelming nihilism), while Ridley Scott's sci-fi opus was exploring equally bleak tones and mature, ambiguous themes. There's no room for three films to coexist at the top, particularly ones with such similarities. Public sentiment agreed that John Carpenter's small-scale saga of a fierce, faceless extraterrestrial attack in the Antarctic desolation couldn't hold a candle. Fortunately, hindsight has been more forgiving.What a ride this is. Carpenter leans hard on the suspense, skillfully employing the locale's smothering isolation as amplification in much the same way Scott did with Alien, just a few years prior. The nature of the beast, as an invisible, corrupting force, is a brilliant device for this type of story. Nobody's safe and nobody can be trusted, not even oneself. Late in the crisis, when the team has finally developed a reliable blood test, that fear is palpable. We can see it in their widened eyes and held breath: what if I'm already infected? Their uncertainty intensifies our own, heightening tensions to unbearable levels. In this, Carpenter teaches a master class, and the payoff - a series of lumpy, repulsive creature effects from Rob Bottin - are worth the price we pay. When the alien mass sprouts from its living host, the results are car-crash grotesque, all melted flesh and unnatural deformity. Appropriately powerful and haunting, alien but also eerily familiar, they shock and disgust, every single time.There's no two ways about it: this is a classic. An intelligent, potent, thrilling example of science fiction and horror that's right up there with the best of each genre. Tragic that the poor initial reception had such a negative impact on Carpenter's career.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Wonderfully crafted spine tingling movie.,"I created an account just to share my love for this movie, after all it single-handedly got me interested in John Carpenter's movies. Definitely my favorite horror of all time. This movie hits the nail on the head for so many things, the scare factor, the ambiguity leaving the watcher needing to think about the movie afterwards, the amazing chilling practical effects, the isolation and atmosphere, the amazing soundtrack playing at all the right moments expressing dread, the paranoia, the list goes on. I have never left a movie feeling the same way that this movie does. My favorite one of the things this film does wonderfully would be the ambiguity. I engaged in many theory videos and did some thinking on my own as well, but people such as Bob Ager had much better theories than anything I could come up with. This uneasiness, distrust, and uncertain feeling the movie displays is truly what makes it scary, on top of those terrifying practical effects which I love so much. The threat of The Thing being larger than life was also a very engaging aspect, making it even more truly scary. After seeing many movies of the same type, The Thing always takes the cake. Everyone involved in this film did wonderfully, and although nothing is ever perfect, this movie is damn near perfect FOR ME.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"A classic with its practical visual effects, great influence on similar works, its atmosphere of tension and for bringing a narrative that so well develops its conflicts","""The Thing"" (1982) is one of the greatest classics of the sub-genre of science fiction called Cosmic Horror, and one of the most acclaimed works of director John Carpenter. It can be considered at the same time a remake of The Arctic Monster (1951) and a readaptation of the short story Who Goes There? (1938) by John W. Campbell, the screenplay by Bill Lancaster follows an American research station in Antarctica that is threatened by a strange alien parasitic species that assimilates living organisms and imitates them, creating an exact copy of it, thus generating an atmosphere paranoid of who is really human among those men.The film follows a group of twelve men in the remote Station 4 of the US National Institute of Science. After they shoot down a Norwegian helicopter that was trying to kill a dog, pilot J. R MacReady (Kurt Russell) offers to travel to the other base and try to find out what was going on. Upon arriving at the scene, he realizes that an alien capable of transforming into an exact copy of its victims is among them and everyone could be a possible threat.Allied to this, the director had a competent team that helped create the entire suspense scenario that the film carries since the beginning. Starting with the soundtrack by Ennio Morricone, which opens the film by introducing the tone of the story. The beat of the synthesizers, which soon mixes with the noise of the helicopter, helps to create a feeling of strangeness. When the public realizes what the shooter has in his sights, the mood is not one of action, but that something is wrong. This union between diegetic and non-diegetic sound, extends throughout the narrative, keeping the tension always high.The Thing is characterized almost as an exercise in genre, and naturally does very well in that sense with the sure direction of John Carpenter. There is no concern in developing most of his characters, since we see MacReady (Russell) from the beginning of the plot assuming the exclusive prominence of the story, when in the first sequence he is seen isolated from the rest of his team, and we realize his impulsive behavior, but also leadership, as basically none of the other men question his actions or his orders. Thus, the deficiency in the characterization of those people would not generate the well-known identification in the viewer, however, this is not what happens, since the script ends up betting well on the construction of paranoia and fear, curiously giving each character the same importance in given moment of the movie, since anyone can be the thing.The screenwriter Bill Lancaster's (""The Bad News Bears"") goal was to work the chaos - he wastes no time in building the conflict, which starts to affect everyone with just a few minutes of production - and to bring a minimum of depth while the plot. Advances. If it works on the one hand, it also makes none of the deaths-except that of the dog-have any more significant importance. The atmosphere of paranoia owes a lot to Dean Cundey's setting work. The filmmaker's well-known cinematographer - they had previously worked together on ""Escape from New York"", ""The Fog"" and ""Halloween"" - it is he who transforms the research base into a cramped and claustrophobic environment. The corridors narrow with the camera angles, and towards the last act they look more and more like a maze. In addition, close-ups help create the feeling that danger can be anywhere. Even with the dark corners continually appearing, Cundey doesn't hide the being, showing just how horrible the threat is.And it is precisely the creature that holds the visual tension of the film. The creation of then-rookie Rob Bottin, the monster is the essence of H. P. Lovecraft, which matches the film's aesthetic. The scene in which one of the team members is sucked into the belly of a contaminated companion put Bottin's name in the circle of special effects stars - in the following years he would start a partnership with Paul Verhoeven and be responsible for the makeup of ""Seven"". Here, he manages to synthesize evil as something that cannot be defined and helps the characters' continuous feeling of delirium.The film addresses themes of subjectivity and human relationship in a genre film. Films that, even using a usual theme that is invasion and alien possession, were not what people were looking for in cinema in 1982, the year of their release. In fact, the slasher was at its peak, with sequels to ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Friday the 13th"", films that were sensational at the time and were not concerned with existential questions. The film was not successful at the box office and with critics in the year it was released, largely because of the changes made by the director in view of the first adaptation of the short story, ""The Thing from Another World"", an American film from 1951. In the same year ""E. T"" was released, a much more commercial and family-oriented film, which ended up helping to take the focus off Carpenter's work. In 1982 Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" was also released, another film without much repercussion at the time, and, like ""The Thing"", gained a survival when released in the home video industry and today is worshiped by those who dare to watch.In the opening credits we see a spaceship crashing on a planet that looks like Earth, the date on which this happens is not specified. Right in the foregrounds, we are set in the snowy immensity of the desolate Arctic. We managed to have a very precise definition of space, this is important because this isolated environment will be essential in creating the feeling of despair and hopelessness that the film gives us. The director uses shots that lend themselves to showing the environment, and aligned with a dark and unusual soundtrack composed by Ennio Morricone, but with great influence from John Carpenter's synth horror, we have already identified this space as a threat in itself.The atmosphere of tension and discomfort that the soundtrack gives us takes on another dimension from the moment we get to know the characters who work at the station. The camera several times uses the dog - which was being chased in the opening credits - as a narrative tool following the premises and helping with the development of some characters. Even with the montage giving us a docile air of the animal, we remain apprehensive and questioning due to the initial scene in which the Norwegian helicopter chases it. From the initial incident, Windows (Thomas G. Waites), who appears to be a communications technician, tries to report what happened to the outside world but is unsuccessful. Meanwhile, MacReady (Kurt Russell) and Dr. Blair (Wilford Brimley) go to the Norwegian station in an attempt to get answers. They come across the abandoned and destroyed station. In a certain room they find a holed glacier, and soon determine that something may have come out of it. Among the bodies found, there is a strange, bizarre humanoid creature, here we can see an explicit example of how body horror will be used in the film. They take the disfigured body when they return to the American base, and after an autopsy, it is confirmed that it is a human.The film feeds the feeling of fear until we are introduced to the organism. The purpose of the unusual scene is to shock, whether by gore or gore. Practical and animatronic effects are used in most moments where we really see the creature in its multiple forms and bring some iconic and disturbing scenes to life. In most of the clashes and dialogues, paranoia is placed above the sense of collectivity, this is successfully conveyed by the direction and ambiguous performances. Due to the naturalness and closeness of the characters, we can see that they have been there for some time. But from the moment it is not known where the threat, the urgency and the will to survive the creature will come from, these relationships are put into play.With a very curious central theme - contact with the other can make me sick - and a good exploration of the threat in an environment that should offer security, Enigma from Another World is one of those films that hold us from beginning to end and leaves us horrified in several moments of its projection. The ambiguous ending, another hallmark of the filmmaker, is also present. And here, with a special touch of irony, which concludes without needing to close, opening parallels with the investigation at the beginning in the Norwegian base. The dialogue between MacReady and Childs in front of a bonfire and seeing the station on fire is uncomfortable and to some extent nihilistic. Not knowing which of the two is infected, they decide to wait and see what happens.The Thing is that feature that became a cult. Among its greatest qualities, the idea of a creature without a definitive face is surprising. After all, it manages at the same time to highlight to the viewer the danger and mistrust between all the characters. And when she does appear, her plastic effect of teeth, tails and tentacles is strong enough for a visual horror that bears a strong resemblance to the writings of H. P Lovecraft. Even being a remake of another feature from 1951, The film manages to create its own atmosphere that undoubtedly marks the feature. Also very well for the technical components, such as the direction and the closed environment, as well as the soundtrack, which insists on distressing and ""errant"" sounds during the narrative. John Carpenter's film is considered a cult classic today for all the impact it has had on the horror film industry over the years. With its practical visual effects that have become a great influence on similar works, its atmosphere of tension and for bringing a narrative that so well develops its conflicts.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"An Icily Efficient, Nihilistic Masterpiece","It's often said that the scariest part of Halloween (by the same director, preceding The Thing) is the moment suburban doors go unanswered and curtains are shut in response to a girl pleading to be let in somewhere to save her life. The Thing takes the grim nihilism of that moment, and spins it out to the length of a whole film. A isolated Antarctic research station is attacked by a shape-shifting alien life-form ... and the film gradually whittles away at the crew's numbers. The lack of trust the alien's shape-shifting form injects into the relationships between the crew is starkly terrifying, as each tries to survive; the final conclusion that there is no hope for survival, inevitable.The only false note is the bizarrely brief scene, with very ropey special effects, of a spaceship crashing to earth; the need to explain how the alien arrives is superfluous. But it takes away nothing; and the practical effects on show in the rest of the film are amongst the best in film history. The score is simple, and haunting; the performances admirably lacking in hysteria; the whole film icily efficient. A masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

An unidentifiable thing making a mess of things,"There must be certain objections to this classic Science Fiction film, by many considered John Carpenter's masterpiece and best film at least, and of course it is extremely well done with a virtuoso program of special effects, making the results of the activity of ""The Thing"" as horribly revolting as possible - you really aren't prepared for it when the first appearance of ""The Thing"" turns up doing something terrible to the poor innocent dog. The first time I happened to this film I could not see it any further than this, the second time I gave it a chance but still couldn't see it all, but now the third time at least I was prepared and could watch it calmly to the end. Everything is technically perfect, and the direction and music by Morricone couldn't be better, but the flaws are all in the script. After all, these researchers in the Antarctic are all scientists and should act accordingly and not constantly lose their self control. When doctor Blair loses control it's the starting point for the whole adventure to run off the rails, and then it constantly gets worse. They resort to violence, which is the last thing a scientist should do, he is educated to have no capacity for that, and then the film goes constantly from bad to worse and becomes nothing else than a monument to paranoia. Of course, these poor fellows without a woman or even any picture of such a healthy creature are all fenced in by the Antarctic winter in hopeless isolation in the dark of winter, so naturally they could develop psychic problems, especially in the encounter with such a thing as ""The Thing"", but they should at least TRY to keep cool and maintain some scientific self control. They all fail in this, and the signal for everyone's going off the rails occurs perhaps already in the beginning, when Kurt Russell accuses his computer, with which he plays chess, of cheating and pours whiskey into him. That's perhaps the starting point of the following accumulating monumental mess.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good!,"A good horror and suspense film!I came to this film after watching the 2011 ""Reboot"". And I could see why that film was cool to watch!The unknown is very scary! Sometimes the fear of not being able to believe or trust anyone becomes the real terror! And the film works this very well, knowing that at no point do you even have a relief from feeling safe is excruciating!The film works so well that it doesn't even feel like it was made more than 40 years ago. And I'm sure that this fever of ""traitor"" games, like ""Among Us"" and several others, took a lot from the idea of this film.I highly recommend it!

The Thing About The Thing,"I'm a John Carpenter kind of guy so I must say I go into his films already enjoying them. Watching The Thing biased for many years and then watching it with my partner last night kind of opened me to the fact that some people just don't gel with this movie. And honestly, I don't really get it at all. The effects, they are fantastic not just for the time but they still hold up today. Yet they're over the top enough to make the film energetic and fun and honestly make the even more dreary bickering of the station crew lively. The suspense is also so well laid and executed and the different things you might pick up on as you watch this film make it such a fun rewatch. Pair that with a fantastic cast and you just get a horror film for the ages. But you know what I'll admit? The suspense does take a little while to build, and to be quite honest I don't remember the first act of the film being so slow. I feel like there are two critical scenes that could've either been trimmed down or cut entirely as they really only reinforce what we as an audience already know. But as a ride or die Carpenter guy this is only a concern for other people. For me, this is still so good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Thing Horror,"""The Thing"" is a masterclass in tension and suspense, expertly crafted by John Carpenter. From the haunting score to the chilling atmosphere, every element contributes to an overwhelming sense of dread. The film's practical effects are nothing short of groundbreaking, creating terrifying and imaginative creature designs that still hold up today.Kurt Russell delivers a standout performance as R. J. MacReady, embodying a complex character who grapples with paranoia and survival. The ensemble cast effectively conveys the escalating fear and mistrust among the team, making the viewer question who can be trusted.What truly sets ""The Thing"" apart is its exploration of isolation and the human condition under duress. The film raises profound questions about identity and trust, making it not just a horror movie, but a thought-provoking experience.Overall, ""The Thing"" is a timeless classic that continues to influence the horror genre, and it's a must-watch for any fan of suspenseful cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The story lost in excess gore,"Yep, we are confronted by a dog-splitting being from the great beyond. Being isolated we must evaluate track and kill this most obviously menacing ""Thing"".

Still, it is a sticky blob story that has no personality of its own.If you are looking for Adrienne Barbeau, you will not see her because she is just the voice, great voice, of the computer (uncredited).The story is fluffed out with Carpenter-Esque storytelling and misses the point of the book and the film spends too much time with blood and guts to focus on the people's interaction. Sure, there is some interaction or we would not have a movie at all.The ""Thing"" in the book was psychic and could read and manipulate the minds that the film overlooks.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Paranoia,"Wow, John Carpenter really loves Howard Hawks, doesn't he? Well, he was hired onto this project after it had been through several drafts, managing a new draft written by Bill Lancaster, and didn't originate the idea, at least. Still, what Carpenter helped script and ended up directing is an ideal remake. Returning to the ultimate source, the short story ""Who Goes There?"" by John Campbell, Carpenter recast the whole concept with a twist while firmly planting the new film in a new time, never feeling like he's just repeating what Hawks and Nyby had done before in The Thing From Another World.One of the key differences between Carpenter's remake and Nyby's original is in terms of its construction. The original starts away from the remote, icy camp and moves into that team finding the alien trapped in ice. The remake starts with the creature having already been dug up, torn apart a Norwegian camp, and arriving at the American camp with our heroes in the form of a dog. This is important for one big reason, the monster is incredibly different. In the original, there was just a monster (that apparently looked like a carrot in color) that needed defeating. In this remake, pulling more from the original source material, the monster is vastly different, able to morph from one shape into another as it absorbs the essence of other creatures. There's a lot of questions that arise about how it does it and how perfectly it can hide in its form, and the movie, having the refuse of a previous encounter to sift through, provides those answers on the front end of the film.The dog runs into camp, the final Norwegian dies by a gunshot to the head, and Mac (Kurt Russell), the helicopter pilot, flies to the Norwegian camp to investigate with a couple of others. There, they find the half-burnt remains of something. There are distinct signs of human appendages and two heads melting into or away from each other. This is obviously not human, and we get a scene where Blair (Wilford Brimley), their biologist, dissects it, finding perfectly normal human organs inside. This is telling us that whatever this thing is, it's not human and it will look human down to its organs. There will be no telling it apart from anyone else. It's great that this information is introduced early because once the questions about who might or might not be the creature, we're not bogged down with questions of how. We already know that.The dog wanders the enclosed hallways of the camp for a day, and there's something to be said about the dog's performance. I guess I wouldn't have thought of this if I hadn't had my most recent watch of this film with my visiting mother (the movie was her idea) who noted it as we were watching, but there's an eerie quality to the dog. It's too calm, collected, and still to be real. How it steadily wanders the halls, eventually choosing a room to go into, or how it stands perfectly still at a window looking outward is off-putting. Anyway, after a day roaming the camp, Mac tells the dog handler Clark to put the dog with the rest, and things go pear shaped quickly. Alone with the sled dogs, the creature changes shape into an amorphous set of tentacles, jaws, and flesh, spraying dogs with liquids, grabbing them and absorbing them while chaos erupts.This points to another of the film's great attributes: the creature effects. Done by Rob Bottin (with some work by Stan Winston), the creature work is amazing. The wide variety of manifestations of the creature represent months of work, and there's a fleshy, other-worldly quality to all of it that unites them as one. Everything changes from one situation to the next, but they all feel like they're part of the same thing at the same time. My favorite is the variety of effects that make the head independently crawl away from the burning corpse. So well done and creepy.To get to that moment is a series of steadily increasing doubts that each man has about everyone else around them. It becomes obvious that no one can truly trust each other, especially after the doctor proposes a blood test that would identify the creature and the store of blood gets sabotaged. No one knows who does it, but suspicions are directed in some specific directions at the same time. An admirable element of all this is that we, the audience, are completely in the dark about who is or is not the creature, as much as anyone else in the movie, and it never feels like a lie. It never feels like Carpenter is artificially keeping information from us, even though we see the moment that leads the dog to infect the first person in the camp but we can't see who it is. It never feels like a lie to us. Instead it feels like we're reaching the edges of perception based on point of view that's pretty solidly set in the film. Most of it is told directly from Mac's point of view, though we do move in and out of it here and there, and it never feels like a cheat.That lack of clarity about who is who is the ultimate source of tension in the film. We're never sure if anyone can be trusted, and there are moments where we even begin to wonder about Mac, even though we've walked most steps along with him. The centerpiece of creating clarity amidst the confusion is the blood test scene where Mac takes blood samples of everyone and uses a hot needle to see if the blood will react violently in response. It's an amazingly tense sequence because we honestly have no idea what's going to happen. One of them, at least one of them we figure, has to be a creature, and we don't know who. We also don't know how its blood will react or how it will react if exposed. It's also remarkably cleanly filmed, providing a very clear sense of geography around the room that helps to hide some of the special effects when they pop up.There's a remarkable professionalism to the filmmaking in general here. That's a way of saying that this movie simply looks great. There was something about the generation of filmmakers that came about in the 70s that gave them this great combination of old school aesthetics with new school sensibilities. Like how Coppola's The Godfather is rather perfectly framed from beginning to end but focused on a more grounded, dirtier, and more detailed violence than gangster movies of the past, Carpenter's The Thing has the roving Steadicam shots of a new filmmaker while framing several men in small spaces without every losing sight of the focus of the scene, helping to keep the variety of men separate in our minds. This extends into the special effects sequences where the detailed puppets are filmed in the perfect light to keep them looking real and terrifying at the same time.And what do I think of the ending? Both are human and are going to die a very cold death. They won, and they will die heroes in the cold.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A Sci-Fi Horror Classic,"Title: A Sci-Fi Horror Classic - John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (1982)John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is an absolute masterpiece of science fiction horror that continues to send shivers down the spines of audiences even decades after its release. This 1982 film stands the test of time, thanks to its impeccable storytelling, groundbreaking practical effects, and a hauntingly eerie score composed by Ennio Morricone.Set in the frozen isolation of Antarctica, the movie centers around a group of American researchers who encounter a seemingly benign stray dog chased by a Norwegian helicopter. Unbeknownst to them, this chance encounter is about to unleash an unimaginable horror upon the researchers' outpost. As they investigate the Norwegians' camp, they discover the horrifying truth: an extraterrestrial lifeform capable of assimilating and imitating any living organism it comes into contact with. The tension and paranoia steadily mount as the group grapples with the realization that any one of them could be the Thing in disguise.Carpenter's expert direction creates an atmosphere of claustrophobia and dread that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the film. The film's brilliant pacing allows the tension to build slowly, with each passing scene revealing more about the characters and the imminent threat they face. Kurt Russell delivers an outstanding performance as R. J. MacReady, the grizzled helicopter pilot and de facto leader of the group. His rugged charisma and determination anchor the film, making him a memorable and relatable protagonist.The practical effects, led by the talented Rob Bottin, are nothing short of revolutionary for their time. The gruesome transformations and nightmarish creature designs are a testament to the skill and creativity of the effects team. These practical effects have aged remarkably well and add an authenticity to the horror that CGI would never have been able to replicate.""The Thing"" also delves into the psychological aspects of survival in extreme circumstances, exploring themes of trust, fear, and the dark side of human nature. As the tension escalates, alliances are formed and shattered, and the characters' sanity is pushed to the brink.Ennio Morricone's haunting score further amplifies the sense of impending doom, with its eerie and pulsating tones, adding an atmospheric layer that perfectly complements the chilling events unfolding on screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Maybe the best horror film ever made,"I am big fan of horror films and I do know what I like and dislike. The Thing was a movie I instantly loved. Since very young John Carpenter has been a director which has produced movies that I still today consider one of my favorites namely: Escape from New York and Big Trouble in Little China. It was in my later years I started to appreciate more the horror genre and that is a lot thanks to Halloween, Prince of Darkness and of course this movie the Thing. John Carpenter has an extraordinary ability to build the story in all of his movies in such a way that you feel you are just drawn into the movie, slowly but surely. There are many ways to do a horror movie and how you as a director decides to scare the audience. Many movies relies heavily on gore or visual effects, however, Carpenter has never gone that route but instead he has focused on building a great story where the suspense develops gradually. The intro song to the movie is an excellent example of his art of making horror movies.
In my opinion that is a far better way to scare someone than blood splashing on the screen. When you watch this movie then it's not the gore (which it does have also) that scares you the most but that it's the feeling that you feel you are becoming paranoid about what's really happening and that is by far the best way to really scare someone.

The Amazing Thing,"Wow! So glad to have this finally off my list of shame and even happier that it actually lives up to all the hype, not necessarily in the way I thought but still incredible. I didn't find it particularly scary or anything and would probably classify it more as a creature thriller more than horror but that's not a bad thing. The tension this builds is incredible, the way the characters all twist and turn on each other is intriguing and seems realistic enough to be believable. So this psychological aspect was completely unexpected for me and I loved that. Then there's the effects themselves which are mindblowingly good even to current standards almost 40 years later. The Thing makes me want to sing the praises and pine for the days of practical effects, when a movie could still look so good regardless of the passage of time or advancements in technology.This really was a remarkably good movie and my only disappointment is that it took me so long to see it.

Is it because it looks ""different"" or is ""ugly"" according to media and societal standards? So what message does this send to viewers?

"THE ""SECOND"" THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD","""The Thing"" is based on SyFy author John W. Campbell's classic novella, ""Who Goes There?""which was first published in 1938.

Nevertheless, lack of certain technologies only served to fuel Carpenter's creativity, and many of the special effects in this film were so groundbreaking (and shocking to audiences) that contemporary filmmakers became inspired by his mixture of ""old school"" and ""new school"" innovations. Indeed, some particularly graphic scenes are unforgettable; images I first saw in 1982 are still quietly burning in the back of my mind. And unlike Hawk's black and white version, Carpenter's version was released in jaw-dropping color, with the story and plot lines far more faithful to Campbell's original novella. Carpenter perfectly captured the very human emotions of fear and paranoia, themes which helped to further define the genre of science fiction horror films.""The Thing"" follows a group of American scientists working in a remote and desolate Antarctic research outpost. Their work is suddenly interrupted by a couple of visibly determined men in a Norwegian designated helicopter who are attempting to shoot a clearly frightened looking Husky Sled Dog. After a few missed shots the dog luckily finds shelter in the American research camp. Both Norwegians (the helicopter pilot and shooter passenger) are killed during the pursuit.With so many lingering questions, the Americans quickly decide to explore the Norwegian camp which is several miles from their own base camp. What they find at the Norwegian's decimated campsite is both repulsive and frightening. Shocked and thoroughly stunned, the Americans return to their camp. Within a few days their previously boring but peaceful research center becomes a nightmare of horror, fear and paranoia. It is then that they learn the Norwegians had discovered a crashed spacecraft as well as what is apparently could have been the ship's pilot. Both the saucer and its pilot are firmly encased in frozen, ancient Antarctic ice. The researchers conclude that the alien may have either been thrown out of the saucer upon impact, or had been injured in the crash and was attempting to crawl to safety before being frozen solid by the -100 below freezing temperatures. Either way, it's a stunning find.What happens when they bring the body of the flash-frozen alien back to their camp for further study is a perfect example of classic science fiction and horror, broken up with carefully placed moments of droll but effective humor. And it all works, indeed, it works extremely well!The fine cast includes screen veterans such as Kurt Russell, Wilford Brinkley, T. K. Carter, David Clennon, Keith David, Richard A. Dysart, Charles Hallahan, Peter Maloney, Richard Masur, Joel Polis and Norbert Weisser.There would be one more ""Thing"" remake to follow Carpenter's version: The somewhat gory but interesting version by Dutch filmmaker, Matthijs van Heijningen Jr., ""The Thing,"" released in 2011. As of this writing (2022) John Carpenter has recently hinted he is considering filming a new sequel.No spoilers here as usual, but I will reveal that because of the film's industry and fan ""buzz,"" nearly all of the actors that ended up in this movie instantly became a member of the Hollywood elite. Carpenter had a enviable budget of $15,000,000 to make ""The Thing"" (by comparison, in 1977, ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,"" had a mere budget of $11,000,000). For ""The Thing,"" Universal Studios attempted to attract and secure some of our Hollywood's biggest stars for the all male cast. These names included Jeff Bridges, Nick Nolte, Sam Shepard, Kris Kristofferson, Nick Nolte, Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Peter Coyote, Fred Ward, Isaac Hayes, Tom Berenger, Tim McIntyre, and John Heard. All of the actors or their agents had been contacted by the studio, but they had either turned down the project or were simply unavailable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Alongside Alien, one of the great sci-fi horror classics","Carpenter combines several extreme settings to create a thrilling film. A maximum of spatial hopelessness, absolute mistrust within a group of people and total physical destruction. One of the main factors for fan love is certainly the excellent and excessive effects. Yes, excessive is probably the most apt word. SFX, high-budget and still timeless today. This is rounded off by a classic horror atmosphere with darkness, silence and confined spaces. If there is light, there are also shadows, if there is total silence, the fantastic soundtrack mimes the tension-ridden heartbeat of the viewer, and if a fundamentally uncomfortable situation is already a fact, then icy temperatures are also added here. The failure in the eyes of critics and audiences at the time is no longer comprehensible today. Alongside Alien, one of the great sci-fi horror classics.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
carpenters beast,"anyone who gave this film less than a 7.5 at least is to be frank viewing it from a snobby point of view. They are the type of people who watched pulp fiction and thought it was trashy rubbish. This film originally received terrible reviews and nearly ruined John Carpenters carear! This was the man who saved the horror genre with Halloween, and he was slated for a film that is, from mine and many other Carpenter fans point of view better!!!! The direction is outstanding. It follows the first rule of horror to the hilt and isolates its victims very artistically and gripingly. The special effects are lighters ahead of its time and used, contrary to popular belief, tastefully and well. While it is gory, it is not the gore fest that many would have you believe.

I know i'm human,One of the greatest films ever. Horror or otherwise. Just got out of seeing it on the big screen 42 years after i first saw it at 20. It's got better. Or maybe at 62 i see it in new ways. To this day i don't know how the Thing gets in the host and the whole process but it doesn't matter. It just works. Never has paranoia been shown so well. And what a great class. Kurt Russell's best performance outside of Bone Tomahawk but everyone is memorable and great here. Practical effects just work. Bye bye CGI.

A stone cold classic,"The Thing contains pretty much everything there is to love about horror and to this day is easily one of the best films of the genre. For starters, it is scary, no question about it. The film is able to create a terrifying atmosphere and combines it with a sense of paranoia and dread from the first frame. The dark and moody tone continues throughout the film and builds off the ever increasing amount of suspense and claustrophobia. It doesn't take too long either for the things to get freaky; extremely freaky! The cast is another thing that's well worth mentioning. They bring humanity to the characters with vivid life and even a bit of humor. It's Kurt Russell though that really shines. He's as good as he's ever been,
sarcastic and unafraid, making for a milestone in his career of performances. The elaborate special effects though are the undeniable highlight of the film because they leave absolutely nothing to our imagination and push the boundaries of gore to their very limit. It's the stomach-churning visual excess and outright disturbing use of realism that make this film so horrifying. This is the movie that shows you how to love the horror genre and appreciate its relentless desire to be as unpleasant as
possible. Bloody, creepy, frightening, shocking, and very wellacted, The Thing is a horror classic full of grotesque effects and chilling scares.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Simply Fantastic Cult Classic!,"One of the best films I have in my collection and one I happily return to regularly!It led me into the horror genre, but is very difficult to surpass in quality even with much more money being poured into the genre now.Both the story and script are superb, the dialogue is excellent and the production is great.The acting is fantastic, a proper ensemble cast with Kurt Russell leading the charge.Everyone should see this at some point!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Best Remake Ever,"The Good: Yep, I said it. The Thing is certainly in the running for this illustrious title. This movie is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. There is literally nothing I would change about it; everything from the setting, to the characters, to the pacing is perfect. This movie manages to have an entire crew of distinct personalities and is anchored by the phenomenal Kurt Russell and Keith David.But let's be real, the star of the show is the The Thing. The practical effects here are legendary at this point. The creative, disturbing visuals and artistic/technical mastery on display here is truly awe inspiring. Honestly, nowadays they throw hundreds of millions of dollars at visual FX, but few movies leave the impression this one does.The Thing as a character is purposefully vague and underdeveloped; it's a being that humanity would have no reference to. It's supposed to be mysterious; the trap that so many movies fall into is over explaining. Here is the perfect example of not doing that. It's kind of amazing to consider how generic the original ""Thing"" was - a hulking humanoid monster - vs the creative genius of this version.The Bad: There are a couple of weird visual FX here and there (the Thing is shown in stop motion briefly towards the end) and I do wish we got more time with Blair and saw how he got infected. But those are pretty minor.The Ugly: The Thing is Carpenter at his best. It's amazing to consider how great of a run he had in the 1980s. Yet, to also reflect on how this movie bombed back in the day. It's a masterpiece, probably the best remake ever and one of the best horror films in the American canon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Kept waiting for it to start,"I did not care for this film.The few bits of action in this movie didn't make up for the long bouts of nothingness. I kept waiting and waiting for the plot to start, but it never did. I can pretty much sum it up like this: ""angry all-male cast tries to kill unspecified monster, fails until they eventually succeed.""There was not a single female character, which may help to explain the plotlessness. I understand why it was a total flop at the box office, but I really can't understand how it's called a ""classic"" now.If you like your films to have any kind of story or character development, this one's not for you.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

He's truly a master at his craft!The performances are fantastic and the prosthetic work is outstanding! I don't think I will ever see better effects in a movie ever again! My jaw was on the floor because of how flawless they looked!You are constantly sitting on the edge of your seat, wondering who has become a THING and who's still human. It's a thrill ride!! And the ending, AMAZING!!!

Chilling to the Core,"The Thing is a cornerstone of the horror genre, an undeniable masterpiece. Directed by John Carpenter in 1982, this cult classic remains one of the greatest films of all time, seamlessly blending psychological tension, visceral horror, and groundbreaking craftsmanship. For any fan of the genre, it undoubtedly stands as an essential watch, often ranking among the best of all time.Set in the frozen desolation of an Antarctic research station, The Thing follows a group of scientists who encounter an alien life form capable of assimilating and mimicking any living organism. As the creature's presence becomes undeniable, paranoia and mistrust begin to unravel the group. The film masterfully builds tension, immersing the audience in an atmosphere where no one-and nothing-can be trusted.Kurt Russell delivers an iconic performance as R. J. MacReady, a rugged yet resourceful helicopter pilot who reluctantly steps into a leadership role as the situation spirals out of control. Russell's portrayal strikes a perfect balance between stoicism and vulnerability, anchoring the film amidst its escalating chaos. The ensemble cast, including standout performances from Wilford Brimley, Keith David, and Richard Dysart, further enhances the story's intensity, with each character adding to the pervasive sense of dread and distrust.The practical effects, spearheaded by Rob Bottin, are legendary. The grotesque, otherworldly transformations of The Thing remain as terrifying today as they were upon the film's release. Each creature design is a testament to Bottin's creativity and the era's unparalleled dedication to practical effects. The absence of CGI gives the horror a tactile, visceral quality, amplifying its impact and solidifying its place as a milestone in visual effects history.Ennio Morricone's haunting, minimalist score complements the film's unsettling tone, with its deep, resonant notes underscoring the characters' isolation and despair. Carpenter's masterful direction elevates every moment, using claustrophobic settings, sharp pacing, and atmospheric cinematography to evoke a profound sense of unease. The Antarctic outpost becomes as much a character as the men within it, its icy remoteness amplifying the story's themes of isolation and survival.Beyond its monster movie facade, The Thing is a profound examination of human nature under extreme stress. Themes of trust, fear, and survival are explored with intelligence and nuance, challenging viewers to question how they might react in such dire circumstances. The film's ambiguous ending-a brilliant choice-ensures that its questions linger long after the credits roll, solidifying its reputation as a thought-provoking and enduring work of art.In conclusion, The Thing is a triumph of horror filmmaking, a perfect fusion of tension, storytelling, and technical brilliance. Its influence on the genre remains profound, and its chilling exploration of paranoia and survival continues to captivate audiences. For anyone seeking an unforgettable cinematic experience, The Thing is a must-watch-a timeless masterpiece that exemplifies the very best of what horror can achieve.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
2nd Best sci-fi/horror ever,"For the ultimate sci-fi/horror cross over there is ""Alien"", next in line is John Carpenter`s ""The Thing"" and i will be very surprised if any future movies in this genre can beat these two classics.The DVD is also very good (excellent documentary),but non-anamorphic.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the best SCI-FI horror films ever made,"The reason why this film is separated from other really good horror films is the characters and the story, Its because you go along with the character you just see some one become a alien and say ""ok i know he is the alien"" but in this film you don't know who is the alien that is why this film is so great because you follow the characters.The alien of The thing has to be one of the best alien kind of monsters because its how it infects or consumes the person or animal like it can have 3 heads and if you choose to cut off its head then the head will grow spider legs and crawl away so it's a very intelligent life form because it can hide it's self among other humans as making it self a human and making the character scared and uneasy because it could be anyone making a very good plot and I think it has to by one of the best sci-fi horror films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Among Us,"John Carpenter is certainly an interesting film director. Most of his films are often hated upon release and then years later, are considered cult classics. That would be the case with 1982's The Thing which I consider to be more based off of the original story ""Who Goes There?"" and not the 1951 film, The Thing From Another World. I have not read the story or even watched the 1951 film. With that being said, when this film was released, nearly every one hated this film. But, years later, people now consider this film to be one of the best John Carpenter films and one of the best horror films of all time. This is notably one of the few John Carpenter films to not be scored by John Carpenter himself and rather was scored by the late Ennio Morricone. The film notably stars Kurt Russel in one of his many roles in John Carpenter films, Keith David (who would later star in They Live, and Wilfred Brimley (famous for the diabetes commercials that are so nostalgic). This film would later see a soft reboot/prequel in 2011 titled The Thing.The film follows a group of American scientists who are stationed in Antarctica. One day, some Norwegians are in a helicopter and chasing a dog. The Norwegians die and the Americans are left with this dog that they know nothing about. But it isn't a dog and the Americans learn that very quickly. The Americans learn what this thing is and they start to grow suspicious of one another....I am going to be honest here. I do not believe that this film is John Carpenter's best film. But where do I start? This is a horror film and a good one too. I do enjoy the setup here. You have a group of people who are in the middle of the Antarctic and they cannot trust one another because of what this thing can do. It is quite scary when one goes and thinks about it. One can really feel the tension between the characters in just about every scene and that there is genius. But where this film fails is that nothing comes out as really really scary and if your gonna call a film the greatest horror film of all time, it has to be really really scary. That being said, there are a few instances where there are jump scares and are fairly effective. But what this film wants to rely on for scares is in it's special effects. Now, the special effects are really good and even hold p to this day for the most part. Sure, there are a few instances where you get that smooth, rubbery look but it is not too often where that occurs. The effects are grotesque and are not for the squeamish. But the effects are really fun to look at and one can tell what hard work has been put into them. Many people who grew up with this film can say that the gore in this film has really had an effect on them and I will admit that it is one of the goriest films I have seen but I have seen some (and they are not necessarily horror films) that are much gorier. What is really interesting is that this is the first Carpenter film (and so far only one that I have really seen so far) to have a lot put into special effects of this magnitude. I was at first disappointed to find out that Carpenter did not do the score for this film. But, when I found out that the late Ennio Morricone scored this film, I was excited. This film's score is really good and uses ambiance and it is one of the best film scores in a horror film. Now, here is where I find the film lacking and maybe I am just being a straight up film snob here but, the characters are not written well at all. Upon release, this film was seen as a late Alien cash in. Yes, Alien is the better film and an amazing film at that. Alien had a cast of characters that were developed fairly well and each character is likeable in their own way. In The Thing, the only character to get developed is MacReady (played by Kurt Russell) and even still he is the hero character. Yes, Russell has that charm to him, but there has to be more to it than that. The characters are not all too interesting and if they have any traits, it is the usual traits like the comic relief or crazy person or what not. The only reason why I would like any of the characters is because I am fairly familiar with the actors that portray them and I am not saying I hate the characters because I do not. Typically this happens in a few Carpenter films but I can most of the time overlook this like in They Live (but that is more because it is a cerebral type of film). But this is kind of hard to overlook because you can have well developed characters in a film like this. On a final note, this film has some great cinematography. I love the scenes shot in the dark because they fit well with the tone and I do like the lighting in those shots (for example when there is flares or even a flamethrower) which help create shadows which look really nice in this film.The Thing is a good film and was fun to watch but for me it falls short of being the best horror film of all time and even the best John Carpenter film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Iconic horror mostly for its practical effects,"The story has been adapted a few times, most notably the black and white version, the thing from another world, a gem for its time, however Mr Carpenter's version, is a hundred miles an hour on speed, the story remains pretty much the same, creature lands on earth, attempts to Take over earth, what sets this apart, is the amazing practical effects by the amazing Rob bottin ,no CGI here, add to that the score by none other the genius, Mr morricone ,great performances all round, mostly by by Kurt Russell, by far Carpenter's finest work, Halloween not even close, its a must see for any horror fan.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"After the contamination of a scientific Arctic team from an unknown alien creature, the group must figure out who is really who in order to stay alive.","In the early Fall of 1978, Terrence Malick (Badlands, A Thin Red Line) released his take on deception and turmoil on a rural farm with Days of Heaven, which featured the young faces of Richard Gere and Brooke Adams. Accompanying the 29 year old actors is a majestic and graceful score by Italian composer Ennio Morricone, who created one of the most iconic sounds in a new generation of Westerns. Around this time, a bright eyed and passionate director began piecing together one of the most memorable scores for a film that would become one of the most iconic slashers of our time. Four years later, both masters of iconicism would join hands melding Morricone's strings with Carpenter's terror, creating one of the greatest pieces of science fiction horror cinema has ever seen.Taking place at United States National Science Institute Station 4 in Antarctica, a helicopter manned by a Norwegian sniper attempts to shoot a wild dog making its way to the research station. After a brief shootout, the Alaskan Malamute is taken in by gruff sled-dog handler Clark (Richard Masur), while fellow researcher Dr. Copper (Richard Dysart) and helicopter pilot R. J. MacReady (Kurt Russel) investigate a nearby Norwegian research facility. Finding the entire camp in ruin, and a mysterious, twisted corpse containing two faces lying amidst the charred facility, they fly it back for Dr. Blair (Wilfrud Brimley) to look at. Soon afterwards the dog, now caged with the others and containing the creature, mutates into a biomass of flesh and bone that is quickly contained by a flamethrower wielding Childs (Keith David). The creatures autopsy reveals that the thing inside of the animal can mimic other life forms, putting the rest of the crew on edge as they quickly try and figure out who the creature has infected.Originally a short story entitled Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell Jr., The Thing is a remake of a 1951 science fiction film The Thing From Another Planet by Howard Hawkes and Christian Nyby. Playing more closely to the story Hawkes and Nyby adapted, John Carpenter weaves a beautiful tapestry of twisted design between a veil of claustrophobia as each member of the research team becomes more and more paranoid over who is who. As the creature makes itself apparent, showing us one beautiful transformation after the other, the room we are given to move around is slowly cut off, adding to the creeping feeling of isolation and hopelessness.With the tension John Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster creates as things unfold is all too palpable, causing each scene to build on top of each other in Jenga like fashion. What stirs each paranoid glance, each unsure movement, and what ultimately goes bump in the night is Ennio Morricone's magnificent post-Western score, raising hairs with each sound. Whether it's a wide shot of the frozen Arctic tundra or a close-up of the thing ripping out of a fellow teammate, the music behind each scene raises it to new heights that only a master composer could.Just as The Thing is a film that you can watch, it is also one you can listen to and feel, with each contribution working with equal and powerful forces. Ranging from suffocating tension to grotesque and sudden outbursts, every frame is one for your senses. While Todd C. Ramsay's editing comes off as a bit too ill-guided, forcing multiple scenes transitioning to pick up too many pieces, it doesn't cause us to deviate from the story. Whether it's John Carpenters patient build up, Rob Bottin's and Stan Winston's horrifying and undeniably ahead of its times special effects, or Ennio Morricone's hair raising score, The Thing is a film that cannot be forgotten.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
You really think you can trust the person at your side?,"This is a serious injection of pure paranoia. If you don't get anxious and ask important questions about what exactly happens that we don't get to see, and when, during the course of this, then you, my friend, were not properly engaged, and, let's be brutally honest here, this film probably wasn't meant for you(and hey, that's no problem, nothing is for everyone). A lot of debate is possible over the answers. And that's part of why this is so enormously terrifying, and what keeps this working for the audience, even with many viewings. It's difficult to be certain. The plot is marvelous, and its progression feels natural without being predictable. The concept is well-thought out, interesting and fascinating, and the execution does not disappoint. The pacing is spot-on, there is not a misplaced moment to be found in this. When this intends to be, it is rather intense. The atmosphere is expertly crafted, and builds at the proper speed, never rushed. The tension is so thick you can practically *see* it. The gore is plentiful, and while quite frightening, it isn't the point, nor does it ever feel like it is. And whether you like them or not, ya gotta admit, they look pretty darn good for when they were made. All the special effects in this do, almost entirely on account of Rob Bottin, the newcomer who literally exhausted himself creating them. The key is the balance, how far you push the shocks, and John's got that down to a science. The humor is of the same type and close to the same amount as his usual efforts. The acting is average or above. The characters are sufficiently developed and varied. The dialog is well-delivered and well-written. The mood is helped by the brilliant composer Ennio Morricone, who applies his talent, and puts together music that fits Carpenter perfectly. If your nerves are not in tattered rags before this is over... see the beginning of this review. All of these things together... the isolation of the people and the setting, the long, claustrophobic hallways, the genuinely successful scares, the gruesome violence and the haunting, unsettling score... it creates a strong horror piece which still holds up today, and which manages to get jumps out of yours truly, after having watched it around a dozen times. The DVD holds a feature-length behind-the-scenes documentary and a commentary track with Kurt Russell and the director, who are cool to listen to together, and which is both entertaining and informative. The menus are a tad flat, and one can tell that the release was done years after this hit theaters. I recommend this movie to fans of all that were involved in making it... in particular the man who helmed it. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
a definite chill in the air (in more ways than one)...,"True to his name, John Carpenter was a major architect of celluloid terror in his prime, with a distinctive visual style, a reliance on simple musical scores that stick menacingly in the viewer's mind, and a manner of manipulating suspense through lighting, character conflict, and well-choreographed action. As both writer (often under a pseudonym) and director, Carpenter's films comprise some of the finest examples of the horror genre. However, when he's in command of someone else's script, there is sometimes a clash between the two. Upon viewing ""The Thing"" for the first time in several years, this inconsistency sticks out like a sore thumb.Now don't get me wrong. As a child I'd build my schedule (at least on weekends) around horror movies playing on cable TV, and Carpenter's interpretation of ""The Thing"" (far more faithful to the short story 'Who Goes There?' than its 1951 predecessor) was certainly a major influence on my personal taste--it was bloody, scary, and very cool-looking (Rob Bottin's makeup FX put all the CGI offerings that have come since to shame). And that minimalist score by Italian composer Ennio Morricone produced a shiver without fail. And the ending--from its ambiguous final line to the isolated manner in which it's photographed, was enough to thoroughly creep me out as a youngster.The movie still holds up for a lot of the reasons I just mentioned, but it falters somewhat due to the weak characterizations. Bill Lancaster's script renders the dozen or so men stationed at an Antarctic research outpost (a gaggle of scientists and military types) besieged by an imitative alien life form as little more than fodder for the cool-looking transformation/death scenes (that is, when they're not tossing explanatory dialog around like a hot potato). The isolated setting in the midst of a section of the world known for extreme weather conditions casts a weariness and desperation over the whole film, which would have been more effective if we gave a damn about the characters.Carpenter does what he can, and certain actors shine (such as future Quaker Oatmeal spokesman Wilford Brimley as a crazed doctor and David Clennon as a wisecracking pothead), but most of the cast comes off as nondescript as the alien life form itself. While mostly exposition, the dialog does unravel in an intriguing way as the men become increasingly aware of what they're dealing with, and the special effects complement the story rather than overwhelming it. And perhaps ""The Thing""'s main saving grace--in terms of its horror being so well-preserved after all these years--is Carpenter's uncanny way of capturing a mood of dread, fear, and isolation, to the point where you might be tempted to jack up the thermostat a few degrees after the end credits are done rolling.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Carpenter's best.,"Can you believe that, when this movie was originally released, audiences despised it?  An 80s remake of The Thing could very easily be a rehash of Cold War nostalgia- there's still something of a pretext about it- but the setting and effects employed here make it a horror classic.  The stop-motion animation, instead of feeling dated and tired, has a more visceral impact than computer-generated FX, and the entire film is loaded with tension.  And Carpenter doesn't let the movie fall back on cheap gore either: several scenes are just good, old-fashioned scary as hell.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Easily one of the best horror movies ever,"John Carpenter used to be a great director and this is an example of that. He's done one really good movie in 10 years and that's ""In the Mouth of Madness.""  For some reason he's gone away from what he does best and chooses to do horrible big budget horror movies like""Vampires"" and ""Ghosts from Mars.""  This is a classic horror movie and better than the 1951 original. Kurt Russell is excellent and so is the rest of the ensemble cast.  Paranoia is the best way to make a horror movie work.  Movies like Session 9 don't even need a budget because they work so well with human nature and how it takes very little for man to turn on his friends.

Absolute pooooooooooo,"Dear readerPlease please please dont watch this
Easily the worst movie I've watched in the last 5 years after (TW) the neon demon.First of all, not for one second did I feel a SPECK of fear or even discomfort. The 'monster' was like a bunch of goo and fingers who the hell would get scared of that, especially with such old and bad cgi. The mens reactions were so not fitting, barely any emotion, and the acting was below average. One line in the entire dialogue made me chuckle and thats about it, i think it was the old guy wanting to be untied after the blood was checked. I kept waiting for the 'horror' and trusting the process, and that we were warming up and getting there but it was just so so so so boring. We were 3 btw and all three of us hated it (amna idc what you think). When we got to the last 12 minutes we were so fed up we watched it on speed 2 just so we know we gave it a chance all the way to the end. There is no way nearly 500k reviews averaged out to be 8/10. I want to cry. Never trusting imdb ratings again.So speechless
I invited my friends over to watch this on my projector and screen
I want a refund of the minutes
Also want the lamp hours i wasted on it back
And an apology + a new car from the reddit guy who said it was one of the best movies ever. (amna going on reddit was your fault)How could I forget the ending
Omg the ending just made the whole thing even worse

"Symbolic, Entertaining, and Classic","This is an enthralling film that though focuses on a simple theme will stay with the viewer long after they have finished watching it.If I had to summarize this film into three themes it would be the following. The first is PARANOIA. The second is FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN. The third is ABANDONMENT. This film doesn't focus on camera work. What it does focus on though is the art department, special effects, and lighting. The special effects of which are of particular note.

John Carpenter's Masterpiece,"John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is not only a compliment to the 1951 original film, it eclipses it in quality, and originality. ""The Thing"" is one of the most frightening, absorbing sci-films that I have ever had the pleasure to view. The feel of isolation amongst super-natural terror is very abundant and effective. This is John Carpenter's best film (yes even better than Halloween (1978)), and Kurt Russel gives a career-best performance along with the fine supporting cast of, Wiford Brimley, Richard Dysart, Keith David, Richard Masur, etc. This film is not to be missed by anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Thing of Beauty,"I never realised it before but I'm a bit of a John Carpenter fan. I still don't like Halloween though, I find it an ordeal to sit through.This on the other hand is pure brilliance. The story revolves around a group of American researchers on an Antartic research station. After rescuing a dog from a seemingly crazy bunch of Norwegians (or were they swedes? ;)) they start falling host to an alien being that can imitate anything it assimilates. Cue plenty of suspense, paranoia and gore.This film wouldn't have worked anywhere else. The sense of isolation and hopelessness adds to the claustrophobic horror of the film. The characters, especially Carpenter veteran Kurt Russell are fantastic. It may seem on the surface a simple horror film but its so open at the same time that you can read anything into a particular scene or conversation. You feel just as paranoid as the characters on screen. Its wonderfully done. Its a testament to the film that it is being so hotly debated 23 years after it was released. I'm still not quite sure who was who, even right at the end. Whether this was intentional on the filmmakers part or arose simply because of the nature of the story I really cant say but its a major part of the films appeal.The film is also well known for its gore and creature effects which are still fantastic even today. In fact in the wake of CGI snoozefests they can be appreciated even more. Some scenes such as the defibrillator scene are simply shocking upon first viewing.A lot of films seem to focus on one aspect of horror, whether it be gore, suspense or psychological. The Thing defies convention and masters all of them effortlessly.

worthy of the status of a true classic,"as far as sci-fi/horror hybrids go you cannot get much better. alien would maybe give it a run for its money, but whereas we can all breath a sigh of relief at the end of that film, this has no such let up. when the end credits roll, and morricone's superb chilling score returns, there is no escape from the paranoia and fear. i remember stumbling out into sunshine when i first saw it and the images were still burnt onto my retina.... it is fair to say that carpenter's masterpiece SHOULD have got much wider recognition but this was the time of ET and people did not want such a relentlessly dark vision. I also saw ( approx. around this time, Blade Runner, Videodrome.. talk about spoiled with riches. has there been a similar time in our CG-saturated era? not really. there are great films, district 9, Primer... but nothing can match the impact of this in my own experience. it is simply perfect. i can only tolerate the remake, because of knowing that it is a remake of the 1982 version, and in spite of it's more state of the art sfx ( and the gorgeous Elizabeth Winstead), it really can not compare.. it seems at the very least ( esp. in the soundtrack) a work of reverence to a master. in my top 10 of all time, no mistake : )",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Savage bloody paranoia,"On a personal level, this is the film that ""almost made me throw up when I was 8 years old"". It was the first and the last, so you can imagine how much a milestone this film is for me. :) But, of course, I ended up watching this film when I'd become an adult, and it become quickly one of my favorite films ever. In fact, it would be up there with ""Alien"", hadn't it been the Carpenter film wouldn't have existed without Ridley Scott's masterpiece.What takes us to the point: ""The Thing"" owes ""Alien"" so much I can't give this movie a higher rating without feeling ""dirty"". However, of all the films that lift ideas from others, this is the best, no doubt about it, and the one who stands on its own more remarkably. In the end, this is movie is so good you will forget about the slight ripoff.Which are the basements of this movie? They have to be: environment, acting and, of course, FX.I'll start with FX, because they are so incredibly wild they'll stick in your head for a long time. They are insane and brilliantly implemented. I can only worship Rob Bottin for them, because his work is miles ahead of CGI. This man made me adore rubber and latex like no one. He's a true artist. I forgive him for making me feel sick when I was just a little boy.The environment is the most appropriate. It enhances the feelings of paranoia and true danger we have to sit through. If you add a disturbing bass beat for music, you get it. An isolation feeling almost impossible to excel. There is a certain shot of pure genius: all survivors meet under the snowfall, each suspecting of the other, dressed up in their anoraks. It's bright, because they all look the same from a certain distance, all their heads hidden under hoods. Everyone could be the monster, so the smell of menace permeates the screen. Great scene.And what about the acting? Awesome, credible. This is one of the few movies I have liked Kurt Russell unreservedly. You may laugh at what I'm going to say, but even the dog gives a hell of a performance.

Disgusting!,"The Thing was so terribly gross with the amount of gore it had! I liked the suspense and mystery aspect of the story because it was a great idea to have a story about a shape shifting monster that's picking off victims one by one, but no the amount of gore that was shown was so gross to the point it ruined the film. There are some people who could watch these films and then suffer from actual PTSD after watching it. Would I like to see more suspenseful films like The Thing where the emphasis is on the suspense, and the mystery ""yes"", but can these films that are extremely gory be tolerated ""no"", therefore I actually can't say The Thing was a good film because it's not.

What a Horror Movie Should Be,"Remakes today are seemingly ubiquitous in Hollywood. Most of them are unnecessary (e.g. Alfie), or unwarranted (e.g. Dawn of the Dead), and damned near every single one is crap. But there is always the exception to the rule: John Carpenter's The Thing is the exception to the Iron Law of Remakes. It goes off in a different direction than Howard Hawks' Thing (which is trite ""Doctor, look at the geiger counter!"" 1950s rubbish), but stays more faithful to the original source material. This film is a horror masterpiece, without flaws, false notes, or counterfeit nonsense that makes the viewer say to himself ""Oh yeah, I'm watchin' a movie."" The script is taut, the acting superb, the credibility factor unassailable, and the special effects tremendous. I don't think Hollywood realizes just how artificial and awful CGI is. The effects in The Thing are gross, gory, and organic, and they never made me shake my head once. Let's put it this way: the 1982 special effects for The Thing do the job they're supposed to do--tell the story--better than anything George Lucas and his oodles of nerd-loot managed twenty years later. This is a film to own, and I can't sing its praises enough. Last point: I've seen the movie numerous times, and know how the plot works out...but the film is so well-made, such a classic, that I'll stick with it if I chance upon it on cable because it's that good (cf. ""The Godfather).",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Best movie of Carpenter (along with Halloween),"I like Halloween, but my best choice of all John Carpenter movies is The Thing (remake of classic SF movie by Howard Hawks, b/w ""The thing from another world"" (1951)). I like that movie because he have good aspects of chill, suspect and gore, great cast of actors, and in this move we don't have any female (only voice of computer (voice of cute Adrienne Barbeau)in cast...The idea of 12 men living in worst and coldest place in Earth, isolated for 3-4 months from any contacts with civilization and then they battle with unknown alien organism.. Thanks for idea that John W. Campbell Jr. and his short SF novel ""Who goes there""(one of best SF novels ever)...The cast was good choice for every character (Kurt Rusell and Keith David are Carpenters house actors, and rest of actors are fine in their work of acting.. Carpenter's movie has second best visual effect I ever seen in my life (Copper try to save Norris when he have cardiac arrest, second best in whole move is 'Dog Canel' scene where Bottin have help from 'dad' of Predator, Terminator & Alien, master of visual effects Stan Winston)..Kurt Rusell is great as helicopter pilot McReady and this is his best performance ever (sorry Snake Plisken but you are on second place) with his blue eyes, beard and ironic ""MIster No"" type of thinking), Rob Bottin have his best work thru the whole movie (he was 22 then, and already have fine job in best werewolf move ever ""American werewolf in London"" by John Landis (1981) and do best visual effect ever ""Jack transformation in werewolf"" - Oscar winning).This first Carpenter movie from Apocalypse Trilogy is truly master piece, and have best soundtrack score in SF movie (Razzie Award for Worst Musical Score I don't care) by legend Ennio Morricone (se Sergio Leone movies and you will know what I mean). I like that brooding, menacing bass chords that say to spectator that movie is depressive, paranoia type. Claustofobia elements is very intensive in the movie (like in ""Alien"" or in ""Evil Dead"" first two parts) and you have very good aspects of ""who is who"" and ""who is next and who I will trust"".So if you didn't yet see that movie you go on and see it right away (if you like gore scenes you have it plenty)..but if you already watch this peace see then :The Hidden - look like and very good SF movie with Kyle MacLachlan (he as FBI agent again but still goodlike in Twin Peaks)The Faculty - ripe off of alien design like ""The Thing"" but still good SF movie with young excellent actors and good director Robert RodrigezThe Thing: Terror Takes Shape - documentary movie about the movie Invasion of the Body Snatchers - both versions from 1956 and 1958, great actors and depressive, paranoia type (great ends of both movies is one best in SF and Horror genre).Play the video game caled ""The Thing"" and see comics with the same theme.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
haven't seen the original but this one is really good,"The only words that pops in my head after seeing this is sci-fi and horror, and of course, the thing. This is probably my favourite horror film. Why? Because I think the idea is simply genius. A bunch of men going somewhere in Antarctica and some creature just randomly appears in the base. OK, starting like this doesn't make that movie look any good, but the rest of the film is just so powerful. The screenplay, the actors, the plot, the intrigue, the fact that we always want to know what will happen next...all those elements make this film a true masterpiece. Why, why in hell most of the recent horror films just don't get even close to this and just keep being bad? I'm actually watching the remake of The Thing. I'm about half of it and think it's pretty good but my guess is that it's not gonna be better than the original. Plus, I find the character that Kurt Russell plays very interesting. And by the way I find this actor very flexible in his roles. Very good actor. The Thing, by John Carpenter. A must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Strong horror film,"In the summer of 1982, audiences flocked to theaters to spend time with a visitor from outer space named E.T. Around the same time, another visitor for the depths of space was also stalking multiplexes, but he was far less warm and fuzzy as E.T., and went by the name The Thing. Although it was not a box-office success upon original release, John Carpenter's remake of the Hollywood horror classic has gone on to achieve cult success over the years, and stands as one of the scariest horror films I have seen to date.Based on a short story by famed science-fiction author John W. Campbell, Jr., entitled 'Who Goes There?', The Thing was brought to the screen in the 1950's by famed producer-director Howard Hawks in what is viewed as a seminal horror classic, although it heavily deviated from the source material, and generally doesn't stand up to scrutiny for modern audiences. When bringing a new version to the screen, Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster stuck closer to the source story and crafted a tale of paranoia and isolation that works on your nerves and rarely gives you a moment to relax throughout it's running timeSet at an American Antarctic research station in the dead of winter, The Thing opens with two Norwegian scientists from a nearby station chasing a dog across the barren wasteland in a helicopter, attempting to shoot it. They arrive at the American camp and in their attempt to kill the dog appear to attack the members of the American party and are themselves killed in the process. Curious about what would lead the Norwegian scientists to follow such a strange course of action, the American expedition's doctor, Copper (Richard Dysart) and helicopter pilot Macready (Kurt Russell) make their way to the Norwegian camp and discover it destroyed and all members of the expedition dead, some in rather mysterious ways. They also come across a video recording of a recent dig the Norwegian's performed at a nearby site as well as a block of ice that was carved out of the ground and appears to have contained something approximately human-sized. Copper and Macready then investigate the dig site and discover a large saucer shaped space craft in the ice. They quickly determine that the object in the ice was a creature from another planet that was excavated and thawed out, and shortly thereafter, the dog that the Norwegian's were chasing reveals it's true nature: an alien shape-shifter that can take on any appearance it chooses, and can spread to multiple individuals at the same time, essentially replicating itself at will. Blair (Wilford Brimley), the lead scientist, upon discovery of this fact destroys the expedition's radio and all means of transport with the intention of ensuring that the alien does not spread to the outside world, knowing that if that were to happen, humanity itself would fall, replaced by replicating things.The Thing is, much like the classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a film that asks the most basic of questions: Can you trust the person sitting next to you? As realized by Carpenter and Lancaster, The Thing keeps you guessing and unsure of all the characters throughout the film, constantly putting them in situations that could lead to them being consumed by the thing, or just as easily not, leaving the audience unsure of who is human and who isn't. The tables are turned on characters several times through the film, causing our belief of who is and isn't infected to constantly be in a sense of motion. One of the film's strongest aspects is that most of the characters, while not supremely well defined, are given enough personality and individuality for us to root for them to come out of the ordeal alive, giving us a stronger stake in the events on screen. If we didn't care for these characters at all, the tension and suspense wouldn't work nearly as well.The film is also helped by a strong sense of isolation. Like many horror films, such as Alien, placing the characters in an environment with no way out gives you an even greater sense of unease, and you can feel how the characters are trapped by their surroundings, as well as by each other.One aspect of the Thing that was groundbreaking at the time was the make-up effects crafted by Rob Bottin. In the early '80s there was a rash of films that were based around elaborate make-up effects, and The Thing is one of the standouts. Almost all the make-up effects are spectacular and create the appropriate sense of revulsion and horror that they should. Some audience members will be turned away by the sometimes extreme nature of the effects, but they are actually much less bloody and disgusting than countless other horror films that came about as the decade went on. What is featured in The Thing does not feel gratuitous.Most of the performers in the Thing were character actors who were not big name stars, but they all do the job well. Kurt Russell, a longtime collaborator of Carpenter's, is effectively low-key and straight in the face of some rather incredible situations as the film progresses. He grounds us in the film and makes us believe what is happening on screen. Wilford Brimley is also notable for his performance as Blair, a man who understands the implications of the situation they are in and slowly goes mad because of it.While hardly the most original horror film, The Thing is an effective entry in the genre, and one that is worth seeing if you like being scared.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

An intense drama with horror elements,"When John Carpenter is at his best, he has no equal, and his early works are, IMHO, his best.  This one, however, is probably my favorite.  I do not consider this a horror film, but rather as an intense drama with horror elements, much in the same way David Cronenberg's remake of ""The Fly"" was a tragic love story with horror elements.  This is a character-driven piece and is a shining example of great ensemble acting.  These guys seemed to be really into their characters.  Ennio Morricone's score sounded like Carpenter wrote it himself.  It is minimal, yet very effective, especially the pulsing two-note motive in the bass.  The icing on the cake is the eye-popping visual and makeup effects, supervised by Rob Bottin and Albert Whitlock.

The best monster movie of the last 20 years,"It's only serious competition for that claim to fame is the undoubtable ""Aliens,"" which has to be the most imitated monster flick for the last two (and the trend seems to be continuing) decades.  Unfortunately, that makes Aliens a bit hard to swallow nowadays (although, that one remains J.Cameron's best work).  With everything else being a 'Jaws' retread, 'The Thing' is a bit refreshing, using a plot line that isn't done much anymore, even with its over the top effects--an isolated, spooky bump-in-the-night story.  Carpenter does a delicious job of presenting enough shadows, questions, and uncertainty to capture the effect.  The acting is top-notch, with every character a level deeper then caricature.  But clearly, what everyone remembers is the best special effects scenes ever made, and stand-up incredibly well today.  The Thing also is a credible point in the war against CGI effects: imagine those gooey episodes today, with fake-o looking CGI, for example, as in 'The Faculty,' and you can see how the animatronics and latex still are the most credible looking effects that can be used in a film.'The Thing' wouldn't be even close to successful with CGI.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The Ultimate Paranoia Film,"-This is an excellent example of quality horror cinema.  Despite it's slightly cheesy title (although very appropriate), it is a truly amazing piece of work.  It builds an eerie mood of isolation from society, creates believable characters with plausible relationships, and generates just enough gore to keep you near sickness, but not pushing the envelope.  The gore is really a subtle fraction of the disturbance factor of the film. The real suspense/fear comes from not knowing who is human and who is an alien ""Thing.""  This paranoid feeling added to the remoteness keeps this film terrifying even twenty years later.  Although the graphics are somewhat dated, I find them more frightening then some of the available computer let downs of the late 90s and early new century (pitch black).  When did Toy story become scary? I really like Kurt Russell in this film also.  He creates this kind of ""bad-boy"" hero persona into his character that really makes you like him.  The ending is also one of my favorite moving endings. Does it matter if the other guy is a ""Thing"" or not?

Back to the days of  early 80's monster horror.,"With all the fancy technology of today that are used to create all the special creature effects there are only a few films in my opinion that really have some cool special effects and the best part is all of them came out in the 80's, before the days of overused CGI.The films that stand out are A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, Clive Barker's HELLRAISER, Clive Barker's NIGHT BREED and John Carpenter's THE THING, now THE THING is the only one out of the bunch where I actually get grossed out when I looked at the creature effects, I mean as I'm writing this review this film is 29 years old and I've watched it again recently and the effects still gross me out, that's how well this film is made, put it back in the cinemas and it'll wipe the floor with every other new horror movie out there.The acting is outstanding, many of today's actors will struggle to match this caliber of performances and the plot is simple, very well paced and does a great job of creating a high sense of paranoia.Overall, its a classic worth revisiting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Psychological sci-fi thriller that works paranoia in with suspense,"If 1979's ""Alien"" was the original hypothesis that the best science-fiction thrillers are psychological, then John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is the study that proves it true. A remake of John W. Campbell Jr.'s 1951 classic ""The Thing from Another World,"" Carpenter's re- imagining is another brilliant execution of quiet suspense that gets quickly into your head and hooks into your brain.Kurt Russell, Carpenter's star from ""Escape from New York,"" takes the driver's seat again as one of a team of scientists living in Antarctica when a helicopter with two Norwegian scientists arrives at their facility trying to shoot down a husky. The Norwegians are killed and the husky lives, only the husky is actually an alien from another planet that survives by taking the identical appearance of the organisms it kills. Having had the dog in their possession for 48 hours, the men realize that any one of them could be a thing, causing a huge build-up of distrust and tension.The key part that makes ""The Thing"" stand above most other alien/creature/monster kills off a group of people one-by-one movies is that last bit about distrust. In other films, the creature is identifiable -- a shark, an alien, etc., but in ""The Thing,"" it could be any of the characters -- now that's both terrifying and awesome. Instead of a thriller where we're just curious about the gruesome way in which the creature will kill the next random dude, we get the simultaneous thrill of wondering which person the creature is. It's like rolling a mystery into a sci-fi horror film.The nice part about that dual entertainment is they feed off each other. While we're busy wondering who isn't human, Carpenter can fully utilize shock and awe when the thing actually does attack and boy, does he ever. The amount of prosthetics and mechanical devices used to create the constantly moving spool of guts mixed with slimy Venus fly traps that is the thing and the people its imitating are incredible. More than 25 years later you almost wish more films stopped pushing computer-generated images so hard and stayed devoted to developing better and better prosthetics.But can shear paranoia and suspense along with the fulfilled promise of excellent visual effects drive a science-fiction story? Apparently so. Russell is the only known actor and there's not a whole lot to the characters other than the way they deal with their fear and paranoia.Another less obvious reason ""The Thing"" works so well is the parameters the story sets up for itself. Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster establish a very specific set of rules for what the thing is and isn't capable of, even going so far as to show us the science of how cells from the thing devour other living cells. We know that the thing only reveals itself when its alone with its victim and that it is driven primarily by a survival instinct. These rules lend legitimacy to the story and make it much more interesting for the viewer trying to stay a step ahead of the plot.When it comes down to it, ""The Thing"" is just smart formula film-making, even though the formula arguably came after this film. It has a director with impressive horror and suspense credentials in Carpenter, who directed ""Halloween,"" one of the greatest film composers ever in Ennio Morricone to do the suspenseful, haunting score and a creature with more than meets the eye who wreaks psychological havoc on the characters and consequently, us. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
2 versions of this film,"There is a little known alternate version of this film, sometimes shown on cable television.  The alternate version features a narration at the beginning of the film, giving an ominous warning about what may be out there.  Then, as we see the characters for the first time, there is a brief narrative, covering a bit of the character's background, and the reason as to why they are in the Antarctic, on this research base in the first place. The end of the movie also features another chilling narrative, warning that a being like the 'Thing' is not necessarily a far-fetched concept.  This alternate version is used to fill time and censor some dialog, most likely to make up for the time that has to be cut for cable viewing.This is a very chilling and frightening movie...the gore is a bit over the top, however.  If you see this movie for the first time, you'll probably end up getting sick to your stomach.  It usually takes the average person one or two sittings of the movie to become adjusted to level of gore.  Otherwise, this is one of Carpenter's best flicks, and Kurt Russell gives a great performance, supported by the talented Keith David.

It's main idea is which you already know from the movie description that an thing/alien which can take shapes of any kind, so idea is interesting, but that's it, they never made it interesting or engaging, and you have to left your brain in other room to complete it, i literally watched it on 2x in second half to just complete.

'I know I'm human.',"John Carpenter's remake of 'The Thing' was buried at the box office by another visitor from outer space that went by the name of 'E.T.' But the passage of time has seen this movie gain a serious following thanks to home video, and many people now view 'The Thing' as one of the all-time great horror/sci-fi films.A group of researchers at an Antarctic science facility are unwittingly exposed to an alien organism that has the ability to perfectly imitate any life form it comes in contact with. As the gravity of the situation becomes frighteningly obvious, and with no way of contacting the outside world, the men struggle to determine who's human and who isn't, as the alien life form slowly moves through their ranks, taking them over one by one.As an exercise in paranoia, 'The Thing' works very well. The characters don't know who to trust, and neither do we. With the exception of one scene early on, no one is shown being 'taken over' by the Thing, meaning anyone could not be all that they appear to be. In the original film, the monster was a visible, hostile menace. In the remake, the monster can look and act like your friend, much like in the original short story both movies were based on. Carpenter gets maximum mileage from this concept, milking the paranoia and dread for all it's worth.But still, this is a horror movie at heart, and horror fans won't be disappointed. While the Thing prefers to stay hidden and secretive, there are numerous scenes where it is drawn into the open and/or revealed, and the end results aren't pretty. These sequences are startling and gruesomely imaginative, thanks to the shocking make-up effects done by youthful special effects wizard Rob Bottin; some of the things he comes up are bizarre and frightening (check out that 'spider-head'), and these scenes still hold up, even by today's standards. On the basis of these sequences, lots of critics dismissed 'The Thing' as a snowbound 'Alien' clone, but that's not an accurate assessment, although there are some similarities.Still, there are other scenes where the movie is effective: the opening scene with the helicopter is mysterious and strange, and the exploration of an abandoned camp where unspeakable things happened is eerie and haunting. The 'blood test' scene is very suspenseful, and the payoff will make you leap from your chair. The ending of 'The Thing' is refreshingly downbeat and bleak, and is a nice change from all those 'happy' endings we've had to endure.'The Thing' has improved with age; what was once dismissed as a 'freak show' has evolved into a classic horror/science-fiction movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Best Scifi/Horror movie there is!,"This is easily one of or the best scifi/horror movies there is. It has everything you want in a scary movie.

By far Carpenter's best,"I would have to say that I do generally like John Carpenter's films, and I feel that when he has a good script to work with, he can make an intense movie.  This is by far my favorite of his.  Usually a film like this becomes very dated very fast.  And I'm talking about special effects, sound, visuals, the works.  This one though is differant for me.  The special effects are some of the best makeup effects (which I prefer to CG) I've ever seen, and the visuals are beautiful and bleak.  The only real thing that seems to date this film is the clothing and the shots of the ""high tech"" electronics.  If you can get past these minor things, you will find that this is a gem of a film.  The story is intense, the acting is top notch, the cinematography and direction are good, and the score, a staple of every John Carpenter film, is as haunting as ever.  It's a shame that more people don't recognize this movie for the wonderful film that it is, and in my opinion, on of the best in it's catagories.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Left me wondering why I hadn't seen it sooner. Carpenter is a master film-maker.,"In the last couple of years, I've been watching as many John Carpenter movies as possible. I fell in love with Escape From New York, and practically worship Big Trouble in Little China. I love the energy that Carpenter directs his movies with, I always feel they're special and unlike anything else out there. It's no different with The Thing. My question is, how does Carpenter do it? The Thing is a horror masterpiece. The movie is based on a book called ""Who Goes There?"", which is rather fitting considering the plot. In 1980's Antartica, a research team accidentally stumble upon an alien that can change it's appearance to look like anyone through cell-transformation. As it begins to wreak havoc and mayhem upon the research facility, it becomes clear that nobody can trust anybody else. Paranoia sets in, and a perfect horror mood forms. It's all very clever.Leading the campaign is MacReady, a brave and cool helicopter pilot played perfectly by the awesome Kurt Russell. Again, Russell and Carpenter craft and amazing character together, just like their previous legend; Snake Plissken. MacReady rounds the men together and attempts to destroy ""The Thing"", but things do not go as planned.For a film made in 1982, the special effects are top-notch. They look realistic, which makes a change (the 80's was a big special effects testing zone, which wasn't necessarily a good thing). It's gory and violent too, and never did I find myself thinking, ""Oh God, why?"" Ennio Morricone composed the music, influenced by Carpenter's classic synthesised tunes. I was impressed by the main theme, a sort of basic tense number; it succeeded in keeping me at the edge of my seat. This score however, was totally different from anything I'd heard Ennio do before, which made a refreshing change.Overall, The Thing is one of my favourite horror films (and one of my favourite films, to be frank). It kept me interested and tense, whilst thrilling me for the full running time. The acting is superb, as is the direction by one John Carpenter. Ennio Morricone's score was simple but effective, and the special effects just finish off this piece of perfection film-making. In one word, spectacular.(5/5)",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Carpenter's best film...,"I know a lot of people love Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and consider it his masterpiece, but this is easily my favourite flick of his, especially as I tend to prefer monsters of the monster kind, as opposed to the human kind.Everything comes together well here...great ensemble acting, amazing effects, excellent script, incredible tension and atmosphere and great music by Ennio Morricone. Even the dog is great! This is one of those classic horror/sci-fi flicks that is great to own on DVD, as you can go back and watch it regularly, since it holds up so well. Extras on the DVD are great too.What is there more to say that hasn't been said by others here?

The missing scenes,"After Watching this film for the past 20 years... not even countable how many times I've seen this... I still can't find ANY information on the missing scenes...I seem to be the only one who noticed that there are some crucial scenes missing... and it took a lot of views to even notice it. Mostly because the film is so good and it flows along very well.In the scenes where Clark finds something weird going on in the dog pen and brings all the others back, they all watch as the things stretches long clawed arms upwards, punches a hole in the ceiling and escapes and then they burn what was left in the pen.Then the movie continues with NO ONE remembering that part of it escaped from the dog pen.So where are those scenes????",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An amazing piece of work!,"""The Thing"" and ""An American Werewolf in London"" demonstrate what you can do with some puppets, latex, fake fur, and red syrup.  And I mean this in the most respectful way.Undoubtedly Carpenter's greatest accomplishment, ""The Thing"" is a different sort of horror movie.  For one thing, there are no female roles...none, nada, zip.  In fact, there really aren't even any ""weak"" male parts. There are no individually identifiable victims or threatened individuals.  Instead there's a strange ""socialism of terror"" that comes out in teenage slasher movies and Twilight Zone episodes about the end of the world.  It's also different in that the special effects DO (as stated in several other reviews) drive the plot.  The crew of the station react to the terrifying (and often bloody) situations with a stunning combination of mystified disbelief, bravado, terror, and resignation.The beauty of this film, and where it differs from the earlier version, is that the threat to the crew is based in what is also their strength.  Up until the very last frame of the film, the men must desperately rely upon each other for their safety and security.  Yet the threat in their midst is so dangerous precisely because it preys on this need to trust others.  The men are able to destroy the creature by various means, but only when they can identify it.I won't bore you further.  See this film.  The DVD version with the commentary and features on the making of the film is a ""must-have"".",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"More than horror, an interesting study","Okay, it makes me shudder to say such cheesy things, but this movie is less a horror movie (sorry Carpenter) than a ""study in fear.""  Phew, pretentious, I know, but it's the simplest way to describe it.  By fear I mean the fear each of the characters is experiencing, not necessarily the audience's fear (although this *is* a scary movie).  As in a lot of Carpenter's movies, the premise and tone is very Lovecraftian, which involves a lot of hinting at horrors past, and horrors to come.The story is adapted from a short narrative called Who Goes There? that was made into a movie by Hawks in the fifties (I have not been able to find a copy of Who Goes There? but Carpenter's version is supposedly more faithful to the original concept).  The idea is that a creature has gotten into an arctic research station and is able to become any other organism there, whether dog, human, or something kinda between the two.  That's all you need to know.  We watch as the men at the station try to come to grips with their situation, controlling their fear while trying to decide which one of them is the creature, and most importantly, how to kill it so it doesn't reach civilization and conquer Earth.  It's a light-hearted romp for both young and old.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A re-make that works!,"I don't like remakes at all, but the original of this film hasn't aged well and it almost put me off seeing Mr Carpenters version. I'm glad I did as this particular re-make is an extremely taut and exciting film which far out strips the (rather boring) original. As you can expect from Mr Carpenter there is the usual measure of gore but in this instance at least it never feels gratuitus and heightens the tension. The characters work in the film too - sure we know they're going to get picked off one by one, it is a horror film after all, but they appear more than the usual slasher fodder. A good film, very intelligent and probably my favourite John Carpenter film",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
John Carpenter's Best Film & The Best Science Fiction Movie Ever,"I watched this movie for the first time on New Years Eve, 2003 and it made an impact on me. It introduced me to John Carpenter. At that time, I hadn't seen any of Carpenter's movies, except for Halloween, but even then I was about eight. After watch The Thing, I now own every mainstream John Carpenter movie and love the guy's work. It showcased some spectacular gore, creepy score, excellent performances, and a great story, illustrated with genuine paranoia and fear.First and foremost, the astonishing special effects in this movie are one reason to watch this movie, even if you don't like horror movies. Rob Bottin and his crew created, in my opinion, the most realistic gore effects second only to Day of the Dead. My favorite is either in the dog kennel or the scene with the defibrillator. WOW! I won't say anymore.The score, though not composed by Carpenter, is unsettling and creepy. It fits the movie perfectly and doesn't overpower it at all. To this day when I watch it, I am still creeped out by it.Even though there are 12 guys in this movie, they are so different and well developed that I can name all of them right off the top of my head. Even the minor characters like Bennings, Fuchs, & Nauls are memorable and enjoyable. Kurt Russell gives a fantastic performance here as R.J. MacReady, even rivaling his role of Snake Plissken. This man means business and I would want him to be one my side if push came to shove. Keith David as Childs is wonderfully sarcastic as usual, I mean the man is an expert at playing this role. A. Wilford Brimley plays Blair perfectly. The man can act. The other supporting characters are great too, especially Norris and Clark.The story, based on the short story ""Who Goes There?"" is adapted perfectly. The fact that it's set in Antarctica already ups the isolation factor. Add in 12 uneasy, unstable and panicky men with a shape-shifting alien that can imitate anything perfectly, and the paranoia level is cranked up to 11.This movie is one of the few movies that actually scares me. The movie itself is creepy, but after you watch it, I guarantee that it will stick with you and creep you out. Go out and either rent or buy it.

An unfairly under-appreciated modern horror classic,"Many have written John Carpenter's version of The Thing off as an overly gory remake of the 1950's horror 'classic'.  What these people have failed to realize is that, unlike the vastly overrated and campy Howard Hawks version, The Things' scripters actually read their source material, John W. Campbell's classic sci-fi tale, ""Who Goes There"".  You will be hard pressed to find a film that remains so faithful to the text off which it is based. Everything is meticulously captured, from the utter desolation of the Antarctic to the grotesque, Kafka-esque imagery of the monster itself. The cast offers genuinely solid performances, making for a horror movie that does what a horror movie should: frighten the audience while having them sympathize with the plight of the cast.  Despite its gore, the film keeps strength in characterization, making death scenes and creature attacks more tragic.  Those who write this film off as an overly gory remake should learn what makes a good HORROR film and read the original story off which the film is based.  This isn't a remake.  It's Hollywood finally doing the story justice after its butchering in the 1950's.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Scared the hell out of me.,"Over the years it seems that my tollerance to horror has lowered and i've noticed that i get scared a whole lot easier than i used to. I blame the excessive amount of splatter movies that i've seen as it has de-sensatised me from that particular genre but has increased my fear at the less noticable horror, namely psychological.The Thing is a splatter movie but it is also more than that. The splatter elements themselves only happen infrequently which leaves the rest of the film to build on the relentless tension and shear terror that the group of men feel as they don't know who the thing has infected.Setting the film in the Antarctic was a masterstroke as it creates a sense that there is no escape. I mean where are the men supposed to run to? This film also shows how computer animation has taken over from the great puppet work that used to be the norm.The effects in this are absolutely fantastic as everything looks so real. Also using the old rubber and latex technique makes the splatter look that more grotesque and gut wrenching (as opposed the CG gore that you find in films like Starship Troopers).This is also one of those films where you feel the terror that the characters feel also. As the decapitated head grows legs and runs across the floor you hear the line ""You've gotta be f*****g kidding"" from the character and the audience as a whole.John Capenter is a bizzare man as he has lost touch with his audience over recent years. Some of my favourite movies are his earlier works (this and Assult On Presinct 13 being nearer the top) but his newer stuff really is the lowest of the low (just look at Ghosts Of Mars).When watching his movies you either pitty him or remember that he used to be one of the greatest directors of all time. The latter thought is enough for me to still give him respect and repsect is what the man deserves as without him we wouldn't have Halloween or this masterpiece of cinematic horror.John Carpenter, i salute you.5/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Imagination pays off.,"I first saw the movie at age 5, 1985.

"""MacReady wants the flamethrower!""","IMDb Top 250: 174 In the year 1982, while all the other films were having a nice party, The Thing was at home, cutting itself up. You've probably heard how gross this film is, but I'll say it again: The Thing is arguably the most visceral film I've ever seen and deserves all of the praise it gets.Praise? What praise? No one liked this movie in '82. But the special effects/ make-up are so disgustingly real, you will feel sick. The creatures are so vile and spectacular it's unsettling. They are real: unlike today's CG monsters, these actors were in the same room with those monsters. It adds to the effect. The Thing was way ahead of it's time; people could be scared of the 30-year-old movie today if they saw it in theatres. (If you like Dead Space, you'll like this.) None of the acting is particularly special, but it doesn't need to be. In fact, a little fleshing out could've helped, maybe during the first half hour. I confused the characters during the film.The plot is very simple, yet very complex. Sure, you can boil the summary into one sentence, but there's much more than that. Where is it from? How did it crash? One could spend a lot of time thinking about the film. The plot moves quickly, and is always interesting. And gross.It's easy to see why The Thing is so well liked today. Ahead of it's time content and a timeless theme of paranoia and uncertainty. Ample gore and tension. Just look at the FAQ page; people are serious about this movie.

"Simply the best horror film ever, ending is exceptional cool.","When I first saw this movie I really was wondering if this was the best movie I have ever seen (honestly). The movie's paranoiac atmosphere, caused by an unknown threat, works perfectly. Despite some clichés, the style of the movie is most original. Fortunately no one has tried to continue the story of The Thing - the original film is always the better one. Movie ends just like it is supposed to: the last two characters drinking alcohol and waiting for the blank future, surviving is unlike. I hate happy endings anyway. The only reason, why this is not the best movie on earth is the acting of Kurt Russel. Don't get me wrong, he is not bad, but someone else could have been better. Never the less this is easily the finest movie in which he has been acting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Slow, Haunting, Slient... True Horror","I'll be honest, this is the first John Carpenter film I've really seen. I saw Big Trouble in Little China when I was a little kid so I wasn't paying attention the way i do now that I'm older, so that doesn't really count. This is the first John Carpenter film I have seen with an attentive attitude.Before watching this I never knew who John Carpenter was. But he always intrigued me. I'd walk through the DVDs at Borders and see John Carpenter's The Thing or Escape From NY. I wanted horror one day and bought The Thing with no expectations... Perfect purchase.From the opening to the finish I was hooked. The way the film opens with little to no music, just some synth bass popping in every so often, really makes the film more mysterious right off the bat. Why Ennio Morricone's score would be nominated for a Razzie is beyond me since considering the film and genre it fits perfectly.The fact that the crew doesn't fight the alien by going all guns blazing is very reminiscent of Alien. These aren't soldiers, these are scientists and workers. No professional combat experience here. They have to rely on their wits and their peers to survive. Tensions begin to run higher and higher as the film progresses. It doesn't get any easier as the creature picks off and replaces each crew member one by one, making the one-by-one scenario a bit more terrifying because not only are people dying but the alien is mimicking them so nobody knows who's dead and who's an alien.The special effects are top notch for the time. In fact I thing it's better than some CG effects that appear today. With CG effects the first thing crossing my mind is noticing all the imperfections. Physical effects actually feel real and much more believable, which made the transformation sequences pretty disturbing.The acting is first rate as well. All the characters felt believable as did their relationships with each other during the rising fear and tension. And Kurt Russel is a joy as always.Again on the music. The lack of music actually helps define the lonely mood and sense of claustrophobic solitude in the arctic wasteland. It deserves an Emmy not a Razzie.Final Rating: 10/10 Right on par with Alien.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

John Carpenter's Finest Hour,"In the summer of 1982, audiences were presented with 2 very different types of alien movie. Whilst millions of moviegoers were won over by the warm, fuzzy antics of Steven Spielberg's E.T. on the other side of the fence was John Carpenter's The Thing, an altogether more vile and repulsive prospect. Needless to say, warm and fuzzy won out at the box office.22 years on and vile and repulsive have given way to revered and respected. Quite simply put, Carpenter's magnificent movie has stood the test of time well and is, in the opinion of many, (myself included), his finest film and considering the work of genius that is Halloween, which he directed 4 years earlier, is no mean feat. Sure, there are gorier films that have come out in the past 20 years, but few of them carry the same clout as seeing The Thing for the first time. When it first burst onto the scene, it was groundbreaking stuff. The effects were second to none. A dog's face splitting open; a human chest opening to reveal vicious, razor sharp teeth; a head sprouting legs and scurrying across the floor - just some of the surreal treats in store. If it had been made in the last decade, most of the effects would have been created with CGI, but the fact that everything you see is 'in the flesh' only adds to the jaw dropping astonishment of seeing these weird and wonderful creations.Bucket loads of gore alone, do not a great film make and fortunately The Thing has a number of great performances along with a great story to add to the mix of mayhem. Critics often complain that films lack any real characters and that there is no one to care about. Not so with The Thing. It may not seem obvious at first, but repeated viewings highlight the individual characteristics of the main players and in spite of the situation they are in, they behave in a credible manner throughout. There is a real sense that these men have been stationed at the base for a long time and that they have learned to tolerate each other even if they do not necessarily like each other.The underlying theme of the film is trust, or lack of. As the story progresses, it becomes uncertain as to who may, or may not be The Thing. It could be any of them, or it could be none of them. Tension rises and tempers fray as one by one, they each fall under suspicion. It's surely, no coincidence that Quentin Tarantino, who cites this as one of his favourite films, took the theme of trust and used it to great effect in his own film, Reservoir Dogs.There are so many great scenes in this film, it's difficult to pick one, but highlights must surely include: the defibrillator scene; the blood test scene and of course the infamous head stretching until it falls off the table and sprouts legs and runs away. Everyone has their favourite!The ending is satisfyingly ambiguous and has provided fans of the movie with plenty to debate. Spin off comics and even a hugely enjoyable console / PC game have helped to sustain interest in the film over the years.Rumours have persisted that a remake of The Thing will appear as a TV mini-series. Please, for the love of whichever deity you believe in, don't do it!!! If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Too many times a remake / re-imagining (whatever you want to call them) has tarnished the good name of a classic film.The DVD edition of The Thing is a true gem. Crammed with extras, the highlight is the commentary track with John Carpenter and Kurt Russell. It's informative and entertaining (as Carpenter's commentaries always are) and just listen to Russell roar with laughter during the aforementioned defibrillator scene. Priceless!As a side note, it has to be said that, generally speaking, people with beards in films, are not cool. In The Thing, Kurt Russell makes wearing a beard seem effortlessly cool!If you've never seen John Carpenter's The Thing, do yourself a favour and buy it / rent it, turn the lights off, take the phone off the hook and sit back and enjoy. I envy you, I wish I could watch it again for the first time.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Awesome,"This movie is very cool It is John Carpentars best film and the best Sci-Fi Horror ever made. It is similar to Alien but is better. Some people may not like it because of the gore but i don't find it that gory at all. It is well directed by Carpentar and has a good score from the great Ennio Morricone even though it was nominated for a razzie. The story of 12 men in the south pole with no communication and no helicopter being attacked by an alien that changes form is brilliant. Kurt Russell has acts excellently as MacReady, the central character and a man born to lead.

80's movies and time,"To see this movie in this day and age, most think that ""The Thing"" is a horrible movie. I myself believe quite the opposite. We should relic the movies before computer generated animation. Movies like ""The Thing"" and ""Alien"" or even ""Killer Klowns from Outer space"". Each of those movies, while they may not be the most popular movies, is a relic and a tribute to times when a monster required work and time outside a computer screen. Sure there is a small amount of computer help in ""The thing"" but the monster and all the scenes in that movie are genuine in the fact that a real place was involved in either the in studio filming or the on location shots. Lets not think of this movie as old and outdated, lets think of it as a true horror movie that was designed to scare you not to make you ooh and ahh at the monster (Even though the monster in ""The Thing"" is one of the best movie monsters ever both visually and in pure horror",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Quite possibly, the finest movie ever made","With all due respect to the original Star Wars (which is the greatest movie of all time), this is a spectacular movie, that long after you see it, you still find yourself wondering about details. This was the first DVD I bought, and recently, TNT showed this on TV. Curious to see how this was edited for TV, I tivo'd it and was quite surprised to see additional narration and scenes, lines of dialogue were added here and there, and there was an additional ending of maybe 20-30 seconds that showed the smoke from the ruined compound and a dog once again running across the snow. The characters were all introduced at the beginning by a narrator, which while interesting to me, seemed distracting.Why do I love this movie so much? For one thing, modern moviemakers could learn a thing or three from this, as the movie posits a number of questions that are open-ended. What happens in the end? Well, if you watch Contact, everything is explained to you, which ruins the movie really (why is there hours of static?) Why did they do this? Are we as an audience so jaded that we have to have every nuance explained to us?I've seen this movie many many times, and here are some thoughts:1) I'm still not sure how Mac's clothes get found ripped up here and there, but my feeling is that this is Blair's doing.2) How the team decends into paranoia is enthralling. I've rivited to the screen everytime. When the corpse moves in the supply room with Bennings in the background...I get chills everytime.3) The soundtrack...gotta love it, a true classic. Maybe 3 notes and it speaks volumes.4) My feeling is that Childs was paranoid, but saw Blair towards the end and ran out into the snow after him. Childs never caught up to him and got disoriented in the storm.5) Still not 100% on how Fuchs dies (burned up in the snow, but how?), but my feeling is this is Blair again.Best scene? I have several candidates, such as when Norris' stomach implodes, when the Norwegian frantically digs in the snow and the grenade goes off, or when Blair appears behind Garry, but I really love when they find Mac holding the dynamite and the flare.haven't seen it? you're in for a real treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A lesson in paranoia,similar in respect to ""Alien""","Who hasn't seen this classic?I have seen it too many times to keep count,and it creeps me out each successive viewing!The special effects wern't perfect,but then again this was before C.G.I took over our imaginations.They did what they could with the materials they had on hand.I was trapped in a New York Apt. for three days (with my wife and 3 kids with no power to the cable,so the only thing we had to watch was a copy of well,""The Thing""to occupy our time.The plot is well thought out,but I have to agree with a lot of viewers that the character development was a bit nonexistent.However this may be,the stark paranoid feeling and overall dread was superb,especially with the unrelenting Carpenter-driven drillhammer score to accompany it.Kurt Russell's portrayal of a weary,cynical everyman was a delight,and given his performance,its a shame the other characters didn't get much attention.Final thought-is a sequel ever going to appear?",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Big deal.But this was made before cheap, cheesy CGI morphs. There's nothing smooth about these transformations. Much the opposite. What's so monstrous about this Thing, is that everything about its transformations is so WRONG.

Hella Good,"I remember seeing the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and thought that was pretty creepy.  This however made me excited when somebody turned out to be The Thing.  It was great when Sci Fi decided to air the movie in order to promote the video game (which is equally as cool).  I also enjoyed how there were no women in the feature mainly because it meant no love story would be included.  This is one of those few movies where you wouldn't want a thing like love to slow a character down.  Also I doubt they wouldn't be trusted just like any other person, which means there couldn't be a love story.  One of my favorite parts is in the beginning where the Swedish guy throws the grenade and goes after it.  Childs would have to be my favorite character just because of his attitude.

In some ways, that makes it a better movie than Alien:  there's no escape pod and little expectation that the beautiful woman will get killed.

JOHN CARPENTERS'S FINEST,"Far and way the best ""Thing"" that John Carpenter has ever produced. This bears no resemblance to the late 40s classic which featured James Arness as a dangerous, alien vegetable in the Arctic. Rather it is a modern version of the the original 1930's novella and follows its story line extremely well but for the likewise modern, but more cynical ending.A combo of science fiction and horror that is very frightening and could be thought of as plausible if you have an imagination and enjoy this genre.The cast led by Kurt Russell does a marvelous job and the screenplay is excellent altho some might be offended by some excessive profanity in the original release.It is a great watch and a must for fans of genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Supertastic.,"John Carpenter was probably the man to beat during the late 70's and early 80's in terms of horror flicks, and ranking as his greatest film, is most certainly the Thing. This is a creature horror, a genre that rarely hit's the mark, but most memorably perhaps with this film, and Ridley Scott's Alien, a few years previously (for the best recent example, check out The Descent). The Thing also ranks as Kurt Russell's greatest cinematical moment. This came shortly after Carpenter himself had helped Russell expunge himself from his longstanding Disney poster boy image (In Escape From New York). Indeed the collaborations of Carpenter and Russell always hit the mark, and established Russell as one of the coolest, cultest, action guys of the 80's.Here the story centres around RJ MacReady (as cool a name as you'll get in cinema, perhaps seconded only to Snake Pliskin) and his workmates stationed out in a remote scientific research station in the Antarctic. When a chopper carrying Norwegian's from a nearby station fly's over their airspace, while shooting at a husky, something seems amiss. The Norwegians seem intent on destroying the seemingly innocent dog, and after inadvertently blowing up their own chopper and wounding one of the American men, the remaining Norwegian is shot down. When MacReady and Co take a look at the remains of the Norwegian camp they discover it all but destroyed with no survivors and only a hideously mutated carcass, and a huge crater. As the film progresses we soon discover that the camp was destroyed by an alien shape-shifter, that absorbs the bodies it contacts and takes over that form (the dog, and then down the line the crew members). The genius in The Thing is, from a certain point on, Carpenter builds up the tension between the American crew. No one trusts anyone, and sanity is pushed to the limit. One by one they all get killed by the Alien, or by each other. Above the amazing special FX in this film it's the human interaction that creates the most tension. Kudo's to JC for creating a really intelligent horror.As mentioned the FX are amazing. All the creature FX are top class, and of course done long before CGI came and reared it's ugly head. The FX in this, by Rob Bottin, and also Stan Winston, outdo anything I've seen done in a computer with creature makeup etc. The film is pretty creepy and gruesome at times with some nightmarish imagery, and Carpenter pulls off some brilliant jump scares in the film, some of the most perfectly set up and timed scares ever committed to film.The cast are excellent. There's a host of characters and in the support of Russell, Wilfred Brimley and Keith David are particularly good. Kurt Russell though is the man, playing his role superbly as an actor and as an action man. People seem too quick to remember Willis, Stallone and Schwarzengger as the 80's action gods, when Russell preceded them all. Russell is after all one of the few people to ever successfully pull off the mullet.Carpenter has never exceeded his work here. It's brilliantly paced, shot and edited and Carpenter has a control over proceedings that exceeds all his other work. Aided also by a fantastically uncharacteristic score by Ennio Morricone, who does a very Capenteresque score, and something that is fully of eerie menace. This is without doubt one of the best of its genre. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the best sci-fi horror films you'll ever see,Simply the most frightening remakes ever made. The special effects were decades ahead of there time and still take your breath away today on DVD.

Deserves a 10 out of 10. Here's why.,"With a storyline that still leaves audiences asking questions, THE THING was undeniably one of the landmark horror films of the 20th century. John Carpenter's expert cinematography ensured a realism and suspense that has created a lasting impression even by today's standards.THE THING is set over a six day period where a group of isolated US scientists are attacked by an alien life form at an Artic research station called OutPost #31.From the husky's entrance at the beginning, right up until it's climatic ending, THE THING's screenplay fabulously depicts a traumatic realism which has been signature to the films lasting reputation. The story unfolds when the characters suspect that any one of them could be infected by the alien. Their fears are realised when one by one each of the team members falls victim to THE THING leaving the last remaining members to fend for themselves. Besides the outstanding acting and special effects, John Carpenters build of mystery, anxiety and panic uniquely portrays a psychological confrontation rather it does as a typical horror.Essentially however, it is a survival film. Arguably, it was the first film of its kind to incorporate horror and a  'who dunnit' theme reminiscent of genres found in murder/mystery films. Critics have therefore failed to give appraisal to THE THING for unwillingly appreciate the intricate detail that was involved in the story line. Who was the shadow on the wall? Who was first infected? What happened to the whiskey bottle? Who stole the keys? What went on in the Norwegian camp? Forget who shot JFK, who survived THE THING?This film deserves a 10 out of 10 in every respect. Any film which has sparked as much critiquing as THE THING has surly earned itself to be titled as a movie masterpiece. Rumour of a much awaited sequel has revived the film's popularity in the 2000's. But until then, fans will have to do with the DVD release and the captivating new computer game.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
You feel alive when you watch this movie...,"Just to have mentioned it, I'm up to double digit numbers when counting the number of times I've let myself become a part of this movie. To me it's a classic, maybe not due to the story, maybe not because it isn't the best movie ever made (maybe Lost Highway is?) but because of the embodying atmosphere Carpenter creates, the way he tells this simple story, the way it doesn't fully scare you, but the way it makes you feel... alive.Carpenter's The Thing is a true masterpiece in a way you are left to appreciate yourself, you may like to delve and criticise such things as the plot and characters, or you can simply not say anything about it. I love the atmosphere in this movie, the slow pace of the movie, from the start... the music, the ice, the snow, the cold yet comfortable air, the atmosphere that so surrounds you, the whole from the start to the limit of infinity, to the end. The still dense music that puts you in a mood (if you allow yourself) that makes the whole movie so perfect. Just feel relaxed.Carpenter might not be true to Campbells novel, but then again isn't the novel a story of an immense yet subtle threat to humanity, and isn't Carpenters movie that too? While the heart of the novel lies in the conversations between the scientists at a polar research station, their suspicions, their fear, fear of each other, fear of the entity... the alien... their dwellings on what it is, it's nature, why it acts like it does... and while Campbells novel is a storywise and storytellingwise original masterpiece (out of which infinitely many clones have come, storywise as well as storytellingwise, Campbell - as we all know - started the Golden Era in the 30's of science fiction novel's, the era during which Asimov, Simak, Heinleinen, Clark and the others released either some of their first or some of their best novel's, all of which somehow went over to Campbells premise of not writing science fiction stories of galaxy sized fights with heroes throwing planets at each other, but stories with a content, a premise, an atmosphere...). Carpenter's movie has a story based up on the novel by Campbell, but Carpenter doesn't place the heart of the movie on the conversations between the scientists at the research station, the scientists do fear and focus their thoughts on what it is among them that is killing and why it does so, but Carpenter has cut up and reassembled the story and tells it his own way, and he does this by simple means... that so talks to you.Set on a research station (unclear what research is actually conducted there) surrounded by cold ice, cold snow... all through the movie one sits still, sometimes jumping up or trying to control ones eyes as an unexpected gross effect takes place (no computer animated effects, real - somewhat - cronenberg styled effects, heads falling, dripping of the bodies). Still all the time, at no time control over the movie is lost, the slow, the still.. lovely paced way of bringing forth the movie is never lost, things go quiet, brings you back, small things happen, all the time the fear returns as one does not know from where the entity, the thing, will attack next, you don't necessarily get truly scared (though some things might actually accomplish that, depends on who you are), but one does feel the tension, and as such lets the movie continue, all the while... the music plays... who goes there is truly what one wonders. It's still, it's cold, the music comes in and with the visuals builds up an atmosphere I've never found in any other movie. With atmosphere I simply mean atmosphere, what is the atmosphere like in your room, still, dark, quiet..? That's atmosphere, not so fascinating being a part of the atmosphere in your room (unless one can manage to find some deep philosophical meaning with ones empty room, then it can become fascinating, but that's to noone but yourself), but being there, being a part of the air, the cold air, the icy snow covered lands, the loneliness.. the isolation and the threat... it's a thought that grows on you... scares you..I wish to avoid saying anything about the story, it's a science fiction movie, both horror/thriller suspense, but in the ground it is a movie with a story and an atmosphere that somehow talks greatly to me, not that I love the cold winter, but the stillness of the antarctic, the knowledge of the icy atmosphere, the mood, the dense - melting into - music, just helps bring this atmosphere, this movie alive...The story isn't simple, the threat is just such a well known threat, but never have the whole concept of an single entity, one single aliens threat to the whole of humanity, been filmed better...The Thing is, we don't know Who Goes There...",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
It wants to be US!,"A delightful and charming story about a visitor from another world who lands on Earth and comes in contact with several humans whilst trying to find a way home....And this, is another film where an alien being, comes down and takes the form of several humans (and dogs) trying to disguise itself and avoid being found to then return home. How similar are ET and The Thing? Both are made in 1982, both are about alien visitors and both films show the obstacles faced in their plight to return home. Well, I suppose one film is more sickening than the other (I mean how much mush, sentimentality and sweetly sick story can one person take?) But enough about E.T, The Thing has become something of an underground classic during the heydays of VCR rentals, where it's outstanding scenes can be paused and rewound to be watched over and over again. Some of the scenes within the film are jaw-dropping and it's all done pre-CGI. It's amazing what could be done in those early days of creature animatronics.The Thing is directed by John Carpenter and is probably one of his best, but unfortunately it was not a hit. A remake of sorts (John Carpenter was hugely influenced by Howard Hawks) however this is an altogether different beast. Set in Antartica, an American expedition group are interrupted one day by gunshots from a far. A couple of Norwegians are firing at a husky from a helicopter. With sporadic gunfire, one of the American scientists takes a shot in the leg. Shots are fired in response and as a result the Norwegians are killed. The dog is taken in and held with the other dogs in the camp. Unbeknown to the American group, the Husky is not what he seems. Eventually the team set out to discover why the pair of Norwegian were shooting at the dog and what they find out is beyond their darkest nightmares.The plot isn't anything original as the group is picked off one by one until there is one man standing (or in this case two), with it's remote location it's very similar to another classic sci-fi horror that is Alien....but where Alien only really has one complete genuine gross out moment, The Thing has so many that it's a wonder when you see the first gruesome transformation how they can top it... but they do. The whizkid at the time (Rob Bottin) deserves so much praise as his effects beat anything that modern special effects can bring to our screens. He was also only 21! The central themes on what makes us human and the loss of identity is dealt with in vivid detail. As men in joining the tribe we gain a sense of belonging but as a result we lose personal identity. Paranoia and trust are tested to the limit. Characters start turning on each other, they begin shooting and eventually resort to tying up one another. In one of the films more lighter moments, they devise a test to see who is human and who is not, from this comes one of the most memorable and perfectly delivered lines. There is relief amongst all the bodily gore.The technical achievements in this film is what makes it so watchable. The score by Ennio Morricone is a haunting yet deliberate heartbeat which is minimalistic yet menacing. One of the only films where Carpenter hasn't had an input on the scoring, but nevertheless Morricone's approach is very suited and matches and enhances the films eerie atmosphere.There is a lack of character development within the film (that is the only flaw I can say), and it seems that Kurt Russell's character (MacReady) is the only one who is given enough personality for us to root for. The majority are unfortunately given the basic stock character traits, though the acting by all is well above average, there isn't enough depth to them.With a tight a script, direction and amazing effects work by Rob Bottin's crew (never has intestinal and flesh mesh been so beautifully realised), it has still stood the test of time and is always a joy to watch. One of my all time favourite films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I think I'm still human - I hope,"There are so many comments here on this brilliant movie, yet I've been compelled to also write one for so long, so here we go at last.You can opt to answer if my comment is useful, well, I guess that depends on whether you've already seen The Thing or not :-)If you have, perhaps you're in a younger generation (IOW, you didn't see it in the cinema, I think ?). If so, this is an opportunity for you to take a ride back to 1982, as a teenager and the account of it on the big screen. What do you reckon ? If you haven't, no worries, this is not another user comment claiming to not spoil the movie when I think (IMO) it does.... at least to some extent - not plot-wise per se. For example, I read user comments claiming it's not about special effects... you kidding' me ? The Thing's special effects (in 1982) didn't just shock, they truly terrorised (more below on that, stay tuned)!So, let's go back to 1982. All the masses were flocking to the theater to phone home (ET). A bunch of teenagers about 15-17 - my friends and myself included -wanted to see 'The Thing'. (I personally had no desire to see ET at that time, I'd read the book and that sufficed - for now). In hindsight, I'm glad we did. Sorry - correction, a couple of mates back then didn't, I think. One ""friend-of-a-friend"" (amongst the bunch of us) came out of the theater looking pale, he felt sick (well, he looked it :-) because of the terror he just went through. Is that good ? Absolutely !Now, let me digress briefly to the special effects. I've seen my share of horror movies. Some have great special effects, sure. But this is 2009. Terminator 2 presented a quantum leap in CGI. But James Cameron thought it through, as usual. He knew then that CGI is - or should be - the last resort, not the first. The team that ensured The Thing delivered its full impact beyond the nightmare story, using every resource available at that time (CGI wasn't one of them), succeeded too well it seemed. Rob Bottin's (yes, even Stan Winston) willingness to push the envelope - of course with the help and synergy of many other brilliant minds - did something I have/had never seen in a story on the screen : I spent years, stumped ... speculating how on earth the movie's visual juggernaut was conceived and punched into my face... And I couldn't figure it out. (not until the fine day I got my hands on the special edition DVD).Now, again, consider this is 1982 ! I can't muster another movie title where I've wondered how it looked ""fake"" in other words, how it was done. All others are fake ; some take little effort to conjure up or accept the story's reality, many need a willing mind and some effort. That's not necessarily bad of course.Now back to the future, today. It's 27 years on and this movie still manages to either make you think you're human (you hope) when it picks you up and immerses you into the story of this ""frozen dozen"" characters. They're isolated, exhausted and too terrified to even consider sleeping. But one or several are hoping they're human - I think - but are probably not. Why ? Because something has infiltrated them, or should I write, 'some THING'.So, if you're still reading and you didn't see the movie then I urge one of 2 things. Rent the movie or buy the DVD movie (I did the latter). OK, now proceed with your favorite ritual (you can get popcorn, I'm not sure if you'll actually remember you have it while viewing:-) and get ready to watch film making that is so brilliant that the audience wasn't fully ready for it in '82, sadly underscored by lack of ""box office success"". I'm not even sure about 2009. I have flagged this Chef D'Oeuvre to a few younger friends asking to see a ""scary movie"" when thirsty for more of today's gore entertainment.... most have afterwards admitted they got too scared and didn't see it through :-)So, are you game ? Ennio Moriconi will give you a taste with his introductory sound score, that this story will finally thrill you as you were promised. If you're anything like me, it'll do so much more. Every line of dialogue is great. The actors' performances are outstanding and utterly convincing. (perhaps save for a single line ""What do we do now"" by Donald Moffat). But Moffat and all other 11 are discerningly cast near perfection and clearly spilled their blood, sweat and tears, it seems, to bring these outstanding performances.To close, it's quite hard to fault The Thing when put in its context. The lighting is perfect, the sound and dialogue is, the score is. And a handful of dark humour will make you laugh, but I did it afterward - when I was able to - back in 1982 when I got every cent of my pocket money's worth paying my cinema ticket.I'm sure you will treasure The Thing's special DVD edition after you've added it to your collection... I did and still do. Finally, in my opinion John Carpenter brings you his best direction and breathtaking camera work in this movie.(DVD purchased in 2004, watched every 3-4 months or so since, the last viewing earlier tonight).",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Trust no-one,"John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is a rarity among movies. It's a remake of a classic (""The Thing From Another World"") that managed to eclipse the original. It did so by hewing closer to the source material (John W. Campbell's classic novella ""Who Goes There?"") and by showcasing some incredible visual effects.The story concerns a group of American scientists stationed in the Antarctic. In the film's opening, they encounter a group of seemingly mad Norwegians frantically pursuing a dog in an attempt to kill it. Unbeknownst to the Americans, the dog is actually an alien that assumes the shape of its victims. When the Norwegians are killed, the dog is taken in by the Americans and begins to turn them against one another.The plot is rife with paranoia as tensions arise over who may or may not be an alien in disguise. The story is as bleak as the Antarctic wasteland that provides its background but is enlivened by the extraordinary special effects of Rob Bottin (and, in one sequence, Stan Winston). Admittedly, not all of the effects have aged equally well but there are several memorable sequences scattered throughout the film.Meanwhile, John Carpenter's direction shows a deft control of building suspense, maintaining it and, ultimately, paying it off with unexpected scares. Another vital element in the film's atmosphere is the icily foreboding score by Ennio Morricone.In terms of acting, though, I find the movie to be fairly undistinguished. Kurt Russell's OK in the lead role but I find that he's better suited to lighter material (eg. ""Big Trouble in Little China""). The supporting cast includes a few recognizable individuals like Wilford Brimley and Keith David but, for the most part, the ensemble's composed of relative unknowns who perform their roles satisfactorily though unexceptionally.Taken altogether, ""The Thing"" is a well-executed horror/sci-fi movie that's deserving of its cult status. The special effects may be the main attraction but the story is equally important in the scheme of things. John Carpenter and company undoubtedly delivered a movie that was worthy of its landmark predecessor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Hits You Where it Hurts,"One day in the mid-eighties, I was paying a visit to a dear friend of mine, and his girlfriend. I discovered there were quite a few other people there already, and they told me they had rented this movie, apparently a horror-movie on VHS. So, I joined in the watching - totally unprepared for what was in store for me. I sat there, in their sofa, surrounded by lots of people but in spite of that the film so affected me and wrenched me away from reality that I had to steel myself not to reveal the HORROR that gripped my whole body! I felt totally alone, exposed to that extreme terror that was shown in this film.I have this 'condition', that when I see a truly good horror-movie, my body starts to tremble. And I mean tremble uncontrollably. It isn't that obvious and you can't really notice it if you aren't looking straight at me when it happens. But ooooh gawd, did this film make me tremble. The same happened when I, as a 14-year-old boy saw the first ""Alien"" film. This time though was absolutely the worst.And as I was trying to get a hold of myself, the film just progressed and got even scarier.Afterwards, I had to admit to being 100% scared out of my pants, even to my friends. We all were a bit shaken and had a hard time returning to this mundane world, as the thoughts of the film still haunted us.This is the Numero Uno of all the horror movies I've ever seen. And I've seen quite a few, as I'm 38 years of age when writing this.And the most important thing about this film is, that it's made long before the CGI graphics of today, and yet is even better than what they make today.

"My Opinion, For What It's Worth","This picture is horrible. Just horrible. No touchy-feely messages or situations, no annoying ""dark comedy"" relief, no wall-to-wall, headache-causing audio-visual effects such as are found in most more recent monster flicks. Just enveloping, grinding tension and suspense, with paralyzing hostile-creature sequences.In short, it's everything a monster movie ought to be.Having grown up in the 50s and 60s and thoroughly enjoying the 1951 ""Thing From Another World"" and all the renowned monster pix of that time, I'll say now that this movie, for me, tops them all. I agree most heartily with many co-commentators that the atmosphere (right from the opening titles), special effects, characters and musical score are near matchless among sci fi-horror efforts. I've seen the movie easily over a dozen times, and to this very day I still tense up when anticipating certain scenes. Ennio Morricone's potent, steel-cold score, distributed through the picture with a master's perfection, compounds every gripping situation in the story-but then, what else should we expect from the man who gave us the famous ""Clint Eastwood Theme Song"" in ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" (yeah, it was him!)? Also, the film is not ruined by stupid ""politically corrected"" character stereotyping, such as is seen in ""Independence Day""; you can actually relate to these poor, besieged stiffs, which is really essential in achieving the suspense needed in any horror movie. I refuse to inject any spoilers- I'll only say that this John Carpenter thriller about Antarctic scientists thrown into a tense, deadly battle against a vicious alien intruder deserves a seat alongside ""King Kong"" (1933), ""7th Voyage of Sinbad"", ""Alien"" and very few others as one of the greatest monster movies of all time...that's my opinion, for what it's worth.My suggestion for viewing ""The Thing"" is: at night, alone, preferably in the wintertime, with a large screen and multiple speakers if available. If you're a connoisseur of chick-flicks or ""E. T.""-type movies, forget it.10/10 on this one, folks. God bless one and all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A terrific surprise,"When my boyfriend and I decided to watch this movie, we dove into it thinking it was going to be a rather amusing, easygoing piece of classic 80's horror movie with clichés and bad effects. And that is was similar to Alien. That's all we knew and we didn't expect much. So the movie started and we giggled at the cheesy characters and bad haircuts (Kurt Russell, as always, is a gem), as you do. Then along came the scene where the dog mutated and we both fell silent in awe. Occasionally, one of us burst out saying ""WOW"". I could not have been more surprised or terrified.If you are a fan of over-the-top 80's gore effects, seen in e.g. Cronenberg movies or the Evil Dead trilogy, you are going to love The Thing. This movie went to such an extreme level of gory mutation and body horror that I can only really compare to the ending of The Fly. Yet, even if the extent to which the body horror is taken is some of the most extreme and in turn ridiculous I've seen in any movie of this kind so far, The Thing never loses its finesse. As horrific and disgusting as they are, you still always look forward to the next mutation scene, just to see what new thing they can think of next. The Thing is one of the absolutely most creative horror films I have ever seen.But The Thing was much more than just the gore. In this movie, John Carpenter once again proves he is the master of build-up. The tension, partially thanks to the skillful camera-work, never stop creeping under your skin throughout the story and never lets you stop keeping guessing. The characters themselves are unable to trust each other, and for the viewer, it never gets less obvious who you can trust or not. It manages to always keep you on the edge of your seat.The Thing only really falls short in the boring soundtrack and the flat characters with little to no personality, except for Kurt Russell, whose character is unnecessarily crass and hard to relate to as the hero of the story. But with that said, it's hard to believe the hatred the movie first got upon release (Roger Ebert, I'm looking at you!). The Thing is surprisingly enjoyable, especially for its genre, it really stands out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Scariest movie I have ever seen,"I did not know really what to think when I first started to watch this movie. Actually, I did not even know what it was about or who was in the movie. It turned out to be the scariest movie I had ever seen. It stars Kurt Russell as a member of a expedition team in Antartica. They then come across an alien that takes the shape of people. It is probably the scariest when the alien is taking shape into the other people. It is also very suspenseful when they have to figure out who is an alien by testing their blood. I think it is a very good movie, that deserved to be watched. It is up there with Halloween and the Escape movies as John Carpenters best movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Quite possibly the finest movie ever made,"I'm totally serious, this is a work of art. The setting, acting, plot everything is TERRIFIC. Top notch psychological thriller. I love this movie so much it was one of the first DVD's I bought. Hell I bought a DVD player just so I could buy this movie on DVD. This movie is up there with the original Star Wars in terms of my devoted reverence.What makes this movie so great? It's the feeling of helplessness so far away from any sort of rescue. It's the complete unknown. It's watching in grim fascination how this group dynamic completely becomes unhinged. When the monster first appears it is so GODDAMN frightening that you are just awestruck, along with the rest of the all male cast. It's that surreal theme of just a single repeated note.... It's the way the ending is left completely ambigious, something Hollywood seems to have forgotten how to do. Remember Contact? Why have ""we have 17 hours of footage"" comment at the end instead of leaving it ambigious, promoting eternal wonderment and use of your imagination to decide for yourself how it all turned out. The Thing is a wonderful, terrifying, utterly captivating what-if social experiment that far transends it's b movie, horror/sci-fi categorization. In fact in that category it is it's Star Wars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

wow,"what can i say? a gem in carpenters distinguished career. this is one of the most underrated films ever. perhaps its because it was so dark and gloomy that many people didn't see it? the haunting music and the isolation of the scientists certainly adds to the eerie feeling of the whole experience. i must say the alien is very interesting, not since alien (1979) itself have we met such an interesting and indeed deadly creature. it hides out among humans by imitating them. very novel! there are large amounts of death and gore in this film, so it shouldn't be seen by people with weak stomachs or reservations. its based on a book called 'who goes there' which was also the inspiration for the thing from beyond space, which is what this film is a - superior, in my opinion, which is a rarity, like oceans 11 - remake of. the effects in this film are good for a 1982 film, and very realistic as well, this is for me a triumph of cinema, and a truly great film. 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The most perfect alien film ever made...,"From the opening shot and accompanying (and memorably haunting) Morricone score, the scene is set: A helicopter chasing a seemingly innocent dog through the Antarctica wastelands.And Kurt Russell's (MacReady's) first appearance is also characteristically anarchic and stubborn: calling a computer chess program a ""cheating bitch"".This film's plot is spot on. The acting feels real, even with the (now dated) mechanical props. The all-male ensemble cast (with some classic B-role actors acting perhaps their life's roles), the claustrophobic set, the palpable personal tensions between diametrically disparate characters... then add to all that a near-perfect alien entity that melds with whatever it touches. Human or otherwise. One word: Atmosphere! The biggest tribute this film has ever had is that NOBODY has ever had the brains or courage to try a remake or a sequel.You think of some of the top-rated films here on IMDb - or anywhere really, films that stand by and for themselves, such as Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption, 12 Angry Men, The Usual Suspects.. and you will know that they were great and remain so purely on their own merits.Well, The Thing is the same. There may be many Star Wars, many Aliens, many Predators... but there is only ONE The Thing.Why? Because apart from its seamless plot, it has possibly the best ending of any Sci-Fi flick ever made. An ending that's simultaneously so open yet so unequivocally definitive.Enjoy. This is Carpenter's masterpiece.

This is the film that turned me into a Carpenter fan,"For me, a ten-star film is one that never dies in my memory, and yet can be watched over and over again with the same pleasure as the first time. This could be a technically flawed movie; the pleasure has nothing to do with spit-and-polish (my personal top-ten is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is one of very few films to fit this criterion.I've been a science fiction fan since I was a child in the Sixties, and I read the John W Campbell short story on which the film is based (""Who Goes There"") before I saw the original, black-and-white Howard Hawks film (as with a lot of people, that viewing was illicit, on the TV, when I should have been in bed!). That movie, as with so many that you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed near perfection: the suspense, the inexplicable nature of the alien, the photography; it all just seemed to work. I watched it many times in the years after (and still do, when it is shown on TV). Because of this, I avoided the Carpenter version for years - seeing remakes of one's favourite film is, I thought, always a mistake. When I did eventually watch it sometime in 1988/9, again on TV because there was nothing else on, I realised that I need to change ""always a mistake"" to ""usually a mistake""! Carpenter had produced something different from the original film, closer to the original story, and truly wonderful. From the opening scene of the helicopter and husky, through the viscerally disturbing scene in the dog-pound, to that ending (sorry, no spoilers here!), I was hooked. The sound track alone lives with me - all I have to hear is a close similarity to that bass-over-snare drum beat, and I'm *in* the final scene again ...Until seeing ""The Thing"", I had Carpenter down as just another gore-monkey, based only on comments and reviews in mainstream press. Since seeing ""The Thing"", I think I have seen most of his movies - I haven't gone out of my to do so, but if one comes up, just seeing his name as director is enough to make up my mind to watch it. He is thoughtful, and knows how to build a film up so that it reaches a point at which something will stick in the memory.If you haven't seen ""The Thing"", and you enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favour - sit down in a dark room, wrap up warm, and prepare to have your memory enhanced!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The best horror movie ever.,"This is simply the most underrated horror movie ever. It is also the best.When I think horror movie, The Thing is the first movie that comes to mind.Horror movies in my mind are partly special effects. This movie is partly special effects, which is what all the critics couldn't get past. Horror movies to me are also mostly psychological. If the movie can hit and maintain that one disturbing note than it has worked. The Thing keeps that note vibrating through the whole movie. The intrigue and tone is set in the first five minutes.(Not the unnecessary opening titles) What a great way to start a movie and make the viewer think.Yes this movie has incredible effects but they are all secondary to the story. This movie works on so many different levels you can't pigeon hole it because of it's special effects. The special effects are just what's on the surface. The movie works because of the story.The Thing actually makes you think. It's kind of a twist on the who done it mystery.Everything works perfectly. The simplistic heartbeat like score from Ennio Morricone. The isolated setting. The acting. The editing. The great cinematography.Although each character isn't overtly developed, there is a lot of subtlety (something all too rare today) in each performance.This is probably Kurt Russell's best performance. Not that he has a lot of dialogue. It's all in the facial expressions and what he doesn't say but rather communicates with body language. Like when he removes his hood in the climax.Another key performance is Keith David's. Watch his fearful face when he is tied up. His performance in this has made me a fan of his work ever since.Everyone is good in this movie.Other than the effects nothing is thoroughly spelled out for you. It's up to you to figure out just what happened off screen. Something they also don't do anymore. Everything is now hammered into your head.The scariest things are what your own mind comes up with when posed with a few facts and images. Sometimes it's scarier when you don't see the monster. This film really couldn't of done this with respect to the monster but it did make use of that concept elsewhere. Even though it's kinda like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It works better this time knowing what the monster's ghastly intentions and forms are. Instead of the ""don't get caught ""(sleeping or awake) mentality of Body Snatchers, The Thing's mentality is best summed up by the original story's title ""Who goes there"", which I recommend reading.Great line from the movie.""You gotta be **cking kidding.""Note: Buy this on DVD, it has got to be one of the most comprehensive and feature packed DVDS out there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the best.,"It's true, The Thing is one of the best horror/sci-fi movies of all time, definitely the best out of John Carpenter's Apocalyptic Three (The Thing, Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness).There are certain movies that can make me love/hate a certain actors and actresses and The Thing is the movie that made me love Kurt Russel. Playing the part of MacReady he comes across as one of the more memorable bad-ass heroes in our time: long hair, full beard, shotgun, whiskey and the weirdest hat i've ever seen in a movie... what's not to love? Okay, that aside, the acting IS stellar. Paranoia and suspicion are the leading emotions in this film and you really begin to wonder which of the handful of men in the outpost are infected by the alien. Keith David and Wilford Brimley are definite stand-outs in the acting department.The special effects are also quite a treat. Considering that it was released the same time E.T. was they're both realistic, disgusting and terrifying.... hilarious, if you, like me, have seen the movie upwards of twenty or so times.It's nice to see a horror movie without the dynamic of love, sex or romance in it. This movie is raw and brutal. Once you've seen it there wont be many other horror movies that can really 'do it' for you.I can't recommend it highly enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie,"I saw it in 82 when it came out, and many times since. One of the best horror movies. I highly suggest this movie.

the best sci-fi /horror crossover along with alien!,"I am not a horror fan but I am a great admirer of John Carpenters work and, having helmed such classic films like Escape from New York, The Fog and Halloween I believe he is a very understated director. The Thing is possibly his greatest achievement and has all the ingredients you don't see in the horror genre today.For a start the casting is superb, the Kurt Russell/Carpenter marriage is on top form here again as Russell gives gruff coolness to the anti-hero Macready. The rest of the cast members also excel in their roles as they are faced with a terrifying and insurmountable foe from outer space. Ennio Morricone's score adds to the tension and becomes kind of an extra character creating a feeling of isolation for the central protagonists. A vital ingredient for any horror flick.The effects are quite simply years ahead of its time, and I would say the creature still stands as being possibly the most highly original of all time. The idea of having an alien being an infection is a landmark in the genre if compared to such modern bores like monsters in caves or hillbilly cannibals. when the creature reveals its form it is truly heinous and revolting. The death scenes are amongst the most inventive I've seen on celluloid and it will be a long hard stretch to be beaten even by todays technological standards.All in all The Thing is a prime example of how the genre should be projected to the audience and still sets the benchmark for suspense horror today.

One of the best horror films ever.,"This is, quite simply, one of the best horror films - ever. I can recall the first time I saw it, in 1985 or so, after it had come out on video.   I was about 5 or 6 years old then.  I had seen C.H.U.D., a couple of Nightmare on Elm Streets, and even a Friday the 13th or so, but not a single one of them had scared me. This film changed that (to this day). This is the only film to have put a little fright into me. Back when you had to think of special effect (instead of having one guy with a vivid imagination, and 124 computer geeks-like today) this film maximises a lot out of a little.  A great story, good acting, and a satisfied customer - three things that rarely go together when discussing horror films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
turn off the lights and the heat,"The Thing was released a few weeks after E.T. in 1982 and Blade Runner was released a few weeks before E.T., resulting in dismal box office for both of these films. Blade Runner has, of course, gotten its due over the years, but The Thing still hides in relative obscurity (perhaps in one of us...get the flame- thrower!). While not as groundbreaking a classic as Ridley Scott's masterpiece, it's certainly worth repeated viewings. It is a good ol' fashioned scary movie, and certainly Carpenter's best work. If you've only seen in on TV with commercials or on cable a dozen years ago, see it again (if possible a wide screen copy as Carpenter used the 2.35:1 screen beautifully to create a mood and place). No stupid cop-out endings or cheesy one-liners here, just great storytelling. Best seen at night, during a snowstorm, with the lights and heat turned off.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
a throwback...,"old movies bring back memories, let's face it.  it's not the quality of the story line, acting, music score or cinema photography that necessarily draws us back in, it's instead what the film represents in terms of remembering where we were, who we were with and what we were doing in our life at the time of the films original release.I watched this movie again the other night, 20 years after I saw it in the theater.  In 1982 it scared the hell out of me and I felt it was one of the most suspenseful films I had ever seen (to that point).  Re-watching it, this time with my 16 year old, I found it somewhat hokey, and my daughter's laughter (at the gruesome parts) reconfirmed what I already knew: what scared people in '82 is not what keeps them on the edge of their seats in '02.  Our kids are used to a world of realism (a.k.a. terrorists) and mutating organisms just don't hold them spellbound.Still, I really like this movie, even after all this time has elapsed.  In an age where most special effects are 100% computer generated, I found this film's most gruesome scenes original and refreshing (for they were 'state of the art' back then).  At the risk of dating myself (I've already done that!) I have to say that I'm more drawn to this genre of film circa early 80's style, than I am to most of the content that comes from Hollywood today. I also love the character development on display here.  It's great stuff.I never saw the 1950's version of this flik.  I was plenty satisfied with this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Ennio Morricone's simple yet eerie musical score is also a big asset by adding to the tension.The film has many memorable scenes from the dog's gooey transformation, the guy's stomach turning into teeth and chomping off the doctor's arms and the severed head that grows legs and scuttles across the floor.  Now come on, what other movie alien has ever done that?!I first saw this film on T.V. about five years ago and I remember being astounded by what I was seeing.

Carpenter's Genius on Celluloid,"John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is a fantastic sci-fi/horror film with an interesting story and good special effects (for 1982). Carpenter turns what would've been a lesser film in the hands of another(except possibly the great Quentin Tarantino)into a slam packed film in which the suspense is great and the various revelations pose more questions than answers. Kurt Russell oozes cool as helicoper pilot MacReady who only wants to get out of Anarctica and go home. The plot is one of my favorite aspects of the film: a remote Antarctic research station is infiltrated by a creature that is thousands of years old and can assimilate any body and become a carbon copy. Paranoia and fear run rampant as the residents try to discover which one of them isn't who they claim to be. The writing can get corny at times but the script hold tight enough. Carpenter's direction in the horror genre is untouchable and this film is a glaring example of why.

"Great, scary flick, even almost 25 years later","The Thing explores trust and fear, and you find yourself wondering ""what would I do?"" throughout the movie.

It keeps you interested with the plot, the twists (who are the good guys now?), and the scary parts build and then jump right out at you throughout the film. You're kept guessing even up to the end and after it's over. I remember renting this movie around 1983, when I was 22, and after it was over I thought about how spooky it was for a couple days.

Who says remakes are never better than sequels?,"John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is an absolute masterpiece.  This film is flawless in nearly every aspect, and really proves how talented John Carpenter is as a filmmaker.  From Dean Cundey's stark lighting to Ennio Morricone's solid minimalist score, this film reeks of greatness.  A true compliment to pay the film though, is how John Carpenter is able to take the large cast and make each character unique and interesting.  It could have become confusing in the wrong hands, but John Carpenter is able to balance character development in with the plotting seamlessly.Although all the actors are excellent, the real star of the show is Rob Bottin's ground breaking special effects.  As I write this in 2003, his effects work in ""The Thing"" have yet to be beat.  Simply amazing gore work is featured throughout the film that is so gruesome and shocking it will have even the toughest of viewers turning their heads.With all the gore featured throughout the movie, it is amazing how Carpenter is still able to generate suspense by stressing the unseen.  He is not merely making a gore picture, he cares about scaring the audience.  Some scares come from the gore, but most of them come from the build up to that gory moment.  The long tracking shots inside the claustrophobic station are particularily effective.The icing on the cake with ""The Thing"" is Carpenter's perfect apocalyptic ending.  This is a dark film, and the ending does not cop out with some sappy rescue scene.  The ending is true to the themes and characters of the film, and is one of the best in history.  The last line of the film beats ""watch the skies"" from the original ""The Thing"".  In fact, everything about this film upstages the original.

Brilliant,I am a really big hater of horror movies because usually they use semi scary jumpscares and an eerieish atmosphere to distract from poor writing but this one was brilliant. Everything about this was exactly what you would want a horror movie to be.I don't think there was a single jumpscare in this film yet it was borderline terrifying. The entire atmosphere of the movie was really chilling and made it feel like there was something out of place. The special effects in this film were crazy good.

Still Holds Up Beautifully,"If you love mystery, scares and old school special effects that make CGI look like pure, unadulterated garbage, then you'll love this phenomenal story from Bill Lancaster.This is by far, John Carpenter's best film, full of grit, fear, conflict and circumstance. With a strong cast of characters and sometimes virulent dialogue, Dean Cundey's subdued cinematography allows us to fill the chill of the Antarctic station and establishes a visual tone that is just plain disturbing in its isolation. Haunting music that permeates the psyche, and Rob Bottin's outrageously mesmerizing special effects, will transport you to another world of shock and awe.Better still, the story is rock solid, loaded with little enigmas that keep the audience guessing even after the credits roll.Do not miss one of the strongest and most profound horrors of all time.

Yes folks, this movie combines the plot of the original movie with a monster that constantly metamorphoses like the ""Alien"" and one that can also replace unsuspecting humans with perfect (albeit extra-terrestrial) carbon copies. In addition to being a great sci-fi/horror/action flick, John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" also has a great element of suspense as well: who is really human and who isn't? Only ""The Thing"" knows for sure as it goes about killing off the motley crew of losers and misfits forced to deal with it and replacing its' victims with perfect look-alikes! Needless to add, this doesn't make things any easier for our ragtag and mostly gutless heroes, who are at each other's throats every time someone gets killed since they all suspect each other of being the extra-terrestrial murderer.

John Carptenter's Greatest Masterpiece,"I saw this film back in 1996 for the first time and have since never been without a copy in my library. I watch it at least 10 times a year and each time I see something new, make new assumptions, and get the same excitement from watching it.The original ""The Thing From Another World"" was typical grade-B sci-fi move that was actually quite well-made for its day: unfortunately, the monster was James Arness in a suit and essentially a vegetable. Even today Hawk's version seems to get more accolades than Carpenter, but in a strange and rare twist, the remake is actually phenomenally better.The Thing takes place in Antarctica 1982 and subjects a team of Americna scientists, mechanics, pilots and fuzzy radioman to an alien life form that can assimilate any organism it touches...anything. The team has to figure out who' human before spring allows it to escape. Because the thing is an imitator, it has no singular shape, so every time we see it, we see only a mass of blood and flesh from other lifeforms it's assimilated over its travels in space.The characterizations are admittedly weak because we don't have the time to get background, but in a way, this works because when the thing possesses someone, we're left to wonder what clues it gives away,if any. Nevertheless this has some superb acting by a wonderfully interactive ensemble cast that definitely puts Keith David into his ""always bad-ass"" character that he plays so well.Other than that I feel that this film is The Perfect Script. It's not too long, not too short, has a brisk and energetic pace, leaves plenty of clues hidden and obvious, great material presented in the right way, and is one hell of a mystery than can cause you to look back over and over again for any possible clues you may have missed. I've since noticed almost no continuity mistakes, but am always discovering new clues and hints. This film is THE blueprint for studying the structure and execution of a suspense film, much more so than many of Hitchcock's films.No other film by John Carpenter has ever managed to be as perfect or as outstanding or enjoyable as this (although They Live was fun), and I would recommend it to anyone who has not seen it.

T., The Exorcist. Is it a better horror film than The Exorcist? Not even close. Simple minded young viewers , BEWARE.Review:
Now The Thing in and of itself is a very well done film from John Carpenter. I quite enjoyed the opening and Kurt Russell's character as the aggressive leader against the unknown throughout, ( particularly enjoyed his whisky throwing moment when losing to the computer at chess).The Thing holds some of the best special effects you can witness from a film made prior to the advent of computer animation. Its not only dazzling, but so realistic and is what I believe makes this movie worth watching. It is solely in this that makes this film stand out.The story however, can only be so great, as the plot is narrowed on finding who and what is the Thing and asking: who to trust? Who is next? There are brief moments where worry for the characters well being lessens as The Thing tends to be easily killed early on.However, Its ability to constantly act as a parasite that never fully dies with ability to mask itself among the humans makes it a most difficult conundrum among the humans. The film has one of those 'discuss and debate' endings.Overall spectacular, in terms of alien movies i put it slightly inferior to 'Alien' but in the horror genre this is easily top 10, just not 1--and i mean that objectively.-J.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
an excellent exercise in suspense and character writing,"I am 15 years old and i love horror movies. the reason that i believe this is John Carpenter's masterpiece is not only due to Rob Bottin's amazing and grotesque special effects, or of Ennio Moccorone's haunting score, it is because of the care and time put into writing believable and sensible characters. All of the actors (especially Wilford Brimley)execute their lines and actions very well, and they make it seem like the characters handle situations much like a real group of people would. another great aspect of the film is the atmosphere presented in each set and location. all of the suspense is well executed and the scares are not expected upon first viewing. the kills (or transformations rather)are inventive and truly frightening.This movie was ahead of it's time for 1982, and remains an essential classic for any horror fan.i just hope that it won't be remade like the fog, another Carpenter classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Sci-Fi Horror at it's best,"This is an absolutely great movie, definitely Kurt Russell's best ever.John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" holds my top spot among Sci-Fi horror films (in a tie with the original Alien).  I can think of no other in that genre that comes close to those two.  I have watched it over and over again and pick up new little subtleties each time.  If you have not seen it, check it out ASAP.  I wish they still made films like this rather than the crap Hollywood puts out today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
John Carpenter's finest; an underrated masterpiece,"An alien theme plays as a helicopter flies across the South Pole landscape. Below it is a wolf dog, running through the snow. Apparently, the helicopter is chasing the dog. The pilot emerges with a gun and begins firing at the creature as it runs towards a base of American scientists.Soon, this doesn't sound as strange as it seems. Kurt Russell stars as the American scientist who learns the secret of the creature: it's over 100,000 years old, frozen beneath the ice, and ticked off. We also learn that if it reaches civilization, within 27,000 hours the entire planet would be run by this creature - an alien lifeform that imitates whatever it kills. Dogs, spiders, grandma - this thing can do it. It's up to old Russell to save the day and destroy everything in sight in a blind rage.When first released in 1982, The Thing met with mixed critical acclaim - most of it bad. It was either ""not scary"" or ""relies on special effects"", but rarely would you find a positive review. Now, in the new millennium, the film is finally getting the recognition it deserves. The Thing has deservedly joined the ranks of the most famous horror films of all-time. It is even arguably more popular than it's basis, the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing from Another World.I felt the acting was excellent, especially Russell as the determined chosen leader of the team. The acting actually gives this film a documentary feeling ...Carpenter is probably the movie's second most important aspect. His direction is eerie and suspenseful - this movie helped elevate him to his current position of horror/thriller wonder. If you truly look at this film, you can tell Carpenter wasn't trying to make it scary - he wanted to make it suspenseful, although there are a few jumpy moments in the film.There's also a fitting and chilling score by Ennio Morricone. It definitely doesn't rank among the master composer's greatest scores, but it works well on the mood of the film.The most important, and no doubt the greatest, aspect of the film is Rob Bottin's special effects. They are extraordinary. Every scene involving the alien parasite is completely convincing. Whether it's a gruesome alien bursting from a dog's body, or a severed head sprouting spider-like legs and walking around the room, the effects are outstanding. Bottin proves himself to be a make-up genius.It's no wonder The Thing is a classic. It's documentary-like feel and it's creepy atmosphere are perfect. Carpenter has succeeded in making a thrilling wonder that may even surpass it's aforementioned story source. No horror, sci-fi or thriller fan should go without at least taking a look at this masterpiece chiller.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Another John Carpenter classic,"John Carpenter is one of the most influential directors in the horror/thriller genres. He has at least four classic films to his credit in my personal order of preference - Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween, The Thing and Escape from New York. I liked Assault and Halloween better than The Thing largely because of their low-budget feel. The Thing, although probably better directed, is a big-budget movie from an established and successful director who was all of 33. It doesn't have that gritty, low-budget feel that made Assault so stunning - although its certainly more testosterone fueled and there is NO female involved in the making of this film. This is the second adaptation of the John Campbell sci-fi short ""Who Goes There?"" which was first filmed in 1951 as The Thing from Another World. The original was reputedly directed by Howard Hawks but I find that hard to believe. The original was a drag, there was no atmosphere or any of that B-Movie feel that films of the period like Them! or Invasion of the Body Snatchers give fans of those films. There was also a ridiculous love interest angle which added nothing to the film. The John Carpenter remake is actually more faithful to the original sci-fi short story apart from being eminently more entertaining.The basic premise of both films is a group of scientists based at an Antarctic station come across an alien - a ""Thing"" from another world which starts attacking and killing them. A very similar theme was tackled in Ridley Scott's Alien. Alien, which is actually better than The Thing, was set in outer space and even more scary than The Thing. Its release a few years before The Thing may have been one of the reasons for The Thing's originally dismal box office returns. However, rest assured that the usual elements that make for a good John Carpenter film are all present in The Thing. Namely, great atmosphere, a good ensemble cast, thrills aplenty, a unique musical score (Ennio Morricone this time) and at least one classic scene of nerve biting tension. The classic scene in The Thing is obviously the blood testing scene which just doesn't let up on the tension - it keeps building and building.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"One of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings, and preserves a sense of dread every time","Up until the last ten minutes of its running time, John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" upholds its contemporary, well-deserved legacy as one of the best of recent science-fiction films. Actually, the picture is more of a mishmash of science-fiction and horror, with a tremendous amount of impact being held up on the part of the second. It is based on the novelette ""Who Goes There?"" by John W. Campbell, Jr. which was also the source for a much-lauded 1951 Howard Hawks film with a pre-""Gunsmoke"" James Arness and, more recently, a prequel to Mr. Carpenter's film. Comparing all three films, I think it is fair to say that Mr. Carpenter's has held up the best: it's the trimmest, the most purely enjoyable, even if it's somewhat unpleasant to watch. Then again, that was the whole idea.It's also the closest to the original story, about a research team in Antarctica composed of a large group of men who find themselves placed under attack by a shape-shifting critter from outer space, which can seamlessly adopt the characteristics of organisms (men included) that it comes into contact with and walk about undetected until it decides to change shape again. The Howard Hawks version had a monster that, as described by Mr. Carpenter, was a ""Frankenstein's monster"" as opposed to the other-worldly thing in the story, and the 1982 film.It is such a fabulous, smashing idea for a science-fiction film as well as a straight-up gross-out horror flick, which ""The Thing"" marvelously, not clumsily, combines together. One of the fabulous tactics that the filmmakers make is not giving the alien creature a definable, recognizable shape. We never see what it looked like before it started assimilating dogs, men, and who knows what else from all corners of the universe before and after its crash into the Antarctic ice a hundred thousand years ago. This in turn produces a truly effective sense of dread about the creature, as it can appear in and out of nowhere whenever it chooses to. It adds another dimension to the ""Jaws"" theory, that the unknown or unseen is more effective.And when we do see the thing, it is done with special effects so tremendous that they actually surpass the digital concoctions in its 2011 prequel. When it changes shape, its disguise starts to spurt blood and protrude with all sorts of strange figures, oftentimes from life forms it attacked before. Whereas Mr. Carpenter kept visual blood to a minimum in his classic 1978 film ""Halloween,"" here he lets it pour in spurts, hoses, and torrents from the disfigured assimilated bodies and the effect is superb. To an extent, the gross-out effect may be a show-stopper, but I think it works to a strong degree. After all, what would it really be like if a human stomach split open and a big pair of jaws appeared at ragged edges of the sliced flesh? Also effective is the decision of Mr. Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster to reduce the number of characters to a minimum. Some might find problem with the picture for only a few of them being defined, much since the alien is devouring many of them early on, this seems to be hardly a problem at all. Best of all is the way in which the filmmakers develop a sense of animosity and tension between them and this is the core effect of the picture. ""The Thing,"" while gripping and scary, is more or less a ""who's who?"" fright-tale with the cast, headed by Kurt Russell in one of the actor's very best performances, trying to decipher who is human and who is an alien in disguise. The strongest scene in the movie is when the characters, who think like human beings, learn that every part of the alien reacts to pain, so they strap each other to chairs and draw blood before exposing it to a hot needle. It combines both parts of Hitchcock's surprise/suspense theory and utilizes both of them to a hilt. The tension of waiting for the bomb to go off (or in this case, the creature to get loose) is nail-biting.The last ten minutes of the movie, do however, prevent ""The Thing"" from being a wholesome masterpiece. Its raw power, developed by the aforementioned suspense scene, begins to loosen as it approaches a climax which is unfortunately a little rushed and not striking with as much of the intended dread. It's not that the ending of ""The Thing"" is bad or not effectively done, it's just not as good as what came before it.However, this is an easily-forgivable weakness, as more than seventy-five percent of this classic is immensely enjoyable. It's a great idea done with skill and affection. Clearly, John Carpenter was in love with the original story and one can feel his affection for it in the way he has cleverly directed it. Best of all is his understanding that it was meant to be a nightmarish tale and his understanding of how much to balance the intrinsic horror and science-fiction elements. Even though it has, in a way, been done, there really is no need to adapt the story again, as John Carpenter has done it in the best way possible, save the very end. It's one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewing and still very effective even when you have seen it a few times and know what is around the corner.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"The ""Real"" Thing","Based on Campbell's book, ?who Goes There? and comparing it to Aliens, I would only say this; The Thing is far more suspenseful. Russell playing his opposite, in this case Ripley is more realistic while Weaver is more stoic. A sequel should be made. Russell and Childs as you know were still alive at the end but of course being in Antartica, there was no chance they survived? Maybe they did. It will take a good writer to act on this and add to Campbells original concept. Overall, this movie is much more intense than Alien. The 1950 version with Kenneth Tobey and of course, James Arness playing The Thing was a scary movie when I saw it the first time. It gave me nightmares! The Thing IS the best horror movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Movie excels with its atmosphere and eerieness,"Personally, horror and sci fi are two of my favorite categories, with my favorite film ( 2001 a space odyssey) and my second favorite (the shining) being 1 sci fi and 1 horror ( im assuming you can guess whoch is which) But out of all the sci fi horror films I have seen ( with alien, aliens, predator, signs, annihilation being some of them), the thing is unmatched. What makes it so compelling is one thing, its atmosphere. Watching this movie with its eerie, haunting score and the sound of the howl lf wind outside in the snow, you really feel transported to their doomed base, which makes the ensuing terror all the more gripping. Yes, alien did this well too, but that movies protagonists had that huge spaceship to run and hide in as well as those escape vessels, for the men at the research station in this movie however, escape is not an option. Furthermore, the xenomorphs from alien are more cool than scary, I had one as a toy when I was younger, curtesy of my parents.

"A genuine horror classic. ""Your popcorn will fly!""","My favourite film of all time, The Thing has only recently taken it's place as a horror classic.

It's better not to know too much about the plot if you haven't already seen the film, but pay attention during the sequence where MacReady threatens Childs and the others that he will blow up the camp. See how Carpenter misdirects us into believing that the threat is in one direction when it is in quite another. What more could we want from a horror film?The blood test sequence has gone down as the most suspenseful scene in the film, but there are any number of creepy shocks awaiting the unwary viewer.

Classic Horror/SciFi; Just Wish They Kept Campbell's Ending,"It's impossible for me to discuss John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" without also discussing several works that provided its inspiration. J.w. Campbell's classic story ""Who Goes There"" was also the inspiration for the Howard Hawks/Christian Nyby version in 1950. Since Hawks/Nyby lacked the technology to portray Campbell's shape-shifting, assimilating creature, they focus on Campbell's theme of the ""red scare"". It's absolutely true communists occupied high positions in our government, including the CIA at the time Campbell wrote ""Who Goes There"". Hawks/Nyby focused on the camaraderie of the artic crew to represent ""the American way of life,"" while making the creature a ""walking vegetable,"" feeding on blood and preparing its occupation of the earth through asexual reproduction. Thus, the creature represented the ""Communist menace"" and the scientist a ""fellow traveler. By 1955, the US government, through oppressive laws against communist in this nation, as well as the Hollywood Blacklist,had created a backlash against ""McCarthyism"". As a result, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" presented the humans as communists and the ""pod people"" as the ""fascist oppressors"". Also, in 1955, the UK released ""The Quatermass Experiment,"" AKA ""The Creeping Unknown,"" which presented a creature that possessed the assimilation half of Campbell's ""Thing"". By the time of the unsuccessful release of John Carpenter's film, the ""red scare"" portion had been utterly discarded. However, the paranoic theme of ""do you ever really 'know' somebody?"" essence of Campbell's story remained. Even better, ""movie magic"" technology had made it possible to represent the creature as Campbell presented him: a communal shape-shifter capable of masking his actual identities, but capable of viciously revealing it true multiple natures when threatened or ""hungry"". Carpenter wisely retained most of Campbell's story. Especially effective is the scene where each of the Antarctic station's crew member is tested by having a hot wire submerged in his blood. It's a pity Carpenter didn't retain Campbell's ending, which was to discover that the creature was using equipment parts to build a communicator to alert his kind that the earth was ripe for invasion. Carpenter's ending is not as plausible, but it is certainly more exciting.The television version of the movie adds narrative exposition, providing the background of each character. I believe that was improvement over the initial movie release. After all, the characters start dying off so quickly, it's difficult to identify them, much less develop some empathy. Nonetheless, ""John Carpenter's The Thing"" is taut and terrifying, a genuine classic that did not deserve it's box office failure. Kurt Russell, Keith David, Richard Dysart, Wilford Brimley and the rest of the cast turn in fine performances. Ennio Morricone's terrific music perfectly complements the dark, moody cinematography and editing. The creature effects are outstanding and quite gruesome. Only the short animation sequence lacks plausibility.""John Carpenter's The Thing"" has finally become a bonafide classic, and that's a good thing (pardon the pun). I give it an ""8"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

One of the greatest and most layered horror films of all times,"Maybe it was the timing. With AIDS rearing its head in eighties culture, the Cold War essentially having everyone fearing the end of the world but John Carpenter's The Thing just has that special something about it.Considering today's horror films are almost entirely remakes (something The Thing has had written about it for several years now) this feels original despite already being a remake in itself. There hasn't really been anything else like it before or since, unlike films such as The Exorcist or The Omen that have found their premise inferiorly mimicked countless times now.The premise is simple. Nine men are stranded in Antarctica - and something is taking over their bodies. Carpenter racks up the tension early on creating the sense within the first half hour that the entire cast could already be infected and never gives you any suggestion they are infected until the reveal. It's that sense of unknowing as an audience member that gives The Thing one of its finest strengths.Performance wise the cast are universally strong, never dissolving into horror clichés to ensure that this isn't just Kurt Russell's show nor is it just another hackneyed remake. Ennio Morricone's minimalist score only helps to heighten the tension around every scene.The real hero of the film, and its strongest suit, is make-up guru Rob Bottin creating creatures that are undeniably taken from the audience subconscious. Every time the creature is revealed in its grotesque form there's a sense that the stuff of nightmares is really well and truly out to get these people and the audience. While many horror films (including many of Carpenter's own works) deal in the unseen The Thing itself is always seen and its terrifying.The fact that the ending ends on such a note of uncertainty is all the more chilling leaving the audience wanting a conclusion that they will never get. It's that sense of unease that never leaves you. The Thing is about a lot more than just scaring its audience. It leaves you thinking. It leaves you wanting more. It leaves you in a state of unease. But then again, The Thing never really leaves you.To put it simply, utter genius",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A certain classic,"This film first caught my attention on the blockbuster shelf for a very strange reason: it had the only blue DVD case in a field of red tones. Just for the sake of it, I checked it out, and then watched it.Before my eyes unfolded a magnificent story of fear, paranoia, and survival. John Carpenter has managed to make a perfect film: the suspense is beautifully created, ramped up sharply and yet not ridiculously, the blood doesn't run ahead of the plot, but doesn't fall behind either, and the effects are great! This is the type of film that proves that CGI is nothing compared to good old models and sets.The acting deserves special mention. Kurt Russel was terrific in this film as a grim, rather solitary man with the quite apt name MacReady (kudos to Carpenter if he put that in on purpose). Hallahan, Brimley, and Carter are perfect as rather worn and rugged researchers and essential people on a small, isolated Antarctic station.As for the Thing... well, it's beyond description. Robert Frost and Shakespeare himself would fall short of a satisfactory description of the Thing. You have to see it to believe it.A definite 10/10.

A horrifying gory Masterpiece!,"A brilliant horror film. Utterly gruesome and very scary too. The Thing is a remake from John Carpenter, but please, do not let that put you off this film.

The start of the film has the alien's spacecraft hurtling towards the Earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film's title in amazing shining white and blue stating 'THE THING'. One of the best opening credits for a horror film ever.The cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their Station in Antartica is visually impressive on DVD widescreen. It must have been great in the cinema. I regret not seeing this on the big screen.Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base. All the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected. My favourite scene in the whole film has to be when Macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection, it is tense, scary and finally spectacular. I love it because its funny as well.Special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself. If he didn't get an Oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have. This is also debatable as to whether this is John Carpenter's greatest film...its certainly a gruesome masterpiece.Wait for a cold winter night. Get some Budweiser from the fridge.

Visceral Sci-fi body-horror par excellence,"In the frozen emptiness of the Antarctic, a research team finds itself confronted with the very stuff of nightmares when a vicious parasitic alien life-form with the ability to assume the form of its victims is inadvertently awakened from its slumber under the ice.Often cited as a remake of the 1951 Sci-fi flick 'The Thing from Another World', Carpenter's film is really a more faithful adaption of the original source material of the short story 'Who Goes There' by John W. Campbell Jr., and is the first (and most accomplished) part in Carpenter's so-called 'Apocalypse Trilogy' - a loose collection of films whose only connection is a brooding atmosphere of impending doom (the other parts being the slightly disappointing 'Prince of Darkness' (1987) and the satisfying meta-fiction romp 'In the Mouth of Madness (1995)). In 'The Thing' the impending doom engendered by the presence of the parasitic alien is heightened by the setting of the remote icy wilderness and the piercing sense of growing isolation born from suspicion as it dawns on the members of the team what they are up against and that no-one can be trusted as any one of them may be the Thing. Oh, and not forgetting the brilliantly ominous score courtesy of Ennio Morricone!All this being said, the real stand out quality of 'The Thing' are the special effects: gloriously breaking the oft-repeated ""leave-it-to-the-audience's-imagination"" dictum 'The Thing' serves as an exemplary example that sometimes the audience's imagination ISN'T scarier than what's on screen. In fact, the sheer visceral body-horror of the effects in 'The Thing' would make David Cronenberg proud, and indeed one scene in particular makes the famed John Hurt chest-explosion sequence in 'Alien' (that other Horror Sci-fi masterpiece) look amusing and woefully amateur! High praise indeed, and the fact that all this is done without a jot of CGI makes it both a testament to the sheer ingenuity of the special effects department and a reprimanding finger-shake to all films that have lazily relied on such computer generated effects for their thrills.Bizarrely this film was a flop upon its initial release, but time generally stands as a good judge in these matters and 'The Thing' has rightly assumed a position as one of Carpenter's best films as well as one of the finest hybrids of horror and science fiction you are likely to find outside of the Nostromo.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Perhaps my favorite film...,"I know... It isn't  ""the Bicycle Thief"", or ""Citizen Kane"", but minute for minute, i gather more enjoyment from The Thing than either of those masterpieces.

I find myself curious about the people who find themselves stationed in that far corner of the world. Carpenter never tells us anything about them, which gives us a voyeuristic feel. Great special effects and a good plot move the story along. The tension builds unceasingly as you slowly realize that all of the people in this film are doomed. The DVD version is a must own, It has so many extras that it is like getting another film free. And the color and sound are vastly improved over the video version ( yes, I own both).

The acting in this film is great along with the (great but dated) effects, but back then they were top of the line. I watched this last night and even though it's an old film it still holds it's own! I remember watching this as a kid and having to close my eyes on certain scenes. I will never forget it, those were the good days! Leave it up to J.C. to make a horror/sci fi movie in the Antarctic! I see that a new ""The Thing"" is coming out this year (2011) I hope they don't mess it up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The best horror/scifi film ever made!,"The story is based on the novella 'Who Goes There' that was beautifully written by John W. Campbell. (This movie has nothing to do with the 'The Thing from Another world', 1951 which was just cheap 1950's scifi movie-mill pulp fiction fair.) Although the story in Campbell's book took place around 1920, John Carpenters 'The Thing', 1982 is an updated version with modern settings.The characters in this movie are well thought out. They come across as very believable, unlike most of the Hollywood flicks these days. They don't say stupid things or have witty comebacks every three seconds. Nobody is cracking jokes in this film. Humor is just a cheap dialog trick by writers who aren't intelligent enough to say anything important.  The characters in this film are much more true to life. This is the story about people at their best and worst, brought about by the most terrifying creature to grace the silver screen.The action sequences can be pretty graphic. Heck, lets not mince words. This film, uncut, probably has the most horrific scenes I have ever seen in a movie. Some people may not like it because of that. But it really does add to the story and is needed to show what the characters are going through. I probably wouldn't show this film to anyone under 15 or to my Grandma though. It's not for the timid. (Don't watch this film on public TV, they cut way too much out. Rent/buy the DVD.)I think those that complain of the slow spots in this film are just too used to the brainless action films of modern times (Chronicles of Riddick, T3, Matrix, ad infinitum). I like how the film slowly builds to a crescendo. It does have a few slow spots as it builds the storyline and expands the characters. But the slow spots are just setting you up for a triple whammy that will have you on the edge of your seat. It is just good suspense! It is the perfect mixture of talk and action that is rare in todays films.Whenever I see a horror/scifi film today this is the movie I compare it to. This film is the quintessential horror/scifi. This movie has it all: a monster that is really scary, good character development, great dialog, fantastic special effects that actually add to the story, and a plot that not only builds with time but is believable. See it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Classy remake of an old classic.,"I was very suprised at how well The Thing has held up over the years. I saw it when it originally came out and only recently saw it again. Thinking I knew the movie and what was going to happen, imagine my suprise when predictability did not set in.The paranoia that sets in as they men try and figure out who's real and who isn't is fantastic and similar to ""Invasion of the body snatchers"". Their are fine performances especially by the underrated Keith David And the open ending is particulary cool. This is John Carpenters best work. one problem: The monster looks really stupid. important lesson: less monster, more suspense. The film still comes out with flying colors. 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"creepy, well acted","From the first few frames, you know this movie is intriguing...The creepy soundtrack only adds to the suspense, and the mechanical effects are astounding!.  Are there issues with the story and continuity...defintely. However you are so absorbed with the story that is doesn't really matter. Kurt Russell is very good and perfectly cast as Macready, not so macho, but tough enough to get the job done...and oh yeah its a big one for sure!! One of Carpenter's best, and a lot of effort put in by everyone involved, and it shows.  Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Monster masterpiece,"This is probably my third review here of this Carpenter classic. An American scientific expedition in the Antarctic is laid siege by a shape-shifting alien, and no one is able to stop it. Kurt Russell stars as the expedition's bearded, quirky pilot. Shot in Canada, the movie is stark and shocking at times, and the creature effects -- prosthetics, the forerunner to CGI -- are simply amazing. They look great to this day. The opening is haunting: a sled dog is pursued across frozen terrain by a gun-toting helicopter crew from a Norwegian camp. The dog reaches the American camp, and it soon becomes apparent this is no ordinary dog. It is an alien in disguise, which the Norwegians inadvertently released from its 30,000 year old frozen slumber. Carpenter respectfully pays homage to the 1951 Howard Hawks version, but takes his remake to levels Hawks could only have dreamed of. Great supporting cast, including Wilfred Brimley and Keith David. For those unfamiliar with the source material, it is a short story called ""Who Goes There?"" Carpenter's version is much closer than Hawks' to this Cold War tale. Hawks' version is essentially the Frankenstein monster loose in the Antarctic. The remake is notable for its all-male cast and sense of claustrophobia and impending doom.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Whatever happened to...,"I very rarely buy a film without having seen it first, but my confidence paid off here.

Carpenter's Best,"This movie tops horror movies up to today in story, effects, and suspense. It was ahead of its time then and it still is. The creature effects (Rob Bottin) were so cutting edge that you would think that it was made today, not 21 years ago.And since it was made in a time when getting top bill actors wasn't such a huge issue, they actors were perfect for their respective roles.The story was fantastic. No cheesy catch phrases, or lame lines that were to be played over and over in previews. Just normal dialogue among characters.The feeling this movie creates of isolation and suspicion is incredible. In movies today you have one big name who is the hero and one big name for the foe... this movie you really don't know who is going to be next... I've watched this movie dozens of times and I'm still caught off guard.This movie will remain in my top ten favorite films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Paranoia and Desperation At It's Finest,"Quite possibly John Carpentar's greatest achievement as a filmmaker. A remake of the classic ""The Thing From Another World"", involves an American expedition in Antartica dealing with a tenacious alien that can mimic anything it ""absorbs"" or contacts; an alien that will stop at nothing to ensure it's survival. This leaves all the characters questioning who is the ""Thing"".As the film progresses tensions increase between everyone. Paranoia, suspense, and desperation, becomes the prominent feeling and mood among the members of the expedition as each one slowly falls victim to the alien.The soundtrack by Ennio Morricone purveys the dread and despair that the characters feel throughout the film. It does a great deal to add to the suspense. Along with the setting which takes place in Antartica, the viewer is left to wonder if there is any escape from not only the alien, but from the most unforgiving climate in the world. The word ""cold"" is an appropriate and applicable explanation of this film.The Thing is perhaps the most suspenseful horror movie ever made. A must see, not only for horror fans, but for fans of all cinema. It is one of a kind film that leaves an indelible impression on the viewer, and continually makes them ask what is going to happen next?",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Good movie to watch on a cold, dark night.","The Thing will scare you.  John Carpenter's film starts off slowly, then he lets things loose when the alien erupts from the dog.  From there, each member of the doomed Antarctic station is paranoid as hell.  They don't know who's human and who's the thing.  The effects work is amazing.  The creature is hideous and will give you the creeps.  One of Carpenter's best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Legendary horror movie,"I didn't know what to expect before I went in to see this but I came out thinking that it was one of the greatest movies I had ever seen. Usually I see very average performances by actors in movies like these but I have to say that the characters are portrayed exceptionally well in this.Personally, I hate CGI implemented into modern films; it just doesn't work. The Thing shows how gore and special effects should be done and puts current movies to shame.The setting is isolated and perfect for the flick and the music, as usual by Carpenter, fantastic. This is a good movie to watch for the carnage or for the paranoia and break down of characters, or both.One of my favourites and does not get old to watch again: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One Of The Best Horror Movies Ever Made!,"Truly a great horror film, there's never been one like it before or since. Kurt Russell gives his best performance ever in this horror movie set in Antarctica.  The movie's pace is non-stop, and all of the scenes ring true. The special effects are still great more than twenty years later.  What makes the monster truly frightening is that it isn't good or evil, or right or wrong, but that it destroys to survive, and that its path of destruction is unstoppable.  This is one of the few movies where the term ""Lovecraftian"" can really be used.  The monster is from somewhere else, and is not a conventional anthropomorphic creature with corny dialogue.  Very original, if only Hollywood would make more horror films like this! 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
it 's about human nature,"It looks like it 's chaotic power, but it 's still about human nature. I suspect each other about stabbing with a knife. It can be expressed in such a heavy taste way.

John Carpenter's Masterpiece from another world,"As the ending credits appeared on screen of my TV after watching ""The thing"" on DVD for the first time(knowing very little about it), I just sat silently and whispered to myself more ""wows"" than I have my whole life.Some people will call this a horror movie, but I politely disagree. Even tough elements of horror run throughout the movie, ""The thing"" can only fall under the sci-fi genre. And not only is this sci-fi, it is sci-fi as you will have trouble finding- the purest of its siblings. There is not one unreal symbolic character development like you find in so many other movies; the characters evolve with the movie and there is absolutely no moment where the action stops in preparation of the next THRILLING moment- it is always thrilling, endlessly running the beautiful images and sounds and effortlessly building the story without flaw in your mind.The acting and directing, as well as all the other technical areas, work so well they're not even noticed. Kurt Russel delivers a terrific performance worthy of mention.When watching ""The thing"" it is hard to try outguessing it, not just because it will surprise you in every corner, but more importantly because you will be sucked into that world and be too impressed by it's wonders to think about anything else.I give it a 9/10 and a top 5 in my all time favorites list.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Scary- One of the best,"Perhaps the scariest movies I've ever seen. John Carpenter really had it back then (we'll just forget about Ghosts of Mars and some of the other crap they've released more recently). Everything about this movie is why I haven't lost faith in American Film. Kurt Russell does an awesome job, and has a commanding presence, even if he's not your typical Ahnold type alien fighting hero. This movie is scary on multiple levels, visually (because Stan Winston rocked), psychologically, and it has that long term fear factor that still to this day (almost a full 10 years since I first saw this movie) scares the bejezus outta me (even if I haven't seen the movie in a long time- just looking back on it gives me the willies). This belongs in movie history as among the top 3 scariest movies ever created, but also, one of the best science fiction films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the few good horror films,"I dislike Horror movies or Thrillers spoiled by inane humour. I also dislike over-emphasis on violence and destruction in these films. For this reason, to me the Thing is a masterpiece. Little humour, a simple yet great soundtrack and superb suspense. Calling it just a horror film seems wrong. Quite simply it is a thriller, unmatched in the sci-fi or Horror category to this day! It is a hard act to follow, but bring on a sequel!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Thing,"This movie is top notch. I personally consider this one of the best horror movies. This was not only a fantastic horror movie but it also popularised the horror sub-genre ""body horror."" It is fantastic in almost all aspects of horror. As I sat through watching this the first time, the tension put me in constant suspicion of who really was ""The Thing."" I was also constantly surprised when I saw one person after another reveal themselves. The atmosphere was also superb as it showed to you that there was no way out of this cold hell. It was also very violent and it certainly doesn't let down on the gore. Many a time the violence made you blurt out ""good god!"" The only drawback to this classic is the lack of jump factor in the film, but nonetheless it is a fantastic film. Also I recommend that those who enjoyed this film check out the play-station 2 game ""The Thing"" which although having the same name as the film, is a sequel in story terms to the film. And that's a wrap!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Who among them is the thing?  Great paranoia horror from one of the masters of horror.,"This film to me is the best horror film John Carpenter ever did, trumping another great ""Halloween"". What he did in remaking a 50's science fiction movie into a super horror movie was just genius. The story has these guys (and it is all males, not a female to be seen) at some sort of research facility in Antarctica, I think. They discover something that has been removed from the ice at another facility, having been led there after witnessing a helicopter chasing after a dog with the purpose of killing it. Well they explore the base and take said dog back to their base, which in turn leads to some thing moving about the facility. It seems to infect or take on properties of those it kills, it is kind of hard to say, but when you find it out it goes all out to defend itself making for some of the most gruesome special effects you have ever seen. I love the scene with the shock pads and the head, who can forget the head? The movie also has such tense moments as you do not know who could be the thing and the group of dwindling survivors gets more and more nervous and paranoid as their numbers go down. The monster effects would inspire a lot of horror movies and games, just look at the recent ""Dead Space"" video game for things that look like they came straight out of this movie. This movie would also be Carpenter's greatest movie, looking at this one wonder's how he could have made a movie as bad as ""Ghosts of Mars"". This is also one of Kurt Russell's best roles as well, he and Carpenter always make a good team and this movie makes for a good night of fear, suspicion and gore. The thing could be anywhere...or be anyone!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Gore fest. Yet actually amazing,"Hidden gems are a beautiful thing. I'm writing this in hopes of exposing this amazing movie. I saw this on a list of the best horror movies of all time and it piqued my interest. I'm normally not a big horror fan because the acting and storyline are usually ""Horrible"" (ha ha). With this movie though, it's a much different story. This is the best role I've seen Kurt Russell do. He plays a leader of a group of people doing scientific expedition in the Antarctic. I think it's safe to say that there is some ""Thing"" on the loose. A monster that can imitate the form of any person or animal. This ability is reason why the film is so amazing. At any moment you don't know who is a thing or who is human. If you've ever played the party game Mafia you'll get a kick out of the situation.Throughout the movie the director builds suspense at a steady rate. By the end I was holding my breath to see what would happen to the main character. The gruesome deaths and the monster might be too much for some people. The Thing is essentially a giant pile of gore with tentacles. The special effects still hold up today. I was cringing in a couple of the scenes. This is one of the goriest films I've ever watched. You've been warned. The environment in the movie is a large research building in a remote snow filled area. It adds a lot of memorable atmosphere and ambiance. Near the end it gets dark outside the characters have to use flares to see and they can't go outside for a long time without risking freezing to death. The thing one the other hand only can survive in freezing temperatures, so the crew is at a big disadvantage. They try to burn him to death with flamethrowers, the keyword there is try. He is like a virus that you just can't get rid of. He is horrifying. I'd suggest watching this one after you've had plenty of life experience. Watch it too early and you're liable to be scared for life. Luckily I'm thoroughly desensitized by now.I'm telling you, if you have Netflix and don't mind some extreme gore watch this as soon as you can. You're in for an amazing experience. This is now my favorite horror movie of all time. I'd give this movie a 9/10.tkubas1.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Chilling to the bone's depth...,"The Thing is a frightening movie, because the shape-shifting alien is too disgusting with its multiple misshaped limbs and slimy tentacles. When I see it, I get chills and in more, the action takes place in a frozen and lost land that is Antarctica.Kurt Russell did a great job with this classic, and I wish to find it in store to buy the DVD, cause I like sci-fi films a lot. Also, it's mixed with viscous horror to freeze you dead.Finally, I think that when we see ""traitors"" becoming deformed monsters is truly awesome for a 1982 movie (a big thank to Stan Winston's awesome talent), and it makes it a classic reference of the genre to view absolutely.Steve Baillargeon",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
more masterful direction by carpenter,"I first saw a commercial for this movie two years ago on cable. I didn't think much of it until I actually watched it two days later. This movie is purely a masterpiece. It almost surpasses Halloween in some aspects. if you're wondering why you've really never heard of it, it was released about two weeks after E.T., which completely overshadowed it. For those of you who haven't seen it yet, be prepared for some of the most beautiful special effects, grotesque, but beautiful. Too many movies have lousy computer effects which ruin them. In horror films you need the villain to be maluable, you need to be able to touch it. I very much recomend this for someone who's looking for a good Carpenter movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
You Don't Have to Be a Horror Fan to Love The Thing,"This review will remain vague. In fact, I think the IMDb description is too much. You should go in as blind as possible.The Thing is one of the few horror films I've liked, let alone loved. First of all, few have such a mysterious, creepy atmosphere. You are given plenty of time to let the situation settle, ponder the mysteries with the characters, and question everything that comes across the screen. You're further isolated by the cold, inhospitable environment of Antarctica. Nothing feels right, so you're always on the edge of your seat.Character is much better than in most horror films. None of them are useless, annoying cannon fodder. They act how you and I would act to the situation. Each has their own traits, occupation, and moments in the film. You don't want to see any of them die. MacReady is a good action lead - cocky, but takes things seriously. He also has a cool beard. The characters aren't fleshed-out, but its impressive for a horror film with a large cast.The effects are considered among the best in practicals ever made. You'll need to see that for yourself.The Thing is the perfect horror film that deserves its resurgence. It doesn't treat the audience like teenage idiots, and few can match its constant tone. You will not see me rate a horror film higher than this!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

If it wasn't for this film, I do not believe we would have the (quality) horror films that came later, simply put: John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" paved the way and wrote the blueprint for all that followed. 1982 was by far a turning point for special effects, and The Thing delivers it by the truck load. Mind blowing creature effects, blood, gore and a fantastic storyline to pull it all together. R.J. MacKeady (Kurt Russell) is a hard-edged government man stranded in the north pole on a research team, when they come across someTHING in the ice. Carpenter blends comedy with horror and gore to a glorious conclusion, the acting is top notch and the characters are believable through out. The scenes are paced so that you truly are on the edge of your seat and when the horror starts, it throws you out of your seat.

John Carpenter makes a classic sci-fi movie even better!,"Who knew in 1978 when we saw 1951's ""The Thing"" on a TV set in John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" that he would be remaking it 4 years later? ""The Thing"" was the last film in Carpenter's succession of theatrical hits (""Assault on Precinct 13"", ""Halloween"", ""Escape from New York"", ""The Fog"", ""Halloween II""). Since then, Carpenter has only gotten worse, with his newest release ""Vampires"" sucking REAL bad. But here, you see Carpenter at his peak, working in a claustrophobic isolated environment with a hopeless situation. The best thing about the movie are the special effects by Rob Bottin, who had done an excellent job with ""The Howling"" a year earlier. The movie takes no time kicking into gear, with a graphic dog mutation setting the standard for what to expect in the next few hours. The highlight of the film is a soldier's head slipping away from his body and mutating into a spider!!!

"Grim, genuinely frightening horror epic","Easily John Carpenter's best film, ""The Thing"" is that rarest of movie rarities -- a remake of a classic film that is every bit as good as the original.  Backed by a pounding, heartbeat-like synthesizer score from the brilliant Ennio Morricone, ""The Thing"" opens (following a pre-titles UFO ""teaser"") with striking, beautifully choreographed images of a low flying helicopter chasing a dog through a desolate, frozen landscape.  The finale is just as stunningly filmed, the story bleakly and ambiguously ending in that same landscape awash in redhot flames.  In between, ""The Thing"" offers some of the most potently horrific sequences ever shot. John W. Campbell's original short story ""Who Goes There?"" is followed much more closely here than in Howard Hawks' version, resulting in some awesomely effective man-to-monster transformations.  Although these make-up effects have been much copied since 1982, the film has lost little of its power to shock even the most jaded of horror fans.  Carpenter's direction is stylish and assured, filling almost every sequence with the maximum amount of dread and suspense possible.  Add Morricone's thumping, eerie music to the mix and you end up with one of the most terrifying of all movie experiences.  (The DVD and laser disc versions are highly recommended, crammed as they are with wonderful additional goodies, including a shot-by-shot audio track discussion by Carpenter and star Kurt Russell, as well as an informative eighty minute documentary of the film's production.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
John Carpenter's The Thing,"I'm a big fan of the black and white version of ""The Thing"". I was angry that John Carpenter made his own version and I refused to see it... until recently. ""The Thing"" has a very Lovecraftian feeling to it. Lovecraft is one of my favorite writers so it was inevitable that I would love this film. Let me clear the air about a few things. This is NOT a remake, both films are based on a story entitled ""Who Goes There?"" by an author I can't remember. I will try to find and read it as soon as possible. The level of paranoia in this film is thick. You have no clue who is The Thing until the transformation happens. The difference between this film and the black and white version is that the black and white monster was like a Frankenstein monster type of thing. This monster is like Alien from ""Alien"". It takes the form of living things (excluding plants, that's just my guess) and hides in them. Both monsters can be destroyed by the same means, see both films if you want to see what these means are. I'm eating my words, I will bow down to John Carpenter for doing this film. Both films are good, so I suggest if you see this one, see the black and white version. Just don't expect to see the same monster. Another thing that got me about this film is its level of controversy. Apparently, a bunch of sensitive people got offended because there's no females in this film. I don't see people for their race, gender, ethnicity, etc. I see them for who they really are. Some people are way too sensitive about stupid things like this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the best horror films ever!,"When I first watched this film I was sixteen years old. I was at the time (I still am!) a huge fan of Carpenters work and had seen films like ""Halloween"" or ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" and many more, but unfortunately ""The Thing"" wasn't available on DVD in Germany. So I bought it via the Internet. When I watched for the first time I had many friends around me, we used to watch movies at least once a week, mainly horror. When the film started it got dead silent and everybody was fully concentrated to figure out who was the one creating all that havoc (of course no one did with succes!)The film itself is highly tense and manages to make you sweat! The superb directing of John Carpenter, the great performances of Kurt Russel and his co-stars, the eye-catching special effects (all hand made, no CGI!), the music (Carpenter himself) and the new approach to an old topic makes this film most definetly to one of the best horror films. Who could ever forget scenes like the ""blood test scene""? Or the beginning with the dog? These scenes can be remembered forever, just like the shower scene from ""Psycho""! But I must warn you: Don't ever watch this film alone! It'll make you turn into something different! 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"""I just wanna get up to my shack and get drunk!"" - MacReady.","Apart from the fact this is one of the best and most comprehensive special edition DVD's ever produced the film itself is an absolute classic bordering on masterpiece. Staying true to the spirit of Joseph Campbell's short story WHO GOES THERE? (the basis for Howard Hawks' original b/w version) Carpenter's THE THING brought Rob Bottin's mechanical special effects into the realm of high art. The original story is an allegorical tale of the fear and paranoia created by the anti-communist sentiment pervading the 1950 / 60s USA. Communist paranoia was transposed into Sci-Fi / monster movie in Hawks' version but Carpenter, having no need for this in the 80s, brings a contemporary fear to his version - that of illness. Carpenter's version plays on our fear of what may be inside us or those close to us (a type of left wing horror - fear of ourselves as opposed to right wing horror - fear of them) whether it be disease such as aids or mental illness, it is this kind of atmosphere that saturates this film and is made manifest by Bottin's truly viscerally terrifying special effects. Every aspect of the film is top notch: the acting (with the ever excellent Kurt Russell and a magic ensemble cast), the cinematography from Australian DP Dean Cundy (long time JC collaborator), the effects (as mentioned), the amazing snow covered exteriors and Carpenter's effective, intelligent, economical directing. One of the best horror movies ever made that stands up today as if brand new - a true keeper, enjoy",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Truly a chilling masterpiece of sci-fi,This film has to be the greatest collaboration of John Carpenter and Kurt Russell.  The other films are great but seldom am I left with such an intense and disturbed feeling as I have when I view The Thing.  The acting all around is fantastic.  Rarely have I ever seen such a troop of men pull off an acting job that lets the viewer actually feel their fear.  The special effects hold up just as well when viewed by today's standards.  The musical score is the icing on the cake which adds an extra special feeling of dread and isolation. I love this movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"POOR BABY, YOU'RE STARTING TO LOSE IT, ARE YA???","JOHN CARPENTER'S The Thing is my favorite movie ever. Hands down. John Carpenter's usually awesome direction is present and Kurt Russell delivers such a strong performance as MacReady, you almost assume the character is REAL. Many people have claimed the film is too heavy on effects and the storyline is totally absurd (if an intruder took over your body and soul, what would it matter?? You would practically be the same person...) I don't know about you, but me and MacReady want our individuality. It's a movie, folks...Movies are meant to entertain. And that is exactly what The Thing does. Fabulous fast-paced script by Bill Lancaster and outstanding performances all-around, especially from Russell, Clennon, and Brimley. The film professionally features suspense, horror, and even bits of humor (Russell's macho attitude features humor in it all-around) in it, showing us all that the filmmakers and actors were indeed all well-trained. Rob Bottin deserves a special award for his breathtaking effects and Ennio Morricone's score is absolutely eerie (overtones of Carpenter's scores are heard here, or i believe Carpenter uses overtones of Morricone). Overall, the film is a perfect 10 and you need to watch it on DVD. And remember: Man is the Warmest Place to Hide...",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An unrivaled masterpiece,"This 1982 remake of THE THING gets my top rating, and few films do. I was awestruck by it from my very first viewing and continue to watch it at least once a year for good measure. An ambitious rehash of Howard Hawks' 1952 THE THING and clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 ALIEN, JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING roughly follows the plot of the original: An alien life form that can imitate anything it desires kills and absorbs humans and other animals left and right. If let loose on the world, it will soon be the only living thing on the planet. A bunch of American scientists and their support team working at an Antarctioc base try to contain the beast, with little success. Hawks made his creature a close copy of Universal's Frankenstein monster, while Carpenter opts to have his Thing morph into all sorts of things, including a sled dog, various people and occasionally a snarling pile of absolutely disgusting ooze and flesh. There's even a funny if stomach-turning moment when the creature is an upside-down head running around on tiny feet. I wouldn't have been surprised if one of the men had said, ""Now there's something you don't see everyday."" It's a fight to the finish, with a very ambiguous ending. The incredible special effects have never been surpassed. The cast is superb, and includes a very hairy Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, Keith David and Richard Dysart. Plus some wonderfully trained dogs, with an astounding opening sequence involving a suspenseful chase across a snowy landscape. The film was shot in Canada, for the record. While each character is nicely defined, Russell is definitely the tie that binds, the John Wayne-type hero facing down the black-hat villain. Several sequences pay fond tribute to Hawks' original. I like that as well. See it. But definitely not at meal time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Alien, but in Antarctica.","This Alien-style thriller may not be as scary as the aforementioned shocker, but it beats it hands down on enjoyment. The Antarctic setting gives a bleak, almost stifling atmosphere, and the gory action is great. Kurt Russell turns in his best performance ever. It also has the best line ever...(trying not to spoil the plot here), Kurt Russell turns to ""The Thing"" of the title, says ""f**k you too!"" under his breath, and throws a stick of dynamite at it.

Far Better than I Remembered,"I first saw The Thing when I was in junior high, and was rather disappointed. I had read about it in books on horror movies, and had expected a total gore fest beyond anything I had ever seen. Although the movie was indeed bloody, it was not the vomit-inducing shocker I had expected and hoped for.Fast forward twelve years. I purchase the movie cheap on Amazon, having heard so many rave reviews of it that I was wondering if I had missed something. What I found was a sci-fi / horror masterpiece.Too many reviewers concentrate on the gore in this movie, while failing to note the clever use of a claustrophobic, hostile setting, and the tense atmosphere. Although the film is set on earth, for all intensive purposes it takes place in an alien environment, a place so cold no human can survive there for long. It is these aspects of the film that make it genuinely unnerving.The film also earns kudos for being a remake that improves on the original. Whereas The Thing from Another World was basically children's matinée fare, this is a truly disturbing film with a deserved cult following.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"A great, cold, visceral no-brainer","Men at a remote Antarctic research base are threatened by an alien creature that can absorb and duplicate its victims. Director John Carpenter's gruesome splatter version of the story is much truer to the original (John W. Campbell's 1938 short story 'Who Goes There?') than 1951's 'The Thing (From Another World)'. As noted elsewhere, the film was largely reviled when it was first released for its over-the-top gruesome special effects and its cold, nihilistic vibe (at the time audiences and critics were used to the cheerful optimism of 'Star Wars' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and the saccharine-sweetness of 'E.T.'). Led by Kurt Russell, the film's all male cast makes no effort to make their characters heroic or likable, but as the premise of the story is that you cannot trust anyone, asocial hostility is a realistic, if not very pretty, reaction. Carpenter has never been known for his subtlety, and this film's special effects are (in)famous for their shocking ugliness. Standards have changed in 40 years and the ingenious mechanical effects might seem quaint to fans reared on CGI but some (but not all) of the images are highly memorable (the spider-head for example). Sci-fi films have depicted aliens that can mimic people for decades and while the concept makes for a good yarn, it makes little sense and 'The Thing's plot is no exception. Key to the story is that individual parts of the alien are independent creatures, and since the conservation of mass seems to be conveniently ignored, every spilled drop of alien blood is therefore a new creature, making hunting down one pointless. Definitely a film to enjoy (albeit not to everyone's taste) but not think too hard about (but 'so what'). The early shots of the Norwegians finding the Thing's circular spaceship is a nice homage to the iconic scene in the 1951 film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The Thing,"The 1951 film The Thing from Another World is a classic of its era, but doesn't feel very suspenseful in retrospect. John Carpenter's remake from 1982 reportedly follows the original book by John W. Campbell, Jr. more closely and hasn't lost any of its effect over the almost 30 years since it was first released. The plot premise is the same in both films: a team of scientists on a research station in Antarctica comes across an alien spacecraft that has been buried under the ice for thousands of years. After discovering the hideously mutated remains of another research team, they realize that they are dealing with a hostile organism that can infect any living creature it encounters with gruesome consequences. To their horror, they become aware that some of their own team members may also have become infected... but which ones?The number of actors is small, but the twelve men on the station suit their roles naturally. MacReady, the leader of the group, is played by the always charismatic Kurt Russell, but I would also mention Wilford Brimley as Blair, the station's doctor who cannot cope with the stress, and Keith David as Childs, a strong and somewhat menacing team member. Besides the sparseness of human presence, the atmosphere is also intensified by the overwhelming isolation of the station. The claustrophobic rooms and corridors of the interior scenes contrasted with the vast empty plains that expand all around the compound create a very effective setting for the distressing tale that Carpenter handles skilfully throughout.What I like the most about the film, particularly when compared to the 1951 film, is that the effect of isolation, uncertainty and stress on the crew is explored so effectively. The tense contacts between the characters are essential for the mood, and it's enjoyable to follow the team's evolvement from a carefree and somewhat bohemian bunch to nervous wrecks. Besides the atmosphere, the film also puts more emphasis on spectacular gore effects that are a real treat for any slime fan. The tentacles, crawling body parts and the arm-chewing ribcage are not far from black comedy, but never come across as unfitting for the style.The cinematography also looks good, ranging from the blue darkness of the snowy plains lit by red emergency torches to the flaming interiors. Since the gore and suspense are in good balance and even the last shot holds on to the hopeless aura the film radiates, there is no reason why any horror or sci-fi fan should skip The Thing; it is essential viewing in both genres.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A beautiful over-the-top gorefest -,"First off, this is not exactly a remake of Hawk's 'The Thing (from Another World)'. There are only glancing similarities. Most every reviewer has pointed this out and now so have I. But that makes it far from disappointing. It starts right into the action and tosses a mystery in your face. Before you get a chance to ponder too long the fit hits the shan. I love this movie. It is so nightmarish, grotesque, and at times hideous. The special effects are stomach churning every time - and fascinating - almost beautiful. And yet it isn't necessarily a 'gross-out'. There's plenty of blood and ooze to last a couple of sequels - it's just the nature of this beast - whatever it is. The movie keeps you tensed and eventually resolves to a logical ending. Then I wonder why a sequel was never made? Now I understand this didn't exactly pack them in at the box-office. It's just as well. It would have been hard to equal this in a sequel.The acting is exact and convincing. Russell is, well, as you've seen him before and since. But he does it well. No-one really stands out, but everyone is competent and the character development works so well you don't even notice it happening.The background music is taut. Perfect.The real show stopper is the special effects. For maximum effect - beware. Many cable channels will show this movie but they always cut it. When they do this they take away some of the more interesting effects. Yes, they are intense and disturbing - but that is the whole point - innit? That is why this one is a 'keeper' in my library. Great Halloween night flick! Just maybe not for the feeble or green, if you know what I mean?I have viewed this multiple times and still find it worthy. I find myself even trying to determine who 'caught it' when by nuances in the acting. You never know. I kind of identify with Brimley's character. I would get real confused and paranoid too. Or was that just an act to get left alone to work some things out? Hmm?",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Sci-Fi Horror at it's best,"This is probably one of the most underrated films in the sci-fi world.  I am still blown away by this movie.  This review is for the Collector's Edition DVD.To me, how a DVD is constructed is as important as the content itself. Unlike most DVDs that force you to sit through warnings that noone reads and studio logos that nobody cares about, this DVD gets it right.  You drop the DVD in your player and it plays the movie just like you would see it in the theater.  Studio logo followed by opening credits.I absolutely love the opening sequence of music and credits followed by the helicopter chasing the dog.  You are instantly thrust into the madness caused by the alien intruder and the ride continues until the movie ends. It is never boring, yet doesn't rush the storyline and dialog like so much of Hollywood drek these days.I recently saw Alien and thought about the similarities to The Thing.  In the end, I have to say The Thing may be a better movie for one reason - it is closer to home - i.e. planet Earth.  Each movie rates in my top ten, but I have to put The Thing one notch higher than Alien.The extras on the CD are a mixed bag.  The interviews with cast and crew are quite good, with a fully produced sequence, including clever variances of the title sequence.

John Carpenter's Best Film,"How often is it that a remake is vastly superior to the original?  Not often is the answer.  The Thing is the only one that comes to mind.  This movie, much more true to the short story ,""Who Goes There?"" from whence it was based, is far more magical and encompassing than ""The Thing [From Another World]"" from the 50's.This is one of those all-rare instances in Hollywood where the special effects SUPPORT the story instead of take its place.  They serve to enhance the movie experience, and suspend your disbelief entirely.  If John Carpenter never makes another good film (he hasn't since), he can go to his reward knowing he made this one.

Not only a good horror film,"The Thing is Carpenter's best work right after ""Halloween"" (which is almost impossible to surpass). It was also the first film of J.C. which he did for a big studio and on a rather large budget. Contrary to other films Carpenter was given much more time to complete this masterpiece. What he achieved has since become a true classic in the horror genre even if it is quite different from most of the other films that were made in the 80s.The Thing is not just a normal horror film trying to scare the audience with cheap thrills but is also some kind of a psychological drama. Throughout the whole movie you can never be sure who to trust. The thing moves from body to body imitating the victims perfectly and that's why anybody among the men could be possessed. The theme of paranoia and mistrust is very strong in this film and cleverly done.The Thing is set in the Antarctic (in fact it was shot in British Columbia). It is made clear to the viewer that there is no possibility of escape for any of the members of the research crew. The location also creates a feeling of loneliness and isolation where each one of the dozen men is basically on his own and therefore contributes to the paranoid undertone.And of course the film has state-of-the-art special effects and lighting. Rob Bottin simply did a great job. There is lots of gore and some very inventive scenes were the thing changes its shape. Some of the effects had to be done several times and others were deleted because Carpenter and Bottin didn't want the effects to be laughable or cheesy. The effects are outstanding and astonishing even for today's standards. They are much more interesting to look at than modern computer-animated special effects.But the most important thing that made this film believable are the actors (it is a male-only film by the way). Each and everyone of the cast was convincing which is a rare thing. Although there are twelve or so men in this film who are almost equally important (with Kurt Russell becoming some kind of a leader) Carpenter managed to give each one of them an own character in a very short time. He didn't even need to include much dialogue to make the persons seem real.I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in Carpenter's work and/or horror films and doesn't have a weak stomach.My rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Great flick,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time and definitely a must see for sci fi horror buffs. I'll just run down the pros for you as I can't think of any cons.Acting was superb. Everyone is believable and their fear is palpable. Kurt Russell is the great anti-hero and is great as the ""clutch"" guy who really doesn't give a f***. John Carpenter did NOT do the music, Ennio Morricone did thank goodness and his score set the mood perfectly. John Carpenter should not score movies even though it's apparent he loves to dabble in music. Is he trying to save a buck or is it ego? Rob Bottin's special effects were phenomenal though they were considered gross and too gory when the film was released. The story is different from original version though the original was good also. This is by far John Carpenter's best movie and is much better than Halloween imho.Along with Alien this is as good as sci fi-horror gets.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

One of my all time favorites!!!!!,"This is a masterpiece of horror/sci-fi cinema! The best ever along with original Alien (although I like The Thing better). I`ve seen this movie at least 50 times and I never get enough of it.I was 6 when i first saw it and it scared the shit out of me (most horror/thriller movies do when you`re 6 year old kid) but in a different kind of way then most of the other movies. I just cant praise it enough!I John Carpenter is still one of my favorite directors (mainly because of his early works) and it`s shame that he isn`t making movies more often. Halloween,Dark Star,The Fog,The Thing,Big Trouble in Little China,Escape From New York are all no-budget wonders and cult favorites. But The Thing remains his greatest achievement! Direction is flawless,the script wellwritten,acting great from everyone involved (Kurt Russel just isn`t the same actor when he isn`t working with Carpenter),the score is amazing (this is,after all,a Carpenter movie) and creature effects are simply breathtaking! The movie captures the feeling of paranoia and isolation like none before or since. What other 20+ years old movie features stuff that you see here?I could write about this movie or its director for 5 hours but the fans already know-this is one of 50 greatest movies of all time (and all time top 10 when it comes to horror) and it is shame that The Thing isnt on IMDB Top 250! What kind of world is this when movies like Amelie,Memento,The Pianist and Requiem for a Dream are all top 50 while this movie didnt make Top 250 list????? It just shows what most of us already know-peoples taste in movies is getting worse for every minute. For those who didnt like the movie - stick to romantic comedies and ""based on a true story"" crap dramas.

A Psychological Paranoia Thriller!,"This can definitely be considered one the greatest scfi/horror to date.Plot: The movie takes places in an isolated research camp in the middle of Antarctica. The first week of the winter season is starting, and the research team is threatened by an alien intruder that has the ability to ""imitate: other organisms. (mainly the researchers). With the temperature dropping outside and all hopes of escape gone, the tension rises between the men as know one trusts the other.Review: From the beginning you feel bits of isolation that turn into extreme claustrophobia. The isolation then combines with the paranoia giving off the feeling of pure terror. Who is the thing? As you ask yourself that questions through out the whole movie, John Carpenter does an excellent job combining the ambiance and the score to give you ideas that are often mislead on the identities of the men.Acting: The cast of actors do an incredible job, making the situation believable. Kurt Russell (R.J. MacReady) and Keith David (Childs) are extremely noteworthy during the film.Special Effects: The special effects are impressive, and in my opinion would hold up in movies today.

Excellent!,"No doubt one of the best horror movies ever made. The special effects are so mind-blowing that one can almost not believe it. This is made before computer graphics, so one becomes aware of the artistic genius behind the special effects. I saw this as a child. It is super cool. A real 80s movie. Later I found out the H.P.Lovecraftian spawning of the movie. Anyway, it's great. Watch it! All sci-fi and horror fans should see this movie, and despair! Only thing I found a bit weird was the beginning with the spaceship that is flying to Earth. Perhaps that is a bit too much, since this is a monster-movie more than anything else. Moreover, one has a feeling that it is a present-day Earth, so it doesn't fit in with the plot of the UFO having landed a long time ago. Anyway, despite ""goofs"" and ""mistakes"" this movie is on my top 10 of favorite movies. Of course, the reason for this is also the excellent acting and dialog, such as great lines like: ""Maybe we are at war with Norway!"" All things considered, this is a great movie which can be seen again and again. There is so much detail in the characters, plot and effects. Moreover, it is shot in a beautiful location in Alaska.

One of those perfect horror films,"The Thing is one of those perfect horror films. Everything seems to fall into place. In short this is a magnificent viewing experience.I assume you know the plot so I won't go into it here. It was a strong move by Carpenter to utilize to original plot from the short story ""Who Goes There?"". The Thing has the ability to assume the identity of it's host and therefore can go about undetected among the men. This causes the immense feeling of distrust among them and Carpenter milks it for all it's worth. In the original there was simply a guy in a costume portraying The Thing and that was a real letdown.By setting the film in a virtually timeless no-man's land, Antarctica, Carpenter maximizes the utter isolation with it's magnificent snowbound scenery and bitter cold. When all radio contact has failed, these men are quite simply alone in the world. And when The Thing starts absorbing them one by one, up until the point that we have no idea who is left intact, their isolation and despair become frightfully real and tangible to the audience.Carpenter's direction is nothing short of spectacular. This film, along with Halloween and Assault on Precinct 13, is his crowning achievement. Genuinely haunting, terribly suspenseful with an eerie, all to real ending, this is one film you won't forget easily. Ennio Morricone's music, which is very similar to Carpenter's own orchestral works, is quite simply stunning. Operating like a slow, emotionless heartbeat, it enhances the impact of every scene. Another triumph for this movie are the special effects. This is 1982 and I have yet to see a horror film that surpasses this one in terms of monster effects. Granted the effects are disgusting but, very importantly, do not lessen the impact of the story. It never succumbs to being a special effects extravaganza, it's limited to only a handful of scenes. In short, this film is unbearably athmospheric and has terrific special effects to boot. They make the film more effective, and that's a rare thing in a horror movie.The performances by the actors are superb. Carpenter regular Kurt Russell makes a solid hero and the rest do an impeccable job in varied roles.One of the best horror films ever, top 10 easily. Can't recommend it enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Arguably the Best Creature Movie Ever Made,"The Thing is by far one of the most unique and impactful movies out. The 1982 classic has notably created a mass influence on how structures of movies, especially horrors, are created today. This movie will always hold up graphically, and is a beautiful mystery and horror that makes the most of a creature's goal solely ""wanting to kill"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This is one of the scariest remakes ever made!,"John Carpenter's remake of ""The Thing"" is without a doubt, one of the scariest films ever to grace the silver screen!  I remember watching the original version of ""The Thing"" and it managed to make me jump a few times. Although it still has maintained the qualities of a legitimate artistic sci-fi film, some of the ""creep-out"" factors have now aged into silliness. As for the new version of ""The Thing"", it's not here to make us feel comfortable.  It's here to scare the living shit out of us!  What scares me more than anything is not the creature itself, who plays a constant game of hide and go seek with the other crew members of the research team, but the suspense.  The idea of a creature being able to recreate a perfect duplicate of another living creature was bad enough.  But when things started to get out of control, and nobody knew who was who, if they were a person or a thing, then it got really scary.  It was very paranoid, like you couldn't trust anybody except yourself.  In some moments, the characters look as if they can't trust themselves either.  Worst of all it's set in Antarctica, the coldest, loneliest place on the face of the planet.  It's like an alien world, a perfect place for an alien creature to live.  The creature is an incredible creation of design and special effects.  I liked it because it seemed like a walking germ, that had no definite shape.  We never knew what it was going to look like.  Better still, I won't spoil it for those who have not seen it, but lets just say that the fear and terror of the film is not resolved or finished even when the end credits are rolling!  And oh, that theme music that plays over and over again, brings the creep-out factor to it's peak.  It's a real tour de force of suspense, terrifying images and special effects, which are used sparingly so as to not turn the film into a mindless special effects bonanza.  This makes the old version of ""The Thing"" look like a comedy by comparison.  Even on a standard television set, the creep-out factor is never lost.  If your looking for a great scare that won't leave you, this is it.  It's groundbreaking!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
excellent film,Very good film is one of my all time favourites's. The storyline is very well written and is a must see film to any alien loving sci-fi film fans!!Also a very enticing ending which will keep you guessing days after you've watched it which will make you watch it more and more to just try and find any clues. very good choice of actors which make the film intense and questions who is actually the thing? At the end of the film you'll most certainly have more questions than answers which also adds to the enjoyment of a well made film that you will want to watch over and over again. The spooky music fits right in with the fact that these men are isolated from the world and have nowhere to escape and should provide you with an excellent way to pass your time by.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
How to destroy an original screne play...,"This movie should be retitled: ""How to destroy an original movie script."" I saw the original movie as a kid and I loved it. I loved how I was terrified of the Thing and how I was encouraged by the heros. It was so excellent. There was real palpable anticipation in the original. It was done with intelligence and creativity.However, in today's world intelligence has been replaced by blood and creativity has been replaced by boobs. John Carpenter is no different (sans boobs). His lack of creativity is profound. His zeitwelt is typical of today: ""humans are evil and need to die."" I guess the movie is really a ""film noir"" of man's place in the universe.I hated this movie. However it is well done and is watchable (unlike his ""Ghosts of Mars"" fiasco). 8/10ZafoidPS: If you too saw the original as a kid - the excitement, the drama, the acting, the sci-fi!

This glorious film makes Alien look terrible,"I didn't like Alien (1979) and I got put off by watching another alien, fantasy, sci-fi film again. But when my godfather burned John Carpentar's The Thing, it looked strange but exciting at the same time as it was a Carpentar film.The Thing is about a couple of people who are in snow cabins, studying things and the like. Then a dog runs into the campus and a crazy man with a rifle comes in trying to shoot the dog. He ends up dying and a couple of days later we see the dog evolve into a nasty looking Alien that can take anything it touches and it can imitate that thing. It ends up getting many of the men in the campus and many of the men act out evilly because of the Alien inside them.The Thing has many psychological elements that make this film really fun to watch. It was a little scary, especially when we see that Alien with the really skinny, long neck.This also one of the best remakes that should be owned and watched many times. Even if it's not as good as Halloween, it definitely deserves it's place in the Horror genre. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
changed my life,"Never has a lack of trust for one's allies been depicted in such an amazing way. The isolation of the Antarctic adds to the films ever increasing suspense that creeps up on you like a nasty tentacle oozing with alien goo. The effects are timeless and the actors performances are without a doubt perfect. The Flame thrower as a horror weapon is superior (it doesn't break the tension with loud bangs and works well only in close quarters combat). It even has an axe versus door sequence. As well as all that, you have incredibly tense scenes that make this the most awesome Horror film of all time, But in my opinion what makes this film truly great is the way that every member in the team appears in equal proportion to each other with the slight exception of MacReady (Kurt Russell) the main character. This I feel makes it impossible to workout who's next and there fore seals its place as the best horror of all time. I LOVE THIS MOVIE.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Probably the best(with Escape from N.Y.)J.Carpenter's movie,"This is one of my favourite S.F. movie. I like to be very precise with the genre because (for me)this is PURE S.F.. Not only for because it is tract by the Campbell's novel, but also for the cut that Carpenter give it. Few movie have its balance between terror and amazing for the unknow, between suspence and beautiful(and also mechanic)special effect! I think this  is one of the best example of the Carpenter's talent, and  I'm almost sure that he also think to the genius of H.P.Lovecraft for the structure of the storyboard. The end of the movie is very enigmatic and elegance (no good end), with obscure politically reference(like more of Carpenter's movie). Enjoy for all the S.F. fan who doesn't see it. Goodbye!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the best of its type,"The Thing must be considered one the best within the genre of Sci-Fi horror movies, together with the first two of the Alien films. Set in Antarctica it captures the atmosphere of isolation, eerie feeling of fear and terror of the unknown. Together with terrific special effects (the head sprouting legs and scuttling away must rank amongst the greatest scenes in the annals of Sci-Fi horror), and good acting by the principal actors, it is one the most memorable of films. I was somewhat shocked and disturbed by the film when I first saw it, and the feeling of unease lingered in the mind for some time.The final scene is also one of the most interesting in the film, it leaves the story perhaps unfinished and in the viewer a deep sense of unresolved tension and unsettled fear.I probably would have given it a 9 or 10 for its sheer brilliance, but viewing it again many years later the shock factor has somewhat diminished, perhaps lowering unfairly the appreciation of the film. Hence the slightly lower vote although it probably deserves more, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who haven't seen it before.(vote amended to give a 9, it does deserve it on second thought.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Thoughts on The Thing,"This film is easily the best film about paranoia I have ever seen.The film, about a shape-shifting, predatory alien that takes over any animal it eats and perfectly duplicates it, and endlessly reproduces as long as prey is available, is very frightening for its potential.The Thing seems to be a biological weapon from another world. Trapped in Antarctica far from the coast, it schemes to escape the polar stations where it is trapped. If it does so, every animal on Earth, including every human, faces extinction in a matter of a few years. Once it gets to a bird, a seal, a whale or a penguin, its escape is assured.We never see the true form of The Thing, though in WHO GOES THERE it was described as having three hate-filled red eyes.The Thing is totally and horribly hostile, and intelligent as well, which makes it a terrifying opponent.This movie gets my thumbs up as one of the best horror films ever made.MtLoweMan",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A perfect horror film, a modern day classic.","As we all know, usually remakes can be colossal bombs. Not so, ""The Thing."" Quite possibly John Carpenter's greatest film, I have watched this fantastic movie at least 50 times to date, largely because most of my friends have never seen it! While working on ""Big Trouble in Little China"" with the same director, I was prompted to ask him, straight out, why this film seemed to simply fall off the radar, and his answer was short and sweet: ""Timing. I had the bad fortune of deciding to release 'Thing' at the same time that Steven Spielberg released ""ET."" The movie was simply buried under the onslaught of media attention that made ET a worldwide hit. But that fact doesn't undercut the sheer brilliance of this nail biting masterpiece of horror. Starting from the truly inspired casting, to the script, to the incredible monster making, to the cinematography, to even the stark, atmospheric soundtrack by the great Ennio Morricone, 'The Thing' has become the modern benchmark of sci fi/horror films to come, and John Carpenter deserves all the credit. First, the setting. Using an already claustrophobic location of a completely enclosed, totally isolated Arctic science lab outpost, inhabited by all that testosterone, was as an effective a place for a modern day horror flick as the spooky Gothic castle was in the classic of the genre, ""Frankenstein,"" imparting as much of the feeling of dread as the story itself. But quite possibly the greatest plot choice in was in simply leaving the ending open, ""and just wait and see what happens."" Brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"damn, don't you people read books?","the thing is a FAR better movie adaption of the original John W Campbell Jr/Don A. Stuart story ""Who Goes There?"". Carpenter's film version actually FOLLOWS the original story (though in an updated 1980s setting), with the alien being a shape shifter that consumes its victim's cells and morphs and merges or splits into two. The 1951 version is a shallow adaption of the original story and has nothing of the creepiness and gracious gore of the original. What the hell is wrong with you people?

You gotta be Carpenter kidding me...,"After being freed from its ancient crash site an extraterrestrial life form infiltrates an Antarctic research station, imitating taking the appearance of the researchers that it kills.An atmospheric understated sci-fi at it best. I'll never understand how Carpenter lost the lustre in some of the other film he made, nevertheless, his Thing is one of his best movies and also once of the best sci-fi movies ever. Despite being based on the same source material (before remakes were popular) the thing has a look and feel of it's own and is very different from its 50's counterpart.The isolated setting, the astounding cinematography and scenery creates intrigue; drawing you in from the very beginning. It's a perfect horror/sci-fi cocktail of Ennio Morricone's haunting foreboding score, Rob Bottin and Stan Winston's benchmark practical effects (which are to-date arguably unsurpassed) Carpenters claustrophobic set ups and Bill Lancaster screenplay.It's rare that every single actor is exceptional and supplied with effective dialogue. All the cast from Kurt Russell to Wilford Brimley as Blair are all captivating, great casting by Anita Dann. The characters have their own issues and as the paranoia sets in relationships are forged and other broken, building to a bold and satisfying conclusion.This is more than just a cult film with a 'monster' hiding in warm places surrounded by snow, it's a finely tuned science fiction horror masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Carpenter's best,"This movie is Carpenter's ""ten"".

Although The Fog, Precinct 13, and Halloween 1 are super, The Thing is the REAL DEAL.The cast is typical Carpenter: TV actors (Wilford Brimley), or second chance actors, or one-note deadpan actors (Kurt Russell), and they all do the job necessary to not distract from the suspense.

"Well, it's certainly SOME thing.","""You'll never, ever, see anything like The Thing again."" -John Carpenter, 1997.He's absolutely right. No one would have the nerve to make a film as disgusting as this in the current ""let's not offend anybody at all, ever"" climate. Without a single frame of CGI, the Thing shoves our faces right into Rob Bottin's gruesome make-up effects and proves that genuine, tangible prosthetics and monsters are a million times scarier than a cheap, obvious effect done on a computer in post-production.I don't understand why people keep referring to this as a remake. It's far, far removed from Howard Hawks' version. Even Carpenter himself, a Hawks admirer, says that The Thing is it's own movie, and much closer to the original novella 'Who Goes There' by John W. Campbell Jnr.Set in the lonely Antarctic, The Thing takes the form of a wolf and bounds across the snowscapes to a US research station, pursued by frantic, half-mad Norwegians. Unable to communicate with the English-speaking American team they end up dead before being to warn them that the cuddly dog is actually a hideous shape-shifting monster. The team eventually discover the wreck of an alien spaceship that has been entombed in the ice for at least 100, 000 years before the monster begins to wreak havoc at the research station, intent on consuming all of the humans and making it to civilization where it can take over the entire planet.Fear and paranoia grow among the team as they desperately try to prove who is biologically human and who has been assimilated by The Thing. It's utterly horrific stuff, but it's not without its illogical moments and massive plot holes. The universal adoration of The Thing seems to forget that it doesn't make complete sense. Carpenter admits he lost track of who is and who isn't, which seems kinda lazy. Ambiguity can be a cheap way of maintaining uncertainty and Carpenter should have delivered a more focused and precise plot. Plus the paranoia was way overdone. By the halfway mark I reckon the fear among the men should have been merely implicit rather than verbally delivered at every opportunity.It's rather strange, and fitting, that this movie also comes across as a big-screen adaptation of HP Lovecraft's 'At the Mountains of Madness', which also features research scientists in Antarctica discovering an ancient shape-shifting lifeform and losing their sanity.Despite the problems, this is Carpenter's direction at its best, with long, slow, tracking cameras in gorgeous anamorphic Panavision, evocative lighting, and lonely minimalism. Even Ennio Morricone's score is very much restrained. The cast have their defining features mostly hidden beneath thick facial hair, but Kurt Russell once again proves why he is Carpenter's favorite lead, and the awesome Keith David provides plenty of badassness just with his mere presence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Desert Island Movie Keeper !!!,"This is perhaps one of the most under-rated, yet best sci-fi/horror movies ever made. It's hard to believe that this movie is almost 25 years old but it has aged well and looks as fresh as ever.John Carpenter has made some good films here and there but made A lot of dogs. However, sometimes...and I mean once in a lifetime kind of ""sometimes""...everything will click and you got yourself one damned fine film. This is Carpenter's ""click"".Ingredients: A great premise story by the late John W. Campbell Jr., an absolutely spectacular ensemble cast who, even back then was somewhat unknowns but they all cut their teeth on the stage. I mean really, Richard Dysart, W. Brimley, Peter Maloney, D. Moffat, Richard Masur and Tom Waites, all damn fine stage actors. Sorry to name drop but the producers either were brilliant and/or extremely lucky to pull off this cast for an ensemble piece about paranoia. Great cast! And to really put the icing on the cake they have the edgy special effects guy, Rob Bottin, who was really just a kid at the time pulling off amazing special effects (yes, this is before CGI, kiddies) with a budget that I use to buy groceries with. He was years ahead of his time.The litmus test for me was to show this to my 15 yr. old son and a few of his buddies one Friday night. They were glued to the TV; from the opening scene where the Norwegians were shooting the wolf from the helicopter to the end scene where Mac and Childs make veiled paranoid small talk amidst the carnage that was once their camp. They loved it and were blown away when I told them how old it was, but I think the scene with Mac and that lame chess computer sort of dates it.

Flamethrowers. No Questions.,"More a mystery/thriller than a horror The Thing is packed with special effects, which were probably some of the greatest at the time. Tame by today's standards, The Thing will only get to the weak of stomach and the unsuspecting.  The Thing has many moments where the viewer can literally not move, it will have you in such suspense and awe that your eyes will be locked onto the screen until the scene is done.The Thing takes place in Antarctica mainly in a U.S. Research Base, what they are researching in the middle of nowhere on a block of ice in 1982 is a complete mystery. We know this movie is about an alien when we see a spaceship crashland on Earth. Soon after this a helicopter from Norway is opening fire on an Alaskan husky, it doesn't take much thinking to know this is the alien. The chopper doesn't shoot it and lands in front of the research base, unfortunately the gunman can't speak English and accidentally shots one of the workers in the arm, thinking that he is hostile the leader of the base shoots him in the eye, and this is where the mystery begins. The men travel to the Norweigan base which is completely destroyed and contains odd looking corpses which have been warped and mangled, lucky for them they bring them over their base. The Thing can be based up on a few things ; flamethrowers, tentacles, the ice, and the blood test scene.The ultimate ending is rather anti-climatic. Everyone thinks something will happen at the very end of the movie, then the credits roll. The one is missable, if your weak of stomach watch it, it might desenseitize you, if you are totally unable to see horror and laugh at mutilation scenes like me, don't watch this one, you can miss it. If you have ever played Resident Evil 2 for PSX, you'll know exactly what this movie is, and won't feel a thing towards the monsters. This movie is very overrated by tons of people today, The Thing by no means works on the 2000 level, but sure did scare people 20 years ago. One last thing, don't let the cover fool you, nobody in this movie goes underwater even though the box of the movie looks the exact same as The Abyss, a much better movie by the way.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Ranks with Alien,"I recently obtained the Collector's Edition DVD after having seen this film in theaters and countless times on VHS. Still one of the best in the thriller/horror/SCI-FI genre, not quite as good as it's predecessor ALIEN but very close.The paranoia of the hapless research station staff is palpable. Enhanced by the claustrophobic surroundings of the station buildings and inclement polar weather outside. And in 1982 if the director wanted a special effect they actually had to BUILD it. No CGI here. To my mind the effects hold up well considering it was 2 decades ago. Thankfully a second-rate sequel was never made, preserving the impact of the thought provoking ending.THE THING is a classic. I recommend the DVD - wide screen being the only way to view John Carpenter's vision. An updated ""making of"" documentary with cast/crew recollections is also quite interesting.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
As graphic as they come!,"John Carpenter takes horror to a new level by thrusting the viewer into the bleak, frigid expanse of the Antarctic, where an American expeditionary research team encounters the unexpected.... a rescue of a sled dog pursued by a pair of Norwegian paramilitary types from their camp miles away. In so doing, the Americans unwittingly provide a safe harbor for what turns out to be a hideous alien creature capable of assuming any life form in close proximity to it- in this case, the Husky.Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley and Richard Dysart head a cast of scientists, and support personnel who are yanked out of their sheer daily boredom and cabin fever to confront the Thing.Problem is,WHO is the Thing, and WHO is the genuine human? A bitter battle for survival ensues,complete with the dark paranoia and exhaustion caused by each of the men not trusting each other.Carpenter follows John Campbell Jr.'s short story, ""Who Goes There?"" far more closely than Howard Hawks did in the original 1951 release. By doing so, Carpenter was allowed to capitalize on 1982 special effects  in order to portray the alien at its goriest splendor. Rob Bottin's latex and mechanical effects are superb, and will still evoke a sense of disgust from even the more seasoned horror movie buff.The sense of distrust, vulnerability and anxiety mounts among the research staff as they try to figure out how to bring this perfect imitator out into the open... before they are all consumed by It.Definitely graphic. Definitely claustrophobic. Definitely one of Carpenter's best films. It will leave you trembling in your bed at night, whispering, ""who goes there?""",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Thing,"Quite simply, in my opinion is the best movie ever made.
