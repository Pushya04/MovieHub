A wonderfully engaging and convincing slide into a modern madness from a director and actor showing some of their best form,"Travis Bickle is a Vietnam veteran who cannot sleep at night and just ends up travelling around. To try and use the time effectively he becomes a taxi driver. Things start to look up for him as he works nights and slowly starts to live a little bit. He meets a girl, Betsy, and arranges to see her a few times despite the fact that he is a little bit out of the ordinary  a quality that seems to interest her. His connection to the night allows him to see young prostitute Iris being bullied by her pimp Matthew and he begins to see his role to perhaps save her  him playing his part in cleaning up the sewer that he feels New York has become. However when his view of normal life puts Betsy off him he starts to retreat more and more into the night, looking for meaning in his life and growing more and more outraged by the world he is part of.Hardly the most uplifting of films it is engaging and impressive and truly deserves the reputation it has. Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader have produced a film that convincingly portrays a man cut out of society who has the slightest connection to normality before finding it eroded away. The script is brilliant because the detail is engaging but it is this descent into a very modern type of madness that drives the film forward. Travis has just enough about him that is recognisable that it makes it so easy to go along with the rest of his madness. A major part of this is getting the feeling right about living in a cesspit; a city that seems to have forgotten its way morally  New York is the strongest example but elements of it could be parts of any city I suspect. In painting this world in such a real way, Scorsese has made Travis all the more convincing and, to a point, all the easier to follow in his fall. Like I said it is not a film to morally uplift you but one that is depressingly fair. There is no redemption in this modern world and although it appears that the violence at the end somehow redeems Travis in reality by showing ""society"" accepting his action it drags the rest of us down nearer the world that he hates and has become part of. I love King of Comedy for the same reason albeit in a different world.Scorsese injects a real understanding of the place and a real sense of foreboding into even the earliest scenes. He inserts clever and meaningful shots into scenes that other directors might just have filmed straight and his choice of scene and shot compliments the script is depicting Travis descending into madness. What makes the film even better is De Niro showing the type of form that makes his recent form such a major disappointment. He is outstanding as he moves Travis from being relatively normal to being eaten up from the inside out. His eventual implosion is impressive but it is only as impressive as the gradual slide he depicts over the course of the film. Although he dominates it, others impress as well. Foster stands out in a small role, while Keitel makes a good impression as the pimp. Shepherd is not quite as good but her character was not as well written as the others so it isn't all down to her. Regardless, the film belongs to De Niro and although the quotable scenes are the ones that are remembered it is in the quieter moments where he excels and shows genuine talent and understanding.Overall an impressive and morally depressing film that deserves its place in cinematic history. The portrayal of a city and a man slipping into moral insanity is convincing and engaging and it shows how well to ""do"" modern madness and the effects of the moral void of parts of society. Scorsese directs as a master despite this being at an early stage in his career and De Niro is chillingly effective as he simply dominates the film in quiet moments and quotable moments alike. I rarely use phrases like ""modern classic"" because I think they are lazy but this is one film that certainly deserves such a label.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Shattering Tale In First  Person Singular,"The impact that ""Taxi Driver"" had in its day hasn't diminished, on the contrary, it has acquired a relevance of Shakesperean proportions. Travis's loneliness is a hyper representation of the same loneliness most humans have experienced at different times in different measures. It is always associated with a nightmare and Martin Scorsese delivers it like a nightmare. Travis, possessed by Robert De Niro at the zenith of his powers, cruises in his taxi enveloped in Bernard Herrman and we, well, we're the passengers and everything looks terrifying and familiar at the same time. Paul Schrader sensational screenplay comes to life with the jolting force of a rude awakening. Like it happens, more often than not, with masterpieces, it signed in a rather direct way the lives of the ones who live it in a movie theater and the ones who made it. Scorsese being the giant that he is, survived it and will continue startling us I'm sure but I also bet that for years everything he did was compared to this movie. De Niro and his ""You looking at me"" became such an iconic phrase that even he himself ended up impersonating it. Jodie Foster awoke the insane devotion of a real life would be killer and New York, the greatest city in the world was shown with its underbelly up. A work of art, a superlative reminder of what film could actually give us and very rarely does.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Still has the power to shock...,"Not only one of Scorsese's best films, but one of the best of the 70s. It is very hard hitting, dark and still has the resonance and power to shock. The cinematography is measured and chilly, yet very atmospheric, while Bernard Hermann's swansong score is superb, yet more proof at how amazing a composer he was. The story is unsettling but wonderfully told, and the script is brilliantly written. Scorcese also directs impeccably, while the acting is just excellent. Robert DeNiro gives one of his best performances, the whole film is worth watching just for his performance, that's how good it is, but that's not to dismiss Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel and Cybill Sheppard in the supporting cast for they are just as good while Scorsese's own cameo is genuinely frightening. There you have it, another one of Scorsese's best with a brilliant atmosphere and mesmerising central performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Excellent,"A lonely Vietnam veteran who has insomnia spends his nights as a taxi driver in the dirty streets of New York, where he encounters a young prostitute who he tries to help make a difference.This is a very good film and one of Martin Scorsese best (Goodfellas being my fave). An excellent portrayal from Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle the cabbie and good performances from Jodie Foster as the child prostitute Iris Steensman, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle and Harvey Keitel as a pimp called Sport.You actually get drawn into the isolation and anger that Travis is feeling towards these lowlifes and because of that you really feel sympathy for him. Though after a while the loneliness and the city really starts to haunt Travis's mind, causing violent instincts and paranoia.This film is filled with such memorable lines e.g.Travis Bickle 'You talking to me? Well I'm the only one here.' and the many powerful scenes that stay in your head after it's finished. The hypnotic cinematography is a standout, as if your seeing the harsh & gritty New York streets and twisted people through the eyes of Travis when he is driving his cab. A great screenplay, a stunning score by Bernard Herrmann and a superb atmosphere created.This is a brutally compelling and bleak look at a decaying and corrupt society of the 70's. An unsettling gem of a film.5/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Did I Miss Something?,"Did I miss something or this movie doesn't have any purpose?Do people just call this a masterpiece just for the sake of it?I've seen old movies like Clockwork Orange that people consider ""weird"" and liked it and even find this one weirder than that! And the only reason I'm giving a 6 and not a 5 is because of De Niro's acting.With all the ""masterpiece"", ""such a great film"" ""revolutionary masterpiece of a film"" I heard about it I was expecting to be blown away by the story and dialogue, but there's near to no story here other than an incel's journey to being a hero!The dialogue is bafflingly bad and empty, I was expecting great dialogue from this one but it's just not there. Just go and watch the scene with Travis talking to the other taxi driver on the street and see what I mean. It's a 5 minute of nothing. The whole dialogue is ""well I mean.... It's just.... I mean.... well.... yeah.... you know..."". Like what!?The interaction of characters with each other is just awkward.The movie is also a little boring, and don't use that word about movies lightly because I've seen a handful of long movies with stretched scenes and long dialogue scenes and wasn't boring for me but this one is just on another level.And what was that ending? Is Travis supposed to be the hero now? Really?What an utter disappointment this movie was, all these years hearing about it and thinking it's one of the classics and then finally watching it like this...",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese's dark masterpiece of urban alienation,"Despite what some might see as limited by technical flaws and/or as an overly simplistic plot, Taxi Driver deserves its critical reputation as a cinematic masterpiece. Some 23 years later, the existential plight of Travis Bickle, ""God's lonely man,"" continues to pack a hard emotional punch. In fact, it's hard to know where to begin when praising the elements of this film - such elements as the dark location shots of a (now gone) seedy Times Square, the cinema verite settings of the cabbies and campaign workers, the magnificent Bernard Hermann score, Paul Schrader's fine script, the memorable performances of Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, and Peter Boyle all must be mentioned. However, the brilliance of this film is primarily a result of the brilliance of De Niro and Scorsese, one of the greatest actor-director teams in movie history. This is an unforgettable film and rates a 10 out of 10, in my estimation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You'll love the mood.. but is the ending worth 2 hours of build up?,"A nicely made dark and majestic experience, see the world through the eyes of a weird taxi driver, as his character progresses from a total embarrassment to a mad dog. The movie sends a clear message about society and human ego, and how a man's pride can drift him into insanity.The mood is nice, a prime example on a classic Noir movie, it builds up and prepares you mentally for the big ending.. an ending that failed to live up to the hype that the movie has built in you.. though it had a short yet exciting action scene the ending is pretty simple and is more about delivering a simple message rather than leaving you amazed or satisfied.The dark comedy in the movie is pretty clear, it shows you how messed up society really is, the movie was executed flawlessly when it comes to cinematic and production, but it will disappoint you at the very end, the ending was just too ""MEH"" to bear, especially after an excellent build of events preceding it, such a pity.I'm sure the movie was a big hit at the time of its release (after the Vietnam war), but I'm not sure it would be enjoyed the same at our current time, so let me put it this way: - If you enjoy a dark Noir mood with nice character development then watch it now. - If you enjoy movies with subliminal messages then add this one to your ""watch when I have nothing else to watch"" list. - If you're looking for a great story with a nice twist to it, I wouldn't recommend Taxi Driver.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A story about a lonely man,"Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever made. This is one of those films that you do not get tired of seeing and every time you watch it you realize a little detail that you have not seen before. Excellent actors, a good director, an impressive soundtrack and a real story are the main appeals of this film.This film is about loneliness, about the isolation of a man in a society full of scum. His objective is to finish with the scum of the streets. The story uses a taxi driver as a metaphor of loneliness and it has some kind of irony because we can see that a city which is full of people can be the most lonely place for a man. The long nights in the city, the night environment full of whores, junkies, pimps and thieves are the main elements of the world in which Travis Bickle lives. Travis is an misunderstood guy who is seeking desperately for some kind of company because as he says 'loneliness has followed me all my life, everywhere' but at the same time he seems not to do anything to avoid his situation and it is seen when he goes with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) to a porn cinema. At the end of the film the character makes real his most violent fantasies, with a look of certain soldiers from Vietnam, and he behaves like this because of his loneliness, his alienation and because he does not find any sense to his life. The violent behaviour becomes Travis into a hero, although he had killed many people and he could do it again. Although he acts with an extreme violence the spectator understand him and the reasons why he acts that way. The soundtrack of the film, which is composed by Bernard Herrmann, inspires some kind of loneliness and sometimes it is absolutely terrifying like in a horror film. This music and the slow camera showing the streets help to introduce the spectator into the world of Travis, to know what he is thinking about.In general I cannot say any negative aspect of this film because I have not found anything bad. Although it is a film of the 70s it is not an old-fashioned movie because the essence of the story, the reality that is shown on it, can be perfectly referred to the current society. This film has the privilege of having made famous the sentence You talking' to me? You talking' to me?' which will remain in the history of cinema. This is an authentic masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Disturbing Look into a Disturbed Mind,"Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) is a disturbed ex-Marine Vietnam vet. He's suffering from insomnia, and spends his nights driving a cab. He's sexually perverted, and obsessed with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). On top of it all, he wants to save 12 year old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster).DeNiro delivered one of the iconic performances of all times. Travis Bickle is one of the standards by which all performances are judged. Martin Scorsese is making a disturbing movie. It can be hard to watch at times. Scorsese uses his camera to maximum effect. As Bickle's mind drift from his co-workers, Scorsese's camera drift into the antacid fizzling in his glass. The grittiness of '70s NY is all there. Jodie Foster is shocking. Trying to watch Bickle can be a very trying experience. It isn't an easy movie. But it is a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Live it and lose it,"Scorsese's best.  Not too many hyper-critical reviews of this film have anything near as intelligent to say about what the director and the screenwriter had in mind when they created this American gem.To those people that have seen it and thought it was ""slow"" or the pacing was sub par, they don't know what they're talking about; ""Taxi Driver"" is about the gradual and eventual take-over of insanity, and not about violence, action-shoot-'em-up 'slash' car chase... or whatever they expected from it.  The modern audience today is expecting everything--comedy, drama, unbearable suspense, spfx--all rolled-up into one-stop entertainment... and no, I'm not anybody's grandfather, or here to tell you that movies were great in my day, but, viewers, lighten up already.De Niro, and the rest of the cast, do a serviceable job in this micro-cosmic window into the life of Travis Bickle--a Vietnam vet--who, true, writes mind-numbing entries in his diary, leads a, for the most part, dull existance as a cabbie, and strikes out with a female political campaigner who, after Travis becomes a hero, discovers she is indeed attracted to unstable, sometimes violent chauffeurs.The rest of this movie's story is for the less initiated viewer; decide whether you've truly become desensitized to sexual and violent content in today's films...  Ah, forget it!  You have to have lived at least some of which goes on in ""Taxi Driver,"" or you've just been plain lucky in this life so far.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Didn't do it for Me - De Niro's Performance is the Only Real Highlight,"As much as I love Scorsese, Taxi Driver did not appeal to me.For me the film was quite dull and boring with little suspense, drama and extremely slow pacing.I'm intrigued to know why this film was nominated for 4 Academy Awards, as well as its ongoing rave as a classic.Perhaps I missed the point of the movie, as I was waiting it to end from half way through.However I did notice some positives. Firstly it is clear, De Niro's performance as a troubled veteran-turned-taxi driver was masterful, and he showed a clear character development during the film. Another positive for me is the aesthetics of New York, as its darker sides are shown. Lastly the score was one that stood out for me, with relaxing music in scenes of driving.6/10 - a good effort, but too much caution over ensuring not too quick pacing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An Unforgettable Movie and Lead Character,"""Travis Bickle"" has to be one of the most fascinating characters ever put on film, and this has to still rank as one of the best post-film noir era ""noirs"" ever made.Yeah the story is a bit seedy but it's an incredibly interesting portrait of a mentaly unbalanced cab driver (Bickle, played by Robert De Niro) and his obsessions with ""cleaning up"" New York City.In addition to De Niro's stunning performance, we see a young and gorgeous Cybill Shepherd and a very, very young (12 years old) Jodie Foster. I've always wondered what kind of parents would allow their 12-year-old daughter to play a role like this, but that's another subject. Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel (with shoulder-length hair!) and Peter Boyle all lend good supporting help.Bickle's transformation from a ""disturbed"" cabbie to a fully-deranged assassin is fantastic to watch, and includes one of the classic scenes in all film history: Bickle talking to the mirror and repeating the question, ""You talking' to me?"" That scene, and seeing De Niro in a Mohawk haircut later at a political rally are two scenes I'll never forget.The more times I've watched this, the more I appreciate the cinematography and the music in here. There are some wonderful night shots of the city's oil and rain-slicked streets. Also, Bernard Herrmann eerie soundtrack is an instrumental part of the success of this film and should never be neglected in discussing this film.Director Martin Scorcese has made a number of well-known (but not particularly box-office successful) films, and I still think this early effort of his was his best. He's never equaled it, although I think he and De Niro almost pulled it off five years later with another whacked-out character, ""Rupert Pupkin"" In ""The King Of Comedy.""In any case, there is no debate that Scorcese and De Niro are a great team and that Taxi Driver is one of the most memorable movies of the Seventies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I would have given more space to the story of the young girl.,I expected more. I would have given more space to the story of the young prostitute girl whom the protagonist tries to help.

Gut Wrenching,"It's interesting to read the reviews by people who really disliked this film. Can we dislike virtually every character in a movie and yet keep watching it, even respect it? I don't have a definitive answer to this, but I was captivated by this film. I get this feeling every time I see films that glorify organized crime. DeNiro's performance so surpasses any doubt as to the content of this film that I couldn't take my eyes off him. Contrary to the critics, his every expression reveals his skill as an actor. While his motivations are confusing, they are his motives. He is an unbalanced war survivor who can't tolerate the cesspool the world has become. I mean, ""What did I fight for?"" His social skills are wasted. When he goes on the date, it's one of the most uncomfortable moments I've ever spent in a theater. The efforts to save a small part of his world is met with disdain and resistance. So he flips out and decides to clean it up himself. He is suspicious of politicians and authority figures. He becomes his own man and takes matters into his own hands. The key thing is that he is true to himself and even though he is a frightening figure, he gets his way. I guess most think he should have been killed. That's not a valid criticism. See this, but be prepared to keep changing positions in your seat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

De Niro is just outstanding as Travis, and Scorsese is in top form too, only maybe rivaled by Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street. It is not a action, crazy plot-twists, guy meets girl, happy ending kind of movie. What it is, is one of the best character studies and acting ever done.

One of my favorite Movies!,"Taxi Driver is a Neo-Noir crime drama, directed by Martin Scorsese. It is starring Robert de Niro and Jodie Foster and is about a mentally unstable taxi driver who feels a need for violent action and wants to help a young woman to escape from her bad situation. It takes place in late 70s New York when the city wasn't the nice clean city as we know it today but it was a city full of criminals and unemployment. Taxi Driver is a really interesting character study and although it's slow paced it doesn't feel boring. Although the first two acts are slow paced, the final act is very thrilling and brutal. The ending makes you keep guessing. The Soundtrack composed by Bernard Herrmann captures that feeling of 70s New York very well. It has very beautiful cinematography which is very dark and rainy the whole time which sets a great mood for the film. The best thing about this movie is by far Robert de Niro's performance. He does a very good job at portraying this mentally unstable veteran, who can't fit in the society anymore. Taxi Driver has very long dialogues that are well-written.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Outlived classic,"I agree with some of the opinions that people have about this movie. That it's a masterpiece, a cultural icon and THEY'RE RIGHT. I just don't think that this movie is still as relevant as it was in the 1970's. Unlike The Godfather or Jaws, this movie has been triumphed by other films describing an individual slowly loosing his mind (Joker etc.) and even though I consider to be a GOOD movie, I don't hold it on the same level as The Godfather, because this movie is just a masterpiece lost in time, not understood by today's viewership, myself.It moves in slow pace, and the whole movie kind of builds to well, nothing. And that's probably my biggest problem with it. Anyway. So long.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I liked it but I didn't find it to be amazing,"Taxi Driver is another high-rated classic that kept getting on my radar from time to time. It is beloved by many, adored by most viewers but to me, it's just good. I've stated this before during some of my reviews but I'm just not a fan of shootouts, especially when they display Terminator-like stamina and endurance when getting shot or injured in some way. It's like watching an anime character getting beaten to the grown and seeing them regain all their power again in a blink of an eye just to save the day. Of all those that I didn't like though, I'd say this is the best. Mostly because of the aftermath where Travis did the finger gun motion at his skull upon the arrival of policemen. He did it in a crazy, a bit surreal even, fashion that ended up being the most memorable scene in the movie.Other than that, this felt like a hang-out movie from the perspective of a slightly depressed insomniac. There wasn't really a clear direction that this movie took. I thought it be a love story when Betsy was introduced but then she was present for only 10% of the movie, most likely even less. I thought this could be a story about hardships in New York and how the society and many micro-societies live along, fight and interact with violent and non-violent tendencies in mind but it only involved minor plotlines. I thought this could be about saving a young woman from being dragged situation where she is just used as an object to exploit but then again that was only the latter half or three-sevenths of the movie. If someone would ask me what this movie is about, I'd just mention Travis and what he has to deal with but in New York City. That answer would be as ambiguous as the actual plot.Speaking of Betsy and Iris, whose name I didn't mention in the last paragraph, both of these actresses impressed me as much as Travis, played by none other than Robert De Niro. Betsy was played by Cybill Shepherd and even though she didn't have a lot of screen time, it was really memorable. Not just for her looks but also her charm and her wit. She delivered my favorite lines of the movie when she quoted Kris Kristofferson and her appearance in the final scene of the movie, although surprising, helped to end the movie in a good tone. Jodie Foster played Iris and she impressed me in a similar way that Matilda impressed me in Léon: The Professional (1994). Being only 14-year-old when the movie was released (I believe she was 13 when it was filmed), she played a really mature role perfectly. I thought it was a joke when Sport said she's only twelve but I was shocked to find out that she was actually really close to that age as she looked like she's in her mid or late teens. With Matilda, I really didn't expect it as then I thought she was a grown actress playing the role of child, I was even more wrong there. And moving on from that, I still want to talk about Robert De Niro. I got to know him from roles that portray him as badass, sometimes the bad guy that I just can't help but root for. Seeing him in a bit of a more somber role was a good exchange as I got something different from him but I just wasn't really the biggest fan of Travis, to be honest. I've heard some people say that this is the best De Niro performance but I'm not sure. It might be but I just didn't like the character he portrayed. I liked HOW he portrayed him, I just didn't like the character himself. Confusing? Yet, it is.The last thing I want to talk about is the music here. Of course, it has one of the sexiest soundtracks there is and it's a big part of why I might get back to this movie sometime in the future. The main theme is composed by Bernard Herrmann, who also was in the music department of all-time classic movies like Psycho (1960), Vertigo (1958), and North by Northwest (1959). Letterboxd recognized 58 movies with his at the composer and his work is just stunning, I should definitely just look into his compositions one day. The main theme hits us with fun with a jazzy romantic melody that just brightens the mood every time it comes up. Unless it comes up during Sport (I believe his name in the movie was Michael) acts like a creep towards Iris with this song in the background... yes, it didn't really work for that scene and it almost made it lose its charm for me but a few scenes in the future acted like a rebound and got that charm back in my eyes.Overall, Taxi Driver was a good movie that just didn't interest me that much. It got a lot of good things about it but nothing that made me overly excited. There's nothing that makes me think of it as a bad movie either. This places it along with Léon: The Professional (1994), who I mentioned before. I like both of those movies but the action they displayed just isn't for me, I liked the human elements of these movies more. They're still good movies (look at me, repeating myself) but I just can't look at them as amazing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Suck On This!,"If you ask me - I think that Taxi Driver is one of those truly puzzling films that has been seriously over-rated (way-way-way out of proportion). It really has.With me giving Taxi Driver 5 stars, I think that I am actually being quite generous with that rating - 'Cause, at best, this film was an average production that seemed to contain an almost endless stream of filler-scenes where absolutely nothing of any interest ever happens.Now 40 years old, Taxi Driver (which contained some of the most inane dialogue and preposterous situations imaginable) certainly doesn't hold up very well today.And fresh-faced actor, Robert De Niro, as the psychotic vigilante, Travis Bickle (and his double-talking, dime-store philosophy) was pretty dull stuff, for the most part.And, speaking about Taxi Driver's climatic final showdown - I actually burst out laughing as I watched how badly this sequence was staged. And the over-dramatization of the violence, after the fact, was one of the worst examples of bad directing that I've seen in a mighty long time.All-in-all - This highly-praised picture barely managed to rise above mediocrity on only a few occasions.P.S. - If you want to see a real stand-out performance worthy of a ""Razzie"", check out Cybill Shepherd, as Betsy, the airhead political organizer.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Best movie of the Seventies, and one of the greatest of all time.","So much has been written and talked about 'Taxi Driver' that it seems almost redundant to add anything more. But watching it again the other night for the nth time I was, as I have been every single time I've seen it, struck by just how perfect this movie is. It is as powerful and disturbing now as it was twenty-five years ago. It has not only NOT aged, it gets better and more relevant every year. This is without doubt a modern classic, and one of the handful of truly great, timeless movies.Scorsese and Schrader went on to make other great movies after this, both separately ('The King Of Comedy', 'Light Sleeper') and together ('Raging Bull', 'The Last Temptation Of Christ'), but this is easily the best movie of their careers. And Robert De Niro's too. He has yet to top his stunning performance here as the deeply disturbed and alienated Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle, cabbie and would be assassin. This character has not surprisingly entered movie legend.Scorsese surrounds De Niro with a first rate supporting cast, including small but effective roles from Harvey Keitel ('Reservoir Dogs'), Peter Boyle ('Hardcore'), the underrated Victor Argo ('The King Of New York') and Joe Spinell ('Maniac'). Albert Brooks and Jodie Foster are also very good, and even Cybil Shepherd, the butt of many jokes, is fine as Bickle's obsession.When you combine these actors, Schrader's outstanding script, and Scorsese's brilliant direction, with the stunning cinematography (Michael Chapman) and haunting score (Hitchcock fave Bernard Herrmann's final effort), you have yourself a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. If you haven't seen 'Taxi Driver' I urge you to do so immediately. It is a masterpiece, pure and simple.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Martin Scorsese's Hypnotic, Paranoia Fueled Masterpiece","Taxi Driver is one of the most acclaimed movies ever made. The 1976 Martin Scorsese Masterpiece is as studied and reveled today as it ever was and for good reason. Taxi Driver is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen and the hypnotic story of a man losing his grip on sanity is truly one of the most captivating movies ever made.The movie itself is a study. It is obviously a ""character study"" but the film itself is a synopsis of the human psyche, rage, hypocrisy, melancholy, loneliness, obsession with violence, and its glorification in the media. This is all seen through the jaded lens of anti-hero Travis Bickle played in incredible fashion by Robert De Niro. De Niro's mesmerizing performance is truly one of the best ever put to screen. It is captivating in every sense of the word. He captures the essence of the character and makes Travis Bickle all the more enthralling, and for a film like this that is more than essential.This movie draws you in like no other. From Bernard Herman's score, to the mesmeric editing, to Scorsese's masterful direction, this movie forces you to relate to this deeply troubled character. The movie is so hypnotic that much of the film you want to look away, but to turn your head for a second would be near impossible. That's how much this movie's atmosphere takes you in, it is top notch in that.The movie showcases Travis' destructive attempt to escape his own isolation, social incapability, and to achieve self imposed vigilantism. The movie is a slow burning stick of dynamite, burning with flames paranoia and alienation until it explodes in one of the fieriest and explosive climax's in cinematic history. The movie isn't really about Travis' war on the inhumane pimps, it is about delusion, rage, social detachment, paranoia, obsession, violence, and how it can drive a man crazy.The resolution to this movie is also really fascinating. Its meaning has been the source for many discussions but the reason I love it so much is how it plays off the rest of the film. I quote no other than screenwriter of the movie Paul Schradar himself, ""I've always felt that the last frame can be spliced to the first frame and the movie started all over again."" Pure genius.This movie is really incredible and it just gets better each time you watch it. I truly recommend this film. The famous quote from the movie is ""You talkin' to me? Well I'm the only one here."" In Travis' case he couldn't be more right. ""I'm the only one here.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

An individual's fight- against loneliness and for justice.,"""Taxi Driver"" is a beautiful portrayed of an individual who tries to do things his way, in the hectic and dangerous New York of the '70's. He already isn't a stable person to begin with (he's a Vietnam veteran) but through his loneliness and due to his own personal views and idea's of society and the world, he gets more and more consumed by the rotten society until he feels it is enough and decides to take matters into his own hands.Beauty of the movie is that it gets interpreted by everyone in his or hers own way. Everyone sees some different things in the story and characters. I think this also was what writer Paul Schrader and director Martin Scorsese had in mind, while making this movie.The story takes us into the world of Travis Bickle. We begin to see society through his eyes and we more and more begin to understand the character as the movie progresses. It makes his character not only a understandable one but also a very realistic one. Nothing in this movie is overdone or made to look better or worser than it is in real life.The movie is made extra powerful through the performances of the cast. Robert De Niro is a sensational main lead and the supporting cast is also real great. Some well known actors that were still unknown at the time of this movie make an appearance, such as a very young Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Victor Argo and an almost unrecognizable young Harvey Keitel.The entire movie is sensational- and with lots of style directed by Martin Scorsese, who knows how to set the right mood and atmosphere. The simple- but effective and realistic from Michael Chapman and the musical score by Bernard Herrmann (his last) also add to the atmosphere. Also of course the fact that New York City serves as the backdrop for this movie, gives the movie a typical dark and gritty feeling and atmosphere. Everything is slowly but powerfully build up in the movie and every sequences plays a significant role. A result of this is that the movie is filled with some unforgettable sequences, of which the famous 'You talking' to me?' sequence is the best known. But also the violent ending leaves a lasting impression.It's still a movie that applies today, after 30 years now. Because lets face it, what exactly has been changed in society compared to 30 years ago and now? The subject and meaning of the movie could still apply to present day. It makes ""Taxi Driver"" a timeless and important movie that is a perfect reflection of society and already is worthy of the 'classic'-status.Yet another essential '70's viewing.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Masterpiece,"Taxi Driver (1976)**** (out of 4)Scorsese's masterpiece is a raw, powerful and nerve wrecking look at depression and loneliness. The film centers on taxi driver Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a man clearly with his own demons who finds a purpose in life when he meets a 12-year-old hooker (Jodie Foster) who he plans on saving from her pimp (Harvey Keitel). To me this is one of the richest films ever made and it's one that can easily be overlooked in some circles if you don't really connect to what the film is trying to say. I didn't care too much for the movie the first few times I watched it because I was too young to really understand depression and loneliness. After I understood what those things could do to a person is when I fully became aware of the power in this film and today it remains one of the most powerful films ever made. To me the entire film is pretty much about Travis trying to find someone to fit in with but of course it never really happens until he meets the hooker. He tries fitting in with the Cybill Shepherd character but falls flat on his face. He tries fitting in with his co-workers but that doesn't work out too well. No matter what Travis tries he keeps ending up alone and as he put it, he's God's lonely man. This film works on so many levels but I think the psychological one is where it's best at. Getting us into the mind of Travis works for many reasons but the biggest keys are the direction by Scorsese, the brilliant music score by Bernard Herrmann and DeNiro's groundbreaking performance. Putting those three things together is what makes this a classic but we can also throw in the screenplay by Paul Schrader, which rightfully gives the movie the time and patience to let the Travis character grow right in front of our eyes. DeNiro's performance is certainly one for the ages, although I think he would get even better with Scorsese's RAGING BULL, which would follow in four years. His performance here is nothing short of amazing because you can't help but be terrified by this guy because of the look in DeNiro's eyes. You can't help but feel sorry for him at the same time because there are countless moments where he embarrasses himself because he simply doesn't know how to fit in. The word anti-hero gets used a lot and perhaps that's a good term but I think it's something much deeper than that. DeNiro hits all the right marks without a false note anywhere. Foster is also impressive in her few scenes in the film as is Keitel as the pimp. Shepherd is also good as his Albert Brookes and the underrated Peter Boyle who has one of the best scenes in the movie where he's trying to talk some sense into Travis. The visual look of the film is mighty impressive and Scorsese's directing style is nothing short of amazing. The slimy looking streets and the dark atmosphere are one of a kind and something many films tried to copy but could never get it as perfect as it is here. This here remains one of the greatest American films ever made and I'm really not sure any movie could top it in showing the effects that loneliness can have on a person.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You Talking To Me?,"We certainly have here one of Martin Scorsese's best and most striking films, one of Robert De Niro's best performances and one of the biggest Oscar wrongdoers of 1977, in which the film ran for four categories, including best film, but won none. . Certainly one of the things that stands out the most is the New York setting, the city is practically a character in the film, the soundtrack is also great, the direction of Scorsese needs no comments, and the feature has what is in my opinion the best character study in the history of cinema. Judie Foster also looks great in the film, showing that at just twelve years of age she was an excellent actress, and even received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.

Unrelenting descent into one man's private hell.,"One of the most talked about films of all time is Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, it has been pored over, analyzed, and dissected to within an inch of its life it would seem.Taxi Driver is something of a bad dream, it's like we are privy to the melt down of the man next door because Travis Bickle has a certain level of believability, and it's this fact that makes Taxi Driver such a riveting and skin crawling delight. We see New York from the confines of Travis's Taxi Cab, the grim and grime of a dead beat society is itching away at the viewer because of the claustrophobic nature of the viewpoint, we see thru Travis's eyes, his shifty tortured eyes. This grim urban play gains maximum impact from Bernard Herrmann's score, one moment we are listening to a jangly pornographic sounding jazz/blues fusion and then we get Travis accompanied by judder music, unstable judder music! Michael Chapman's cinematography is appropriate to the feel of the film, some how it feels off kilter to further emphasise the unease unfolding on the screen.The supporting cast are as impressive as they are memorable, Jodie Foster lays down a marker that she thankfully continued to improve upon, Cybil Shepherd gets to look pretty and convince as the intrigued but cold Betsy, whilst Harvey Keitel manages to get away with sleazy pimp portrayal by enthusing the character with menace without the histrionics.It's Robert DeNiro's show all the way tho, everything that has been said and written is true, he has the viewer firmly in his hand, from the portrayal of the uncomfortable loner at the start, right to the mohawk wearing crusader at the end, he scares and enthrals in equal measure. He is Travis, and no greater compliment I can pay his performance than to say that I feel I'm along for the ride with Travis, he has my undivided attention, always!One of the best films of the 70s. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Maybe Scorsese's best?,"Here's a test for telling if a film has a great atmosphere: if you find yourself wanting to do the things you see the main character doing because it all just looks and sounds so cool, then it most likely does.And man do I want to go straight to New York right now and soak in the night atmosphere of a big city, drive strangers around while never knowing why they're going to where I'm taking them, and maybe try to assassinate a certain presidential candidate.And I don't even have a driver's license.But seriously, this is another one of those classics I'd never seen before, and believe it or not, somehow I didn't even know about the whole presidential candidate side plot and just happened to watch this on election day.Weird coincidences aside, I bloody loved this. It's by far my favourite Scorsese film I've seen so far, and almost entirely because of Travis and how perfect Robert De Niro is in this role. I'm not sure I've ever felt such moral confusion on a character in my life. I think he's a product of toxic masculinity and that confronting Betsy was pretty disgusting...but then who hasn't been on a date that ended badly for no reason you can see? And how angry did it make you?Similarly, who hasn't seen some kind of injustice at any level and felt that desire, even if only for a bit, to dispense justice yourself, even if you know you'd never really do it?And I'm sure whatever side you're on, you can relate to the desire to assassinate a presidential candidate right now (make it the orange one if you're going to do it anyway though).And I really can't overstate enough how amazing Robert De Niro is in this, everyone else is great too, but he is in some of the best performances of all time tier.But that atmosphere though...this is one of the best cityscape films I've ever seen. The soundtrack, the lighting, and the set design are all incredible, and the directing and cinematography is by far the best I've seen from Scorsese (although that is only including Raging Bull, The Irishman and The Wolf Of Wall Street so take that with a pinch of salt.)And if (God willing) Biden is sworn in two and a half months from now, if I've somehow attracted any crazy right wing nutters to my account, then I couldn't recommend a better film for your frustrations, or as a means of damage control.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A man without history in a world he hates,"Rarely has a movie set out to create a sense of uncomfortable loneliness and succeeded so well as Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader did in Taxi Driver. Born from Schrader's own sense of isolation at a particularly unpleasant low point in his life, this tale of a loner cabbie is one of a man lost in a sea of people, unable to make any kind of connection, and left to his own delusions that take him into dangerous places. Unmoored from anything but his one-way conversation with his parents through letters and his journal, Bickel descends into violence in a searing portrait of loneliness mixed with, potentially, undiagnosed mental illness.Bickel is a twenty-six year old former Marine from the Midwest who has come to New York City for undisclosed reasons only to end up becoming a taxi driver because he's been trolling the streets of the city in the middle of the night and he might as well get paid for it. In the post-Vietnam era, Bickle is the sort of young man unconnected to much of his own past, much less the past of anything else. He is of the moment, looking out of his cab window at the filth of early 70s New York City and seeing a place he finds disgusting but refuses to leave. He wants the city cleaned up, but as a young man with no connections and no power, all he sees is a murky idea of a solution and no way to go about doing it. In the midst of all this is Betsy.Betsy is a young woman, played by Cybil Shepherd, working for the Charles Palantine campaign for president. The first time we see her, and Bickle sees her, she's walking through the streets of New York in a pristinely white dress, representing Bickle's view of her as pure. She ends up being his one chance at real connection, but he has such trouble connecting with people that when he invites her to a movie, he sees it as completely natural to take her to a Swedish sex film, a gesture that she does not appreciate, breaking off any contact with him. I think it's easy to see why she might risk a single date with the overearnest guy who marched up to her desk in the campaign office just to ask her out, but I can also easily see why she would shun him completely after taking him to a dirty movie. He was a bit of a risk that could have paid off and didn't.The flip side is that Bickle put himself out there and got rejected. His rejection over the phone, where the camera pans away at his painful failure, is a turning moment in the film. Bickle was working towards real connection, but his own missteps ended that completely. Immediately before his date with Betsy, he had even gotten Palantine into his cab where the senator had asked his opinion of what needed addressing in the country. Bickle could only talk about how he hated the scum of the city and it needed a cleansing rain. Left alone after Betsy dumps him, Bickle turns inward, shutting off the world around him that he finds so distasteful. He buys some illegal guns, practices with them endlessly while continuing to write about how awful the city is, and he scopes out Palantine's campaign spots.At the same time, Bickle keeps running into Iris, a twelve-year-old prostitute. She ends up representing something salvageable from the mess of a city, and he turns his attentions towards her. He offers her all of his money to get out and go back home to Pittsburgh just as he decides to use his gun skills on Palantine in an assassination attempt. When that is foiled, he marches right over to Iris', kills her pimp and john (who ends up being coincidentally a local mafioso), nearly dying in the process, and becomes a hero in the papers.I've watched a couple of movies recently that dealt with mental illness head on and I ended up calling them both trite (A Beautiful Mind and Welcome to Marwen). Taxi Driver doesn't explicitly deal with the idea, but it seems pretty obvious that Travis Bickle was a sick man. However, Bickle finds no cure. The final scene of Bickel picking up Betsy in his cab some months after the shootout seems to indicate that he's better, but the quick look into the mirror, looking for something just out of view, shows that he's not. He's still a ticking time bomb. He was going to assassinate somebody, whether a Senator or a pimp, and that isn't out of him. He's not cured of his problems because he blew some bad guys away and saved a young girl.Sold these days as a modern thriller, the film is really a quiet character study of a man slowly descending into a form of madness through his own devices and lack of any real support structure. The parents he writes to might have seen the signs of his mental decay, but he never had them around, being able to paint a rosy, mysterious portrait of himself working in secret for the government. His status as a Vietnam veteran along with his living in a city not his own seems to imply a disconnect from his past, perhaps a look at a new America removed from the old in every way with no connection to anything of meaning anymore. The only clean symbol is of a politician and those around him, a man who speechifies disingenuously when even talking one on one to a cabbie. Everything else is horrible, and Bickle has nothing to cling onto anymore.In terms of the film's music, this marks a strong departure for Scorsese. He had sourced music in every single one of his features up to this point, but here he hired Bernard Herrmann, Alfred Hitchcock's regular composer for decades, to score Taxi Driver completely. I can't say with any certainty that Herrmann's score knowingly recalls pieces from his career or if it's just the sort of result one gets from a composer who's been writing music for so long, but there are moments where it sounds like Herrmann's score to Vertigo in particular is seeping through. The movie overall has a certain dreamlike quality to it, and these musical measures placed especially around Iris feel like a direct call to Madeleine in Vertigo, the idea of a dream-woman who does not actually exist. Bickle sees Iris as an innocent, but she's a prostitute, having long lost herself to this dangerous and immoral life.This is a movie that provides absolutely no answers to the issues it brings up. It is the portrait of a lost soul in a world that has also lost its soul, a painful cry for meaning in a society that seems to actively reject it. The violence at the end is a painful view of how people can break in such a place. That Bickle ends up praised for his violence is an ironic point that allows his madness to continue to hide in plain sight.Taxi Driver is a fantastic movie that looks at the ugliness of the world clearly while painting a compelling portrait of a man driving himself to madness. It came from a place of pain in Paul Schrader that Martin Scorsese brought to compelling life on screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very good but flawed,"Great atmosphere and remarkable performances from DeNiro, Foster and even Albert Brooks but this film is sloppy with too many loose ends. Never really explained or expanded upon is the underlying friction between Travis and African Americans in the film...his suspicious, trance-like staredowns with black characters are never developed. The ending is completely out of place and unbelievable...Travis initiated the shootings...he never would have been hailed as a vigilante hero and in the real world would have been tried for murder. Deeply disturbed protagonist gets the girl in the end???? Come on. What's that all about. Also never fully explained is why does Palentine become the target of his lonely obsession with making a mark in this world? Travis had always expressed the desire to clean up the scum...and I understand the symbolic linking of a pimp with a politician, but the association is sloppy in the film because Travis always admired Palantine even after his disaster date with Betsy. There was never a turning point or event for him where the candidate became the target of his social dissatisfaction. And then there's the subject of Travis' hair. I know it seems petty but it was very distracting seeing scenes that were obviously shot as soon as the shaved headed DeNiro's hair grew in barely enough to pass for continuity with the earlier scenes.In all, I like this film. I think it's powerful and disturbing but it is not an icon or masterpiece. In its day, it was so groundbreaking that many of its flaws received a pass. 7out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One Of The Great Dark Classics,"There are some interesting notes I'd like to add to this review about how this film has a strange relationship to some real life serial killers, and of course as most people know, to a man who tried to assassinate a U. S. President...In the coffee and pie scene, Travis Bickle orders apple pie with melted cheese. When real life serial killer Ed Gein was arrested, he asked the police for a slice of apple pie with melted cheese in exchange for a full confession.Travis Bickle's attempted assassination of Senator Charles Palantine in this film inspired John Hinckley, Jr.'s real life attempted assassination of U. S. President Ronald Reagan on March 30th, 1981. Prior to the crime, Hinckley had been stalking Jodie Foster at Yale University, due to his obsession with her character Iris in this film. In a letter wrote to Foster, he told her that he was going to assassinate the President, so he could impress her. Reagan was shot in the chest and wounded by Hinckley, Jr., who was committed to a psychiatric facility when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity in 1982. He was released on September 10, 2016, after thirty-four years in confinement. For me personally, I was quite surprised to hear of his release. You'd sort of expect a guy that tried to kill a President to spend the rest of his life locked up. Then again, most people don't call the U. S. justice system ridiculous for nothing.This film draws many parallels with real life serial killer David Berkowitz, the 'Son of Sam'. He and Travis were mentally ill ex-soldiers who were disgusted by what they saw as the degradation of mid 1970's New York City, both were insomniacs, both used .44 caliber revolvers, and Berkowitz worked as a taxi driver before famously joining the Post Office. Although Berkowitz had already committed non-fatal stabbings and many arsons before the release of the film in February 1976, he did not begin his shooting spree until several months afterwards. It is unknown whether Berkowitz ever saw this movie, but certainly very possible. There is no doubt that Berkowitz was a somewhat traumatized person due to his family upbringing, but his status as mentally ill has actually often been challenged by professionals. He in fact a number of times was determined to be fit to stand trial and at times has even admitted to toying with the police and psychologists, just as he toyed with the police, the public, and the media with letters during his killing spree. He has actually been professionally analyzed as having above average intelligence. In more recent years during his incarceration Berkowitz pursued education and graduated with honors from Sullivan Community College.Sometimes I watch this film and I think, yeah, it's a good film. Then other times I really get into the feel of the film and I realize just how great it really is, it captures a mindset and that is its aim. It probably does this better than most films in history in fact.

One of the greatest character studies to ever exist!,"After watching Joker, I had to watch Taxi Driver to see how Scorsese pulled off this character study and, I have to admit, this is one of the greatest character studies made.Taxi Driver follows Travis Bickle, a veteran who works as a taxi driver during the night. His disgust towards the filth of the city leads him on an unstable and violent journey.This film is a masterpiece. It's a film that fully engrosses you into its dark and filthy world as well as the perspective of one of the greatest characters to ever be created, Travis Bickle.

It's shot extremely well especially the night scenes which are filled with atmosphere thanks to the fantastic score. I have to give a lot of credit to writer Paul Schrader for coming up with a truly disturbing and dark character study.

"On every street in every city, there's a nobody who dreams of being a somebody...","Taxi Driver is one of the first earnest studies of urban alienation that, in a very real sense, predicted many of the inevitable consequences such a condition spawns, and from which America (and Britain) has suffered over the past two decades. It proved to be a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy when, less than five years after it was filmed, a loner shot the US president to impress an actress who had appeared in this film. The implications of this are a little frightening when you think about itRobert De Niro is scarily convincing as Travis Bickle, a nondescript Vietnam vet who observes the dissolution on the streets of New York from the isolation of his cab. Each night he drives the streets, witnessing a tide of depravity that spills into the back of his cab, and each morning, after his shift, he has to wipe from the back seat the results of those intrusions. That's a bad enough experience for any man, but Travis is a loner who longs for a normal life and relationships but is too inarticulate and confused to be able to obtain them. He ruins his chance with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), campaign worker for a senator seeking election, by taking her to a porn film on their first date, and is genuinely confused when she takes exception to such behaviour. As Bickle tries to win her back on a public phone, his face hidden from the viewer, the camera pans away from him to focus on a corridor leading to the street as if embarrassed for him, and from then on, as his descent into madness gathers pace, Travis seems to edge further toward the edge of the screen in almost every shot.Bernard Herrmann's score superbly captures both the sleazy side of the New York streets and the sense of foreboding that permeates the entire film. Scorsese guides us through Bickle's increasingly disturbed state of mind without resorting to sensationalism or cheap manipulation of the audience, and Paul Schrader's intelligent script creates a completely believable character in Bickle as an unremarkable everyman who shares our standards of what's right and wrong but with a skewed perspective that has turned him into a ticking time-bomb. Only the speed with which Bickle and Iris develop a relationship and the contentious ending, for which too many people try to find a hidden meaning, weakens the film overall. That ending just doesn't sit right with the rest of the film  and Scorsese himself has discounted theories that it may be a dream sequence  but that shouldn't dissuade anyone with an interest in intelligent, thought-provoking films to catch this one at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Roots of Violence through a Powerful Character Study ...,"From the dark and misty streets of New York City's nights, two eyes contemplate the desolated degradation of society  the one who sees is Travis Bickle, Martin Scorsese's most tormented character, a cinematic icon who, through Robert De Niro's unforgettable performance, personifies the roots of violence in the most significant way.Travis Bickle, less by vocation than because of his insomnia, works as a nighttime taxi driver. The sleeping problem is the reason of Travis' job, and certainly not the cure for the alienating feeling about to ravage his soul, the torment devouring his heart, despite a ""clear conscience"". The opening shot of the film is a close-up on Travis' eyes; literally, he can't sleep means he can't shut his eyes, he can't ignore what happens before them. He sees because he's lucid. Junkies, whores, drug-selling pimps etc, all the miserable and rotten (low) life of the disillusioned post-Watergate America inspires Travis a pitiless comment: a rain should come out and wash all this filth. This rain is expected as redemption, creating at the same time, a psychological discomfort due to the guilt of being a simple observant just waiting  The filth sticks on Travis' soul like dirt on clothes and in his mind, if you're a watcher, you're part of the filth, if you're not, you're a 'washer'. Watcher or washer, it seems easier to plant seeds of violence in a land of guilt, and Travis' heart is full of it, like the majority of Marty's lead charactersTravis' psychological odyssey is constantly written in a diary, through a daily routine monotonically regulated by the meter. The meter governs Travis' life like the clock of a psychological ticking bomb, which is is almost defused by an angelic creature named Betsy, a beautiful sophisticated blonde, played by Cybill Shepherd, and crystallizing whatever Travis needs to become a better man. Symbolically, when she notices him the first time, it's raining as if she was the providential rain that would wash Travis' dirtied soul  And the interactions between Travis and Betsy emphasize the intelligence of the film, because it raises an interesting question about Travis's responsibilities in his psychological troubles. Is he necessarily a victim of the system? Of a post-Vietnam trauma, or any other alienation? or is he just a social misfit in the pathetic sense of the word?Travis Bickle was listed number 30 on AFI's Top 50 cinematic villains; many will argue he's an antihero. I don't think his outcast status should automatically prevent him from the 'villain' label, which doesn't make him any less fascinating. Anti-hero or villain, he's clearly a sociopath driven by a growing feeling of hostility which after the rejection by his country, by society, and women, hit him like a real psychic boomerang. The gap between Travis and society grows larger, and nature hates emptiness. Gaps must be filled. When Travis criticized Betsy's nerdy colleague, he indirectly summed up his personal philosophy ""he puts his energy in the wrong directions"", he said. Life is about putting energy somewhere. And Travis is not suicidal, despite his troubles. Travis' life is about filling gaps, which catalyzes his decision not to be a watcher, these are the roots of violence: not to take it anymore. We're not born violent, it's an existential choice expressed through acts, not thoughts. Violence is a physical energy; the rest is bullshit, pure hypocrisy like denouncing a situation without having the guts to fight it.Travis doesn't belong to the street, to society, so when all the efforts for normality and happiness become useless rejection, frustration, anger, alienation, all that negative energy plants seeds of violence in the land of guilt, to let a ferocious desire of revenge grow. Travis' energy is injected in a new skin, for a new goal, a selfish one, a redeeming one, in his burning eyes: revenge. The ticking bomb works again, and the explosion is imminent.Travis' legendary training, canalizing 100% of his energy for revenge, builds him a kind of supernatural strength through push-ups, exercises to increase pain resistance, and rapidity to draw a gun. The legendary ""You're talking to me"" scene, one of the most impacting and iconic movie quotes, can be summed up in one word: paranoia. Travis imagines himself talking to his victim; eager to be pushed, to have an excuse to use his gun. He asks for trouble, any opportunity to pull the trigger is welcome, and he's not afraid, he's got nothing to lose. Violent skills and paranoia, the deathblow that start the tickling bomb's countdownTravis has two choices: and violence is the medium of both, one is an assassination attempt and the other, concerns the situation of an underage prostitute, Iris, portrayed in a scarily authentic performance by a young Jodie Foster. Like the iris, she lives in the middle of Travis' eyes, in the center of his thoughts. She's an innocent flower that needs help, and she's Travis redemption. He can be a killer or a hero but the point of the film is not to make us root for Travis, but to show how violence works as a hazardous double edged sword. A bloody massacre can have positive consequences by purging bad blood, just like good intentions can pave the road to hell. In both cases, violence acts as a redeemer for the guilt-carrier soul, and as en exorcism of the frustration and anger's demons, violence like an operatic climax of alienation.Marty's masterpiece is a character study that invites us to explore the very roots of violence, through Travis Bickle, a character who's 'talking to us' by writing redemption in bloody letters, redeeming violence no less horrifying than the condemnable one. The irony is that after watching Marty's masterpiece, even the most horrifyingly violent acts that can't be justified, can at least be explained. Indeed, even the victims are not always innocent",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Cybill Shepherd who comes for love, man! She looked very pretty in the 1970s.The little girl in the movie was a shocker and her parents told her to act with confidence. It really takes courage to force her to do this.Harvey Keitel an underrated actor, he was so convincing as a pump, I wanted to kill him with my own hands because he is so convincing in this role, thank god scorcese saw talent in Keitel, man, he is so good and he was also good in a somewhat not great movie "" Mean Streets (1973), check it out if you really want to see Scorsese's work.Scorcese himself stars in the film, don't miss it because you won't forget it for a long time!The most impressive part of the film, and if you ask me, one of the greatest works I have ever seen, is the stunning cinematography from 1976 and the wonderful music, which I will never forget!

The Original Incel,"Taxi Driver is an incel shockfest that became a cult classic...and is probably more pertinent now than it has ever been.Robert Deniro, in his most iconic role, plays a socially inept taxi driver who falls in love with a woman way out of his league.After giving him a chance, he ruins things by taking her to a softcore porn movie, after which she cuts ties, and eventually ghosts him.Originally, it seems like he is going to take revenge by taking out the politician she works in a supporting role for.But after one thing leads to another...he tries to break a young girl stuck working in the sex industry out from the nightmare in which she lives.Effectively going on a suicidal tirade to achieve those ends.46 years later...it really garners a new context, in the age of internet induced incels shooting everything up...making this an all to prescient foreshadowing of things to come.Is it ahead of it's time, or just to blame?Hard to say in retrospect.But whereas the character here ends up an anti-hero turned hero in the end, in reality...it never plays out that way.Which, I suppose, is the real tragedy here.Either way, it's certainly established itself as one of the most iconic films ever set in New York City...which is a feat in itself.With many of the actors employed in the film going on to have successful and storied careers, as a result of it's success.A gritty, violent, and almost tragic anti love story.They just don't make em like this anymore.7.5 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Moody Character Study That Falls Short of Its Build-Up,"Taxi Driver is often hailed as a masterpiece of character study, and while it certainly delivers on atmosphere and psychological depth, it didn't quite live up to the expectations I had. The film is undeniably moody and evocative, immersing the viewer in the gritty, alienated world of New York City. The character of Travis is compelling in his complexity, but the pacing and the ultimate payoff left me questioning whether the two-hour build-up was truly worth it.The movie's strength lies in its exploration of Travis's distorted sense of morality. His actions-whether attempting to assassinate a politician or targeting a pimp-aren't about moral transformation but about his ongoing self-deception. Travis manipulates his anger and obsession, framing them as righteous causes, despite his complete detachment from any genuine moral concern. The film brilliantly dissects how a person can twist morality to suit their own emotional turmoil, offering a profound commentary on cognitive dissonance.However, despite the depth of the character study, the slow pacing and lack of a traditional protagonist to root for left me feeling disconnected. Travis is neither a hero nor a clear villain, and his descent into violence lacks a satisfying emotional arc. The movie feels more intellectual than visceral, and for some, this can make the long build-up feel like a slow march toward an unsatisfying conclusion. The ending, while intense, doesn't offer the resolution I expected, leaving me questioning if it justifies the time invested in getting there.Ultimately, Taxi Driver is a thought-provoking film, but the slow pacing and ambiguous payoff might not feel rewarding to everyone. It succeeds in capturing mood and offering a unique psychological portrait, but whether it truly justifies the build-up is debatable. For me, it's an impressive exploration of morality and delusion, but not one that fully earned its two-hour runtime.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I can't, for the life of me, see how these people would give this certified dud 8 & 10-star ratings.I mean, Taxi Driver's story was less than interesting. There wasn't a single likable character in the whole lot of these NYC losers. The directing was, for the most part, very amateurish and inconsistent. And the violence was, at times, almost laughable.This, to me, was not in any way a satisfying movie-experience, yet people seem to, literally, fall all over themselves, heaping unwarranted praise on it.Personally, I think that most of these people who love Taxi Driver to pieces are probably now in their 50s and 60s.These people saw this film when it was first released in movie theaters back in 1976.

Back when movie making was art,"Taxi Driver is one of those films you have two watch multiple times. Arguably Robert De Niro best acting performance.

A New York cab driver slowly goes mad...,"... while he witnesses the crime and squalor of the city. It is a fascinating character study of a lonely, socially awkward man named Travis Bickle (De Niro).It's hard to make anything of Travis. Most people attribute his odd nature and serious mental problems to his service in the Vietnam war, but that's only scratching the service and missing much of the point. Travis' problems aren't solely the result of PTSD, although they clearly do play a role in his ability to function and interact with others. Remember, much of Taxi Driver has to do with being lonely and isolated in one of the biggest cities around. Look at the famous scene where he talks to himself in the mirror. I know it was improvised, but it still says much about the character. ""You talkin' to me? Well, I'm the only one around here."" Think about it; he is so lonely that he has to talk to his reflection. Overall, Taxi Driver is a film about isolation and loneliness. If he had an environment that recognized that he has some serious issues, then he wouldn't have done much of what he did. Instead, Betsy (Cybill Shepard) kicks him out of her life, the cab drivers go on about nothing and the pimps see him only as a customer.Travis is also a walking contradiction and someone who creates his own misfortune. He is disgusted by the prostitution and sex around him, yet he goes to watch pornos every night. He longs for human interaction, yet ruins his chances with Betsy by taking here to watch a porno flick. If Travis had just taken her to dinner and to some harmless mainstream movie (I'm thinking Rocky since this is 1976), who knows what could have happened. Instead, he creates his own misfortune- he's a black and white thinker.You could literally write an entire book about Taxi Driver and still not get everything. So this is more than the story of a disturbed veteran (which he obviously is). Look at the beginning and the end of the movie. The first scene and the last scene are identical, because nothing was solved and Travis remains the same person.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I think it is one of the indispensables of a cinema lover,"Travis is one of the main characters that should be underlined in the world of cinema, and of course the camera that revolves around Travis is like a reflection camera placed in Travis' brain. There is more to the audience than acting. To be seen as a legendary man who has synthesized psychological depression with his loneliness, like a bomb ready to explode at any moment he lives, but at the same time as a simple and ordinary taxi driver inversely proportional to this. Travis is one of the examples that life puts in the wrong corner. The city has such a treatment that they have so engraved the dark city in the movie that when we think of scenes from the movie, it is a sky where the exhausts of old cars and cigarette smoke blend together, dirty streets and laughter. Travis is a person's soul to be separated from himself and become lonely. Psychology that will allow a man with a pure and pure heart to come across the wrong hours of life, to feel the ticking of the clock as his own loneliness, to get one step closer to the explosion as time goes by, and to take on a psychopathic identity as time goes on. Trying to eliminate loneliness with weapons and putting the monotonous city into different tunes has now been left to the subconscious of this man. Besides its script, it is a film that created a visual feast in my memory with its strong psychology and huge camera angles. Robert De Niro and his charisma and his charisma combined like the paralyzed stray cats of the American streets, revealing the story of a journey to anarchy. Think of Travis in the dark streets of your heart before you withdraw into your own self and think for a long time. I think it is one of the indispensables of a cinema lover.10 / 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Gritty, down at heel and stylish","Almost 50 years after it's release I finally got to see Taxi Driver, and I'm glad I did. It's a movie well worth seeing, and I can understand why it is often cited as an important movie.The plot, very briefly . . . An ex Vietnam marine, Travis Bickle, takes a job as a taxi driver in the seediest and toughest areas of New York. A loner, an insomniac, and perhaps scarred by wartime experiences, he struggles with the 'filth' of the city and people around him even though to a degree he is part of it. Those mental obsessions eventually encourage him to a violent role as a self-appointed city saviour.Robert De Niro plays Bickle, superbly. It's very much his film. Cybill Shepherd is also excellent as Betsy, who is the subject of Bickle's infatuation. And New York stars too - not in a glamorous way, but in the director's fine portrayal of a tough, oppressive, dirty, drug and vice filled world where you need to be streetwise to get by. As you'd expect from this type of story, the film contains sex scenes, swearing and violence - though by 2024 standards nothing overly shocking.The film focuses squarely on Bickle - his social awkwardness, his isolation and his declining mental health. You sense it will not end well for him, and the film takes you along in a meandering fashion very much akin to a slow, late night cab ride home.The ending, which I've no doubt must have been much discussed over the years, is a surprise. One that adds another layer of questioning and is very much open to interpretation. It worked well for me.Overall, a stylish film that I enjoyed and will almost certainly watch again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Gritty, enthralling and iconic masterpiece","Gritty, enthralling and iconic masterpiece.Travis Bickle is a New York taxi driver. He is also socially awkward, a loner, an insomniac, a Vietnam veteran and has issues. He sees the criminals - prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers etc - on the streets and views them as dirt, and wishes that a rain would come to wash them away. Initially he is just talk but over time he becomes more angry, bitter, delusional and open to vigilantism and taking matters into his own hands...Brilliant movie by Martin Scorsese. He builds up the story well - first painting Bickle as all talk and no action but then showing us how he develops more into a man of action...radical action. Even once it is obvious that Bickle is now beyond just talking about doing something, you don't know how it is going to pan out. Scorsese toys with the audience, giving us a red herring as the entrée for the final showdown. Even then there's another twist in store...This slow-burning build up and portrayal of the escalation of Bickle's outlook is superbly aided by a searingly good performance by Robert De Niro as Bickle. He inhabits the character, and a very complex character it is. I doubt that anyone else could have played Bickle that convincingly.De Niro got a Best Actor Oscar nomination and was only prevented from getting the award by an equally brilliant Peter Finch, for Network.Good support from Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel and Albert Brooks. Foster was 13 years old at the time and got a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her performance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A difficult film to review...,"What can you say about ""Taxi Driver"" that hasn't been said already? It's phenomenal. I'm not a fan of Scorsese's other directorial efforts, really--nor am I a big DeNiro fan--but everything about this film is absolutely, unquestionably RIGHT. So many people seem to be confused when they watch this movie: they either root for Travis Bickle when he finally loses his marbles, or they feel that ""Taxi Driver"" tries to justify racism and misogyny. I don't think there's any need to go to such extremes. Yes, there are elements of racism and misogyny here, but the film doesn't promote those attitudes. And as for Travis being the nominal ""hero"" of the film, I don't believe that this was Paul Schrader's intention, either. There ARE no heroes; ultimately, this is just the very grim story of a marginalized man who loses what little control he had to begin with. This is why ""Taxi Driver"" appeals to people, I believe, but it's also why the film is routinely misinterpreted. As Schrader has said, this is a film about alienation. ""Taxi Driver"" tells an interesting, engaging human story and that's what makes it great--not the social commentary, or what's viewed as such.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Beautifully disturbing well crafted film,"Taxi Driver is one of those movies that stay with you. I first saw this movie approximately 15 years ago, then saw it again last night. Some of the storylines in this movie are still daring even by today's standards. Taxi Driver's DNA can be found all over the productions coming out of Hollywood since it's release in 1975 to present day.Visually, Taxi Driver has that great saturated color that is seen in films from the middle 1970's, but still has a gritty texture. This helps give the whole movie a slightly hypnotic feel that really works as you see the character of Travis Bickle descend into madness. The scenes of Travis driving around at night in his cab really showcase this hypnotic feel while also symbolizing the state of mind of insomniac Travis Bickle. One brief shot near the beginning of the movie simply shows the dark pavement of the road with mottled reflections of color from the lights of the city as the taxi moves about New York City in the night.The performances of everyone in the cast are excellent in this movie, and definitely hint at the great films that Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd and Harvey Keitel would go on to make later in their careers. And of course the same goes for director Martin Scorsese.Something interesting to note for fans of 2019's Joker: if you watch both of these films, it becomes evident that Joker ""borrows"" very heavily from Taxi Driver. Joker director Todd Phillips is obviously heavily influenced by Taxi Driver and used most of the elements of Taxi Driver's storyline in Joker. Robert De Niro also has a role in Joker.This is an excellent film recommended for viewers who appreciate a movie that reveals itself in layers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A lone man!,"Viewing Taxi Driver feels akin to gazing into a fractured mirror - disturbing, yet utterly captivating. Travis Bickle's solitude strikes a profound chord with our humanity, particularly if you've ever felt alienated from your surroundings. His nocturnal journeys through the rain-drenched avenues of New York resemble a perpetual quest for significance in a realm where significance has long vanished.Robert De Niro's portrayal lingers in your mind well after the credits finish. There's something eerily relatable about Travis - not in the way we identify with him, but in the acknowledgment of his seclusion. It's the kind of isolation that contemporary existence can foster: amidst a crowd, yet entirely invisible. His fixation on ""cleaning up the streets"" transcends mere crime; it mirrors his own yearning to rid himself of his inner chaos.One scene that resonated with me is the iconic ""You talkin' to me?"" moment. It's beyond mere bravado - it offers a peek into the delicate façade of Travis's self-image. He is a man rehearsing for a part he doesn't completely grasp, much like how individuals sometimes ""act"" confident during moments of self-doubt. It's disconcerting because it feels authentic.The conclusion of the film is just as haunting. Is Travis truly redeemed, or is he merely drawn back into the cycle of brutality? It prompts reflection on how society defines its ""heroes."" I walked away feeling uneasy, as if I had been privy to something I ought not to have seen - not due to the violence, but because of the stark unveiling of a mind coming apart.Taxi Driver endures because it compels you to face uncomfortable realities about solitude, aggression, and how easily society neglects the red flags in individuals like Travis.

Travis Bickle is in all of us,"Much has been said about Robert de Niro's powerful performance as Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"", about an unhinged taxi driver who works the night shift in New York and grows increasingly disillusioned at the scum and sights he sees on a nightly basis.

We get into his head and his world, and can't help but condone his actions by the end, even if we don't want to and feel like we need a shower once the end credits roll. De Niro is superb, but the best performance in this film comes from Jodie Foster. She is superb here, and the fact that she was only 14 years old is hard to imagine.

Legendary status amongst some. Let down for me.,"Quite possibly the most over rated movie I have ever seen. This 1970s film is based in New York and unsurprisingly a taxi driver played by Robert De Niro. We see the squalor of seventies New York through the eyes of the taxi driver Travis Bickle. You have to agree with Bickles assertions of the scum of the city. Bickle is a Vietnam marine veteran who gets a night time job driving a cab because he has insomnia. Bickle is mentally unstable and we see him descend into a crescendo of violence towards the end of the film. The film stars De Niro, Cybil Shepherd (Moonlighting with Bruce Willis), a prostitute Jodie Foster, pimp Harvey Keitel.... The score is acclaimed. The composer Bernard Herrmann scored several Alfred Hitchcock hits. The film is directed by Martin Scorcese. The partnership of Scorcese and De Niro became a regular partnership. I still felt let down by the film despite its legendary status amongst many cinephiles.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorese and De Niro at the top of their game,"I am a big fan of Scorsese (Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Shutter Island, The Departed) and De Niro (Godfather Part 2), but the brilliance of Taxi Driver still stunned me.I have seen two of the finest male performances given by De Niro in both the Godfather Part II and in Raging Bull, yet somehow he turned in his finest in this film. His portrayal and character are completely fascinating from start to finish. He creates a character that somehow transcends out of the screen and glues the audience into believing, sympathizing, and experiencing with his character. The same can be said for Scorsese. Up until this point I always had Raging Bull as his finest, but something about his work here is completely mesmerizing. Taxi Driver comes together as an incredible piece of filmmaking, with completely intriguing dialogue, and story-wise it is flawless (although technically wise I would say Scorsese was still getting the hang of it).BRAVO to Taxi Driver, and I cannot believe I waited this long to see it.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""Loneliness has followed me my whole life, everywhere""","Have you ever had that feeling where you're alone. You feel like your isolated from the world. You move into a big city and you feel scared. or maybe you're trying to escape something like a traumatizing experience. That is the main message of Taxi Driver.Travis Bickle(Robert De Niro)plays a Vietnam veteran who is suffering from insomnia. He moves to New York and decides to become a taxi driver. He feels like a loner due to him being a Midwestern and him entering a big city in unnerving to him. He develops an obsession with porno theaters and becomes disgusted by the world around him which is full of prostitutes, drug addicts and pimps. He tries to rescue an underage prostitute named Iris(Jodie Foster) from the world she's living on. Will he succeed or will he die a hero like in war?Taxi Driver is the definitive term for a 70's sleaze movie. it's set in New York, it takes place mostly at night, involves violence, bloodshed and sex. You can sympathize with Travis about what's happening to him, he's an outcast who feels like he doesn't belong. The city is also perfectly done too. It's almost like Travis is living in a garbage can, where people discard the things they don't want.To me, Robert De Niro is Travis Bickle. He's a guy who almost everyone can sympathize with. And you also understand his motivations too. Jodie Foster also does a really good job too. She can come across as an innocent girl but you're not sure if she likes what she does. The other supporting characters do a really good job too. Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel, Albert Brooks and Peter Boyle all provide good performances that add life and sanity to the movie.But the main stars of this movie are director Martin Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader. Schrader has said multiple times that this was partially based off a true story and you can tell that the way he writes his dialogue can come close to home. Scorsese was a new director when this was released and this is one hell of a movie to have as one of your firsts. You can also tell that Scorsese adds some of his memories from when he lived in New York into parts of the movie.What else can I say, Taxi Driver is not only one of the best movies to come out of the 70's, it's also one of the best movies ever made. It deals with a lot of things that people can relate too. Go see it. it's definitely worth your time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of my favorites,"Taxi Driver is my favorite film from the director Martin Scorsese and it's definitely one my favorites movies of all time. It's brilliant direction, remarkable acting, deep writing, the dark 70's New York atmosphere that gets even better with the beautiful soundtrack score, everything is just perfect.The movie is about this Vietnam War veteran (Robert DeNiro at it's finest) that needs to get a job and, because of his insomnia problem, he decides to get the taxi's night shift. In the meantime, he gets attached to a beautiful woman working on a political campaign (gorgeous Cybill Shepherd), and to a teenager working as a prostitute (early and prodigious Jodie Foster). The rest is history.Going against the trending of the time, instead of showing a wonderful and perfect New York City, the film exposes the bad and dangerous side of the town: crime, prostitution, trending porn theaters. It matches with the story.There are numerous reasons of why you should watch Taxi Driver. It's a classic, it's in Robert DeNiro's, Jodie Foster's, Bernard Herrmann's and Scorsese's curriculum, it's deep dialogues and monologues... It's an excellent film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The 'Taxi Driver' narrates a story of an ailing society and the inaction and docility in the face of this danger that's engulfing this modern society of ours.,"The 'Taxi Driver' (1976) written by Paul Schrader, directed by the master Martin Scorsese and played by Robert De Niro as its lead protagonist is considered a cinematic spectacle that diagnoses the 'scums' and 'filthness' of a consolidating liberalism hegemony that was at its embryonic stage during the 1970s. The principle protagonist is Travis ( played by Robert De Niro) who is a marine and a Vietnam war veteran who works as a Taxi driver in New York. Travis is a weird figure who seems mentally unstable and an introvert detached from society.Travis apparently suffers from insomnia and shows profound introvert characteristics with vague gazes and looks diverted while interacting with his taxi drivers colleagues. He lives alone far away from his parents, he doesn't follow politics or arts(music) and seems disaffected from societal efforts of betterment and improvement. For Him evil reigns and even politicians cannot fix it. This normative and boring life of Travis is reinvigorated with purpose and value as he come across a young preadolescence blond prostitute named Iris ( Jodie Foster) who is being pimped by gangsters. He goes into gun battle with the gangsters and saves Iris while he himself later recovers from coma to proceeds with his work as a taxi driver.The 'Taxi Driver' narrates a story of an ailing society and the inaction and docility in the face of this danger that's engulfing this modern society of ours. The messiah is a 'white man' (Travis) who once shoots in the face a Black robber. De Niro and Jodie Foster act superb and are captivating to the audience. The 'Taxi driver' is more relevant now than in the 1970s, when society is growing dis-affectionate to politics or Hope of an' alternative world' in the face of a naturalized neo-liberal ideology that disregards and undermines 'the will of the people' as the fictitious presidential candidate in the Film puts correctly. The ripples that the 'Taxi driver' initiated in the 'cinema of Politics' will reverberate throughout time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"The only flaw is the ""epilogue"".","Scorcese must have known his Dostoyevsky well, and not strictly in the positive sense. In a decision of startling audacity for the seventies, he created a modern-day Rascolnikov as an emotionally scarred Vietnam vet, plunging into greater madness at the very core of the world's rotten heart: New York City. One who develops his own agenda of redemption, and eventually becomes a near automaton set to eliminate all that he hates at any cost. De Niro, as Travis Bickle is no more a mere promising talent, but a true revelation, a paragon of male urban despair, a picture-perfect definition of a walking timebomb. His metamorphosis into a killing machine is incredibly vivid and tense, a performance that glues to the screen and transcends all boundaries, making you revel in its very depravity and rejoice in the sublimely staged climax through which De Niro almost sleepwalks, blinded by uncontrollable obsession. This is interactive cinema: the kind that takes the viewers' senses into full custody and does not release them until the very last moment. Jodie Foster, unlike Dostoyevsky's fallen saints, plays her part with bitter cynicism combined with hidden vulnerability, a far more appropriate behavior for a teenage prostitute. Bernard Hermann, the man who brought you the ""Psycho"" soundtrack creates an equally memorable score. Yes, ""Taxi Driver"" would have been an all-around 10, if not for the final three minutes. Just as ""Crime and Punishment""'s tacked-on epilogue of dubious ""salvation"" spoils the overall experience, so does the film's, which should have ended right at the end of that overhead crane shot of authorities and bystanders arriving on the scene of Travis' ultimate crime.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Descent into Isolation: The Relentless Power of Taxi Driver,"Taxi Driver is a visceral, unflinching exploration of loneliness and disconnection in the heart of a restless city. Martin Scorsese's masterpiece is both a character study and a haunting reflection on the darker corners of human nature, crafted with an intensity that remains unmatched.Robert De Niro's performance as Travis Bickle is a tour de force, capturing the complexity of a man grappling with alienation and a longing for purpose. Scorsese's gritty direction immerses viewers in a New York City that feels alive yet suffocating, with Bernard Herrmann's evocative score amplifying the tension at every turn.What makes Taxi Driver so impactful is its ability to confront uncomfortable truths while remaining deeply human. It's not just a film-it's a cinematic mirror, forcing us to examine the fragility of identity and the search for meaning in an indifferent world. Bold, unforgettable, and hauntingly relevant, Taxi Driver stands as a testament to the enduring power of storytelling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Way Ahead of its TIme,"Upon revisiting this film for a college course I realized a few things; One being that Robert De Niro may have never given a better performance than Travis Bickle, two being that this film was way more ahead of its time than many 70's noir thrillers, and three being Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time. Sure all things many people knew already, but for some reason didn't resonate with me the first time.Taxi Driver tells the unfortunate story of Travis Bickle, an ex- marine just returning from his time in Vietnam who struggles to cope with paranoid psychosis in 1970's New York. Beginning and ending with trippy colors and stylish music from Bernard Hermann, Taxi Driver gets under your skin only when it wants to and in the most in opportune times. It succeeds in giving you the uncomfortable feeling and anguish most associated with noir and it does so in fashion.Bickle's skepticism and cynical view of New York City is perfectly portrayed by De Niro as we root for him the entire length of the movie. All of this tends to get him into trouble, but we don't care, because we are so sucked into Bickle's every move and every word that we don't tend to notice just how insane he has become. Of course, the film is iconic for its famous ""You talking to me?"" line and its brutally violent climax, but its Scorsese's direction of De Niro's performance I will remember most.With this film comes plenty of questions as to whether or not any of it is actually real or not, which in most cases is valid. But I don't really care one way or another. No matter what, this is a tragic tale of a man lost in a world that he doesn't understand and a world that doesn't understand him. Whether or not the engaging narration is misleading is up to interpretation, but I just know that it's a wonderfully intricate story of a troubled Taxi Driver. If De Niro's encapsulating performance isn't enough for you than perhaps Scorsese's brilliant direction and Bernard Hermann's hauntingly beautiful and stylish score will be.

Listen as well as watch,"Writing music for film is truly an exceptional art-form but one, if done correctly, that is rarely lauded outside of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Case in point: Taxi Driver. Bernard Herman's score for Taxi Driver is so deliciously haunting and descriptive that if it weren't so perfectly written and executed it would pop out of the film and take your attention away. Herman's character themes become such an integral part of their development that you don't realize how interwoven the score is to each portrayal until the film is finished and the music begins to linger in your memory - bringing with it the appropriate visual. Just as he did with the Alfred Hitchcock films he'd scored, Herman creates the iconic aural colorization that makes you wonder how the story could have ever existed without it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My favorite movie of Scorsese,"""Taxi Driver"" should not be taken as a New York movie; It is not about a city, but about the meteorological conditions of a man's soul, and from all over New York he selects precisely those elements that feed and reinforce his obsessions. The man is Travis Bickle, ex-Marine, Vietnam veteran. He is now a New York taxi driver. The film rarely strays too far from the highly subjective and personal way in which you see the city and let it hurt you.

On the Edge of Insanity,"""Taxi Driver"". Will the cinema ever experience another year like 1976? My goodness think about the five Best Picture Oscar nominees: ""Rocky"", ""Network"", ""Bound for Glory"",""All the President's Men"", and of course Scorsese's disturbing ""Taxi Driver"". Robert De Niro (Oscar-nominated) is an ex-Marine who has been through Vietnam and survived, but will he survive the mean streets of New York City? He is not sure and his thoughts make it apparent that he will destroy those who may be willing to destroy him before they get the chance. Things start to look up when he falls in love with the beautiful Cybill Shepherd, but he blows it and it appears that no matter what De Niro will always do something to keep himself alone. Friend and fellow driver Peter Boyle tries to show De Niro that things are not as bad as they appear, but fails in his attempt. Now De Niro's thoughts become more outrageous and he gets an idea to assassinate a presidential nominee that Shepherd is working for and looks to rescue a very young Jodie Foster (Oscar-nominated) from her sadistic pimp (Harvey Keitel). Everything will become more outlandish and in the end everything will come to an end, but in the end, is it really the end? The film is dark, ugly, unconventional, and out-of-this-world. Martin Scorsese proved that he was here to stay with this one and De Niro only re-affirmed his greatness after his Oscar win in 1974 for ""The Godfather, Part II"". The supporting cast is super and even Albert Brooks makes a lasting impression in a short appearance as Shepherd's co-worker. Paul Schrader's screenplay is super and overall the whole film is an amazing accomplishment that stands tall against the other great movies of the 1970s and every other decade for that matter. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Surreal, searing, descent into hell.","A Catholic priest named Joseph Pirrone, who is an old friend and former teacher of Scorsese, complained that the biggest problem with Marty's movies was ""too much easter Friday, not enough Easter Sunday."" Indeed, with the obvious exception of Alice Hyatt , and the possible exceptions of Newland Archer and fast Eddie Felsom,very few of Marty's characters experience real happiness, or earthly salvation.The most  that most them do is to survive ( Though we are to assume that one of them IS resurrected). So far, most of Scorsese's film have been tours of the circles of Dante's hell. ( He has said that this will change in the future.) One of his most harrowing tours of the Inferno is Taxi Driver.I first saw this horrific masterpiece on the big screen ten years ago.It remains burnt into my memory. Let me just note two things about the film that seem to have escaped the attention of many viewers. The first is how much black, sardonic humor there is . Albert Brooks and Peter Boyle are genuinely AMUSING. The second is how romantic it is. I dont mean romantic in in the ""Harlequin romance"" sense, I mean ""romantic' in the Hawthorne/Melville sense. Like Ahab or Ethan Brand, Travis Bickle is a dark protagonist in a tale that  SEEMS realistic, but which is actually  surrealistic, fantastic, and just plain strange. Like them is he is on a dark, obsessive, demonic quest. After all, how much of what we see is really there, and how much  exists only in Travis' Fantasy world? in short, there is more here than meets the eye--much more. Perhaps David Lynch had a point when he said "" Kubrick is the coolest ( director),and Marty is next door.""

"Bleak and chilling portrait of an ordinary man, who turns to violence to release his inner deamons...","A cabdriver who feels lost and alienated in the big city,slowly looses his mind and turns to violence to ""solve"" his perceived problems.Slowburning start, yet constantly increasing in claustrophobic insanity. For all those who never seen it, my advice would be to give it some time. ""Taxi Driver"" is not made for the impatient. It is NOT an action movie. It is a disturbing movie about a man's mental downfall. It is NOT fun to watch, brilliantly disturbing nonetheless.Director Martin Scorsese got ignored by the Oscars for decades on end. Though recently Scorsese got a standing ovation at the Oscars that lasted longer than any other because of the enormous gratitude and admiration amongst his collegue directors and actors. But way back in the seventies Martin Scorsere was a young and upcoming talent and ""Taxi Driver"" got ignored at the Oscars, although Robert de Niro did get a nomination, which he undeservedly didnt win.""Taxi Driver"" was only recognized for it's true significance by ALL the critics many years later. A lot of mixed reviews upon first release though. Some hailed it as a masterpiece (Cannes Jury Prize), others considered it utter garbage. Firstmost the violence was mentioned as off putting by many of the negative critics. That's strange, because there is not a lot of violence in it at all, but when ""Taxi Driver"" had just been released in 1976 it got a bad rep for it's violence anyway. The (only very small part of) violence is purposeful and crucial to the story. It aint violence for the sake of it. The portrayed violence is the climax of a story about alienation in which the leading character sees no other solution for his problems then starting a killing spree. Lots of analyses about the reasons why this man turns to violence are on the tip of my tongue, but you better judge for yourself why you think violence is portrayed the way that it is in this movie. Lots of different opinions here on Imdb...Legendary movie composer Bernard Herrmann (famous from his Alfred Hitchock scores) who wrote the soundtrack is memorated at the endcredits, because he passed away after the making of ""Taxi Driver"". His soundtrack could truly be labeled as another leading role, because of the powerful impact it has got. The soundtrack mixes in with the voice over of Robert de Niro, who describes the filth of New York, while the jazzy tunes surround him during his nightshift as a taxidriver. This soundtrack is seductive and smooth at one time, yet pounding and dark and eery sounding at other moments.I think Herrmanns soundtrack together with the photography of another movie legend Michael Chapman gives us viewers one of the most impressive raunchy backdrops of New York City life ever recorded. You can feel and smell the filth of the streets through the music and claustrophobic camera. Michael Chapman's use of the camera is extremely intuitive and acts as a fly on the wall, heightening the true to life depiction of Robert de Niro's alienation in New York City. Some of his shots are so extra ordinary and playful that they take me by surprise every time I see them.

The early shots, especially, the night scenes with neon reflected in puddles and viewed through the rear view mirror of the taxi, take the breath away. There is a beauty in the accumulated sleaze and it is ironic that DeNiro should speak of it with such disgust. But speak of it so well does he that we are caught between the two realities. That this seeming nobody could charm the sparkling Cybill Shepherd is at once unbelievable and believable. DeNiro plays these early scenes so well. I realise the writing is near perfect but even so it is stretching a point the ease with which his seduction proceeds and although we are on his side, we can barely believe our/his luck. As the film proceeds and we begin to realise just how mixed up or even psychotic the guy is we still cannot shake a liking for the character. All of this is helped enormously by the incredibly beautiful score by Bernard Herrmann and there are times when the visuals, the music and DeNiro's monologues combine to achieve sheer perfect cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"We never learn much about Travis Bickle, yet the talent involved makes him a compelling figure","""Taxi Driver"" begins so ominously (with blinking neon lights and rising street heat which seem like symbolisms for Hell itself) that people watching it for the first time automatically prepare themselves for a Masterpiece. Martin Scorsese's film is indeed quite good, but it's also flawed, murky and confusing, talky in the wrong places, and features such an over-hyped performance by young Jodie Foster as a pre-teen prostitute that I imagine most viewers will be let down by what amounts to an extremely minor role. Robert De Niro's work is the centerpiece of the picture, playing haunted New York City cabbie Travis Bickle, a man so consumed by the evil on the streets that he eventually stoops to its level. Bickle is a human time bomb; he's ready to explode, and it wouldn't matter where he was or what he was doing. The movie doesn't make any apologies for Bickle, but I didn't buy some of the reasons for his actions (it's briefly alluded to that Travis wants to ""save"" Foster from her sordid existence, but one gets the feeling he just wants to shoot at somebody...anybody). I've seen better movies about people-as-targets, the City As Hell and urban alienation, but I think the reason why so many people remember ""Taxi Driver"" and keep returning to it is Scorsese's style. The filmmaker has an unflinching, fearless ability to take on the most neurotic of outcasts while wedging his camera into the most provocative or squalid of surroundings. His picture moves at a staccato rhythm--and it has too much chatter--yet the seamy, sticky ambiance is so tangible you can practically feel it on your fingertips. Cybill Shepherd does excellent work as a beautiful woman stumping for a senator's presidential bid who comes into contact with Bickle; Harvey Keitel is oddly-placed but compelling as a smug, self-assured pimp; and Oscar-nominated Foster, while just a bit self-conscious, does well with a sketchy role. De Niro, who was also nominated for an Oscar, is so adept at these kind of misfit characterizations that we're ready to fill in the blanks left behind by screenwriter Paul Schrader. We don't really learn much about Travis Bickle--deliberately, one assumes--yet De Niro and Scorsese draw us into his dark world.

And I know he lacks social skills but nobody ever in history thought a first date at a dirty film was the way to go. All the interactions between characters are awkward in fact and the descent the character takes just happens. There's no real reason for it or big moment he just gets real intense all of a sudden, once again, unrealistic.

Dead end streets...,"Travis Bickle is the sort of person you wouldn't even see if you encountered him on the street -- and if you did take note of him, you would make a point to ignore him. He is a non-entity. In his role as a cabbie, you would be aware of him only in the same way you would notice the color of the upholstery or be aware of a strange smell inside the cab. On the rare occasion that Travis might make his presence felt, you would tolerate his existence -- maybe even graciously acknowledge him with a smile or a noncommittal comment. You would only remember Travis if he said or did something particularly rude or offensive or bizarre; and then only as long as you might remember what you had for lunch or what your horoscope said.There is no reason to remember, or to feel bad about not remembering, a Travis Bickle because he has no real effect on your life. He does a job, he fills a space; just like millions of other anonymous everyday workers. But the sad thing about Travis is that he has no real effect on anyone. Most people have a life -- family, friends, interests, a purpose beyond being part of the machinery. Travis only has a job. You would not notice Travis, but Travis might notice you. And judge you: He might decide that you are part of what makes life worth tolerating, but more likely he might see you as part of what makes the world an unbearable hell.It is the nature of film that when it casts an eye toward the ""little guy,"" the attempt is to show that the ordinary man has something extraordinary about him that society is missing -- even if that is just an everyday niceness. This being a Martin Scorsese film, written by Paul Schrader, filmmakers with a near-suicidal view of mankind, the point of TAXI DRIVER is just the opposite. If Travis Bickle is a remarkable person in any sense, it is in a negative way. Travis is not a good man; he is petty and mean-spirited and bigoted and self-absorbed and judgmental. He views the world with contempt; he has to, he has to have more hate for the world than he has for himself.TAXI DRIVER is the story of a man living the proverbial life of quite desperation. In self-imposed isolation, Travis is mentally unstable, and probably was long before the film starts. The film supposedly is loosely based on THE SEARCHERS, but it has much more in common with PSYCHO. Travis, like Norman Bates hides his insanity behind a facade of banality and nurses it with his loneliness. Insignificant men with a significant amount of pent up anger. The main difference -- and it is a telling difference -- is that we don't see Norman's rage until the end, it takes us by surprise; while we never doubt that Travis has inner demons. What Travis does is a foregone conclusion.Paul Schrader's dark, oppressive script pointedly refers to Travis as a walking contradiction, often at the cost of the story's credibility. He's not particularly bright and at times almost shockingly slow, but his journal entries are surprisingly articulate. He declares a woman to be ""an angel,"" but is dismayed that she is offended by being taken to a porno film. He claims to have an honorable discharge from the marines, yet he seems to have been born yesterday, not even knowing the meaning of a common phrase like ""moonlighting."" Schrader's superficial screenplay is long on obscenities and racial slurs, but short on simple logic.The shortcomings of the script are offset to a great degree by solid performances and Scorsese's stylish direction. As Travis, Robert DeNiro is in virtually every scene and even though the screenplay falters at various times, DeNiro holds the film together with a consistency of tone and insight. Forgoing his usual bombastic method posturing (during most of the film), DeNiro plays Travis with a compassion that makes this otherwise horrid little man pitiable, if not sympathetic. He makes us care for Travis, even though the story offers us no real reason to. Jodie Foster, playing the child prostitute to whom Travis hopes to play savior, still has the youthful freshness and wise innocence that made her a treasure as a child actress. (Though I have trouble respecting Scorsese for casting a 13-year-old child, even one as mature and worldly as Foster, in a part that is so squalid and degrading.)Scorsese sees in Travis' New York City a teeming cesspool, but with cinematographer Michael Chapman, he makes it the most photogenic cesspool imaginable. He doesn't romanticize New York, but he does romanticize Travis' seething hatred of the city. However, he does wisely counterpoint Travis grubby view of the world with a sense of a real world, where friends and coworkers joke and talk and, well, exist. Unlike RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS and CASINO, Scorsese films where psychotic characters exist in closed worlds where their lunatic behavior seems the norm, TAXI DRIVER underscores Travis' outsider status by giving us a realistic world that he is isolated from. As such, TAXI DRIVER has an honesty that his other violent epics lack.But Scorsese provides us with at least two scenes that ring utterly false. His own gratuitous cameo as a passenger graphically boasting of his plans to murder his wife seems to be Scorsese's way of showing that there are people who are even crazier than Travis. Why? To suggest that Travis is justified in his paranoia? Also the final climatic bloodbath provided only a cheap shock at the time and now seems like a tiresome cliché of special effects gore. Such over the top mayhem doesn't underscore the brutality of the violence, it trivializes the rest of the film. TAXI DRIVER, like DeNiro's performances, is best in its still moments of quiet desperation.The irony of the violence is that it eventually makes Travis famous, though it could have just as easily have made him infamous. The bullets that kill the pimp could have killed the politician. In Travis' mind they are pretty much the same. Unfortunately, I don't think some people get that. Travis, in the end, is not a hero, he is a murder. He is not purged of his demons; they are just temporarily placated. The famed ""you talking' to me?"" scene has reached iconic status, symbolic of tough-guy cool -- not unlike Dirty Harry's ""Make my day."" But both Travis and Harry are dangerous icons; filmgoers delude themselves into accepting their insane displays of violence because the right make-believe characters get killed. They are protected by the fantasy of film; in the real world they would eventually be revealed to be the monsters. To his credit, Scorsese at least suggests that in the end Travis Bickle is still insane, and armed and dangerous. Even so, the ending is uncomfortably ambiguous: I don't think that Scorsese is as afraid of Travis' insanity as he is in awe of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Dark Journey Through New York,"Martin Scorsese is a director where I'm unsure whether I would love the picture or not as there are some from his work that I didn't enjoy as much as I thought I would. So I came into this thinking maybe it will be decent but nothing more. The film is most definitely excellent and so far my favorite film from him.The plot of Taxi Driver is a man, Travis Bickle, who decides to become a taxi driver and in this profession he sees the filth and waste of the city and this frustrates him deeply. Along the story, he encounters a beauty that stands out from the crowd and a young prostitute he, by chance, sees once in a while and becomes involved with. What held my interest the most is Travis' perspective of the world around him. Schrader has written a fantastic screenplay that keeps itself grounded and personal as we follow this man alone and we only see his understanding of the world, not anybody else's. The story does focus on areas like his romance with Betsy, and his relationship with Iris but it all adds to the point of his frustration. It's plot kept me hook throughout the whole ride and requires a bit of patience as the screenplay is more like the journey of a dark cab ride rather than the destination.This film is herald by many as his greatest film, I can surely say that this film is his best I have seen so far as I have not seen all that he has done. This film felt like a journey of not just Travis but New York as Scorsese wants us to be the passengers of Travis' journey. It clearly shows that Scorsese loves New York and knows how to capture it's beauty and it's filth. The film feels very personal to Scorsese, which is the reason of this film being so grounded as at some level, Travis is Scorsese in a way. There are many people who watch films and feel detached with the protagonist's intentions but I'm the type that follows them and accepts them regardless of their intentions and values. Yes, there are people out there who may watch this film and think Bickle is a little insane but I think he's the only man in the city who has a clear mind.Michael Chapman may be the cinematographer in this film but I felt that the film's image was more tamed by Scorsese rather than Chapman. Scorsese to me, feels like Terrence Malick when it comes to the cinematography as both seem to have a clear idea of what they want and how it should look, which is the reason why their films at times can be a little bit indulgent, not in a bad way. Taxi Driver captures a different side of New York that nobody ever wants to see. Even if the streets are lit by brightly colored neon, the place is still looks like a garbage landfill, and this is because Scorsese knows the area so well that it looks very convincing. I would still give props for Chapman as I think he still had a major contribution in some way.Bernard Herrmann is a legend. The man is responsible for many film scores that have become iconic and adored by many. Taxi Driver's score has this jazzy smooth quality to it that fits very well with the time period and the setting that the film has taken place. The saxophone gives this smooth sound but at the same time feels very sleazy, which fits with Travis' perspective of his surroundings. There are at times where it gets dark and a little crazy, especially when the score is building up and then crashes. Herrmann's work here may not be as iconic as his work on Psycho or Vertigo but great enough that other composers have taken inspiration from him, especially if the film's setting is in New York.The film is driven by DeNiro's performance, which I can definitely consider as one of his best. This is definitely different from his previous work in The Godfather Part II, which is more out there. In Taxi Driver, he plays it simply without any overacting, which is the reason why the whole film feels very smooth. I liked seeing De Niro playing roles like this where he isn't a gangster or a mobster but rather a regular guy. The two women in this film were casted excellently as they were very appropriate for their roles. Cybill Shepherd in this film is beautiful, she is radiant and elegant, and works well with De Niro. I was a little skeptical with Jodie Foster playing as a young prostitute as I have only seen her in strong roles like Silence of the Lambs and Inside Man but she really pulled it off here. Younger actors sometimes tend to overact but Foster kept it easy and light. Harvey Keitel was great but a little bit underused, same goes to Albert Brooks. The acting in this film is spectacular and will definitely be adored by those who like their film with easy-going acting.It contains simple acting gritty photography and excellent direction from Scorsese; making the screenplay come to life. The film overall is fantastic, just seeing New York in this light makes this definitely worth a watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Taxi Driver: Scorsese´s final seduction ...,"""Taxi Driver"" is in a way one of the most timeless movies ever, inspired by ""The Searchers"" directed by John Ford. The acting, the music, the direction, the script and the editing are all close to perfect. If you want to see a film by Martin Scorsese, see ""Taxi Driver"" first - it will always will be his most interesting feature.Even if just a couple of movies have the right to be called Classics, ""Taxi Driver"" must be one of them.Robert De Niro is a fine actor and this is his best performance up to date. It is perhaps only ""Taxi Driver"" that has convinced me that Martin Scorsese is a great director and that Robert De Niro has a huge capacity as an actor. I think that the other things that I have seen by this couple is not even close to ""Taxi Driver"".Martin Scorsese´s masterpiece has turned to be one of the most referenced modern movies ever. ""Taxi Driver"" is not pathetic, but still it gives the viewer such strong emotions from start to end, simply because of the strong job by Scorsese (and his team) that he surely won't surpass.Rating: 10 of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Taxi Driver interprets Shakespeare,"THE SICILIAN CONNECTION Taxi Driver and The Winter's Tale What follows comes from work in progress on how Scorsese's movie may cast light on Shakespeare's play.At the end of Pasolini's film of dipus Rex the blind king walks out of his world into the streets of modern Bologna. If Leontes, King of the Sicilians,went missing, where would he reappear? The hero of Taxi Driver turns up in modern New York of 1976, as if out of nowhere, or maybe one of his own bad daydreams. He's looking for a job to suit an insomniac. Like the Great Gatsby, Travis Bickle seems to be be born of his vision of himself, and this casts doubt on the substance of both self and vision.He gets a job driving a yellow cab. Then he falls for Betsy, a girl with class Then he goes out of his way to foul up by taking her to a blue movie. There, his attention is soon distracted from the real woman at his side . Betsy checks out in disgust. Later he calls her on the phone, but you can't tell whether there's really anyone at the other end. So his thoughts turn to 'saving' Iris, a twelve-year-old hooker who has also come out of nowhere, into his cab. Taxi Driver is set firmly in the eponymous mean streets of an earlier Scorsese movie, and before that, of The Godfather, the daddy of them all. Travis now has to kill some bad people, one of them Iris= trick, a Mafioso. Travis has already killed her pimp Matthew, or Sport - almost twice. In the street outside the tenement where she trades he shoots Sport in the belly before going inside to continue his righteous massacre. The pimp reappears in the hallway, alive and armed, and has to be gunned down again, as if to get it right. But Iris is saved, Betsy forgives Travis now that he=s a hero, and Travis survives. Or does he? Do they? Does any of it happen at all? Can such questions be asked of a work of fiction? In Taxi Driver the narrative viewpoint seems clear. The film opens and closes on Travis' brooding eyes. Intermittently he gives a running commentary in voice-over, which turns out to be the journal he keeps. Sometimes the screen shows things that appear to happen independently, without his knowledge. So these events seem to be 'real'. But they decrease in credibility. Travis sits in his taxi outside a building inside which a tender scene takes place between Iris and her pimp. And now Sport says: Come to me, baby, and he puts a record on the phonograph. He tells her: I'd like every man in the world to know what it is to be loved by you. Inadvertent humour can't get much bleaker. But whose joke is this? Travis buys a suitcaseful of artillery. He practises quick draws in the mirror. Sometimes he packs two guns, but he (as distinct from his reflection) is right-handed. Especially with his star weapon, a forty four magnum. In due course he uses it to shoot off some of the fingers of Iris' 'timekeeper'. Strangely, this has earlier and out of his hearing been described as a typical Mob punishment. Then, in reverse shot, we see the gun in Travis' left hand. He goes on to finish killing the pimp, the mobster and the timekeeper. And then himself - a death he has clearly intended or expected - except that now he=s all out of bullets. So he pretends. He points a finger at his own temple. It lets fall a single drop of blood. He gives a death=s head grin. His thumb works an invisible hammer. Bang, I'm dead.Afterwards he gets police commendations, glowing press reports and grateful notes in what looks like his own handwriting. He loses the scar where a bullet creased him in the neck He grows back his hair, which he'd shaved to a Mohican crest. Finally exalted to a realm above human love and desire, Travis can patronise Betsy, who wistfully seeks him out, but can't get to him now. He's gone through the looking glass. Taxi Driver is perhaps the most chilling representation of psychic death ever to reach a universal audience. The question is: what sort of representation? In a Steinberg cartoon the subject, pencil in hand,is shown completing the picture which is himself. That picture is another of those 'impossible' objects which is possible because there it is. The work of art has become its own creator.It's been said that a work of art goes about the world independently of its author's power to intend about it. In Taxi Driver it's as if the film itself has decided to dispense with the conventional markers that distinguish between what's 'really' happening and what's inside the hero's mind.Such a work enacts the idea that all events, including events 'in the real world' are events in the consciousness; may only be events in the consciousness. We create the world, as they say, from moment to moment as we go along. If our dreams are allegories of the way we experience this world, then by extension our waking perception may be the same; except that it has to adjust itself - from moment to moment as we go along.The movie screen, arena of the 'dream factory', is the obvious place to see this happening. So is the theatre. Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale is like a still, a tableau which suddenly comes to life out of a sort of Arcadian trance as in the Book of Genesis; and as in Genesis, with the touch of the serpent's tooth. It shows a man in torment because he's recreated the world as the hell in his own mind. A hell which he has to exorcise in blood. To understand Shakespeare's great work you could do worse than read it through the eyes of Taxi Driver.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Good movie, but not Amazing.","Taxi driver is the story of a taxi driver in New York who decends into madness from trying to fix the world. This is one of Robert de Niros first performances in a blockbuster movie. He is quite young, but that does not mean his acting is any less amazing. The movie has some flaws. It was made in 1976 and like many other movies from that period does not age that well. I compair this movie to joker (2018). The two movies are more or less the same story. A lowlife with a depressing job and a viced sence of reality tries to make the world a better place by doing something no one else wants to. This sums up both the movies pretty well. I my opinion Joker told this story in a much better way. Taxi driver is an well known movie for a reason and Robert De Niro's character is icon. It has a lot of good scenes with funny characters. I am giving the movie a 7 and i truly believe it deserves such a good score even tho I have criticized it a lot in the review. It is all in all a good movie I would recommend seeing if you want to know more about movie history. It is a good representation of a 70's psychological thriller and an interesting watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Destiny delivers a man's intent as applaudable or condemnable...all a nobody can dream.,"The beauty of this movie lies in the thought provoking idea that , human societies have a very strange way of operating. Travais had a principle that was being violated by two parallel circumstances. He detested breaching trust and hypocrisy, which he saw both in the Pimp and the Politician. He acted to eradicate both of these. He failed in eliminating the Politician , but killed the pimp. It was a powerful ending in the fact that, had he killed the politician for his hypocrisy to the people he would have been castigated as a criminal and condemned, but as it turned out he was appreciated, despite the fact that he worked for the same principle in killing the Pimp (for playing with Iris' trust).",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""Are you talking to me?""","This movie is Scorsese's masterpiece; it is a realistic portrayal of one mans reaction to seeing the very extreme nightlife of New York: pushers, psychos, whores, the list goes on. After seeing the movie 4-5 times, I still have to admit, there are some scenes which I don't fully understand, but I can still somewhat appreciate them. Robert DeNiro's acting is superb, as is Cybill Shepherds, and Jodie Fosters. All of them play their respective character convincingly. All of the minor characters are also interesting; most of them are either a psycho, racist or just plain despicable, in some way or another. The transformation that DeNiro's character undertakes, from being a nice, gentle guy, to being a gun-toting self-help psycho, is amazing. It's got some slow scenes, but overall, I recommend this to anyone who likes a psychological drama, or any hardcore DeNiro fan. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""Are you talking' to me?"" —is one such line that will stun you forever!","Some motion pictures produce the uncanny sensation of returning the spectator's gaze. Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver—a movie in which the most celebrated line asks the audience, ""Are you talking' to me?""—is one such film. It came, it saw, it zapped the body politic right between the eyes.The 12th top-grossing movie of 1976, Taxi Driver was not just a hit but, like Psycho or Bonnie and Clyde, an event in American popular culture—perhaps even an intervention. Inspired by one failed political assassination (the 1972 shooting of presidential hopeful George Wallace), it inadvertently motivated another (the 1981 attempt on President Ronald Reagan). The movie further established its 33-year- old director as both Hollywood's designated artist and, after Taxi Driver was awarded the Palme d'Or at Cannes, an international sensation—the decisive influence on neo–New Wave filmmakers as varied as Spike Lee, Wong Kar-wai, and Quentin Tarantino.Brilliant and yet repellent, at times even hateful, Taxi Driver inspired understandable ambivalence. (At Cannes, the announcement that it had won the Palme d'Or was greeted with boos.) How could reviewers not be wary? Taxi Driver is nakedly opposed even to itself, as well as the culture that produced it. For Travis, all movies are essentially pornographic; had he met his creators, he would surely, his history of Times Square, consider them purveyors of ""scum and filth."" It's the slow deliberation with which this lunatic kicks over his TV and terminates his connection to social reality that signals his madness—and the filmmaker's.No nostalgia, though: In other aspects, the world of Taxi Driver is recognisably ours. Libidinal politics, celebrity worship, sexual exploitation, the fetishization of guns and violence, racial stereotyping, the fear of foreigners—not to mention the promise of apocalyptic religion—all remain.

Perhaps Too Accurate a Portrayal,"Watched this film based on the idea that it was a classic. Of course everything Tarentino or Scorsese touch turns to gold according to the critics by virtue of their names being attached to it.The strength of this movie is that it shows the mundane life that many people experience where their only purpose is to wake up the next day and pay the bills until they run out of years. It also shows how without purpose people can end up in some pretty desperate mental stages where they lose touch with reality.There is a lot of intrigue built up throughout as you are just wondering when he is going to have his violent break out. This anticipation adds some entertainment value but the end result of it is a bust. The violent scene is anti climactic and it just felt like they could have done more with it.There is also a lot of time dedicated to scenes that led nowhere. This isn't uncommon for Scorsese and what he seems to deem cinema and detests films that don't have all this back clutter. Some of it perhaps adds to the bizarre nature of De Niro's character , but it is a bit excessive and doesn't necessarily produce a thrilling story.Maybe it was better back in the day, but I think the creepy obsessive guy genre has surpassed this now.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Loneliness,"""Taxi Driver"" hit me hard in a way few movies ever have. It's not just a story-it's a raw, unfiltered look at loneliness, disconnection, and what it does to a person. The atmosphere of this film is unforgettable: dark, gritty, and so real it feels like you're living in Travis Bickle's world.Travis isn't your typical hero. He's flawed, broken, and aching for meaning in a world that seems to ignore him. Watching his descent is both heartbreaking and terrifying because, deep down, I could relate to some of what he felt. Loneliness really is its own kind of hell, and the movie doesn't sugarcoat that truth.I've seen other films tackle similar themes, but this one feels like the blueprint for them all. It's raw, unpolished, and honest in a way that modern movies rarely are.If you've ever felt out of place or struggled to connect with the world around you, this movie will speak to you. It's not always an easy watch, but it's one of those films that sticks with you long after the credits roll.My rating? 9/10.

Have You Heard About The Lonesome Loser?,"I have a friend. He also reviews movies. One day I had an idea that we should review each other's favorite movies. So I gave him my blu-ray of In Bruges, and he gave me his blu-ray of Taxi Driver. This review is dedicated to my friend.Taxi Driver is a very controversial and interpretive movie. However, this being a spoiler-free review, I will not be able to elaborate on that very much. However, what I can do is highly suggest that you watch it, and interpret it, for yourself.This film is an absolute masterpiece. I struggle to find any flaws with it at all. Martin Scorsese cements his place as one of the greatest film makers of all time. He paints a very bleak, immoral picture of New York City, dripping with filth and scum, allowing the camera to take the place of the protagonist's eyes. Almost every single shot is unchangeable, and every scene tends to hold so much more than meets the eye.One of the strongest points about this film is it's protagonist, Travis Bickle, a painfully lonely ex-marine who sees New York as a revolting cesspool of irredeemable filth, and he wants to do something about it. Many people who watch this film will see Travis as a psychopath, and while I can certainly say that he is very deeply disturbed and unstable, insane is not a word I would use to describe him. Travis Bickle is one of the most complex and interesting characters that I have ever seen on the big or small screen, not to mention Robert De Niro's incredible performance. De Niro sinks into this role, to the point where you forget you're watching an actor in a movie. Although he didn't win the Oscar that year, he certainly deserved it.But now for the very brief summary. What is this film about? Loneliness. Taxi Driver is an in-depth examination on the effects of loneliness and isolation on the individual. Without spoiling anything, loneliness is the main emotion pushing Travis's every action.Taxi Driver is an unquestionable masterpiece and one of the Scorsese's best. This is undoubtedly a must-watch for anybody with an appreciation for great film and is not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Good Film, but not impressed","Taxi Driver (1976) is a psychological thriller movie directed by Martin Scorsese. The movie is about Travis Bickle (casted as Robert De Niro), a Vietnam War veteran who becomes a taxi driver because of his insomnia and loneliness which is the main theme of the movie.The cinematography in Taxi Driver is simple and effective. The movie uses different types of shots, like daylight, close-ups, and side shots, which I found really impressive. The music goes well with the movie and makes it even better to watch.Although I desired greater emotional profundity, the actors' outstanding performances served to increase the film's attractiveness. Beyond an elementary portrayal of the daily life of a cab driver in New York City, ""Taxi Driver""' delves deep into the personal challenges faced by its protagonist. Despite the character's witty, uncritical, and freethinking nature, in contrast with his unstable mental state, the character was sympathetic.This part of the movie reminds me of ""Joker"" (2019) because the main characters' behavior and emotions are similar. Both movies have interesting characters who deal with their troubled minds, which makes it interesting to make comparisons, discuss and analyze. Fun fact is that Robert De Niro was the main protagonist in this movie and also he did play in the Joker (2019) movie but as a TV Show host - Murray Franklin.While I appreciated the screenplay's writing style, I found it to be tedious and lacking in sufficient tension. Some conversations became just words without clear purpose or meaning.Overall, 'Taxi Driver' is a very remarkable film for its time and is still worth it to watch, particularly in terms of cinematography. Though I wished for more expressive performances from the actors, the story itself was engaging. It's a film that impressively captures the essence of its era while delving into the timeless complexities of human character.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

An insufferable bore,"De Niro plays You-talkinna-me Travis Bickle, a loner and a socially inept New York City cabby who takes the job because 'he cannot sleep at night'. As Travis sees more and more of the filth and depredation on the streets he tours, he turns to violence in an attempt to better the world.The movie is insufferably slow and repetitive while it channels the impressions Travis gets moonlighting the streets of New York. The dialog throughout the film feels unnatural and hammy and sucks the life out of an otherwise potentially interesting watch. There's also not much of a plot here which makes the 2 hour viewing quite a challenge. Foster does well but simply isn't believable as a child prostitute working for a pimp played by Keitel. Keitel himself also fails to convince due to the lackluster and rather phony script. Shepherd makes a short and forgettable appearance as Travis his love interest and seems to be cast only for her pretty eyes and patented stare.Though wonderfully moody and well filmed, Taxi Driver is at its core an uninteresting character piece that goes on too long and tells us too little. The music score consists of variations on two jazzy reprises by Bernard Herrmann that are set on repeat throughout the film. When after an hour you hear it being played for the gazillionth time, it starts to become more than a little silly.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Preservation of innocence,"A concise analyses into the characters:Both female characters in the film have naive innocence on the verge of corruption. Jodie Foster as Iris captures the naive little girl who yearns for the love of her pimp, and Harvey Keitel gives her sparing moments of romance so he can cash in. Cybil Sheppard's character, Betsy, represents purity (dressed in all white) but she campaigns for a politician....a politician maybe the most manipulative corrupt figure anywhere. And Robert Deniro as Travis Bicker plays the protector who will sacrifice his life for both women.In the novel Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield plays the naive kid who can not understand the mature world so he questions what a hookers does....or why people cry watching movies. He is forever in the state of innocence which contradics the very society he lives in. New York City, the big apple, home of hells kitchen and other grizly underworld is a place where a breath of innocence dissipates into toxicity. But Caulfield could not understand the contrast between his innocence and the metropolis, so he goes insane, literally going in circles, living in a hallucination where he is catching innocent children falling from a cliff's edge. And Travis has similar traits only he lives amongst the under world and he understands the world he is in. But when he sees Iris and Betsy, he sees what everyone else has been desensitized to see.....purity. But just like Caulfield, he sees a society which embraces corruption of purity...so he makes his ultimate sacrifice.There is a scene in the diner when Travis and Iris locks eyes to show they are the same people, victims of circumstantial environment. Their path out of this....it runs through all three caharcterrsDoes he overcome the villain? Does he get the girl? Will he finally be seen as the hero? All i will say is this. We are who we are in this world. And in this film, a taxi driver will always be a taxi driver.If you are a Scorsese fan....or even just a movie buff, than you've seen this a million times. Some had to write a report on this for film class. Either way, this movie is all about character development which builds up until the final explosion...the moment of reckoning.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A must watch,"Taxi driver,a movie ahead of its time which gave inspiration to movies like joker. The cinematography is fantastic,the acting is amazing the movie feels pretty atmospheric and perfectly captures the feeling of loneliness.

God's lonely man,"Still a hard-hitting, psychologically complex masterpiece that has the power to stun viewers (I first watched this for a college course, and it subsequently awed one half of the class and disgusted the other).

Though Travis' hell is one largely of his own making, as the movie shows his tainted worldview swallowing him whole.A great film on every level-- directing, acting, writing, that stunning Bernard Hermann score. I could go on forever, but the film's greatness speaks for itself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Overhyped!,"Painting an interesting portrait of the underbelly of New York City with its lurid camerawork & deteriorating set pieces, Taxi Driver is a steady examination of an unsteady character whose arc unfolds like a ticking time bomb and leaves behind nothing but carnage & corpses when it finally detonates.Set in New York City during the 1970s, the story of Taxi Driver follows a Vietnam War veteran who's on the verge of mental breakdown and takes the job of night-time cab driving to cope with his loneliness, depression & insomnia but a couple of setbacks trigger his descent into madness as he eventually snaps and gives in to his violent urges.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film is crafted like a drug-induced reverie and is carried by a character who himself is struggling to hang on to his sanity. The plot is rather simplistic, most people in the picture are messed up in the head, and the themes of loneliness, depression & mental illness are wonderfully addressed. But what exactly makes it worthy of such praise?Is it the fever-dream atmosphere achieved by vibrant camerawork & neon lighting or is it Travis Bickle & what he stands for in the post-Vietnam War America or the downhill journey he undergoes or that iconic monologue that has become a pop culture mainstay ever since or that bloody violent finale? Maybe a combination of all mixed with cynical attitude of the 1970s? I'm not sure.There isn't anything necessarily wrong with the story or how it is translated to the screen. The atmosphere is dark & alluring, Cinematography captures the ugly side of New York like never before and the use of colour palette & lighting is inspiring. Bernard Herrmann's score has a dreamlike quality to it that not only fits the film's tone but also uplifts it. And the themes it addresses aren't difficult to grasp either.Coming to the performances, Taxi Driver puts Robert De Niro front & centre of the screen and the actor brings his disturbed character to cinematic life with panache. Supporting characters get only limited space to share with De Niro's Travis Bickle but Jodie Foster still manages to make her mark. Cybill Shepherd & Harvey Keitel play their roles well but it's De Niro who carries pretty much the entire film all by himself.On an overall scale, Taxi Driver is counted amongst the greatest films ever made and while I found it to be a fascinating insight into the deteriorating psyche of a troubled individual in addition to a splendid piece of filmmaking, I don't entirely concur with the masses when it comes to its legendary reputation. The film does what it set out to do but it is no game-changer. I rather found it overhyped to be honest. And if I'm the only one, then so be it.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Finding purpose,"De Niro is Travis Bicker a deranged, insomniac Vietnam veteran who drives his taxi at night hoping to get exhausted and sleep during the day. Somebody should have told him not to mess up with his biological clock and try to sleep at night instead.Travis is aimless and purposeless until he takes a shine to beautiful Betsy and has the brazen face to ask her out, only to take her to an ""adult movie theatre"" (porn) on their first date. Betsy is not impressed and not only because she seems pretty sophisticated, but because Travis is unarticulated and oblivious to his blunder.After the rejection Travis is more embittered than before and decides to find purpose by cleaning filthy NY by himself. Tip: if you hate the city so much, why don't you move Travis? Is not like you have family ties or anything...Starting his crusade, riding his yellow taxi like a white shining horse Travis finds in underage Iris the right damsel in need of salvation and embarks in a violent campaign, whether Iris likes it or not. A word of praise to Harvey Keitel playing Iris' long-haired pimp.The puzzling end scene features Betsy allegedly stricken by Travis doings and willing to go out with the guy who took her to a porn theatre on their first date, because women are fickle.I get the alienation, loneliness, dirty city themes, the ""You talkin' to me"" and I occasionally liked Scorsese's direction, but the story seems to drag a lot to go almost nowhere very slowly, and it boils down to a mentally disturbed guy saving a damsel in distress.PS someone wrote that they ""enjoyed the movie"" ...

For, without this film, many modern films that we know and love today may have been very different, if exist at all. The movie has one feeling the natural unease that comes with watching those around them be corrupted and destroyed while at the same time one of them is trying to soothe you and tell you that everything is going to be all right.

One dimensional characters drive a forced plot,"The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any real depth or complexity. Travis Bickle, in particular, was a frustratingly flat character whose motivations were never fully explored or developed beyond a surface-level understanding of his mental illness, loneliness, and violent tendencies.The film's attempt to portray Travis as a sympathetic anti-hero was unsuccessful, as his actions and behavior were often inexplicable and lacked any real nuance or depth. The supporting characters, including the object of Travis's affection, Betsy, and the young prostitute Iris, were equally one-dimensional and failed to add any meaningful depth or complexity to the film.Additionally, the film's themes of violence and mental illness were handled in a shallow and exploitative manner, without any real exploration of the complex societal and psychological factors at play.

One Man's Terrifying Vengeance,"A perfect film.Martin Scorsese displays complete mastery over his medium in this deeply disturbing 1976 masterpiece, and to my mind hasn't yet made another movie as good as this one (no, not even ""Raging Bull"").In ""Taxi Driver,"" Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who drives a cab for a living. Isolated and lonely, Travis prowls the hellish streets of New York's worst neighborhoods, willing to drive customers anywhere they want to go, quietly nurturing vague fantasies of vengeance on what he perceives to be a sick culture. The whole movie is a nightmarish fever dream. I've never seen anyone capture visually what on the page would be stream of consciousness narration as well as Scorsese does here. And De Niro gives the performance of his, or anybody else's, career. His Travis is a fascinating creation, and one of the most frightening screen characters in the history of cinema. No one could keep me up nights quite like the seemingly ordinary Joe who's ready to snap at any moment and feels that his grisly duty is handed down to him from on high.Cybill Shepherd plays Travis's nominal love interest with just the right amount of vapidity, and Jodie Foster, in a small, sweet and wonderful performance, plays Iris, the thirteen-year-old prostitute who becomes the object Travis sets out to save from the rotten world that has turned him into what he is. And the late Peter Boyle has a couple of beautiful moments as Travis's fellow cab driver, who tries to give him some counsel but is so obviously out of his league.Shortly after ""Taxi Driver"" hit screens, Vietnam turned into a subject that film makers felt comfortable addressing directly (""Coming Home,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""The Deer Hunter""). But none of these, though so much more actually ABOUT Vietnam, addressed half as well as ""Taxi Driver"" the toll that that conflict took on the men it sent back home.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An incredible snapshot of 1970s NYC.,"Writer Paul Schrader and director Martin Scorsese have a very memorable vision in this highly regarded piece of work, certainly very memorable in the careers of all involved and one which of course is now extremely iconic and often quoted. More than anything else, it's the tale of a man who feels disconnected from society at large, a society which he has come to regard as filthy and corrupt and in need of a cleanup. That doesn't change the fact, however, that the man in question is mentally unbalanced and would likely never completely fit in. Therefore, an all night cab driver would seem to be the perfect occupation for him, and while on the job he meets the various flotsam and jetsam that make up the NYC population. Some viewers don't like the dark, grim, and ultimately very violent journey that this film takes us on, but to some it feels all too real.Robert De Niro towers over all with his performance as alienated cabbie Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who does his best to live a normal life. The trouble is, he doesn't really know how to go about it. When he starts courting Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a beautiful worker on the presidential campaign of politician Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), his idea of a good date is taking her to see a dirty movie. During the course of this story, he chats up Palantine, arms himself to the teeth, and makes the acquaintance of people such as Wizard (Peter Boyle), a philosophical co-worker, Iris (Jodie Foster), an underage prostitute, and ""Sport"" (Harvey Keitel), Iris's degenerate pimp. It's only a matter of time until our lonely protagonist makes the descent into violence.All of the parts are well cast in this thing. Even when roles aren't really integral to the story (such as Tom, played by Albert Brooks), you do appreciate their presence. Foster is absolutely incredible as the girl in need of rescuing, and Keitel is truly, excellently creepy as her employer. Familiar character players in this cast include Victor Argo, Harry Northup, and Joe Spinell. Scorseses' cameo as the sicko watching his wife's silhouette is one you don't forget.Heavy assets are the vivid atmosphere and depiction of different areas of the city, especially the seamier ones, and the haunting music score by Bernard Herrmann, which turned out to be the last one by the composer. That's a very chilling opening when a cab emerges from the smoke while the main theme plays.It's not hard to see why ""Taxi Driver"" would be so influential; even its detractors don't deny the massive impact that it's had on popular culture.Nine out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Metaphor For Loneliness,"Gritty, grim, and depressing, ""Taxi Driver"" tells the story of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a desperately lonely Vietnam vet who takes a job as a New York City cabby. The job should, in theory, draw him closer to people. Instead, it does just the opposite. Through the endless repetition of impersonal contacts, the ever-present prostitutes and pimps, and all the other reminders of urban indifference and sleaze, Travis' loneliness and alienation deepen into concealed rage.Both delusional and morally judgmental, Travis counters in the only way he knows how, by taking up arms, literally. In his words: ""Here's a man who would not take it anymore"". He shaves the sides of his head, he pumps iron to get physically fit, perfects his weapons skills, and sets out to be a one-man vigilante committee.""Taxi Driver"" was, and still is, a relevant cinematic statement on urban alienation. The film's tone seesaws between menacing and dangerous on the one hand, and tawdry and seedy on the other, depending largely on Bernard Herrmann's excellent background music, and the moody neon of nighttime Manhattan. The taxi itself functions as a visual metaphor for loneliness.The film looks and feels like typical 1970's drama: dark, downbeat, somber. There's almost no humor to offset the weighty subject matter. Dialogue is realistic for NYC street life. My major technical objection is the violence, which is overplayed. I did not much like the film's ending.""Taxi Driver"" has evolved into a cinematic classic, owing to its social message, Scorsese's direction, and Di Niro's flawless performance as the anti-hero at the center of the urban maelstrom. This is one of those films that a viewer can appreciate for its technical quality, but not really enjoy watching. Indeed, I find the film to be somewhat tedious to sit through. It's all just a bit too grungy and sordid for my taste.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I love breaking down this film. The way he positions his cameras and the angles he uses the cameras is flawless! He was the first director to make me think about what's happening behind the camera than what's happening in front of it. Genius DirectorRobert De Niro is amazing in this film.

One of the strangest and yet remarkable movies ever,"My brother commented that is was the weirdest movie he'd seen in a while and I have to admit it is definitely odd but strangely entertaining. DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a disillusioned Vietnam Vet who goes to work as a Taxi Driver in NYC because he has nothing else to do. He comes into contact with some strange people which is OK as he is very strange himself. He meets a beautiful woman (Cybill Shepard) who is working to elect a Senator to the Presidency and he messes it up big time. He meets a extremely young girl (Jodie Foster) who works as a prostitute and works to save her from her predicament. You as the viewer watch Bickle lose himself and apparently his sanity minute by minute and somehow he pulls it together and you're simply amazed by the transformation.

The cast is simply wonderful, Robert De Niro with a flawless performance, a very dark and disturbing role that fits him to the perfection, this is one of the acting jobs that made him the great actor he is. A very young Jodie Foster with the role of a hooker that De Niro's character tries to help, a performance so convincing although she was still a young actress she proved some good potential. Harvey Keitel with an amazing performance showing why he is a excellent actor nowadays and the Martin Scorsese's cameo was really good.

No Sympathy,"This film is memorable and is always a compelling piece of film-making. It offers a realistic view as the urban environment as the ultimate alien environment to a person who is incapable of connecting to other people. At the beginning of the film, we have sympathy for Travis. His thwarted efforts at trying to have a conversation with the woman who works behind the candy-counter in the porn theatre is pathetic. When Travis takes Betsy for coffee, we see him doing his best at getting the relationship off to a good start. We see a man who doesn't know the ""games"" that people often play in interpersonal encounters, and we are hoping that he gets a second chance with Betsy. But when he does, that's when our sympathies dissolve for Travis, and we realize how out-of-touch he is, how utterly socially inept he is. For the obvious reason that he takes this beautiful and educated woman to a sex film. How unaware and tasteless can a man be? Why should we feel sorry for Travis when his subsequent efforts to try to et back together with Betsy go rebuffed? From then on, we don't have a film about loneliness as the film claims to be, but a film about descent into madness. Travis becomes a comic-book character, who is acting in his own movie, albeit as either a cowboy or an Indian. Travis becomes an Action-Hero suffused with anomie. He becomes a socio-pathetic warrior in search of an enemy. His intentions with Iris are noble, but the means of execution are criminal. He becomes more violent and misanthropic than any of the sleazy characters he disdains.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Character development.,"Martin Scorsese's masterpiece Taxi Driver, was in the beginning met by various criticism and accusations. Many shut their eyes and were appalled by the violence and uncovered nature of the film. Even though judged by some, others witnessed the revelation of a genuine film-pearl, as Robert De Niro's character ""Travis Bickle"" entered the screen. The protagonist in this movie, is perhaps one the most complex and thorough characters in the history of film-making. Because of the extreme centralization of the main-character, the entire movies perspective takes basis in Travis' own perception and interpretation of the world around him. Every scene in the movie becomes, because of the focus on Travis, very subjective and personalized. We witness the world through his eyes, and take over his prejudices and beliefs. Travis lives in the busy and crowded city, but nonetheless he is alone. Loneliness is in many ways the very essence of his being, and at some point it almost becomes his identity. Walking through the streets alone, as a nobody, he dreams of being a somebody. He longs for company, both socially, sexually and intellectually, but cannot seem to find it anywhere. In his attempt to find company he finds Betsy, a young beautiful blond who develops an interest in him, but his social inexperience repels her from him, and he is left alone, even more lonely than before. The entire film is right from the beginning heading for the very debated violence near the end of the film, this also goes for Travis' life. His life has always in some way headed for this moment and therefore it is given even more importance. His Mohawk is a symbol of rage and lust for blood, which the native Indians possessed before they were going to battle, a so-called warning signal. The foundation of the movie is character development of the main character. This development is clouded and complex and at the same time obvious and simple. Only through repeated viewings can the full development of Travis be discovered and analyzed. Every little piece of conversation, monologue, action or sound plays a part in the corruption and development of Travis' mental state. The plot itself is very simple but still intriguing and luring. The cooperation, or lack of same, between Scorsese and the writer Paul Schrader, has a fantastic influence on the film and gives it its' multidimensional flow. Basically everything from writing to screenplay, directing, acting and setup is superb and flawless. The movies many aspects and open possibility to interpretation, makes it ideal to repeated viewings and second thoughts. The directing is on top level, and the great debut by Jodie Foster together with Robert De Niro's fantastic acting makes sure that the entire potential of the movie is used. Fabulous achievement. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
God's lonely man,"*********SPOILERS******* Seeming out of nowhere a taxi rolls out of the night mist and as it turns sideways on the screen facing the theater audience the title of the movie appears in eerie neon, so starts Martin Scorese's ""Taxi Driver"".Travis Bickle, Robert De Niro, keeps a diary at home where he records his thoughts as well as his daily experience on and off the streets of New York as he drives a cab to support himself. ""I'm God's lonely man"" Travis constantly writes in his diary. Trying to fit into a vast an impersonal city like New York is too much for Travis. He feels more at home by himself with his thoughts and fantasies then socializing with people.In the movie Travis has two relationships. One with a woman the other with a girl, both end up disastrous. The first with Besty, Sybill Shepherd, a campaign worker for presidential candidate Charles Palintine, Lenoard Harris, and the second with Iris, Jody Foster, a 12 year old prostitute who turns tricks for and is looked after by her pimp Sport, Harvey Keitel.Travis spots Besty at the Palintine campaign offices in midtown Manhattan while he's driving his cab and falls in love with her. Travis going so far as to volunteer to work for the Palintine campaign so he can be with her. After a while Travis gets friendly and close enough with Besty to take her out to the movies on a date with him. It turns out that Travis' limited knowledge of the entertainment world, the only movies that Travis watches and knows about are porno flicks, leaves him hurt and humiliated when Besty, shocked that Travis would take her to an X-rated theater, walks out on him.Some time later Travis back on his job driving a cab one night in the East Village encounters Iris trying to run away from her pimp Sport when she jumps into his cab. Sport gets into the cab with Iris and after sweet talking Iris to come back with him gives Travis a twenty dollar bill for all the trouble that Iris caused and tells Travis to forget all about it. Travis soon becomes fixated with rescuing Iris from her life on the streets and from working for Sport for whom Travis begins to develop a very strong and violent dislike of.As the movie slowly moves to it's bloody and explosive conclusion it's obvious that Travis has gone over the deep end. Arming himself to the teeth and getting himself into shape, both physically and mentally, for the battle against all those evil forces that are lurking around him that is sure to come. His frustration together with his ignorance and alienation of the real world has turned Travis, who was friendly and likable if just a bit odd at the beginning of the movie, into a Frankenstein monster.The movie ""Taxi Driver"" is filled with academy award caliber acting imaginary and gritty big city photography and a multi-layer story that's easy to follow due to a very skillful job of directing. The movie also has one of the most haunting and memorable musical score that I've ever herd in any movie and it more then deserves all the accolades that it received over all these years.The only bad thing that I can say about ""Taxi driver"" is that director Martin Scorsese made the movie too soon in his career. It's been 27 years since Scorsese made the movie ""Taxi Driver"" and since then, with all the films that he directed, he's never come close to making any movie as good as it and for all we know he never will. Like Orson Wells in 1941 when he made ""Citizen Kane"" that over forty years until his death in 1985 Wells could never do anything on film to top that movie and the only place that Wells could go after he made ""Citizen Kane"" was down.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""Morbid self-attention""","This picture has been recognised as Scorcese's first masterpiece. It's not his first really great film  that would be Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (which I actually prefer to Taxi Driver)  but it's his first work as a really mature director. He'd shown talent before this, but there's just so much detail and control on display here.Taxi driver is a film about two worlds as seen by Travis  the low-down, dirty underworld and the clean, respectable, ""normal"" world. Travis desperately wants to be part of the normal world but isn't equipped to break out of the low world. Scorcese's camera roves around in prowling point-of-view shots, to show us Travis' wandering mind. He makes great use of colour to create the two different worlds  grimy greys and greens for the low world, clean whites and reds for the high world. There are plenty of little details that add extra layers  for example the two guys arguing in the background during the opening scene.Scorcese is often thought of as a modern director, part of a new wave. But actually Scorcese and this new wave were extremely retrospective. In Taxi Driver you can see shades of Hitchcock in the way he puts the audience inside the character's state of mind. He is like Kurosawa in the way he tailors his shooting style for different moods  particularly that director's High and Low. The character of Travis and the seedy world he inhabits also occasionally reminds me of Michael Powell's Peeping Tom as well. In terms of style Taxi Driver could have been made by any of these, by this time, elderly directors. It's only really the frankness of the sex and violence that mark it as the work of a young director.Travis is the first of Scorcese's loser heroes. Like Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy, he does the ""wrong"" thing to achieve his aims, but ends up succeeding anyway. This is the most modern thing about Taxi Driver  it's the very opposite of Hollywood's old code of ""no crime without punishment"".Like a lot of American cinema of this era, the Vietnam war casts its shadow over Taxi Driver. It's subtle  Travis is an ex-marine, and it's fairly clear his wartime experiences have contributed to his current state of mind. During the war there were plenty of heavy-handed allegorical films, and later there would be lots of heavy-handed films dealing with the war itself, but coming in between this is perhaps the harshest depiction of the Vietnam generation.So yes, Taxi Driver is expertly constructed in terms of its direction. It's also brilliantly acted and scored (perhaps Bernard Hermann's best score). It's extremely bleak and difficult to watch though. While it's possible to sympathise with and understand Travis the picture lacks the humanity of Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Raging Bull or King of Comedy, and it's never really spoken to me as deeply as any of those films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Martin Scorsese's masterpiece.,"It's a beautiful and violent story that talk about a lonely man, Travis Bickle,and the city where he lives in.Driving by night, the protagonist meets the strangest people in the world. He hates New York because he think it's a dirty city with bad people. But at the end of the film he saves a 12 years old prostitute and kill her pimps, so he becomes a hero. The story, that is written by Paul Schrader, is full of violence, and bad words but at the same time it is also sad and a bit romantic. Robert De Niro is fantastic and Bernard Herrmann's music is good too. Taxi driver is one of the most beautiful films in the history of the cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Highly Overrated !,"I recently watched ""Taxi Driver,"" and I have to say, I was quite disappointed. While the film is often hailed as a classic, I found it troubling rather than engaging.First and foremost, the storyline felt disjointed and oriented around a character whose descent into madness was hard to connect with. While I understand that this was the intent, the lack of a clear narrative made it difficult to stay invested in Travis Bickle's journey.The film's depiction of mental illness left me feeling uncomfortable. Rather than offering insights into the challenges faced by individuals struggling with these issues, it seemed to perpetuate harmful stereotypes without any meaningful exploration or resolution.Furthermore, the pacing was incredibly slow. There were moments that dragged on far too long, making the overall experience tedious. While the film does have its striking imagery and iconic moments, they were not enough to redeem the lack of substantive storytelling.""Taxi Driver"" felt more like an exercise in shock value than a compelling exploration of society or the human condition. I appreciate the craftsmanship involved in its making, but it didn't resonate with me and left me unsettled rather than moved.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Understanding the alt-right,"Taxi Driver has always been an important film but decades later, in the aftermath of the alt-right storming of the US Capitol, I think Travis Bickle's odyssey helps explain January 6, 2021.Consider Travis' personality, military background and desire to do something important in his empty life. Now picture Travis connected with social media to a network of thousands of other Travises - all orchestrated by social and political manipulators.It adds more understanding to how this kind of thing can happen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Flawless,"I watched ""Taxi Driver"" for the first time tonight. It was mesmerising. I've never seen such a flawless and beautiful film. From the gritty portrayal of life in '70s New York to the slow breakdown of a lonely man bitter towards a society he sees allowing so much wrong, the film did not misplace a step. Taxi Driver was as perfect as a film will ever be.DeNiro was a joy to watch throughout. I will never forget the scene where he walks through the crowded city streets of New York, a look of pain and disconnection etched upon his face. He is Travis, no question about it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Truly Great Character Study,"The year was 1976, and armed with a budget of around 1.3 million dollars, director Martin Scorsese alongside the phenomenal acting talents of Robert DeNiro and Jodie Foster, crafted what was to become not only one of the greatest character studies of the last half-century, but also one of the greatest films of all time. Nominated for four Academy Awards upon release, the film's popularity has only risen over the years. The continued critical and fan interest in Scorsese's bleak masterpiece is evident, from the countless reviews, to the endless analyses, to the frequent birth of new theories and ideas regarding the film. I myself am among the many who believe that Taxi Driver has had an undeniable influence on cinema today, and that Travis Bickle is one of the most complex and intricately crafted characters we have ever witnessed – or will ever witness – on screen.Since my first viewing of Taxi Driver, I have seen a number of films which tackle the themes of madness, depression, and violent tendencies; but none have ever been as focused, perfectly executed, or certain of their intentions as Scorsese's vigilante flick. Every single component of Taxi Driver works tirelessly to give us an intimate insight into the mind of its central figure, the troubled and tortured Travis Bickle. Travis is a retired marine who, as a result of his insomnia, decides to take up the job of a late night taxi driver; with his night time drives through the underbelly of the city sparking a violent hatred for the 'scum' that walk the streets in the early hours. Travis observes pimps, prostitutes, drug dealers, vandals, and virtually every other form of degenerate; resulting in him ultimately coming to the decision that something has to be done. Someone needs to take a stand.The outstanding quality of this film comes largely from the directorial choices of Martin Scorsese, who is very much in the driver's seat when it comes to this production. Almost every single shot serves to evolve the main character, with virtually no unimportant shots whatsoever. We see through the eyes of Travis as he makes his rounds, are shocked and disgusted along with him, and we feel very much a part of this character's world. The voice-over narration from Travis gives us further insight into his mind state, and allows us to establish clear milestones in his character arc. This masterfully formed character arc being one of the primary reasons that the film has achieved so much continued praise over the years. Travis' disturbing descent into psychosis is portrayed in such a way that no other film has ever been able to replicate its precision. However, none of this would have been possible without the writing talents of Paul Schrader, who does a wonderful job. I feel that every time I watch Taxi Driver, I acquire something more from the dialogue. Every single conversation draws you in and reveals more about the characters, particularly Travis, keeping the film absolutely focused as a character study. I am consistently gripped and intrigued by every word he speaks, and transfixed by his body language and facial expressions; and for me this gives the film a massive re-watchable quality.Robert DeNiro shines as the top-billed actor and gives one of my favourite performances of all time. His history of method acting results in him totally embodying the character of Travis, with the subtleties of his acting bringing an intense realism to the role. 12-year-old Jodie Foster is also excellent as the underage prostitute who keeps Travis grounded and gives him a real reason to fight for justice. Harvey Keitel gives an interesting performance as the pimp, and shows an unpredictability that allows for some biting exchanges with Travis. Without revealing too much or diminishing the magic of key moments in the film, I would like to mention a couple of my personal favourite scenes. Many who have not seen the film will already be familiar with the often parodied ""You talking' to me?"" mirror sequence. With an instruction of nothing more than 'Travis talks to himself in the mirror', DeNiro managed to produce one of the greatest pieces of film improvisation in history. Martin Scorsese's brief appearance in the film proves to be one of the most memorable scenes. I will not say any more about this moment other than that it is a truly chilling cameo, and another example of the film's unrivalled character development. The film's explosive finale is also a jaw-dropping and unforgettable experience.Finally I would like to briefly mention the fantastic score by the late Bernard Herrmann, which is a jazz piece that is heard multiple times throughout the film. Its smooth subtleties and building crescendo perfectly reflect and mirror the story of Travis Bickle.In conclusion, I see Taxi Driver as a film that no amount of praise can do justice. It is an intelligent, thought-provoking, and terrifying character study; with every aspect meticulously thought- out in order to create a character who is both involved and distanced, heroic and disgusting, relatable and insane. The film manages to feel alive, and bubbles with energy, despite dealing with rather subdued themes such as loneliness, depression and isolation. It is an outstanding film not only in the Scorsese canon, but in the crime genre in general; and it is unlikely that its importance and relevance will ever waver as a result of the deeply political undertones and references to child exploitation. It comes as no surprise that Taxi Driver has influenced many greats and spawned countless imitators, none of which ever managing to quite capture the genius of the original classic. As one of the best films that I have ever seen, I would highly recommend this motion picture to fans of Scorsese, DeNiro, and cinema alike.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
great performances from lots of stars in their early days,"I was impressed with every actor and actress here. De Niro, Shepherd, Foster, and Keitel all played their respective roles very well. They had a great story and script to back them up. I really liked how the plot was fairly simple (the title sums up the main character and the setting) yet great depth was added to the characters and the story as a whole. This was achieved through monologues by De Niro and conversations between characters that told us how they each felt. I also liked how the film was broken up into several threads that really weren't related except through the involvement of the main character. For example you had the relationship with Betsy (Shepherd) and the saving a prostitute (Foster) from her life as one. Also interesting was how De Niro's character Travis evolved throughout the film. You had the veteran looking for a job that became his life, then the gun addict then the good samaritan who wanted to save one particular girl from prostitution. I also liked the way the film was shot. Lighting was often used noticeably (for example Travis and his taxi driver friends were often illuminated by a red neon light that surrounded them). The lighting was usually sparse to match the dark atmosphere which was very appropriate to the story. There were also some interesting camera shots and angles. There was always plenty of time to think about what the characters were feeling and reflect on the action that had just taken place (for example in the final scene we get a nice long sequence covering everything thats just happened, again). The sound track and score were also very appropriate and always seemed to fit the scene perfectly. You know it's a good score when you don't notice it much because you're not surprised by it. i.e. there's no unexpectedly up beat tunes. This may also work the other way but in this film there wasn't much upbeatness so it was never an issue to have slow music in a happy scene.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Basically Overrated,"Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver from 1976 is supposed to be a masterpiece among films within post new realism, and a neo noir artistic peak. There is little doubt that it contributed to bringing actor Robert de Niro to stardom, and his portrayal of ex marine and taxi driver Travis Bickle's showdown with moral decay and inner demons is not bad, it's just not very impressive. Also his character occasionally gets less credible as it is building towards a crescendo, and the plot easily becomes predictable. However, then 13 year old Jodie Foster is amazing as the way under aged prostitute Iris. Her acting performance truly stands out and is the highlight of the film. Taxi Driver probably had a fundamental purpose as a reaction to the Vietnam War and the 1970's morally withering society, but in retrospect it's not timeless.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Robert DeNiro IS Travis Bickle, a veteran who lives what many consider to be a greatly disturbing life, but it seems very normal to him.  And, of course, how could you possibly forget the line, one of the most famous lines of all time ""Are you talking to me""  I can relate to that part and I think that most other people can to.

A Legend of it's own!!,"Martin Scorsese's cult favorite 'Taxi Driver' has it's own class, it has it's own aura, it has it's place.

I like porn cinema in this film,"""Taxi Driver"" is perhaps one of the films for which Scorsese is most vividly remembered as a director and creator. This is because in this film he penetrates most deeply and with the greatest criticality into the social strata of modern America and cinematically manages to affect the audience. Cruel, uncompromising, furious, yet humanly tender at the same time, the film owes much of its persuasiveness to De Niro's flamboyant presence. This is perhaps the most iconic role of the actor, although Scorsese filmed him again and again in his subsequent films.Watch to find out what Scorsese's Taxi 1 is worth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""you're only as healthy as you feel.""","Taxi Driver opens with images of a taxi and a city. Neon lights flash across the screen and there is nothing terrifying there, yet it is shot like a horror film. We are not introduced to the film's protagonist, but the movie's atmosphere is set.We know Travis Bickle is 26 years old, a former Vietnam marine, a veteran with an honorable discharge, a taxi driver, and an insomniac, yet he remains a mystery. Did the war change the man or merely attract him? Such questions are never completely answered.But Travis Bickle remains one of the most endearing antiheroes to hit the silver screen. He meanders New York City from night til its wake, observing what he calls filth and trash. We watch Travis attempt to court a young woman with some success. Later he brings her to a porn theater...After such a failed attempt, in what may be the most interesting shot of the picture, we see Travis try to get her back over the phone, but the camera slides away, almost as if the audience cannot bear the cringe. The shot shows us our view of Travis, played perfectly by the young Bob DeNiro, someone we empathize with, but cannot stand to watch.We see the world through his perspective, there is never a seen without him lurking there. We see the subtext of how he views African-Americans, and further the city he lives in. We see how he attempts to connect to others and ultimately disgusts them. We see an ending that may be his delusion, society's delusion, or everyone's delusion.We see Travis through Michael Chapma's splendid cinematography, with the mesmerizing score in the background, through Paul Schrader's writing, handled perfectly by Martin Scorsese. The film always glides over from Travis's viewpoint, if he sees trash, we follow, if he sees the most beautiful woman in the city, we see her too, and if he believes he's the hero, we see his belief in action.The film reminds us of John Ford's and John Wayne's classic westerns such as The Searchers, indeed Travis not only gets called ""cowboy"" throughout the film, even displaying his own holster, he even imitates Wayne in one of the film's most iconic scenes.Travis finds a 12-year-old child prostitute, played by the teenage Jodie Foster, but instead of calling the police, he takes justice into his own hands. The ending of Taxi Driver is one to behold. Always from his perspective, we don't know what to believe. He's lauded as a hero and continues his life as before.Whether the ending of the film is true or not doesn't interest me as much as one of its final moments. Bickle looks into his own reflection a couple of times, turns the mirror back into his own eyes, and puts it back into place, he continues driving. It reminds me of one of the film's famous lines ""You talkin' to me? Well, I'm the only one here."" For Travis, I think the second part holds true.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Classic for a Reason,"""Taxi Driver"" is an American classic. Very early in any cinephile's journey it will come up as a must watch film. This carries with it a danger, though. For some, like myself, they end up seeing Taxi Driver when they aren't really mature enough as a film watcher do appreciate it.After seeing Paul Schrader's ""First Reformed,"" I wanted to dig into more of his films and while he didn't direct ""Taxi Driver,"" he did write it. I'm also not a big Scorsese fan but really it's more that I'm not a fan of gangster films and he makes a lot of them. I love Scorsese when he isn't doing the mob, so I wanted to revisit ""Taxi Driver,"" for that reason as well.A Scorsese film I have a shot at liking? I couldn't let myself go on, disliking Taxi Driver just because I was too young when I saw it the first time.So there was definitely a lot about this film that I didn't understand or catch the first time I saw it. Having been raised pretty conservatively I was not aware of many of the issues Bickle was dealing with throughout the film.Perhaps more than anything else though, the thing that I most didn't get when I was younger was that it is a character study.I remember feeling that nothing was happening in the film when I watched it the first time. For someone whose main movie experience is with typical Hollywood fare, a film which simply follows a person around and the main plot is happening within the inner workings of their brain, is a bit alien feeling.As an more experienced cinephile, I now appreciate and can see what the film is doing, even in the moments which I do not relate to as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Relaxing Jazz Noir,"Taxi Driver is one of those films that I know everything about and yet, in reality, know nothing.

My instincts tell me though that something different, perhaps even bizarre, is going to happen, but I'd be just as content to see De Niro get together with the beautiful blonde and ride off into the sunset, but somehow I know this isn't going to happen.I imagined something brash and vulgar, but instead it's a superbly laid-back and relaxing experience. The camera work is astonishing too, with such clear lines and easy angles.Even though I know nothing about this film, I can still perceive its importance. Is it a story about a confused man coming to terms with being a straightforward taxi driver, or a man that's gradually going out of his mind, sliding through the sewer of life?In case, just like me, you think you've seen this film before but really haven't, I'm telling you - it's an absolutely excellent, rewarding film that casts aside pre-conceptions of backstreet trashiness and replaces them with a newly found respect for mankind, it's that powerful.A 10/10 viewing experience without any shadow of a doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Weird, realistic and horrifying","Acting:
Great acting I must say. Very strange and mysterious character that robert de Niro's plays and plays well. You get a sense of awkwardness and uncertainty of his character and you cant help but feel bad for him. At the same time you also feel a disconnect from his character and become more disconnected as the film goes on. (Which is imo a good thing)Cinematography/music:
I enjoyed most scenes and shots. I say most become some scenes are a bit too long or is extremely saturated with terrible music. That's my biggest dislike of this film. The music is over the top overwhelming and isnt even suited for the type of scenes we are witnessing. Totally ruined good scenes for me. One thing that stood out in this film was the special affects/shootout scenes. This has to be the most realistic shootout scenes I have ever seen in my life. So realistic that you see gunshots appear in real time and it's scary.Story:
Wow this had me thinking of 2019s ""joker"". Surely the director got the whole idea from this film? It seems extremely close with how the main character has mental illnesses and sees the world as rotten. This has a slow start which occasionally seems a bit boring with overly extended scenes or small talk dialog I couldn't care less about. But in general it's very mysterious and very interesting. The best thing of this film is the character development and how well they portrayed such a interesting yet sick person. Also something that really took me back was the last scenes of the shootout. I mean watching the last scenes was extremely realistic and had my breath taken back. My heart was pounding. I cant put into words how good the last scenes were and how it affected me. I felt like I was watching real murders and my blood pressure was off the roof. Now the ending was really strange and seems to be one of those philosophical interpretation type endings which I dont like. If a film has a ending it should be clear. Especially considering how much influence I would expect this film to garner. It's very realistic and similar to that of real world assasinations or school shooters. It should of had a clear defining ending that this is not to be supported.Summary:
If you liked 2019s joker you should like this. This film is somewhat slow, very philosophical and has extremely realistic scenes that I would highly advice you not to see if your sensitive to things like that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Best Scorsese-De Niro film,"""Taxi driver"" is not only one the greatest films of the Seventies, it's also the best Scorsese & De Niro production.A Vietnam veteran, now a New York taxi driver, lives in a nightmarish loneliness. The meeting with a baby prostitute and the will of rescuing her will give him a new aim.The movie is dramatic and passionate. It's a story of an anti-hero who wants to save another anti-heroin. Also when he tries to court another woman (Cybill Shepherd) the result is a complete disaster (look at the scenes...!), it's impossible for him to enter a ""normal"" world. There's an anguish sense through all the movie, underlined by Bernard Herrman score. Definitely ""Taxi driver"" is the momentum of the ""nouvelle vague"" in Hollywood movies. Actually the Seventies were the only time when big studios really allowed independent directors to do their own films. Now these two worlds are more separated than before.This film won the ""Palme d'or"" at Cannes Film festival in 1976, and brought chance to Scorsese, Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel and (of course) Robert De Niro -the same year he made Bernardo Bertolucci's ""Novecento"", the year before he won an Oscar for ""The Godfather part II"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"That is not Robert De Niro! THAT IS NOT ROBERT DE NIRO, it is Travis Bickle, one of the best characters ever created!","Who said that lonely people could never be totally badasses and be true heroes?? Well, with that, I meant exactly what this masterpiece by Martin Scorsese tried and managed to show to the world, and again on the main stage of most of his films, the city of New York.In the movie we have the story of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a veteran of the Vietnam War who lives in his small apartment in the big apple. Travis has severe sleep problems suffering of insomnia, staying up all night, then he decides to work as a taxi driver. Managing to work day and night and earn a good salary. During his travels he meets and falls in love for the beautiful Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who works in the presidential campaign of the Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris). Travis becomes obsessed with Betsy, following her to work, to her home and finally one day he finally call her out, but loses the chance of having a relationship when he takes her to watch a porno movie. With the loving disappointment Travis goes crazy and starts trying to take justice into their own hands. He gets this chance when he meets the young prostitute, Iris (Jodie Foster).Through this simple story and the character Travis, Scorsese and the writer Paul Schrader were able to explore and send a message and critique against the society. What at the beginning seems to be a study of the human condition with the character Travis (which partly is), it is actually a great criticism that Scorsese make against society showing its dirt and evil.Travis is all part of this critic, a veteran returned form war and working as a taxi driver he gets to know various types of people, moreover working at night. Travis begins to have its own philosophy what is good and evil in the city. The night he seems to see the devil walking through the streets in the bodies of prostitutes and drug dealers, and he sees himself as the renegade hero trying to do justice in some way, trying to send a message, which after several failed attempts. At that point he meets Iris, he finally sees his chance, a poor girl in the middle of all evil suffering at the hands of clients and dirty cowards, Travis then begins to act.Not only the story is very well written and explored in a brilliant way, while Scorsese through his direction in a large scale gives a realistic and dirty picture of New York society, showing the dirt and lack of respect and kindness (even his appearance in the film as a customer of Travis help it). But to make everything more pretty he also shows several places of the city, all of them connected to the story.At the level of writing and directing the film is simply fantastic, and the performances are not different. All excellent, Jodie Foster superb as always, as much as she was in ""Silence of the Lambs"" and most of all her work; Robert De Niro..... PERFECT, embodies his character in an impressive way, while we watch the movie we always forget that is not Travis who is driving the Taxi and talking to himself to the mirror (with that I mean we forgot that is a movie at all).A true masterpiece, explores the society in a realistic and obscure way. Thanks to a fantastic writing and direction that created an unforgettable character with superb performances and an ending that makes us open a big smile on our face, ""Taxi Driver"" has invisible flaws being a true classic of cinema, one more that Scorsese gave us, an unforgettable film and a dark and fun experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Nice movie but..,"What is it with this movie? The acting was superb, it had an Okay somewhat boring story but I didn't get it how this movie was a masterpiece. Yes, DeNiro's acting was really good, very well directed, but what about the story? It is just interesting, not a movie that sticks with you, and for that reason I don't consider it a masterpiece. It is just kinda dull and slow paced movie about a lonely man, which the character is peculiar because it isn't the usual hero we see on regular movies but neither really memorable in my opinion, but still interesting... this is why I don't give this movie a 10 but a 7...",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
God's Lonely Man,"A New York cab driver slowly goes mad while he witnesses the crime and squalor of the city.One of my favorite films. Robert DeNiro's greatest performance. It is a fascinating character study of a lonely, socially awkward man named Travis Bickle. Some of the most interesting scenes are when we see in social situations. When he is with his fellow cabbies, he cannot always join in their conversations, he often turns the conversation back to the job and it's dangers. The cabbies all have nick names like Wizard (Peter Boyle), the veteran driver who has seen everything. Dough Boy is one who will do anything for a buck. Travis is given the nick name Killer, which I imagine was because he was a Marine, he had not killed anyone yet in the film. Other awkward moments are when Travis attempts to ask a pretty girl (Cybill Shepard) for a date, though she accepts it turns into a disaster when he brings her to a porno film. She is disgusted and offended and refuses to see him again. However due to his twisted mind and social anxiety he cannot understand why she feels that way, he reacts with anger. I also wanted to mention the scene where Betsy (Cybill Shepard) tells Travis he reminds her of a Kris Kristofferon song, where the lyrics say ""He's a prophet and a pusher, partly truth partly fiction, a walking contradiction."" The clueless Travis only sees things in a black and white way, not intelligent or worldly enough to understand metaphors or irony so he only thinks she is calling him a pusher. We never know what made Travis the way he is. We only hear his chilling yet touching narration when he explains ""Loneliness has followed me all my life...I'm God's Lonely Man.""It is due to DeNiro's performance, Martin Scorsese's direction and Paul Schrader's writing that I can feel sympathy for his character as well as being disturbed and repelled by him as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It's reputation being ""highly-acclaimed"" and a ""true classic"" hyped me so much that I prolonged my time so I can truly find the perfect moment to give it a go. Sadly, I felt underwhelmed after seeing it.Taxi Driver is driven by the internal struggles of Bickle more than its plot. It provides a good character study within the context of social commentaries that the movie tries to explore.Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster did a great acting job but the dramatization of the film for the most part bores me.

Political Representation Affects Social Life,"Taxi Driver is the best film I have ever watched, many very meaningful scenes, political campaigns, public spaces, prostitution, and social life are perfectly represented by Martin Scorsese in ""Taxi Driver"".I'm very impressed with the scene until now, and have never forgotten this realistic drama, such as the scene of Travis and Betsy dating, it's the funniest but meaningful thing I've ever seen, I don't need to explain, those who have watched must understand it.Ending when Travis is wiser when he refuses Betsy's offer to date, this is the best ending beat I've ever watched, and it means that you have to choose a partner who from the beginning tries to understand you, not choose a partner who wants perfection from the beginning, in this case maybe Travis no longer wants to accept invitations from Betsy. Travis understands that, Betsy invites him because of Travis's popularity at that time as a hero who saves a prostitute, played by Jodie Foster. So that characters like Travis only want understanding, therefore he knows that, Betsy only understands the rest of her good when people talk about Travis's kindness.When else to watch a masterpiece like this, I am very grateful to watch this film, I have watched it for a long time, and review this film on September 24, 2023, if I remember ""Taxi Driver"", there is a regret that ""why did I watch it too early"", that is the sentence that can be described by me about this film, because I can no longer watch like people who do not know the storyline and start watching this film, although occasionally watching it is still fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I GET WHY PEOPLE ARE CALLING THIS ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS OF ALL TIME,"TAXI DRIVER is one of the best films ever made and I wish I had seen this masterpiece sooner. The story follows Travis Bickle, a lonely cab driver, whose isolation slowly causes him to turn towards violence. With the misty air, neon lights and busy streets, Scorsese establishes the gritty atmosphere for the film and shows the dark side of 1970s New York. He is immaculate with the camera setups and each shot is layered with depth and meaning. I can't get over how perfect Scorsese's direction for this film is. De Niro, who plays Travis, is also excellent. He beautifully captures the unhinged nature of this character while also making us feel empathy for him. He wants to do the right things, just not in the right ways but doesn't have anyone to tell him that he's wrong. One character does try telling him this, but Travis is so wrapped up in his ego that he denies it, since the only person he can talk to is himself. His mind is filled with only his beliefs. It shows how far someone can go to prove they're right in a society filled with corruption and hate.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese's Best,"Acclaimed director Martin Scorsese and legendary actor Robert DeNiro have made a hard, disturbing, isolating, gritty movie masterpiece. This is a fantastic piece of cinema.DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam war veteran who has now become a taxi driver is a unstable, lonely man. As different series of events unfold he becomes more unstable and has the urge to lash out at a society that has gone down the sewer.Taxi Driver is a superb piece of cinema. Every actor acts with passion so we believe them. In particular a young Jodie Foster stands out as child prostitute Iris, who is befriended by Travis. She delivers a great, heart-wrenching performance. We really feel for her character and all that she has gone through. Harvey Keitel does a great job as the PIMP Sonny. The audience doesn't like him one bit and that's thanks to Keitels great performance.DeNiro delivers a truly great performance. Even though Travis is a lonely, violent, unstable cabbie we do feel sympathy for him and we almost cheer him on.Scorsese has done a fabulous job of directing and the score by Bernard Herrmann is absolutely terrific. The dialogue is great and thought provoking and the cinematography is brilliant. The final scene at the brothel is very disturbing and violent but it's a scene that sticks with us and really is well done.This was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar but sadly didn't win. This movie will go down in history as one of the greatest films made.5/5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Greatest Film Ever.,"This is in my opinion the greatest film ever made. This is not just a film, this is an experience, not to be missed. It is not always comfortable viewing, but the best films never are. The dialogue, direction, musical score, camera work, and acting are the best you'll ever see in one film. This is a masterpiece of 70's American Cinema. De-Niro gives one of the greatest performances on screen ever. The supporting cast are great too. The film is a rollercoaster of emotion and life will never seem the same again after viewing this powerful film. As a study of one man's alienation in an Urban Hell it has a strong message also. This film is not entertainment, this film is life at its most disturbing edge and yet it is hauntingly brilliant. Scorsese & De-Niro should have both got oscars for this. If you have not seen this film - don't watch it - go out and buy it, because you'll be watching it more than once.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Excellent film by Martin Scorsese that foreshadows the great Bringing Out The Dead, which he directed on almost the same subject over two decades later.","Taxi Driver deals with the perils of big city life, and the film works so well because it adds a touch of mental instability to this otherwise tired theme.  It focuses on the life of a lower middle class man who lives in a city that he finds filthy and that is full of people who disgust him. Everyone has impulses to do things that they know they would never actually do, and the vast majority of people generally listen to the voice of reason. Taxi Driver deals with what happens when a man acts on those impulses, driven away from reason by the multitude of atrocities that surround him.Travis Bickle seemed to be a person who had a very lonely life. The film begins with him applying for a job as a taxi driver because he can't sleep at night, and this may be a symptom of his loneliness. He likes to spend his free time at the adult movie theater, and he even took a date there, which tends to give the impression that he is not very experienced with women. Like most introverted people, he kind of kept to himself a lot of the time, and almost always seemed to be fairly deep in thought about something. As he took in everything around him, he constantly saw terrible things (bums, drug dealers, twelve-year-old prostitutes, etc) that drove him closer and closer to the proverbial edge.' His inability to establish healthy relationships is more than likely a result of bad experiences during childhood, which also gave him this mistrustful and overall negative perception of the world. His rescue attempt, although seemingly insignificant in such a huge city full of crime and corruption, was his personal endeavor to try to make a difference, to do something important and good which would give a specific purpose to his otherwise meaningless life.Travis Bickle seemed to gradually begin to realize his own dire intentions and at one point even seeks advice from one of his fellow cab drivers. He goes to an experienced cab driver known as the `Wizard,' and basically asks him for direction in life, but walks away without having received any comprehensive advice. It seems that he felt that there was something positive in the world that he was missing and that was why he had such negative feelings about it. When he found that the Wizard' evidently either had no idea what he was talking about or had a very hard time explaining himself, he seemed to be discouraged. The fact that he was not reassured at all by this guidance troubled him, and it seemed to narrow his options. It made him feel that the world really did exist exactly as he saw it, and he began to feel even more strongly that something had to be done about it.Taxi Driver is a very dark film. There is a lot of narrative by Bickle, a lot of it as he writes letters, which he may or may not even have anyone to send to. Even more important that that is when he would be driving in his taxi and his thoughts would be narrated out loud for the audience. Often during these narrations the viewer would see the streets as Bickle saw them, very dark, cold, dirty, and filled with questionable and suspicious looking people. Coupled with his unhappy words, this darkness gave the city an entirely dismal look.One of the things that this film is most famous for is Bickle's mohawk. It is such a drastic change that it calls attention to his psychotic condition. The first time his mohawk is shown is while he is at one of senator Palantine's rallies. Bickle is smiling radiantly and capping enthusiastically, but he also has this crude and extreme haircut, and he is wearing an army-green trench coat through which the viewer can clearly see the bulges of the guns that he recently purchased. You know he's not there to cheer on his favorite candidate. This plan to assassinate Palantine, like his conversation with the Wizard, and his relationship with Betsy, was another failure, and this was part of the reason that he put so much more effort into being successful in helping Iris.The countless point of view shots from the taxi window looking at prostitutes, pushers, pimps, thieves, and all sorts of other sleazy people that allowed the viewer to relate to Bickle's view of the world. Robert DeNiro provided a spectacular performance as the mentally disturbed Travis Bickle, and the brilliant direction by Martin Scorsese also served to mold Taxi Driver into the timeless classic that it has become. It's not a pretty film in any way, but the skill and the style are unmistakable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A cinematic masterpiece lost in time,"Let me start this off with saying that pretty much everything about this movie on a technical standpoint is fantastic and has aged like fine wine.From the music, to the cinematography the viewer is treated to a cinematic treat in every sense of the word.Despite a rather short run-time the movie is a good slow burner that focuses more on the change in the characters than anything else.One must also say good words about the acting, really great job across the board.So why am I giving it a six instead of a ten? Well, despite everything that I've said here I think that the story itself hasn't really passed the age test.A lot of the themes in the movie about loneliness, the struggle to adapt to civilian life after serving in the army and depression are well expressed but I do feel that those issues are currently a lot different than they used to be when the movie came out.I don't think it's a bad movie, just that with time the way the themes the movies tackle have evolved with modern society with makes their portrayal here seem lost in translation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Taxi Driver: A Gripping Descent into Madness,"Taxi Driver is a gripping psychological thriller that keeps viewers hooked from beginning to end. Robert De Niro delivers an exceptional performance as Travis Bickle, a disillusioned Vietnam War veteran working as a night taxi driver in New York City. Isolated and struggling with his mental state, Bickle becomes increasingly fixated on the city's corruption, eventually plotting extreme actions to ""clean up"" what he sees as a morally decayed world. The film skillfully builds tension, and De Niro's portrayal of a character teetering on the edge of sanity is both powerful and unsettling. The plot takes several unexpected turns, leading to a climax that is shocking yet inevitable. With its dark themes, excellent acting, and intense atmosphere, Taxi Driver remains a standout in the thriller genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One Man's Crusade,"Taxi Driver is unlike any movie I've ever seen before - extremely dark, uncomfortable at times and still one of the greatest movies ever made. It plays on the loners of society quite like in other movies - King of Comedy and Joker. People like Travis in society who feel very isolated, wondering around aimlessly in search for validation, purpose and some form of genuine and receptive human connections with othersTravis in particular is an outsider looking in suffering from severe mental health issues which was in doubt what happened during his time as a soldier in Vietnam which in no doubt warped his perception on humanity as a whole. He can't sleep at night so instead he puts all his effort into his job as all night Taxi Driver. All he sees night in and night out is pimps, prostitutes, hooligans, thieves, psychos and other form of scum coming out in the dead of night. Sometimes they become his customersTravis has come to the realization in his own mind that humanity is nothing but a cesspool of scum which makes him feel even more out of place in the world. Yet his character is a contradiction as he frequently visits a porno movie theatre. He tried reaching out once to a girl named Betsy he really liked and even managed to ask her out on a date. But because of his lack of self awareness and social inept, he takes her to a porno movie by all which Betsy is turned off immediately ending a potential relationship between the twoFrom there on out Travis continues his lonely hate filled existence until he crosses paths with a child prostitute, Iris, who changes his perception on humanity as even in the depths of scum there are still good people in the world even if forced into something that they don't want to do, is looked down upon and believe it's what they think they want. Feeling he has a purpose, Travis sets out to save Iris by any means necessaryTaxi Driver like Joker and even King of Comedy not only sheds light on social issues from the past that can still be relevant in today's society but also can serve as cautionary tales. If your left alone for too long and have no one to talked too even as you try to reach out in your own way but get rejected, it will send you down a very dark path of multitude of possibilitiesIn one way or another and maybe still ongoing we've all be there with Travis feeling very lonely with negative thoughts, the world as it currently is is getting worse and worse. But it's the choices we make whether that be our thoughts or even enjoy being alone that matter the most. It's always important at least I feel is you should always try to be nice to people even the ones that may come across as strange or weird. I understand even then there are boundaries and rules but I feel showing a bit of kindess even just a quick good morning or hello passing them by if they don't stop and want a proper chat will help lift their spirits just a little and have them feel a little bit acknowledged.Is Travis a villain?

Taxi Driver (1976),"Taxi Driver is a true classic and one of the best films ever made. Robert DeNiro gives one of his most compelling performances as disaffected Vietnam war vet and mentally unstable loner. The film is mostly a character study of Travis Bickle, under the backdrop of NYC in the 1970's. Which was a truly dangerous, but interesting place. In this environment, our main man Travis boiling over in a violent rage is inevitable. Writer Paul Shrader and director Martin Scorsese crafted a very important, unique and real well crafted film that is a classic and influence many filmmakers to come. While there are many movies that have been influenced by Taxi Driver, very few of them are in the same class. Taxi Driver is Scorsese/Shrader's post Vietnam urban American masterpiece that is powerful, gritty and uncompromising. Robert DeNiro is pretty much always great, but this is one of his finest performances and I can't think of anyone who could play this character as well as he did here. I have a lot of admiration and respect for 70's cinema, an era where filmmakers had much more artistic control and had the balls to make movies like this.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Technically well crafted anthology of 70s New York,"I wonder when was the last time I got around to watch an acclaimed timeless classic movie where I really felt the same kind of connection as the cult following of said movie seems to have. Taxi Driver was not one of them.After first viewing I am left sorf of underwhelmed given the legendary status of this movie. The acting, and cinematography are all good. The movie is nice to look at and even given the slower pace it holds the attention. The problem is that after the first viewing I am left somewhat confused about the motivations of the main character. Namely I somehow missed how he arrived at the notion that he wants to get rid of that presidential candidate guy. I refuse to believe that the answer is as simple as ""he is crazy"". Scorsese surely had reason and I believe De Niro knew and acted it out, but it is not so obvious to me, the viewer. That might be one of the reasons to rewatch the movie again and again. The answers are perhaps burried in there. Given how Travis encounters various characters in his taxi, the movie felt at times sort of like an Anthology with the story of the Taxi Driver laid on top. Pretty interesting idea, well executed but somehow emotionally it didn't really connect. I'd say it is a good movie, but do as I did and wait to stumble upon it on VOD or in TV.

Taxi Driver (1976),"Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Robert De Niro, Cybil Shepherd, Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Leonard Harris, Harry Northup, Norman Matlock, Steven Prince, Martin Scorsese, Richard Higgs, Joe Spinell. (R)Blistering, brilliant portrait of an isolated, socially-awkward NYC cab driver and Vietnam veteran, Travis Bickle (De Niro), and his slow descent into madness as the world continually rejects him. The urban nightmare of alienation from which he can never wake is perfectly (therefore, repellently) captured by both director Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader, effectively complemented by Bernard Herrman's jazzy score fragmented by dissonant brass and shards of noise (the legendary composer's final work before his death). Culminates in a brutally violent ""avenging angel"" incident, but it's arguably even tougher to watch Bickle's uneasy and even humiliating interactions with those he tries to connect with; even the camera slides away at one point to focus on something, anything else. The cast is uniformly superb, including Foster's underage prostitute, Brooks in his first film role, and even Shepherd, who has limited range and versatility as an actress, but is well-suited for the material here; as for De Niro, he gives one of his finest performances (in a career full of great ones), frightening and tragic and mesmerizing, a mind and soul deteriorating right before our eyes.

Doesn't stand the test of time,"Taxi Driver is clearly an iconic film that has gone down in history with many memorable moments. But it's an ideal example of a film that's nowhere near as good as it thinks it is.De Niro is superb and portrays his complex character absolutely perfectly. Jodie Foster is good (for her age) but Harvey Keitel doesn't particularly shine (he seems a bit miscast) and the rest are kind of average at best (especially Cybill Shepherd).From a plot perspective, Travis Bickle's search for a purpose in his trouble life is an interesting theme that holds the whole film together. But as good as it is, Taxi Driver now feels very dated and parts of it seem a bit laboured. The 'big scene' towards the end is not well handled at all in my opinion and just looks unrealistic. I'm sure it was all very shocking and groundbreaking in its day but it doesn't stand the test of time.At the time of writing, Taxi Driver has an IMDb score of 8.5 – that's pretty high for a film such as this and actually puts it in a higher position (currently) than Reservoir Dogs, Full Metal Jacket and No Country for Old Men. It's nowhere near as good as any of those three and one would expect to see a much better film than Taxi Driver based on such a high IMDb score. However, I hate it when people deliberately give a film 1/10 just because they think a score is too high and they want to influence the average.

"One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Powerful And Unforgettable Masterpiece Of Cinema. Martin Scorsese And Robert De Niro At Their Best.","Taxi Driver is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that combines amazing direction powerful performances from Robert De Niro and a great cast,a terrific script and a fantastic score. All of those elements make Taxi Driver one my favorite movies and Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro at their best.Set in New York City,Taxi Driver tells the story of Travis Bickle(Robert De Niro),a Vietnam veteran and Marine who drives a Taxi mostly at night and makes good money. But Travis is a loner,depressed,mentally disturbed and is sick of the disgusting things he sees on the streets with criminals,drug pushers,pimps and lowlifes so Travis decides to take the law in his own hands. While taking the law into his own hands Travis sees a young Prostitute(Jodie Foster)from pimps and decides to rescue her.Taxi Driver is a brilliant and riveting masterpiece and instant classic from the first time you watch it where just about everything from the acting,direction and screenplay are all are perfect and flawless and was the second collaboration between director Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro after the amazing and underrated classic Mean Streets in 1973. Taxi Driver is also one of the main movies of the New Hollywood era of the 70s is one of the greatest films of the 1970s that years after it's release in 1976 never loses it's impact. Taxi Driver is a film that right from the very start pulls viewers into a nightmare that never lets go until the end and is a film that is dark and violent as well as very bleak and uncompromising with harsh and gritty style that is all it's own. Taxi Driver is also one of the best films about New York City and I think the depiction of the city adds to Taxi Driver's atmosphere which is grim. The city of New York in Taxi Driver is filthy and dirty showing viewers how most of New York City was during the 1970s with pimps,drug dealers,prostitutes and violence that was on the New York streets at that time. Scorsese captures the insanity of New York showing a place where nothing is cleaned up. Taxi Driver also shows the fear and paranoia of the post Vietnam,post Watergate world where some things are falling apart and there seems to be distrust and anger all around with no hope or salvation. Vigilante movies were huge during the 70s and early 1980s thanks to Death Wish and exploitation films during that period and while Taxi Driver is a vigilante movie it's much more character driven and doesn't glamorize violence. Speaking of the violence,the violence in Taxi Driver is shocking and brutal and shows violence and what it really is The screenplay by Paul Schrader is amazing,masterful and one of the best screenplays in film history with Schrader giving the script great dialog that is harsh and brooding with moments of mesmerizing depth and greatness that make the film. The main character Travis Bickle is one of the greatest,most iconic and truly unforgettable characters in movie history who is an antihero. One of the reasons Travis such a great character because we are fascinated by him at the same time disturbed by him. We are fascinated by Travis because the whole movie is seen from his point of view and we feel Bickle's isolation and the thoughts of being alone or because Travis can talk to people but not on a consistent basis and can only express himself in his diary and thoughts. We are disturbed by Travis because we don't really know if he's a hero or a villain he can be a little bit both because Bickle is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode based on his actions whether it's physical or verbal because Bickle is disturbed by his environment. The movie let's us make up our own conclusions. Travis Bickle is a classic character that you will never forget and will truly live forever,especially the classic 'you talking to me scene'. The ending of Taxi Driver is outstanding and one of best endings ever caught on film because it's a mixture of ambiguity,violence and questions that will never be answered which will cause many debates with no final conclusion. A brilliant ending to a masterful film.The cast is terrific. Robert De Niro is excellent,powerful and gives one of the greatest acting performances of all-time in his most iconic role as Travis Bickle with De Niro being intense and believable. Jodie Foster is brilliant and fiery as Iris,a young hooker Travis wants to help. Harvey Keitel is riveting as Sport,Iris' pimp. Cybill Shepard is terrific and beautiful as Betsy,a woman and political campaign worker Travis likes. Albert Brooks is funny and memorable as Tom,a co-worker of Betsy's. Peter Boyle is fantastic as Wizard,a fellow Taxi driver that gives Travis some advice. Leonard Harris is wonderful as Charles Palantine,a politician running for President. Director Martin Scorsese is creepy as one of Travis passengers. Murray Moston(Iris' Timekeeper) Harry Northup(Doughboy),Steven Prince(Andy-Gun Salesman),Joe Spinell(Personnel Officer),Victor Argo(Melio)and Diahanne Abbott(Concession Girl)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Scorsese is outstanding and masterful,with Scorsese constantly moving the camera with tracking shots,great angles and close-ups as well as beautiful lighting. Amazing direction,Scorsese.The score by Bernard Herrmann is beautiful,haunting,memorable and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. A terrific score,Herrmann.The making-up by Dick Smith is fantastic,realistic and add to the film. RIP,Mr Smith.In final word if you love Martin Scorsese,Robert De Niro or films in general,I highly suggest you see Taxi Driver,an excellent and powerful masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Unsettling and Disturbing; A Psychological Crime Drama Classic,"Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is a Vietnam war veteran who suffers from insomnia and depression. He picks up a job as a cab driver to help cope with these feelings, but is soon sickened by the depravity of the passengers he has to deal with on a nightly basis. He meets a woman named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), who works for a political campaign to elect Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris) for president. He falls in love with Betsy, but she decides to stop seeing him after he takes her to see a pornographic film. This drives Travis into a further and further spiral of paranoia. He befriends an underage prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster), and becomes enraged by her exploitation. Travis descents into madness, and the film ends with a brutal climax that can be interpreted in several different ways.This one is an absolute gem. It really is deserving of all of the praise that it receives. Although his cinematography would later be perfected in films like ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"", Scorsese's camera work in ""Taxi Driver"" is still top notch. Robert De Niro puts on one of the best performances of his career, in my opinion, as a down-on-his-luck loser who is struggling with self identity and is trying to find out where he fits into society. I personally feel like this was snubbed at the 1977 Oscars; as much as I love the movie ""Rocky"", this is clearly a better made picture. This is definitely one of the darkest films ever made, and I can see ""Rocky"" being much more widely appealing for its optimistic tale of the underdog hero.It deserves its spot among the canon of cinema. It's shockingly appalling, brutal, and disgusting. The sleazy streets of 1970s New York really pop off of the screen. It's the kind of movie that makes you want to take a shower after watching. It's not uplifting, and it's not the kind of movie that you would want to watch on repeat. But I think it works as one of the best movies to explore the human psyche; the effects of war and the military life on veterans. ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""First Blood"" also come to mind.My only genuine complaint with ""Taxi Driver"" is the blaring saxophone score. It's definitely atmospheric and moody, but it's too short and repetitive to the point where I find it annoying and distracting after the twentieth time that we hear it.It's also worth noting, as an interesting bit of trivia, that this movie served as a source of inspiration in the failed assassination attempt made on President Ronald Reagan in 1981. The parallels between the character of Travis Bickle and the real life would-be assassin John Hinckley Jr. are very eery. Just as Travis became obsessed with Betsy in the movie, John Hinckley Jr. became obsessed with actress Jodie Foster and attempted to kill Reagan as a means of impressing her.Anyways, there isn't really a whole lot else for me to talk about this one other than suggesting that you take the time to check it off of your viewing list, if you haven't already.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very Good,"Scorsese and De Niro are geniuses! I loved the development of Travis's character that changes with respect to the events of the film, it also has a very good performance by De Niro. The setting of the city especially at night is wonderful, I liked those very bright colours in a city as black and dirty as the same society in which the protagonist lives. The music is very well placed in the right moments and the scene that is almost at the end is a jewel. Now that I have seen it, I understand why it is such an acclaimed film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My favorite Martin Scorsese film.,"It is an intense allegory of a lonely and disturbed taxi driver. He drives around the city doing his job and hating it. This man does not have a good life or anything close to a good motive. Whether it be from his insomnia with the painful memories of the Vietnam war or just wanting to get out of his version of hell, the streets of New York, is irrelevant. One day, he meets a child prostitute and is so disturbed by her situation that he decides to use her as an opportunity to act out in violent and unusual ways.When I watched picture I wondered if I was supposed to feel sorry for this man. I felt like I shouldn't have, but I did. He is so disturbed and so inhuman, but in his mind he is perfectly stable and strong. I love films that challenge me like this one did. Travis Bickle is not a good person. That's one of the things that is established almost right away. He is among one of the most insane and disturbed characters I've seen in a motion picture. However, unlike other films that would paint him in a negative and stereotypical light, Scorsese has the balls to force us into his mind and force us to see the world from his eyes. We recognize what state of mind he lives in and what he feels about this world he sees. It is very unpleasant, but it is a powerful and daring thing for Scorsese to do.There are parts in this film that seem to say that hell is the only place that Travis could exist in, no matter what. He is incapable of existing outside of this realm of decadence and self-destruction. He searches for good things in his life and grabs hold of them so tightly that he forces them to become bad things in his life to suit his situation.Eventually, the film comes to the conclusion that he should stop searching for good things to change his life, and start searching for bad things so that other people's lives can change. The film is hard to watch at some parts, not because of it's explicit violence, but because of the emotional pain that Travis goes through.The hardest scene to watch is a part where Travis picks up a deranged passenger played by Martin Scorsese himself. A film like this is special when it can achieve those kind of emotions from a viewer. The emotional pain is a lot harder to watch than the extreme violence that occurs in this film.That's not to say that the violence is easy to watch because it isn't at all. It is sickeningly abrasive and nightmarish, yet strangely enchanting. The blood looks very much like red paint, with a slightly light tone to it that makes it looks somewhat pretty when splattered on the wall.. It is all the more so in that the film forces us to view this and shoves our faces in it while trying it's best to spare us from the emotional pain.This is one of Scorsese's finest and most complete films. It is a powerful and polarizing work of art. It is among one of the most emotional and suspenseful films I can say that I've seen and it's one that you'll definitely remember!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Good, but slightly overrated and superficial","To me, Scorsese's movies lack emotional depth. They never make you really care for any of their characters, you're never able to feel their sadness, their desperation or their joy and even a movie like taxi driver which is supposed to be a character study suffers from this unwillingness or inability to create and depict emotionally realistic human characters you can actually feel for. If you take a girl to a porno theater on a first date you gotta be an imbecile. It's just too much. Why would I care about someone like that? Similarly, his sudden delusion, that he's now working for the government is not believable in the slightest. The little girl would have been an opportunity to show real human desperation and sadness but Scorsese's not interested in that. All he's interested in is ""tough guys"" who ""freak out"", which is why his movies mainly operate on a surface level. That part is actually well done but it's hardly more than sensationalism. Personally, one-liners like ""You talkin' to me?"" don't do that much for me. Is this really what ""movie history"" is supposed to be made of? It's quite hollow. Also why doesn't Bickle go to jail after what he has done? It's simply not realistic at all. What's left is a movie about someone ""losing his mind"" in an entertaining fashion, who maybe even shows signs of sadness and despair for a second like a real human being would, but who is mainly just there to shoot people. My guess is that Scorsese would never be able to make an interesting film about someone who goes insane but does NOT end up going on a killing spree. It's a gimmick that seems to be absolutely indispensable to him, which says a lot about him as a filmmaker. Decent movie but not anywhere near to being one of the best.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I'd rather watch paint dry,"This movie gets so much hype and for what? The only positive I can give this film is the performance given by Robert DeNero and Jodie Foster. The story is not interesting, it's not compelling and frankly boring.

Society,"After reading many of the reviews for Taxi Driver, I feel I have to make one comment.What amazes and baffles me about this movie is that basically, Travis Bickle is a murderer. If he would have killed Senator Palatine, then he would have been scum. But since fate has him killing ""Scum"", pimps and whorehousemen, he becomes a hero. In the eyes of society.So in the end we are left with the message of it is not why you kill, but who you kill. I am still shocked my the poignancy of this statement whenever I watch this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...""You're only as healthy as you feel.""I figured that since I had just watched ""Raging Bull"" for the first time tonight, I'd make it a De Niro / Scorsese double feature and watch ""Taxi Driver"" as well, which I have also never seen before. And, I'm sure glad I did. I even liked this one better. We get a young cast of big names that weren't really big yet. Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle, and Albert Brooks. A stellar cast in early roles - and they all delivered.A veteran of the Marines, Travis decides to take up a job in New York City as a taxi driver, since he has difficulty sleeping anyway. He figures he may as well be paid for roaming the city streets at night. He comes across some unsavory characters after hours with his various fares, but when he chances upon a young girl who is yanked out of the back seat of his taxi one night, his viewpoint on things start to change. This is the story of one man's need ""to do something"" to clean up the city, find the girl and help her, and expose the hypocrisy of a Senator running for President.I was transfixed by this movie. It was so well acted and crafted, it is easy to see why it was nominated for Best Picture that year. It is a film surrounded by controversy, but rarely does such a film, especially from the early 70's pull me in as completely as this one did. Scorsese got 100% from all of his actors, everyone was in top form here. The story was well written and engaging, and the camera work unlike anything of its time. The final shots of the movie were amazing and unsettled me, with just enough of a hint to let me know that Travis is still a danger to himself and others.I absolutely loved ""Taxi Driver"", and the more I think about it, the more I think I like it. On a sad note, this was Bernard Herrmann's final film that he would write a musical score for, as he passed away shortly after. I always remember him for his remarkable work on the ""Psycho"" soundtrack. This movie gets a very high recommend. If you haven't seen it, you really should.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Not Only One of Scorsese's Best, But Also One of the Best Movies of All Time","To me, Scorsese's Taxi Driver stands as another timeless masterpiece in Scorsese's long list of timeless masterpieces that I have been reviewing in the past week. Taxi Driver is a visceral plunge into the abyss of urban alienation and the human psyche. It's a haunting, personal journey of a man consumed by the darkness. Taxi Driver is also a gripping portrayal of isolation, moral decay, and the relentless pursuit of identity in a world devoid of meaning.De Niro's performance as Travis Bickle is actually so good I didn't believe I was watching De Niro. His portrayal of a mentally unhinged Vietnam War veteran turned taxi driver is hauntingly raw and authentic, capturing the essence of a man teetering on the precipice of sanity. To me, Travis Bickle's metamorphosis from a sleep-deprived, lonely cab driver to a vigilante seeking redemption is kind of really haunting yet you can't really look away despite the horrible things that he does, you can't seem to look away from the screen no matter how hard you try. This role undoubtedly stands as my favorite De Niro performance of all time because he commanded my full attention at every moment.At its core, I believe Taxi Driver is a profound exploration of urban disillusionment. The film paints a stark portrait of 1970s New York City, a city drowning in filth, corruption, and despair. Through Travis Bickle's eyes, we witnessed the disintegration of society, the isolation of the individual, and the desperate yearning for connection of any kind. The narrative adeptly delves into the human condition, exposing the fragility of the human mind and the depths to which one can be driven by loneliness and a distorted sense of justice.One of the film's most poignant themes, to me, is the separation between purity and corruption. Travis Bickle's infatuation with Betsy, which I think symbolizes his yearning for something untainted amidst this urban decay. However, this pursuit is juxtaposed with his descent into violence and vigilantism, blurring the lines between heroism and madness. The movie masterfully navigates this moral ambiguity as Travis Bickle becomes more and more mentally deranged.Scorsese's direction, coupled with Paul Schrader's brilliant screenplay and the haunting score by the brilliant Bernard Herrmann, crafts an atmosphere of palpable tension and unease throughout the entirety of the movie. The cinematography, marked by its shadowy, gritty visuals, mirrors the internal turmoil of Travis Bickle. The use of symbolism, such as the recurring motif of rain, which represents the cleansing and purifying aspects of water in contrast to the filth of the city. I love it all so much.I think Taxi Driver is similar to The King Of Comedy in a way, Taxi Driver emerges as its R-rated counterpart, delving deeper into the human psyche. While The King of Comedy explores the obsession with fame and the depths people plumb for recognition with dark humor, Taxi Driver takes a much, much, more visceral approach, depicting the raw, violent underbelly of a city and the psychological disintegration of its protagonist. Both films, however, share a common thread of societal critique, dissecting the human condition in a creative and disturbing way.Taxi Driver is an unflinching exploration of the human soul in all its darkness and complexity. With Robert De Niro's unparalleled performance at its core, it has quickly become not only one of my favourite Scorsese movies, but also one of my favourite movies of all time.There was also a cool Scorsese cameo, and actually he can act really well. Would love him to actually play a prominent role in something because he was amazing in this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An insight into isolated deteriorating mind and your mind as well,"Here I explain what is behind TD's success as a psychological movie.Even forty years after the initial release, Taxi Drivers is still a relevant movie from which we can learn important things. TD deals with far too serious subject to be easily forgotten or neglected. Conspicuously detailing effects of loneliness, Scorsese takes us right into a milieu and mind of a person who is suffering from chronic isolation left to his deteriorating mind.So we're following a story of ex soldier, now a taxi driver working nights in New York. As he drives we see dirty streets revealed by too bright street lights with strange looking people on the sidewalks. Our driver, Travis, doesn't value this people highly; in fact, he is disgusted by everything on this streets. Every now and then we can hear him sharing his thoughts, as a narrator, a background voice, on different matters. This gives us valuable insight into his mode of thinking, current feelings and mental state. So here we have a double insight: one into Travis' mind, world of subjective; second into his everyday life, world of objective. This portrayal is done in a Dostoevsky's Notes From Underground style since this work influenced development of Travis character.Here I shall emphasize what makes this movie special. This double insight, into subjective and objective, is presented very clearly. But it is the opposite with conclusions we can draw from this insights: we can not draw clear conclusions. Travis is not flagrantly troubled. Some of his comments and actions look pretty normal and sound. For example, he is pretty slick in approaching a girl. But on the other hand, especially towards the end, we are made sure his mental state is not a normal one. And there we have it: here we can experience from the first hand what it looks like to be manipulated by someone. Furthermore, we're even put in a position to feel bad for Travis! It's easy to think of him as a hero, as final scene reveals, and as a victim of society dissolved in debauchery.Here we can see that Taxi Driver can be seen as a movie with a very specific ability: it can trick you into thinking that you're doing psychoanalysis only on Travis when in fact you're doing psychoanalysis on yourself as well! That's because you change your opinion about Travis constantly as he gets mad and thus natural question comes up: why is that? And here you're confronted with your own motives and standards.So the careful watching of the movie can really serve as a kind of mirror in which you can see some Travis' traits in yourself. Pair this with prevailing theme of loneliness and isolation and you get a movie which can have a powerful impact on the audience.Here the details of the movie and plot aren't that important because there's nothing solid to hold onto. You have to see this movie and focus on Travis, seeing how his behavior reflects his inner dynamics and hearing him read his diary. Further topics which are explored include the so called Madonna-w***e complex and superiority complex, as well as misfortunes of living in a big city. So to conclude, let me mention that photography and music strongly contribute to TD's ambient. Taken all together, TD really is a great, one of a kind movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Taxi Driver Review,"Taxi Driver is a classic. An earlier Scorsese film, Taxi driver nails it. Robert De Niro nails the role of a mentally unstable Vietnam Vet. Sine this was a low budget film, shot in NYC, the overall feeling of grittiness is there and it is amazing. You really feel as if you are in this 1970's version of NYC following this crazed man around. The camera work is spot on as well, with long tracking shots of our driver and aerial shots of his destruction, Scorsese does an amazing job directing. You really feel the emptiness of De Niro, which makes his ultimate downfall for a mesmerizing journey to watch unfold. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a thought provoking film that highlights the best parts of both Scorsese and Di Niro's talent.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Memorable Feel Bad Film,"25 years later this film still holds up as an outstanding work for Scorsese and De Niro. The accolades have already been laid out here in abundance and are very true.  Artful, stylish direction by Scorsese and a totally convincing performance by De Niro.  The soundtrack is effective and powerful and the supporting performance by Jodie Foster is remarkable.It can be hard to praise a film that is so good at making us feel so bad. But this films is one of the best at doing just that. Made in 1976 this film has become somewhat prophetic in it's portrayal of the lonely, isolated, misfit in our society who sincerely wants to connect but can't and eventually turns violent. John Hinkley Jr. even mentioned this movie in his explanation of his attempt to impress Jodie Foster by trying to assassinate President Reagan.In the movie, the character Betsy,  played by Cybil Shepard, mentions a line from a Kris Kristofferson song that reminds her of the central character, Travis.  After a recent viewing of this film these lines written by another well known songwriter came to mind:""now they take him and they teach him and groom him for life, and they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill"" ""he's hell bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused and his brain has been mismanaged with great skill. all he believes are his eyes and his eyes just tell him lies."" ""now who's gonna take away his licence to kill?""And then there's the ending.The ending is definitely the weak point of this work.  As stated by another commentator it should have ended with Travis and his mock suicide with his bloody finger pointed to his head. His becoming a hero seems odd and unrealistic. The appearance of him being all better at the end comes off naive. Sort of a wrap it up quick and tidy TV ending.A poor ending to an otherwise outstanding and memorable film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

We're All Lonely,"Watching Taxi Driver made me realize everything I thought I knew about movies was wrong and I had much to learn about film. The truth of my initial viewing is Martin Scorsese's direction dropped me so far into Travis' mind and I never understood any of his actions as wrong. I didn't see him as a vigilante or even insane, I felt his struggles, loneliness, and desire to cure the world of uncivilized people. It was not until I read up on the film after the fact that it hit me, Taxi Driver is a diary of a mad man, not a ""hero's tale."" This led to a magical rush of cinematic brilliance inside me, lined in a sour sorrow that maybe I was crazy because I've been extremely lonely. Maybe everyone's crazy. Are we crazy because we're lonely?We've all felt like that dead animal Travis focuses on as he watches TV, while everyone on the screen dances around the fallen soul. What Scorsese makes of Taxi Driver is not soley educating us about the loneliness we may feel, but presents us with a theory on why we are so lonely: we make ourselves lonely when the lines between what we want and what we can have do not overlap. We try to reach out, but the people we want, do not want us back. There are people that accept us into their lives, even if we surround ourselves with them, we will still feel unfulfilled by the absence of the people we want. This makes us feel unworthy on top of the loneliness.Betsy represents who Travis wants unmutually and Iris is the woman he can literally have, but has no interest in possessing. Using his masculinity, Travis can't extract revenge on Betsy by killing the man she looks up to (the presidential candidate), so he kills the man of Iris he is able to murder (the pimp).Taxi Driver show's Travis' loneliness in two specific acts in the finale: 1) the need to change the world's problems (with the shootout) and 2) wanting to end his miserable life by killing himself. After Travis kills everyone he desired to in the finale to save Iris, he puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger. The light sound effect of an empty gun brought the biggest gasp from me embedded in intense sorrow and the slight disappoint Travis feels. Loneliness pushes us to extremes that with a fulfilled life we would think we would have to not sink to.Not only is it my opinion that I think this is Scorsese's best film, but I would guess this is one that's most personal to him. In particular with the placement of his cameos 1) by gazing at Betsy, he's acts as Travis 2.0, showing his fascination and love/lust for her. 2) the man in the back of the taxi cab who literally directs Travis on screen to a method of expressing his loneliness through violence. The framing of Scorsese to DeNiro make the director like the ""devil"" on the side of Travis' shoulder, telling him to feed into his dark side.Scorsese is aided by Robert DeNiro's portrayal, there's no adjective to describe the superb acting he performs as Travis Bickle. One of the finest performances in cinema, he's a factor that made my first reaction so personal. DeNiro's finest scene is talking to The Wizard outside the coffeeshop. We understand Travis, we've been in his mind, we know what he wants to say, but he struggles to communicate when he tries.The point of view of Taxi Driver is crucial to the brilliance of Scorsese's work. He puts us in Travis' mind and his feelings. To realize Travis's violent, criminal actions fed me food for thought: how do we know if we are like Travis? Inside our own minds, we are the heroes and everyone else is a possible villain. We have a magnificent image of ourselves in our minds, even in Travis' head, we feel victimized by Betsy. However, if we look at the story from Betsy's point of view: Travis is a creepy guy that took her to a porno movie theater and stalks her every move. Can we *really* blame her? Perspective is key here and thinking of this fact may help broaden our minds to accept other people's perspectives, not only our own in everyday situations in real life.During my most recent viewing, I took particular interest in focusing on the heavy use of taxi cabs as symbolism for loneliness. The taxi itself boxes Travis in from everyone him, he's enclosed from the world only able to see what and who is around him never reaching true intimacy. Taxi cabs are yellow, yellow is a color usually associated with being a optimistic, which gives Travis pain as a taxi driver all the more sick. Travis sees New York as a filthy space with evil people. Scorsese makes us feel Travis is driving through Hell, with the company of the vast smoke surrounding the taxi cab. The first shot after the taxi cab entering though the smoke is that of Travis' eyes, full of confusion and fear of the unknown. The symbolism is taken advantage of by the director and cinematography, as well as creating new inspired camera shots.""We are the people,"" is the slogan of Charles Palantine, it also becomes the tagline of the film. ""We are the people"" unites us all in the universal hopeless feeling of loneliness. It impacts us all, even if the wave hits some of us harder than others. The last shot of Travis looking back into the rear-view mirror tells us that Travis is standing tall at this moment of ignoring Betsy now that she desires him, but the loneliness still lurks underneath the surface.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
just a few minutes too long.....,"This was an absolutely great movie, until the end.  I am tired of some people saying that the ending doesn't matter, because in this film, it kills the whole movie. We had the potential for one of the best, and most effective final images at the end of a movie.  That would be Robert DeNiro pointing his bloody finger at his head like a gun, after his brutal shoot out.  Then they camera follows a track to police cars and they should fade out.  We would have a had a dark, brutal film with an anti-hero. Then it goes on for a few more minutes, and Robert DeNiro has friends and is a hero to everyone.  It changes the whole tone of the movie, and I feel that Scorcese copped out at the end and softened up the movie.  It went from a masterpiece, to a decent movie.  I am just disappointed by how he decided to end it.  It ruined everything.  Thats why this is only a 7 instead of a 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The film's claim to greatness is fatally marred.,"Director Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976) is a famous, if somewhat infamous, film.  On the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest films of all time, Taxi Driver is listed at number 47, above The Third Man (1949), number 57; The Silence Of The Lambs (1991), number 65; and even Scorsese's much better film Goodfellas (1990), number 94.  Leonard Maltin (in Leonard Maltin's 2002 Movie and Video Guide) gives the film a less than perfect review.  Maltin writes, `To some, Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader's perception of hell-as a crazed taxi driver's vision of N. Y. C.-was brilliant.  To us, this gory, cold-blooded story of sick man's lurid descent into violence is ugly and unredeeming' (p. 1362).Is Taxi Driver a great film or a very bad one?  The film concerns Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), an ex-Marine, and his problems in reintegrating himself into a post-Vietnam American society.  Travis suffers periodically from severe migraines that may be a result of his war experiences (or his neuroses, fears, or perverse imagination-we never find out).  His migraines operate on a symbolic level as well.  Since Travis is in great physical condition, his sickness must be emotional or spiritual.  In fact, the film implies that Travis's sickness is twofold: barely suppressed rage plus a profound despair-that sickness unto death.  (And what is the source of his despair?  That too, we never learn.)We know Travis is socially challenged; we know this because Travis takes Betsy, the girl whom he idolizes (Sybill Shepherd), to a porno film on their very first date.  She is supposedly a high-class, sensitive young woman whom he desperately wants to impress.  Has he no common sense?  Was he raised by monkeys?It is as if there is something important lacking in him-something vital and alive that has become numbed by the war (which he never discusses or speaks about-a forbidden topic).  Oh, yes, he will admit he was in the Marines, but he goes no further.  He can connect with no one.  He is a product of a dysfunctional society-a new antihero, a rebel without a cause, but without the charisma of the Great Dean.The problem with the film is simply that Travis doesn't care who is the recipient of his deadly anger, his repressed violence and savagery.  It's all the same to him-a presidential candidate or some low-life gangster. (Some film reviewers apparently miss or overlook the fact that Travis first means to kill Senator Charles Palantine [Leonard Harris], the politician whom Betsy works for.  Only after being thwarted in this unmotivated attempt, does he decide to whack the mobsters who menace Iris Steensma (Jodie Foster), the pint-size prostitute.)Ultimately, the film, despite its great power and marvelous acting, is a cold-blooded work of art.  As in the Beatles's Eleanor Rigby, Scorsese walks from the grave, the death-in-life of an urban cesspool, and no one is saved. There is no hope, no vision, and no teleology that results from all of the frenetic activity.  There is no appeal to basic humanity or to religious or moral or ethical values or beliefs.  Perhaps the film's claim to greatness is fatally marred.  That the flaw is in humanity itself is no great consolation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Robert De Niro & Martin Scorsese pair together well,"Everyone knows that Robert De Niro is one of the all time greatest actors... at least in my opinion. The story line follows a man who is in the world running through it like a lone wolf. Everyone has quoted ""You talkin to me?"" even if they don't realize where its coming from. The interesting perspective of the movie makes it that much better. For a man that can not sustain any relationships with a single human being he makes the audience love him.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
wow,"Amazing. I guess the plot is a bit basic, but I think it is able to very accurately portray Travis. Camera-work is solid, with nice variation of mounted cams, etc. It goes in for CUs of Travis more often than other people, making you feel like you're really in his head. Editing was superb as well, keeping the pace going it what's actually kinda a slow film. It doesn't feel slow at all. Even with the awkward moments, there's enough tension there, like where he is in the political crowd, or introducing himself to the girl at the office, or just walking up the stairs to the apt. rooms, that I'm not bored in the slightest. It's peppy. THe city feels alive, but Travis is not so much alive at the same time.The ending felt a bit off, but I think Travis would agree.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Powerful but flawed,"To fairly review a movie from the 1970's, one must separate elements of that often ridiculed decade, such as fashion, hairstyles, technology, and jargon, from the story and the performances. S/he can't allow the plaid pants; broad-collared shirts; contrived sounding street talk; over-the-ears, less than natural, post-hippie era hair; or even the absence of I-pods and cell phones to keep him/her from directing his/her judgments only at the believability of the movie's plot and the acting.So... keeping the popular culture of that time in perspective, I think Taxi Driver deserves high marks in part because it helped to make people aware that a soldier usually returns from war (Viet Nam or any other) troubled, not simply relieved that he is no longer experiencing horror and motivated to transfer his work ethic to the home front. The movie reveals, too, that a veteran may not have caring parents and friends and a comfortable home to ease his transition (though the difference between the memories of explosions and screams and the calm of an office or store creates its own special stress); he may have to find his way alone.Taxi Driver succeeds, too, because of the acting. Robert De Niro, Cybill Shepherd, Jody Foster, Peter Boyle, and Harvey Keitel perform convincingly as the victims, degenerates, and survivors of a depraved New York City subculture. Only the FBI agents come across as a little typed.Taxi Driver doesn't score high in all areas, however. While the cast impresses, this starkly realistic story actually lacks in realism. In the climatic scene When Travis (Robert De Niro) rescues Iris (Jody Foster), by gunning down the miscreants who exploit her, he has carried out a rehearsed plan (he had purchased several firearms) motivated by an overpowering and unrelated rage as much as he has valiantly acted on his concern for this once innocent girl. The writers, as they should, make Sport (Harvey Keitel) and his buddies look like low-lifes, but when these men rebound growling and screaming from 38-caliber pistol blasts from point blank range they behave like zombies, not humans.During the outcome phase the less-than-likely events continue. Newspaper recognition of Travis Bickle's act seems plenty appropriate, but a police officer, FBI agent, or common citizen would have probably seen and commented on the similarity between the man in the newspaper photo and the mohawked character who drew attention to himself when he conspicuously fled the plaza where he had considered -- he pulled out a gun for many to see -- killing a senatorial candidate as he spoke to an audience of 500+.And not long after the newspaper makes the public aware of Bickle's courageous deed, he receives a letter from Iris's parents thanking him for saving their daughter. Like the newspaper story aspects of the letter rate it low on the probability scale. I can understand that such a letter would include the parents' gratitude and feelings of indebtedness toward the person who made possible the girl's return home. I don't accept, though, that the parents would also tell of their daughter's successful readjustment to her school routine and renewal of friendships. After the abuse that Iris weathered and the violence that she witnessed, she would suffer post traumatic stress that would rival that of the Viet Nam veteran's.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

What's the point?,"This is a strange mesmerizing film that cruelly preys upon the audience's willingness to identify with the psychotic main character, allegedly in order to teach a moral lesson. But what lesson?Many of the audience may not have been aware that the movie had a religious message, thinking instead that it was yet another warning against the violence brought back from Viet Nam by frustrated soldiers such as the one portrayed by Robert DeNiro. But this does not seem to be all that the film makers intended.Scorsese, the director, today is a major academic critic and professor of the art. His work may be regarded as the embodiment of his political philosophy and critical theories. In an interview, he announced to the world that he was a ""Catholic film maker,"" and referred to the final bloodletting scenes in ""Taxi Driver"" as a form of ritual sacrifice. Precisely what did he mean?It is not the kind of Christian message that Hollywood movies have traditionally given, but one which may be informed by the director's peculiar approach to film making. Scorsese is a foremost proponent of the Hollywood noir style. He mocks liberal faith in the blessings of democracy and the forces of law and order (as against the teachings and methods of religion, I presume).In ""Taxi Driver,"" Scorsese puts the six-gun armed ""Travis"" through a grotesque, seemingly random series of pointless adventures that end in a very ironic and unromantic way. This is a studied use of noir effect that mocks the Hollywood man of action and action genre films. Its pessimistic, bleak message seems to be that life is filled with ugliness and misery, which cannot be cured by action. But it says this in a bizarre, unrealistic way that has more to do with feelings about art than feelings about life.""Taxi Driver"" was much questioned even when it was under production and there was plenty of critical scorn after it came out. A director acquaintance of mine who attended NYU film school (where Scorsese taught) responded to ""Taxi Driver"" this way at the time, ""man, that stuff is more dangerous than you think. Someone out there (the hinterlands) is gonna see that and do something really deadly."" His prediction came true and the country was nearly plunged into chaos at a time when we could ill afford any disturbances in the social order. Shouldn't the movie have taught a lesson against specifically that type of violence?Apparently, the religious message was a bit obscure, because someone in the audience who desperately needed guidance, certainly didn't get the point.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A shockingly accurate portrayal of loneliness and isolation,"Any film which conceptualizes a thematic element for the very first time will inevitably achieve great success. You could argue that every piece of art depicting lonely young men is an olive branch off of what Schrader wrote and Scorsese directed.""Taxi Driver"" is a first person narrative following a traumatized War Veteran who realizes he has no place in western society. He decides to drive a cab at night because he doesn't sleep. He lives alone and has no friends. The ""friends"" he does have consist of a few older cabbies with whom he'll occasionally get coffee with. Their conversations are innocuous and detached. He reaches out for romantic partners but is constantly rejected. He traverses New York City looking at women who he wants but inevitably can't have. The hypocrisy of life is haunting, and the rage and sexual frustrations grow.Travis Bickle's pariah is not easily justified. For all that he loses, the one thing he retains is his sense of ego. It's not as if he walks around without self confidence. It's interesting to note how his war status is only mentioned a singular time. He discloses it in the very first scene. It's never mentioned again. Why does Schrader do this?This is the most accurate depiction of societal isolation in movie history. Loneliness and trauma are infectious. Everyone has periods of life similar to Travis Bickle. Some are able to climb out, while others stay stagnant. If Scorsese is trying to tell us anything, it's that we aren't alone- but in reality, we are.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good,"This movie is really something it's about a mentally unstable loner and it captures that feeling so well and it hits really hard especially during the quarantine where loneliness is very common. It depicts the streets of new york city being very dirty filled with filth and it captures that so well in every scene taking place during night time and it's also very visually pleasing. The score on this film complimented the storytelling of this film quite well the jazzier pieces will definitely live in my head for quite a while. Speaking of storytelling it's probably my favorite part of the film you see travis doing day to day activities and you just feel how isolated he is from others he's very awkward and struggles to socialize properly at times which definitely can feel relatable to some, also making travis narrate his diary entries is very smart as you geta deeper look into his mental it's one of my favourite aspects of the film. My main gripe with the film is that some of the dialogue feel a bit out of place or too awkward or too weird especially in the first act of the film which is a bit of a bummer since it's personal favourite part of it, other than that I think the movie is great it has some very minor flaws but doesn't hinder the experience you will get all that much.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"The depiction of an outcast, becoming a villain. Truly original and very compelling.","Travis is a solitary ex marine that has a very negative perception of society. The chain of events that will change him along the movie feels very close to reality. Personally, I have lived through some of his misadventures, and I can confirm that there are a few events that can definitely change the outlook that you have on people surrounding you. Travis will slowly descend into madness, thinking that through his actions he will cleanse the New York community from lowlifes and criminals. He develops his own idea of justice and he tries to help weak people in his way.Robert De Niro is absolutely fantastic, he carried this movie practically alone and still after all these years, it is one of his best performances. Honestly I cannot see anyone else acting the role of Travis Bickle.The scenery is unique. Most of the time, the movie will follow the taxi driver, during his night rides, where he will meet the strangest people and live the most tragic situations, which will contribute to shaping his toxic mentality. I lost myself in the Big Apple lights, in its traffic, in its sound, in its streets. This is a movie that gave me a unique visual experience. The main theme is fantastic and will always follow emotions felt by Travis. Sweet when he is in love or happy, tense, when he is angry, and sad, when he is lonely. I cannot stress this enough: go listen to the original score, it is a wonderful masterpiece.This is one of the most influential movies in modern history and it is still today considered a reference point, because the protagonist is extremely relatable. Travis represents an anomaly, but unfortunately many people committed extreme acts in real life, like the one shown at the very end of the film. It is fascinating to see how a person can reach the point of no return, why they feel a certain way towards society and which are their thoughts. The more I think about it, the more scared I feel. Definitely a very deep and meaningful film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the Best Character study films!,"Overall, it's clear too see why Taxi Driver is considered a classic. It's one of cinema's outstanding character studies, led by a monumental performance by Robert De Niro.The film shines in its dark themes of isolation and alienation. It shows how the mind can spiral in negative ways when faced with nothing. In this case, De Niro's character suffers with PTSD after being in Vietnam. His performance is just perfect in every way, he embodies the struggles he is going through and he takes us into the mind of Travis Bickle. It's his show.The writing from Paul Schrader equally with De Niro's performance is the films biggest strength. His writing paints Travis as a stable guy in some aspects but he is of course far from that, but the writing is so well done in many ways. Kudos too Schrader for his script.If there was any slight complaints for me, the pacing was slightly slow in places and I don't know how I feel about the ending (although that may change upon a second viewing)All in all, a great film.Quote - 'Your only as healthy as you feel' - Travis.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

De Niro owns the screen but a tad bit overrated as a whole film.,"Taxi Driver is a good film, though a bit overpraised. It is the story of Travis Bickle- a lonely ex Vietnam soldier holed up in a tiny apartment in New York. He develops an infatuation with a woman he sees across the street and befriends a girl prostitute all within a span of time, which pretty much tells you his state of mind. To put it bluntly Travis is a sociopath- a volcano waiting to erupt.

In other words, it's a decent watch but hardly a classic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

And yet it is so boring that I was constantly looking at my watch, hoping it was close to being over.I gave three stars: one because it is the minimum, one for DeNiro's performance, and one for Foster's performance.Despite TD's hype, I cannot recommend it.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An Outcast's Revolt,"Following his masterful MEAN STREETS, Martin Scorsese created another highlight of seventies Hollywood in TAXI DRIVER, a riveting insight into urban alienation, socio-political violence and cultural corruption. Robert De Niro stars as Travis Bickle, a twenty-six-year-old insomniac former Marine who finds employment as a taxi driver in New York City, and becomes so repulsed by the city's sleaze and decay he develops an obsessive hatred. Litter and rubbish bags decorate the putrid streets, where whores, pimps, pushers, muggers, mobs and other degenerates go about their depravity while the general populace remain apathetic. He eventually spirals down a path of violent madness, conceiving an assassination attempt on presidential candidate Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris) and a plan to rescue a twelve-and-a-half-year-old prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster) from her paedophilic pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel).This frustrated outsider is so out of touch with the deteriorating society around him that phrases like ""moonlighting"" don't register, and he has no idea of what makes an acceptable date, unintentionally offending a blonde political campaigner for Palantine called Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). His inability to conform and relieve the tensions inside of him, both psychological and sexual, give him and the film a relentless drive - an outlet to empty his rage must be found. The prevalent seediness becomes the objective of his aimless existence - he dreams of the day that a ""real rain"" will come down and wash away the filth, like the great flood in the Book of Genesis. Travis' 1973 honourable discharge suggests Vietnam, and the prominent scar on his back indicates trauma. Though it's never explicitly stated if he has PTSD or another mental disorder, his struggle to sleep is likely a symptom of something, and his habit of popping pills is probably the only form of treatment or counselling he has ever received. His murderous ambition is a product of his wartime experience, yet his moralistic sense of judgement could be reflective of a spiritual upbringing. The film exposes the shared fundamental behind war heroes, religious radicals, political assassins, vigilantes and resentful misfits - the idea of unleashing oneself and fighting for a cause. Many have interpreted the film's ending as a dream, but it works as reality too in proving just how inescapable the sickness of this dystopia is.Never before or since has a movie intertwined these contentious themes so well and conveyed them with such shattering force. Cinematographer Michael Chapman does a marvellous job of putting us into the eyes of Travis - the neon colours of this metropolis are intoxicating, with voluptuous evil emerging from the gothic shadows. We're drawn into Travis' seething inner whirlwind, and can understand why he feels so disgusted yet obsessed by this vivid inferno. Writer Paul Schrader penned the script during a period of suicidal contemplation, coming from a strict Calvinist background which prevented him from seeing a movie until he was seventeen; this sense of repression shows in his protagonist. Major political inspirations on the plot included the diary of Arthur Bremer and his assassination attempt on governor George Wallace in 1972, as well as the two attempts on President Ford's life in 1975. Perhaps unsurprisingly, for a film influenced by such people, TAXI DRIVER became notorious for shaping John Hinckley Jr.'s aspiration to kill president Reagan in 1981, which also proved unsuccessful.In what may be his most celebrated performance, De Niro brings a terrific, multi-faceted case study of urban outcasts and modern war veterans to the core of the picture; much of the film's complexity and enduring relevance can be attributed to this masterful portrayal of Travis. Owing to his dedicated, preparatory Method acting approach, De Niro obtained a cabbie licence and spent a month driving around New York doing fifteen-hour shifts for the role, taking note of how his passengers hardly ever spoke to him. His passionate bravura attends to subtle, enhancing details; the irritated, burning eyes of this tormented urban foreigner give blank stares and troubled glances, and his speech is subdued by his ever-present lonesomeness, stifling emotions and poor health. As he readies himself for his revolt on the city, he confronts his reflection in the mirror like an antagonist, asking it a defiant question that has become one of the most famous lines in movie history. An archetypal cinematic antihero, the character and quote have been subject to much homage and parody over the years, in film, television and even music. Jodie Foster is also very effective as Iris, a confident child duped into a life of immorality, and Harvey Keitel is good as well, with his insistent wiggling movements making Sport all the more repugnant. Foster was exactly Iris' age when she played the part and consequently had to be replaced in the more disturbing scenes with her older sister to avoid possible trauma. In addition to the excellent cast, director Scorsese appears in a brilliant cameo as a deranged fare of Travis'.The picture received rave reviews and was a surprise box office success, resonating strongly with contemporary audiences experiencing the nationwide post-Vietnam trauma, a mistrust of authority as evidenced through Watergate and the widespread debauchery amongst the general public. It won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and was Scorsese's first work to be nominated for the Academy Award. The horrifying climax, with all its bloodshed, had to be desaturated to avoid an X rating, yet the adjustment seemed to have given the sequence more realism. It's a testament to the film's perception and virtuosity how its themes and messages continue to strike chords in the internet age almost half a century onward, where a sense of isolation and decadence continues to abound in this crazy world. If there was a flaw to speak of, it would be Bernard Herrmann's unsettling score, the last of his life - though memorable, it's unnecessary, repetitive and obvious, the stuff of B-grade shocker flicks. TAXI DRIVER isn't just one of the most iconic artistic statements of its time but a neo-noir crime thriller classic for the ages.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Road to Insanity,"Trying to be good in an immoral world can really drive you mad. That is, in summary, the plot of Taxi Driver (1976), directed by Martin Scorsese. The theme of alienation is a common theme in Scorsese's filmography, but it was no such thing at that time. That's a reason why many, including myself, regard this film as one of the best in cinema history.The film tells the story of Travis Bickle, a taxi driver in New York City. Travis sees the city and the people by the taxi's window, seeing everyday crime and corruption. After being rejected by a woman and ironized by people he feels isolated and ignored by society, which leads him to take extreme actions. At the end of the movie he will lose his sanity, slowly carrying the watcher with him, and he will eventually commit murder.At the end of his journey the protagonist will not be charged for his actions, instead he will be treated as a hero. Was this really worth it? Is the spirit more important than the head? Is revolution the solution? It's too late to elaborate. The driver is already in his taxi, looking for his next prey, and he's staring at you through the mirror.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A perfect blend of Director, Star and Place","Dark, dirty, rainy, dangerous, foggy, grimy, glorious - all words that would describe New York City in the late 1960's/early 1970's.They are also words that would describe Martin Scorcese's 1976 film, TAXI DRIVER starring Robert DeNiro (fresh off his Oscar win for Godfather II) in another Oscar nominated performance.This film is a perfect blend of Director, star and material. These 3 elements come together to blend a vivid portrayal of an outsider/loner observing the decay of the city he loves, finally culminating in his desire to correct some of the wrongs.I still don't know if I'm talking about Travis Bickle, the character DeNiro is playing, or of Director Scorcese.DeNiro is powerful in his portrayal of the titular Taxi Driver, Travis Bickle. He subtly underplays the character - especially at the beginning - showing a lost soul wandering the big city. Slowly, this character begins to gain his footing - and that footing is terrifying in the violence that is welling up in him. He has no social attachments - and the 2 that he attempts to gain during the course of this film slips through his grasp the harder he tries to clutch them.Jodie Foster was Oscar nominated for her turn as 13 year old street walker Iris. It is a stunningly strong performance by an young actress who heretofore was known only for lighthearted ""Disney-type"" films and shows the strength of character and performer that Foster would become. Albert Brooks and Peter Boyle pop up in this film in somewhat comic-relief roles. Roles that are a needed, and welcome, change of pace for this film. As opposed to Harvey Keitel as ""Sport"" the pimp of Foster's character. You can sense that he is just as dangerous as Bickle and if these two were to go up against each other, violence is going to erupt.The surprise of this movie for me was the performance of Cybill Shepherd as Betsy, the object of Travis' desire. She brings a power and grace to her role that is extremely attractive to watch. You are drawn to Betsy and can understand how Travis is drawn to her as well.But, make no mistake, this is Scorcese's film. He captures the feel of New York City of this time. This film is mostly mood and atmosphere - and that is a good thing. You get the sense that you are there. This film is a time capsule of the ""Mean Streets"" times of NYC - and shows a Director that knows this city and knows how he wants to show it on film. I was shocked to find out that Scorcese was NOT nominated for an Oscar for his work here, it is that good.I also was surprised to find that the great Bernard Herrmann (Citizen Kane, Psycho, Vertigo) was the Composer of the film - and he is a great choice. His music perfectly matches - and enhances - the mood that is set up by Scorcese. This film would not be as atmospheric - or would capture the vibe of the time - without Herrmann's score. Unfortunately, Herrmann would pass away shortly after completing his work on this film, so his Oscar nomination was posthumous.A wonderful blend of character, place and mood. Taxi Driver is timeless because it is about a specific time.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) - and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Alcoholic cinematography and intoxicating music!,"This is what I start Martin Scorsese's movies with. Definitely a gem in very unique and tonic way. In my journey of movies so far, I never felt so much of refreshed after watching a long queue of nice and worse movies. This definitely doesn't lie in the later section. Martin Scorsese directed this in a ravishing, prepossessing and hedonistic modus operandi. From start to finish, each detail, each scene, each shot is taken in alluring way that the viewer get as much possible attached to the movie and never get back even after finishing up movie. Of course, script was much good and Scorsese put up his whole heart and even though there were flaws but this movie is really striking.The script has its problems. Writing is a bit lousy.

Brutal look into the mind of a troubled soul,"De Niro is menacing, fragile, deranged and pathetic, all wrapped up into one mind blowingly outstanding performance. The depiction of the moral decay of NYC pulls no punches and reminds us of the horrific lives of those who are beset by poverty, drug abuse and desperation. Watching in 2024 and having seen many real life news reports in the decades since of individuals who have descended that far into their own madness. Taxi driver gives a brutally honest report on why some people decide to follow a dark path. PTSD, loneliness, rejection are just some of the experiences that Bickle has. The movie is clever in that although Bickle himself is quite simply unhinged and his struggle with social interactions conjure an unnerving character who is undoubtedly on the edge of a violent breakdown. Scorcese, helped by De niro's likeability somehow manages to make the viewer give Travis a certain level of forgiveness for his actions. He somehow seems pure at his core. The ending splits opinion. I for one was pleasantly surprised and especially liked the epilogue right at the end. A solid 8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Martin Scorcese's Taxi Driver (1976), could quite possibly occupy the rare distinction of being a 'new genre' movie experience.","Martin Scorcese's Taxi Driver (1976), could quite possibly occupy the rare distinction of being a 'new genre' movie experience. This unique blend of societal degradation, alienation, idiology, politics, sleeze, and ultra-violence is woven seamlessly into a eulogistic, yet paradoxically disconnected poem; of pain, confusion, and cleansing redemption. The sheer depth of expression here, is far too much to process in one viewing. After several views, it might just become blatantly obvious why this troubling classic with it's haunting signature jazz music score, has earned itself a place amongst the 'greats' of cinematic composition.

The movie that defined my life and love for cinema,"Today I rewatched this for, maybe, the 150th time, during my teenage years I had a strange obsession with Travis, the way he sees the world and the brilliant De Niro performance, the scene of Travis watching American Bandstand with that empty look in his eyes is absolutely one of the saddest scenes in cinema history. We really see how much his loneliness has effected his life without a single word of dialogue spoken. Brilliant!Every time I watch Taxi Driver it helps me understand his character, and now I am in a position where it trully speaks to me in a deeper level, on August I decided to let all my friends go: a longtime friend from school, lots of ex-teammates from the football years, a girl that was for sure the best person I have ever met in my life, miss here so much, hope she is well, only one guy stood, and he is the one friend that I'll keep forever, so for 2 whole months this is the only guy that I can speak to, since he is kind of and ""internet friend"", irl it is even worse, not a single word spoken through days, sometimes even weeks, in the beginning the feeling of being alone was really bad, haunting in some ways, I got used to being around people, produced content on the internet that made people admire me, and losing all this was... hard, God knows how hard, but it was needed, I needed to put myself in this position in order to get stronger in the future. Today is a friday, I'll go home, sit alone, and wait until I have to sleep, there is no point in doing anything, listening to music, watching a movie, or even playing games, the joy in doing it is just gone... tomorrow it starts all over again, God knows for how long. In Travis own words: ""loneliness has followed me my whole life everywhere"", so it's time to face it and try to overcome the bad sensation, when I managed to deal with this, I can start again. On the 25th of October this friend that I still talk to comer to visit, first time seeing him in a decade, and finally having someone to talk to in person will be amazing, after the experience, I'll rewatch Taxi Driver again and update the review.Posting just so I can read this in the next years and remember how thing were back in 2019, personal post, if you are reading it on the ""Taxi Driver review page"", just ignore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese's journey into hell via NYC: Classic American filmmaking; iconic DeNiro,"TAXI DRIVER (1976) **** Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Albert Brooks, Leonard Harris, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle. Harrowing masterpiece from director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader for their portrait of the underbelly of the seamy world of Times Square and lone psychopath Travis Bickle (captivating De Niro in his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor; he won the previous year in Best Supporting Actor category for ""The Godfather Pt.II"") driven to violence and the redemption of innocence lost in the persona of 12 year old hooker Foster (Best Supporting Actress nominee in one extraordinary piece of acting).Graphic and hauntingly disturbing thanks to make-up effects wiz Dick Smith and musical score - his last - by Bernard Herrmann.Scorsese has a small role as one of De Niro's fares and look sharp for him earlier when Travis first sees Shepherd, he's sitting on a stoop.

Almost lives up to the hype...,"Taxi driver is undoubtedly a masterpiece, particularly from the time. However, technical mastery cannot save it from one glaring flaw: the final climactic showdown. Two hours of incredibly built up tension leading to a rather bland and poorly stages showdown which left me baffled. Now, I am giving the film the benefit, due to its age. The sound mixing felt particularly odd to me, but then again: could just be a sign of the time.Other than that, the intense, edge-of-your-seat tension through multiple scenes left me very, very intrigued throughout the runtime. Save for a few strange meddlings with the order in which the events take place, the film was mostly coherent and ambiguous, but not to the point of being pretentious. Overall, I think this is an essential piece of cinema for sure. But, if hasn't aged particularly well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Transcendent Masterpiece.,"""Taxi Driver"" is much more then just another Scorcese/De'Niro masterpiece in their collection of classics. This is the great Martin Scorsese's most penetrating and enigmatic creation of emotion and atmosphere. De'Niro displayed, in my eyes, one of the most profound performances in the history of cinema as a disturbed lonely man who's sick of all the scum. This 1976 classic set the table for so many subsequent all time great motion pictures stylistically and atmospherically. ""Taxi Driver"" is an all time great motion picture and should be universally viewed as one of the top 25 cinematic creations ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Disturbing,"Fantastic filmmaking, an outstanding cast, and cinematography that manages to be artistic and elevating, and yet also captures the grime and filth of New York City's seedier areas in the 1970's. Seriously, I felt like I needed a shower afterwards. That's also because the film is dark, and in several ways. It has an anti-hero who is a disturbed, pathetic loner. Child prostitution. Scenes that seem to glorify guns and violence. And an awful ending (and no, I'm not buying the dream theory). I believe it's all meant to be a brutal (and realistic) indictment of America, but it seems to me it also revels a bit in the mire of this grim world, and ironically glorifies some of the very things it's critiquing. I loved the shots of New York at night, and the effects with light, such as when they come through the back of the taxicab out of focus. I thought Jodie Foster at 14 was brilliant, and Robert De Niro (""You talkin' to me?"") was as well. I admire Scorsese the artist, but this one was too disturbing for me to want to see again (though I said the same thing when I first saw it years ago). Poke around and see how many people view Travis Bickle as a hero, instead of seeing in him what isolation, failure, frustration, and mental illness inevitably lead to, and you may get an idea of what I mean.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Chilling and disturbing tale of urban life,"This film is a terrifying depiction of life in a dilapidated urban environment. It's terrifying how alienated and lonely Travis is, even though he travels around and meets many people. It's terrifying how his mental illness progresses over the course of the story with nobody to support him. It's terrifying how the moral decay of the city has numbed Iris into thinking her life is ""normal"". It's terrifying how Travis feels the need to take matters into his own hands and how nobody seems to be very bothered at the end. The depiction of New York City and its effect on its denizens is dark and disturbing. The only normal characters, Betsy and the volunteers, are the only light in this darkness and exist only as contrast to the rest of the filth around them. This film touches on many themes - loneliness, mental health, violence, urban decay and more - and shows the logical conclusion of 20th century social alienation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Taxi Driver is as Relevant as The Day it Was Released,"I think never has Taxi Driver been a more relevant movie to watch. Martin Scorsese's disturbing look at the life of a troubled, disenfranchised, unreliable narrator is engaging and visceral and powerful. The use of New York City as a secondary character in the movie is palpable and enhances the story and the viewing. Almost 50 years later the performances of DeNiro, Keitel, and Foster really still resonate. The film was so impactful that it created its own subgenera, of sorts. While we can't help but be disgusted but what DeNiro's Travis Bickel has become we understand that the foundation upon which his dysfunctional responses are based are not misguided. This character is often parodied and copied, but for his mannerisms and his classic lines; however, there is a depth and sympathetic quality to this character that only this Director and this actor could have brought out. I love Jeff Bridges, the original choice for the film, but he would have been a very different Travis Bickel. Watch this one, or watch it again.

Time out of time?,"A striking film. I didn't see this film until last night, more than 25 years after it was made. Generally I don't like the Scorsese/Tarantino adulation of gangster psychopathology, if only because it explains little and probably serves best to give timid males some relief from their anxieties. If their films point a moral, it is that people do what has been done unto them, which is a pretty obvious truism that doesn't require slaughter-house emphasis.But what makes this particular film so disturbing? Surprisingly, I think it is the music, the whole lounge jazz idiom. Some call Taxi Driver a film noir. It is not - it's way too seedy. But it has the score of a film noir. In other words, Taxi Driver is a forties/fifties film set in the seventies. Strictly, the score should include bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd, but not the Stones (too hedonistic), but more likely urban rock like Springsteen (for the self-pity). It would have made a more informative film: for instance, how afraid of himself is this character?In a way, Scorsese is here like Bogdanovich and Polanski, cultural outsiders making stylistic tributes to a more authentic cinematic tradition. Only the likes of Dick Richards' Farewell My Lovely really worked, but they were still in that tradition.The great surprise for me in Taxi Driver is the relative humanity of de Niro, the control freak who hadn't at that stage quite got himself under control. At times, he even reminded me of the more witty Bruce Willis.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It's a lovely classical film that can be fully appreciated for its craftsmanship,"The director, Martin Scorsese, has maintained a particular style of filmmaking from the olden days to the present. The gangster theme of the movie is very engaging. The story and plot are superb; they include twists that make it interesting and arouse curiosity.The main protagonist of this movie, Travis King, played by actor Robert De Niro, has performed exactly as a character should in the role of a taxi driver. De Niro portrays Travis as a typical taxi driver. Then, he desires to make a change in his life, transitioning from the mundane taxi driver life to the life of a gangster. Travis progresses step by step, practicing with guns, knowing well the dangers associated with being a gangster. When he fails to make the change, a drastic turn occurs when he has the chance to save a teenage girl from a prostitution. This plot twist allows the audience to witness Travis's transformation.The cinematography in this film is aesthetically pleasing and attractive. Set in New York City, the film beautifully captures the essence of city life in every outdoor shot.""One of the most striking elements of the film's cinematography is its use of lighting. Scorsese and Chapman employ chiaroscuro lighting techniques to create a sense of mood and atmosphere, casting deep shadows and stark highlights that reflect the psychological turmoil of the protagonist, Travis Bickle. Whether it's the neon-lit streets of Times Square or the dimly-lit interiors of seedy nightclubs, the interplay of light and shadow heightens the tension and suspense of the narrative.Moreover, the cinematography of the movie ""Taxi Driver"" effectively conveys the isolation and alienation experienced by Travis Bickle. Through carefully framed shots and long takes, the audience is placed in the passenger seat of Travis's taxi, witnessing the city's diverse inhabitants from a voyeuristic perspective. The use of handheld camera techniques further enhances the sense of immediacy and intimacy, allowing viewers to experience the urban landscape through Travis's eyes.This movie ""Taxi Driver"" is a character study of Travis Bickle(Robert De Nairo), a Vietnam War veteran turned taxi driver who becomes increasingly disillusioned with the decadence and moral decay of 1970s New York City. Schrader's screenplay skillfully navigates Travis's descent into madness, capturing his existential angst and alienation through introspective voiceovers and sparse dialogue. The script is unflinching in its portrayal of Travis's inner turmoil, offering a compelling exploration of loneliness, isolation, and the desperate search for meaning in a world devoid of humanity.Scorsese's direction shows Schrader's screenplay to new levels, imbuing the film with an atmosphere of palpable tension and unease. From the film's haunting opening sequence to its climactic and explosive part, Scorsese demonstrates a keen eye for detail and a mastery of visual storytelling. The directorial choices, such as the use of slow-motion, dynamic camera movements, and striking compositions, effectively convey Travis's unraveling mental state while immersing viewers in the seedy underbelly of New York City.This movie ""Taxi Driver"" is celebrated for its innovative storytelling, complex characters, and its exploration of different themes such as loneliness, alienation, and urban decay. This movie has had a significant impact on popular culture and has influenced large number filmmakers and artists over the years. Its enduring relevance and continued critical acclaim firmly establish it as a standout example of classical cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

And all this is done with a very high caliber cast.  No one could have acted out the taxi driver role better than Robert De Niro.  He is simply unbeatable.  Harvey Keitel also shines in this movie as a Puerto Rican pimp, as well as Jodie Foster playing as the child prostitute.

My favourite scene is when he is talking with ""the Wizard"" saying that he ""really wants to do something"" and that he's ""got some bad idea's in his head"". Then you just know that something bad is going to happen.

A Little Piece of Chicken,"Scorsese's nocturnal feverdream of an isolated man essentially becoming radicalised has both a lot to say still and also serves as a vivid time capsule into a broken past. The value in it still is how uncool, awkward and unfiltered it all is - that dated repeating skeezy musical motif, the crumbling buildings and queasy lights. It's deeply greasy, really genuinely unpleasant and endlessly watchable. I did film studies so the potential unreality of the denouement still makes me itchy at the thought of writing essays but Taxi Driver cuts through most doubts and all imitators because what it's muttering to us is so horribly true. After all, we're now living in a world of Bickles.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Scorsese in his element (literally),"When a film's opening scene is of obscure parts of a taxi as its moving ... that's a statement, and a risk.This film is all about details, often mundane, and about character. This is Scorsese in his element, and it shows.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
On its face, the story is both mundane and uninteresting. It's the ""telling"" of the story (indirectly) through choices,
relationships, and observation that set this apart. It's almost like a biography.While it moves along normally, it's the pausing and interactions that gradually brings fruit to bear. What I mean
is that the story evolves carefully, but builds into concrete form from mundane to ""creepy"" as it goes.I think Scorsese was obsessed with gritty urban drama and overt bloody violence. That penchant of his feels
cheap and B level movie-ish at times. But thankfully, he normally doesn't abuse this freedom of expression.I was disappointed by the ending as I thought it sent a grossly inconsistent message.ACTING:
Solid acting across the board, and of course, De Niro kind of plays himself. Like so many (male) actors, his
roles are largely expressions of his own personality. But he played it as only few others could, e.g. Duvall, Bale, etc.There are rare actors that have unusual character range, e.g. Michael Redgrave, Merryl Streep, but the cast here were
filling in the characters with themselves be that Boyle, Shepherd, Keitel, Foster, etc.No one really stood out.TEMPO:
It can feel slow at times, e.g. Watching TV, but then you see the reason why (or maybe not) that scene was drawn out.CINEMATOGRAPHY:
Loved the filming of a very gritty NYC in the 1970's.DIRECTING / WRITING:
Scorsese is an extremely talented director, but his films have a narrow band and the same themes are overplayed.Is it a very good film? Yes.Should you watch this once? Yes, if you don't mind some nastiness.Rating: 8.0.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Classic,The whole time I was watching the movie I was just surprised at how good De Niro's acting was. Easily one of the best acts from any movies I've seen. He does a great role at looking like a psycho but staying composed at the same time. His character feels so real and his body language and face expressions add to it. The whole movie is very entertaining and gives you that vibe that uncomfortable vibe that Robert faces daily.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Ultimate Cowboy movie,"Travis is a nowhere man, an angel with a clear conscience. He feels that the city is a very dirty place and could do with a thorough cleaning up, flushing all the thrash down the toilet. He feels nauseated and can't sleep at night. He wants to do what is right, he wants to do his part. He wants to help others that seem to carry the same impulse but are trapped victims of a modern age throwing its energy in the wrong directions. there is an echoing in this film that makes it clear that you are not the job you are employed to do. Here is a man who stands up and says 'NO' to all the bullshit. Here is......Here is a one man revolution crescendo. He feels he is on a mission. He feels that one must not dedicate his life to morbid self attention. A man waiting for a change, suddenly there is change, he makes it. Many will agree with me that this film is one tight masterpiece. Great chemistry between Director Martin Scorcese and actor Robert De Niro who after this film remained famous until now for his tough quote in the film ""You talking to me? Are You Talking to me?........"" Great script, great direction of photography, great cast and acting, great soundtrack, all very tightly fixed together. Superb direction! In my opinion this is definitely and almost undiscussably Scorcese's greatest of his greatest piece of work. I love how a secretary working in a voting office for a political candidate with another clerk parallels with the relationship between a sedated hooker and her pimps to say the least. This is the stuff that makes Travis feel all the more and more sick and he realizes it. He must do something, he sees these women as angels, good people like himself and he does not want the scum to touch them. As great as the crescendo is in this film, so is the dissolving, the relief at the end parallel to a fizz in his drink earlier in the film, a detail many fail to notice. Every detail has parallels in this film that are very necessary. However, whether you watch this film under a microscope like i did more than once or twice or simply at face value, as a film lover one would not fail to recognize even through its sheer feeling of suspense, that this is a great classic quality movie.

A Classic as dramatic today as it was 46 years ago,"My Review
Martin Scorsese 'S Taxi DriverMy Rating 9/10I rewatched this Classic Scorsese film for the first time in many years after watching a wonderful 2021 documentary titled On Broadway which was about the transformation or Disneyfication of Broadway and Times Square the setting depicted so authenticity in Taxi Driver.Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is a time capsule showing the sleazy sidewalks that were the shopfronts for prostitution and drug trafficking the run down cinemas that showed pornography and the sex shops that taxi driver Travis Bickle played by the brilliant Robert Di Niro frequents after his double shifts .Travis Bickle I think today we would say would be on the spectrum at times seeming rational but with deep dark prejudices and dislike of society in general that causes his delusional thinking.Better movie scholars than I have written thousands of words about this amazing movie but a few new insights did occur to me watching Taxi Driver after so many years.Firstly could this film be made today ?I doubt it very much or if it was remade it couldn't possibly be as authentic and dark.Apart from the locations having to be built as that part of Manhattan has long gone . Another reason is that the other central character of Iris the 12 year old hooker played with such brilliance and conviction by Jodie Foster I doubt would be permissible in this #me too world.If a young woman today was to play Iris a 12 year old runaway on the street with a pimp taking a high percentage of her earnings while she's soliciting I'm sure a 12 year old as Jodie Foster was at the time would have to have an intimacy coach and she would have to be older than 12 years old.I'm a little puzzled and amazed that Jodie Foster's late mother and manager Evelyn Foster who also guided the career of Jodie's brother Buddy Foster would allow her 12 year old to take on this role ?Was she like Gypsy Rose Lee's Mum Rose Hovick who let her young daughter join a burlesque troupe and strip for the same men who frequent to porno houses in Taxi Driver?The other aspect of my reacquaintance with this fine and important movie was my
lack of concern with the violence ?Have I and the general population become so desensitised to the violence that Taxi Driver originally earned its reputation for?It's still there that's for sure but I was more horrified by the arms and ammunition black marketeers who offer Travis Bickle a smorgasbord of deadly weapons to carry out his dark murderous fantasy.In todays world in America anyway the gun lobby laws or lack of them haven't altered much from 1976 when Taxi Driver was released .Any mentally deranged man or woman could still carry out the same assassination attempt that Travis Bickle contemplates in Taxi Driver.The film at the time caused a world wide news incident with John Hinckley Jr.'s attempt on U. S. President Ronald Reagan's life in 1981 which was apparently triggered by Robert De Niro's obsessive character Travis Bickle, and his plot to assassinate a Presidential candidate.Hinkley In a letter sent before the assassination attempt wrote a letter saying his motive in attempting to kill the President was to impress Jodie Foster, whom he'd been stalking after watching her in Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver.Wow ! I wonder what reaction that had on Jodie and her mother Evelyn Foster ?Taxi Driver is great Cinema but it's not an easy watch still all these years later especially knowing this deplorable sex trade in young girls and boys and the street gun violence is still happening today.The other reason why a remake wouldn't work in my view today would be the lack of the great Bernard Herrmann's fabulous score his last in fact it flows through the movie contributing to the suspense and drama without distracting from the action.Cybill Shepherd as Betsy would also be irreplaceable if anyone is contemplating a remake movie or heaven forbid a series.Her role in this movie as Betsy the beautiful and flirty political journalist who becomes the catalyst for Travis Bickle's violence after his rejection is an intrinsic element to this drama.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A masterclass in film!,"For the longest time, I had never seen Taxi Driver. As a film fan, it is a huge disgrace to have never seen it. Now I can say I have and what a film it is. Taxi Driver is a film that has stuck with long after I watched it. Taxi Driver is a weird film. A film that takes it's time to tell it's story. Not only is it a masterclass in how a story should be told however it is also a remarkable character film as well and that is all because of De Niro's iconic performance. From his mannerisms, to his dialogue, everything that he does is incredibly breathtaking to watch and sets the standard for how a character performance should. Also a stand out is Jodie Foster.

A tour de force by the brilliant Martin Scorsese,"Martin Scorsese establishes himself as one of the greatest directors of all time with the movie Taxi Driver. He examines, urban loneliness and despair through the character of Travis Bickle, brilliantly portrayed by Robert Deniro. With direct homage to the classic John Ford western The Searchers, Scorsese traces the events that lead to the release of a young girl being prostituted by a pimp named Sport. Similarly,in The Searchers a character named Ethan, played by John Wayne, is in a desperate search for his niece abducted by an indian named Scar. The main characters in both films are both lonely wanderers and war veterans. Travis's destiny takes a turn after an unsuccessful attempt to establish a relationship with a girl played by Cybill Shepherd. He subsequently purchases several guns, which symbolically represent phallic symbols through which he will ultimately release his suppressed sexuality. In the final segment,when he ultimately confronts Sport, he points the gun at him and says ""suck on this"". Then he proceeds on a bloody rampage to release the young girl, which metaphorically represents a cathartic sexual release for Travis. This scene is absolutely rivetting. The direction and the pacing throughout is impeccable.The mood is greatly enhanced by a superb score by Bernard Hermann. A modern masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A haunting portrayal of loneliness and insanity,Often considered a cornerstone of cinema Taxi Driver left me wanting more. Its not that the movie is bad but perhaps the reputation preceding the product killed it for me. De Niro is in top form as loner Travis Bickle who tries hard to fit in but just cannot. Martin Scorsese has crafted a moody drama film set in his native streets of New York and the cinematography is sublime. It makes you feel uneasy because you are on the level of Travis. Great bit parts from Jodie Foster and Harvey Keital enhance the acting front and a sublime jazz score gives a nice touch. However I feel that the film is a tad overrated,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Grabs you by the balls and refuses to let go.,"It is obvious from the opening scene, that this isn't you usual run of the mill film. A young Robert De Niro, driving around the streets of New York, scoping the streets for scum, with his harsh voice over, expressing his dismay and disgust at all the ""rubbish polluting the streets"", and with the piercing and disturbingly memorable score from Bernard Herrmann, make the opening few minutes of Taxi Driver memorable, and sets the mood perfectly for the next 105 minutes.Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a deeply disturbed insomniac who finds some solace becoming a taxi driver. His already unstable nature is swayed from psychotic to calm during the course of the film. After his newly appointed job as a taxi driver, he witnesses the many harsh realties that plague his city of New York. Working five, sometimes six times a week, and only at nights, he truly sees what a pathetic halt the world has come to. Drug dealers, prostitutes, and pimps line the streets. In an heroic act that can only be admired, he takes a young prostitute under his wing and attempts to get her out of the apparent rut she seems to be stuck in. With a lot of money, but not much to live for, Bickle decides to ""clean"" the street of New York himself. The results is a violent lash-out, which can only be described and brutal and vicious.This unsettling film, from director Martin Scorsese (Raging Bull 1980, Mean Streets 1973), is truly able to connect with its audience, and leaves them with a sour taste, as it should. In a director/actor relationship that is envied by many in the industry, the Scorsese/De Niro team once again bring realism to the screen, which touches upon a sensitive nerve in us all, as well as being visually appealing and dramatically intense. De Niro, gives a stellar performance, perhaps his second best effort to date in the Scorsese/de Niro partnership (the first being Jake Lamotta in Raging Bull). His portrayal of and unhinged Vietnam war veteran is played to precision, as the audience feel as though they are moving with him through his extreme moods. We see the sensitive guy who has fallen in love, the naive boy who takes his new girlfriend to see a porn film, and then we see the obvious anger and hatred towards the world, and the violent actions that follow. Scorsese direction is to be admired. Although he has denied it in many interviews, Scorsese has the ability to connect with his audience. But not in a way that Spielberg or Lucas would. Scorsese is able to put forth a realistic view on the world in which we live. The film is bleak in the point it tries to portray, and its dark settings and meticulously placed lighting creates a world that would really exists. Much like Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"", this film presents to the viewer a shocking reality that many people would prefer not to know about. It is this element however, that is evident throughout many of Scorsese films, and the reason as to why his films have such a huge effect on many people.A brillaint film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The most important American movie of the last 50 years,"This is my favorite movie, absolutely. I never felt so near to a fictitious character before. Travis Bickle is simply the most charming character of movie history: he's not a hero, he's not intelligent nor good looking, nor tragic in the traditional sense of the term, yet no one before him has entered into possession of the screen with such power and naturalness. It's useless to quote particular scenes in a movie which from the beginning to the end carves its name on the rock of history, proclaiming itself as an absolute masterpiece and Robert De Niro as one of the greatest actors of all times, surely the best of the last 25 years. No other movie has pictured so pregnantly the loneliness of a man and of ""the man"", and no other movie has showed better what it means to be sensitive in a cold world of lies. In my opinion, the best American film of the last 50 years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Most Organ-azized Drama Ever,"Taxi Driver is an American drama directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Paul Schrader inspired from 1956 John Ford film 'The Searchers'. The screenplay is crafted so artistically by Paul showcasing a raw, nerve- wrecking and powerful look at depression and solitude. The film has the capability to become an altogether successful venture when the actor-director synergy can make astonishing wonders happen. De Niro and Scorsese happen to be one such example. The collaboration between these two has given us some of the really extravagant films. The movie starts with a Taxi moving in a slow motion as it leaves a foggy smoke behind as credit starts appearing in the cloud of smoke giving a more artistic feel to the beginning of the movie. Travis Bickle an ex-Marine officer suffering from chronic insomnia returns to Manhattan, New York after the Vietnam War. A person having no real life experience in flesh-and-blood human relationships gets alienated in the city of aflame and enthusiastic people. Travis takes up a job as a taxi driver on a night duty travelling around the city watching the night- life and prowlers that rule the streets of NY after nightfall. He is a person who tries to mimic the interactions he sees on the streets and goes horribly wrong, watches dirty movie in a porno theater, falls for a girl working in the Senator Palantine's campaign, takes her for a porn movie making her feel awkward and terribly angry. His small acts highlight his lack of human touch and his unstable mind. The director had pivoted the confused notions of the protagonist successfully as the audience was meant to assume him to be a psycho. Travis in the latter half of the movie, fails in repeated attempts to get his love back and finally makes up his mind to assassinate the Senator only to flaunt his prejudice. After a failed Palantine assassination, Travis freeds himself from frustration as he guns down three men who he holds responsible for corrupting a girl's youth in a brothel to rescue a 12 year old prostitute named Iris in an unsurpassed bloodbath. Scorsese proved himself a creative genius through Taxi driver. Only part remains undisclosed in movie is the reason Iris chose to run away from home only to become a prostitute at an age where she ought to be going to school, giving an uneasy feeling to the viewers. Like all the Scorsese directed films, redemption is the soul of the film. The audience, terrified and overwhelmed by urban crime will readily respond to any film about heroic vigilantism in future.

I think: Best acting performance in the history of the motion picture.,"A role character study like I have never seen in a film before. Excellent and perfect play by Robert De Niro, who completely absorbs himself into the role. Excellent and perfect direction by Martin Scorsese.The supporting actors also do a great job. The camera, the editing, the set design, the music, the costumes, everything fits the mood of the film. A great script, Paul Schrader. You will find film techniques of the absolute master class in this film.You not only feel Travis Bickle's emotions and thoughts. You feel the mood of the time. You feel how chaos reigns, how people want to lead, how they want to encourage, how love is sought as well as lust and desire, how uncertainty and doubt are in the air and coldness and anger. The latter especially at night. Who are the people? A contradiction. When money rules? A city as the main protagonist as well. A city full of extremes. Travis Bickle's transformation is captivating, it sweeps you away, makes you suffer with him, understand him, pray for him and wish for his salvation...I think: The biggest mistake in the Academy's history was not to award this film the best film, best director and best actor.

YOU talking to me? You talking to ME?,"Director Martin Scorsese uses harsh reality and memorable characters to perfection. Robert de Niro plays a slightly deranged Viet Nam vet that drives a NYC cab at night. His insomnia appears relentless and he spends a lot of his time in porno theaters. This lonesome loser does have a heart buried beneath that rough and hardened exterior. Driving his taxi allows him to see through his eyes the underbelly of the city and confirms his contempt for the ""scum"" all around him. So memorable is his working up to date the beautiful Cybil Shepard only to p*ss her off by taking her to a porno flick. Then trying to ""rescue"" a 12-year old runaway turned prostitute(Jodie Foster)and dealing with her sleazy pimp(Harvey Keitel).

An overrater,"The story revolves around a mentally troubled character with a low level of intelligence.

The scenes of him trying to conquer a beautiful woman are very uncomfortable to watch (maybe that's the idea) but at least to me it seemed incongruous with many of the later actions of the protagonist.I give them credit for the images in certain scenes, for the crudeness of the environment in which the plot develops, but at least to me they seemed like simple accessories to an extremely flat story, with very slow attempts at twists that lose effect on the viewer.In short, it is a very overrated work.

Martin Scorsese's Defining Movie!,"Taxi Driver is truly the movie where director Martin Scorsese really comes into his own. 1973's Mean Streets did not really connect with me as it did with other people and 1974's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore was a very entertaining road trip movie but it's not a classic. Now Taxi Driver is absolutely the definition of an instant classic. This film, about a loner with borderline homicidal tendencies, was well-received upon release and to this day, the movie holds up incredibly strong. There are many themes that can be applied to the film which we will get more into later, so this film is one of those rare ones that will challenge you to think; to make your own personal opinions about what is occurring on screen. Paul Schrader's screenplay is well-written and his words are easily brought onto screen with such effectiveness. Then again, I also think Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro helped bring those words to life.So the film focuses basically on one main character. His name is Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) and you might recognize the name because how iconic this character is. Anyhow, Travis Bickle is a Vietnam War veteran suffering from bouts of insomnia. He spends his days in porn movie theaters and his nights driving a taxi around New York City. Essentially, Travis is a man who is socially inadequate and he often thinks about what is wrong with the world-particularly in New York. He generally despises people, but he has a soft spot for Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who works for the office of Senator Charles Palantine, whom he later wants to assassinate. Also important to Travis is helping an eleven-year-old runaway prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster) whom Travis wants to protect from her pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel).So who is Travis Bickle and what does he stand for? I ask this because this movie is all about him and it is effective it getting the audience to sympathize for this character despite possessing qualities of a bad human being. We are told he is a veteran from Vietnam and that he was psychologically affected from the experience overseas. His voice-over in the beginning of the film suggests very strong opinions about people of NYC. As he cruises down the city streets, he talks about the filth of the city. The pimps, the prostitutes, the robbers, etc. He mentions if he had his own way, he would clean up these streets. We also learn that Travis is a man with a quick temper and a violent edge to him. I loved how he pretended to know everything about the political candidate, Senator Palantine just so he can get the girl. My favorite scene (or one of my favorites) is when he drives the Senator himself in a taxi pretending he knows all about his campaign. And I wont do spoilers, but there is a certain connection between Palpatine and the mohawk on Travis's head.This is a film that requires powerful performances if you want to make this a good movie. But with Scorsese at the helm, everyone performs amazingly. Of course, Robert De Niro did an astounding job in making Travis Bickle his own. He performed the character with ease, though this must have been tough on the actor. But I truly believed this character as a loner who is violent and has very strong beliefs. I loved the rapport he had with the young Jodie Foster. Foster began acting at such an early age, and you can see how skilled she is when she holds her own against De Niro and both have strong chemistry with each other. The rest of the cast is rounded by the likes of Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel, and Cybill Shepherd (who is a joy to watch as Betsy).I must say the cinematography and the score are standouts of the film. Michael Chapman filmed mostly at night and the picture has a gritty, real-time feel to it. The score was created by Bernard Herrmann, and this would be his last score before his passing. What a way to end a storied film career! His score yearns for the loneliness of Bickle's heart. The saxophone is synonymous with the empty shell that is Travis Bickle. It's a powerful, though often haunting score.The film does not go without its controversies. The ending was deemed way too violent and Scorsese actually had to de-saturate the color to get an R rating. Though I believe it plays an essential role of the film, I agree the film (especially the ending) is very, very violent. Essentially, the end has Travis going on a murderous rampage against Sport so he could return young Iris to her family. The film is also home to a political assassination, which was set up very well. Though this is a characterization piece, expects lots of violence and blood. In fact, The attempted murderer of Ronald Reagan, John Hinckley Jr. based his assassination attempt off the events in this movie.Taxi Driver, admittedly can be a hard film to watch. Though an iconic character, Travis Bickle is not a pleasant man. But one cannot help but root for him. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I found some interesting interpretations of this character. There are religious and social interpretations. He can be described as ""an avenging angel,"" and I can see that point very well. I loved how Scorsese kept the movie ending up to grabs. In other words, each person may have a different interpretation on what happens in the end. The film wouldn't have worked unless it got excellent acting and powerful directing. And that is what we get. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro pulled off a cinematic gem. Although you might get a little depressed watching at times.

We see gentle-toned music accompany a lack-of-expression De Niro who is incredible in his role as Travis, the smiling facade adds to the pretence that covers the cunning undertone that lies beneath the character, thus justifying his Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.Once the movie does gather speed, it is a thrilling spectacle, the deterioration of a man who viewers are made to believe he will commit the most unforgiving act. Scorsese's intelligent camerawork helps create the constant tension and unnerving suspense, further supported by the inclusion of bad weather and dark nights.Not just regarded as De Niro's best, but one of the best films ever created, 1976's 'Taxi Driver' amassed over $28 million in the Box Office following its release, and even 45 years later, we can see why.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

But if you're often fascinated, as I am, with entering into a different and disturbing psychological mindset and a subculture foreign to you, then Paul Schrader's brutal screenplay, filled as it is with profound self-loathing and anger, as well as an all-consuming sense of boredom and aching loneliness may be just the ticket to both perk your interest and ultimately make you feel a tiny bit better about your own neuroses.

One of the most harrowing and disturbing films ever made- must watch,"Taxi Driver is a milestone. Be it a character study, or a time capsule of the era this film captures the mood and feeling of post-Vietnam America unlike few others. Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle- a lonely war vet, struggling to make sense of a world that gives no respect to him or people of his ilk. The raw emotions and portrayal by the young actor are so good it makes you realize how talented the duo of Scorsese- De Niro is. Jodie Foster is impeccable as the young prostitute and the writing of Paul Shrader keenly exposes the cesspool of 1970s America(New York City to be specific)- one of the best character sketches in all of cinema. The cinematography, as expected from a Scorsese film is very good and the mood of the film is heavily accentuated through the lens.

The combination of Scorsese, along with De Niro's performance make this a great movie.Now with the things I wasn't too fond of. The storyline seems very confusing, and twisty turny. It gets to a point where you're left spinning in circles in confusion. At some points I really wasn't sure what the point of doing this or that was.

The pacing is literally more retarded than the main character.,"In complete opposite mentality of Taxi Driver, no one challenges things anymore. If a movie wins a few Oscars and is labeled as a ""classic"", the title sticks and everyone must bow down to it. If someone challenges this titleeven so much as asks, ""Why is it a classic?""they're ironically turned into a laughable fool by fools laughing. The paradoxical problem with this is that no one can really defend the so-called classics. All you ever hear in the defense of films like Taxi Driver when criticism arises is a list of the film's awards, or a list of the film's critical acclaim, or just, ""It's a classic, so shut up!"" There have been far more original, thought-provoking, well-made movies that never even get the public's attention, much less won overrated Oscars. When people challenge the so-called classics with this fact, the notion is never entertained, and oftentimes foolishly laughed at or stupidly dismissed as childish or immature. With everything I just said as a backbone, I'm about to challenge the ""classic"" Taxi Driver. If you're open-minded you'll give this review a chance. If you have the arrogant mentality of a whiney 4-year-old""It's a classic, that's all there is to it!""then don't even bother reading any further. There is no hope for your immature intellect.First and foremost, Taxi Driver is not a completely worthless film. I'm not even going to try to argue that. It has had had a major influence on the way open-world movies and video games have been made, and possibly even invented the subgenre. Taxi Driver creates a realistic world, fills it with faceless scum characters, and openly lets the main character interact with them in a completely non-linear way. Some people find this completely boring, others find it completely genius. The entire film is hinged on if or if not you can emotionally relate to the main character. If so, these opening scenes of him interacting with his environment will likely captivate you. If not, these scenes will likely put you to sleepevery single time you attempt to watch it. Stating and argument on whether or not Taxi Driver is boring or not is completely pointless because it's completely opinion-based. Personally, however, I was bored out of my godforsaken mind until the last thirty minutes of the film. Movies have presented loneliness much better, in much more effective ways than this. Another 70s film, Straw Dogs, for example, examines realistic human emotion with much more depth.DeNiro's acting is average at best, unless you're really studying so closely it's ridicules. If DeNiro wasn't so famous, no one, not a single review, would even mention his acting whatsoever. The character he plays is also completely average. Some people state that he has mental disabilities; if so, I didn't even notice. He was an average, typical, lonely character and nothing more. The majority of his time on screen he's staring at the walls or staring out his windshieldthat's not psychologically deep, it's typical. There is nothing, not one thing, psychologically deep about the main character. It literally makes me laugh every time I hear people calling the character of Travis ""one of the most accurate psychological characters ever portrayed"". If so, Napoleon Dynamite is the next Freud. Neither Travis nor Napoleon do anything whatsoever except stare at things. And we all can learn so much about the human condition from that.An actual story doesn't even develop until the last thirty minutes of the film. Though it is somewhat nostalgic, it's a pretty typical example of 70s ""shock value"" that is about as shocking to us today as watching a dead tree stump rot. At least it didn't have a cliché, non-graphic rape scene like the hundred other 70s movies just like itI'll give Taxi Driver that credit. The final action scene is PG-13 at worst by today's standards, but it does give some much-needed diversity to the film. In fact, I would go as far as to say that the structure of Taxi driveropen-world, followed by a mini subplotwas a pretty fresh and creative idea for its time. It's almost prolific, considering the thousands of movies and video games that came out after it with the same style. But it's executed terribly here. Travis just repeats the same lines. He never really examines human nature or human behavior. It just gets old fast. The writers could have done so much more with this formula, but their lack of creativity and imagination is absolutely ridicules.Overall, while the formula Taxi Driver follows is essential, the overall film is bland and forgettable. There were so many missed opportunities to bring true depth and insight into the film, but the writers didn't take them. The lack of any story at all gets very annoying very fast, mainly due to the average main character, played with an average performance. But I guess that is the moral of this non-story that all future directors should take note on: meritocracy wins over the imaginationless critics. And spineless viewers agree with every word they say.4/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

God's Lonely Man,"Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" has got to be the most interesting character study I've ever seen.Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a former Marine living in New York City is a depressed loner with almost no friends except for the handful few he makes during his taxi-driving stint. He is also an insomniac who chooses to drive a taxi during nights mostly, because he can't sleep. During the days and during his time off, he spends his time in seedy movie theaters playing pornographic movies.While driving his taxi in the night on the streets of New York City, Travis encounters a wide variety of passengers. In the first half hour he describes his experiences with his passengers and we even get to see one interesting episode with a particular passenger played by none other than the great director of this film himself! All these experiences have left Travis disillusioned about the world as he knows it. He narrates to the audience that there is a lot of ""scum"" and ""filth"" in the streets. He drives around some of the seediest areas of Manhattan during hours when all the sex-workers and hoodlums roam the streets. Travis is still not entirely pessimistic, though, as he narrates in the voice-over: ""Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets."" In the midst of all this filth, Travis gets to meet the beautiful 'Betsy' (Cybill Shepherd) who is a campaign volunteer Senator Charles Palantine, but his joy is short-lived.Things take a different turn during the final hour of the film, which I will surely not spoil here for the viewer.Robert De Niro delivers one of the greatest performances of his career and makes Travis Bickle one of the most memorable on-screen characters. He is an absolute treat to watch, as he practically becomes Travis Bickle and also makes one wonder if this is the same man who played the young Vito Corleone in ""The Godfather Part II"" not very long ago.Of the supporting cast, Harvey Keitel is superb as ""Sport"", the pimp. Jodie Foster makes a strong impression in one of her earliest screen roles as the teenage prostitute, Iris, even though she gets very little screen time. Cybill Shepherd and Peter Boyle both do justice to their roles as Betsy and ""the Wizard"" respectively. Martin Scorsese appears for a short time and shows his ample acting skills in a scene which is perhaps one of the best director cameos ever.Paul Schrader writes a superb script with one of the most interesting characters ever written for the screen. Equally interesting are his bizarre experiences and his eventual extreme reaction to the disturbing reality he has grown sick of seeing around him.Martin Scorsese directs with the kind of finesse that is expected of him. No other film I've seen, visually details the dark underbelly of New York City as effectively as ""Taxi Driver"". The director shows you some of the sleaziest places in the City full of pimps and prostitutes roaming around. Then there are some mean hoods who come out in numbers at night. You are also taken inside a porn theater with very little seating space and shabby looking interiors and projection screen, where Travis spends his spare time.Bernard Herrmann's score, particularly the saxophone in the main title is so mesmerizing, the music combined with the disturbing images in the film refuse to let go and keep echoing in your head long after the film is over.""Taxi Driver"" is a haunting portrayal of ""God's Lonely Man"". It is the kind of film that demands repeated viewings and grows on you. This film is certainly not for everyone, considering it is really character-driven and not plot-driven. People who are looking for mere entertainment are likely to be disappointed. For others, who are lovers of some serious art cinema, ""Taxi Driver"" is a must-watch and a must-own!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Awkward masterpiece,"Taxi Driver is a film that needs more than one viewing...
I was originally drawn to it by a spell of watching 1970's classics, and a recent visit to New York.Upon first watch it seems bizarre, awkward and not that much actually happens.But on rewatch I realised just how well acted DeNiro's part as Travis is.It shows a person's decent into mental issues from being lonely in a vast city full of people, and working long hours to try to stay sane.It's also beautifully directed and shows NYC in a gritty way that depicts the dangerous often unpleasant place it was back then.Great to see a young Cybill Shepherd, but the very young Jodie Foster is involved in a fairly uncomfortable scene.The ending is one of those open to interpretation.I've got my thoughts on it, but no idea if I'm right.If you're aware of what it's about, it's a brilliant film.If you're going in like I was the first time expecting an exciting or funny film you'll be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great character study,"""Taxi Driver"" is one of those films that was slightly overrated, yet I have no cause for complaints.  This is a very impressive character study about the distraught life of a loner who meanders through the streets of New York City.  Travis Bickle came to be one of the most famous fictional characters in movie history.  Almost every one of us can relate to Travis in some sort of way.  And it's great how Scorcese used DeNiro's explicit narration to bring us--literally--into the mind of this relatively harmless loner with unrelenting anger beginning to rise to the surface.  And it's the way DeNiro flawlessly portrayed Bickle, displaying every tiny mannerism, that also gets the audience engaged.  Sure, this is an unpleasant, graphic journey through this virtual hellhole--but that's exactly what it is!  Anyone who's been around the streets of New York City at night--and actually survived!--knows fully well that Scorcese flashes every picturesque detail in our faces to receive a perfect vision of the City That Never Sleeps--which is especially true through the eyes of our protagonist.  Later in the film, we watch as Travis works out streneously and purchases guns, mind clouded with thoughts of murder.  But that violent episode is a demonstration of the anger that pumps through anybody's veins in his situation, only Travis outwardly acted upon those thoughts.  We watch as his love for this young prostitute--played brilliantly by Jodie Foster--blossoms and he will do anything to keep her off the streets and out of the hands of her arrogant pimp.""Taxi Driver"" is an intense, gripping urban drama that draws you in from start to finish.  It's deeply engaging in it's portrayal of blue-collar America.  The characters are so vivid and realistic and multi-dimensional you feel as you've known these people for years.  This movie doesn't have much plot to follow, as it is predominantly character-driven, but it's moving and fast-paced.  Aside from breakthrough performances by DeNiro and Foster, I also have to note Peter Boyle who doesn't have a huge part but is also terrific.  Plus, there's a great cameo by the great Scorcese as a passenger with suspicions of his philandering wife.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Frightening, Powerful","Taxi Driver is one of the best classic movies there is. The film follows the life of a friendless, lonely veteran named Travis Bickle, played by the gorgeous Robert de Niro. He lives in a shabby apartment in New York and decides to be a taxi driver at night because of his insomnia. He gets sick of the filth and scums of New York, and he wants to get rid of them.Here, we also see the 12-year-old Jodie Foster portraying a prostitute named Lily. Travis badly wants to save her from prostitution. Jodie was simply great in this movie.The atmosphere and story are dark. We see, not a glamorous and wonderful New York, but a filthy and dangerous world. The main character is very complex and interesting and De Niro nailed his performance.

"""You talkin to me?""","This is one seriously brilliant film, widely held up as Scorese's best movie and I don't know if I don't agree. Robert De Niro is amazing in this film playing a lonely and disturbed taxi driver who lives a life involving these violent fantasies. He also holds in disgust the state his city is in and begins to feel the need to do something about it. In his head he may be a hero but in reality we see something quite different. The script is superb and builds a mounting sense of tension that this can't end well. I thought on the technical side the film was also very well shot. This has got to be one of the top films of the 1970s, the rest of the cast are also brilliant. I doubt a film this good and controversial could be made today, especially the parts with Jodie Foster but cinema is all the poorer for that fact.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This movie hits me on a whole new level,"When I saw Taxi Driver a few years ago, I didn't know what to think of the movie other than a cab driver with instability and mental issues. Now to revisit this movie later, it all just feels like a modern tragedy.Travis Bickle is a war veteran who looks for a simple job as a taxi driver, since other jobs he feels like he don't belong. Driving strangers around town doesn't help nor hurt his social status but rather take in the scenic and sometimes hostile environment NYC has to offer. Being ""God's loneliest man"" it doesn't seem to bother him much. But as Travis finds love, you can tell the tragic side of him come to play as he foils the first date.I can't really explain how real this movie felt to me. It's a calling to all the people that are deemed socially unaccepted in life, a nobody if you will. And someone like Travis is like a book with no words. You never know when he'll snap or what his motives are. It's like he's here in this world to just waste time knowing that he can't feel fulfilled. He's a man that struggles to find happiness.

Driven mad?,"Ex-marine Travis Bickle takes on a job as a night-time Taxi Driver (he decides to use the nights constructively as he struggles sleeping as he suffers from insomnia). Whilst out and about Travis spots Betsy a political campaigner whom he becomes smitten with. However, the blossoming relationship doesn't last long when the pair disagree on what an appropriate 'date' movie ought to be. This, combined with Bickle discovering an underage prostitute under the control of her pimp sets Bickle on a violent course of redemption...Films which are character studies are among my most favourite type of film (when done correctly) and Taxi Driver, as far as I'm concerned is one of the best. Think what you like about Travis Bickle, but one thing you can't really say about him is that he's uninteresting. One thing that isn't really addressed is why he was discharged from the Marines? He says that he was honourably discharged? Maybe he was or maybe he wasn't? Ordinarily I would criticise a film for doing this with a character as it gives them a lack of depth, but Travis Bickle is such a fascinating character that I think it works in the film's favour to not divulge too much about him. Perhaps PTSD or the horrors of war have had a profound effect on him and have influenced his behaviour? Who knows?.When watching Taxi Driver there's always something bubbling away with Bickle's character; his rants about cleaning the streets of all the filth at the start give a hint as to what will follow later and Bickle continues to up the ante as the narrative progresses. A good move on the part of the filmmaker's with Taxi Driver is to have Bickle narrating his own thoughts which really helps to get inside his head. In contrast to the violence that follows later, Bickle does show another side to his personality in the early portions of the film; his interactions with a couple of women clearly highlight a social awkwardness from Bickle and his inability to interact with women (interestingly it is just women that he seems to have this problem with). This shows a certain fragility and vulnerability about him which again makes him more interesting. It's fair to say that Bickle isn't entirely unlikeable either as he becomes a vigilante of sorts in the final third of the film.What really makes this film work is De Niro; he really brings Bickle to life and the cool and calm way that he carries himself for most of the film makes the violence that follows all the more shocking. Bernard Herrman's score is a beauty as well giving the film an almost haunting quality to it. Scorsese's direction is also masterful and there's something about the majority of the film being set at night that gives it a sort of seedy quality (this is intended as a compliment).If I'm to be super critical then perhaps the only minor blots against Taxi Driver are that it can be a bit slow in spots (mostly in the first half of the picture) and some of the supporting cast could have been used a little better (some of them feature in scenes that don't seem to serve much purpose to the story).Still, minor flaws aside, I still think Taxi Driver is a first rate character study and Bickle's journey is never uninteresting and, even watching it for a second time I can see why so many people hold it with such high regard.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I love it!,"I think this movie is unusually popular. I often see guys quoting it and adding it to their movie collections alongside Goodfellas, The Sopranos, and Entourage, just like I do. Unfortunately, I believe many people like it for the wrong reasons - they're fascinated with the violence, guns, and De Niro. However, to me, this is the ultimate art house movie. It is obscure in its meaning and plot, and the main character has numerous psychological issues. In fact, only the Presidential campaign's staff have no problems. However, I might not be giving these fellows enough recognition. Could it be that they are as lonely as Travis Bickle and that this film offers them a way to release their emotions in a made-up world?Taxi Driver has a difficult job: they must make Travis Bickle, an exceptional and intriguing character, come to life. Similar characters to Travis Bickle are infrequent, but when they do exist (like Christian Bale in American Psycho or Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler), the character is typically more captivating than the movie itself.In the movie Taxi Driver, Travis and the film are intertwined and complement each other in a way that only great movies can achieve. What I find most impressive, and what many fans of this movie can relate to, is our ability to understand Mr. Bickle. We all have the potential to experience the isolation and loneliness that Travis goes through. Paul Schrader, Bobby D, and Scorsese really understood these feelings, and they courageously expressed their own personal struggles in a vulnerable yet artistic way. I have great respect for them because they pursued their vision with unwavering commitment in a collaborative film project that explores complex and intimate concepts and emotions. This is Scorsese's most intense movie yet, and that's saying something. It's straightforward to analyze and appreciate. The movie's cinematography inspires awe, the music stirs the soul, and experts are still analyzing the film's editing and camera techniques. This is a magnificent piece of art that these filmmakers were destined to create.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Driver,"Loneliness makes a man hooked, my friend. In loneliness, thoughts become deeper and darker. Have you ever felt like you couldn't find anything to do and said, ""What am I going to do now?"" What a bad feeling. One mouse passes through your head. Oh, and insomnia. What did he say in Fight Club? 'When you have insomnia, everything seems to be far away. Everything is the image of the image of the image. One day, when Travis was having insomnia, he told himself to stop. He said, ""Let me at least get a job at midnight and earn money.""

Otherwise, it's not even possible for him to go crazy. And as he sees the nightlife of the city, he is increasingly motivated to do something different. And at that moment he experiences a personality transformation. You can call this psychopathy, but the man's mind works like poison. Maybe many people in that city are experiencing Taravis' thoughts. But since they don't have as much courage as Travis, they continue their depressed lives. Rather, they are putting themselves under pressure. There is a lot they can learn about destiny if they allow change. Let me tell you something? I think you should just grab a pen and paper and watch the movie. Every word Travis writes in his diary is a lesson. I drank 6 beers (alcohol is harmful to health) while watching the movie. And until now, my friend, I have never seen a movie that reflects human psychology so well. A small footnote; It is an interesting coincidence that Bernard Herman, who composed the music for the film, died on the same day he completed the score.

Taxi Driver VS. Chinatown,"I just ended to see Taxi Driver, I just say that is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, is an excellent portraying of that filthy, unsocially, vicious and decreased part of New York, with characters that used to live there and that are creating mean business, that we don't want to see, not only there, but also in my city, in fact, some of the society is identical to the poor parts of Colombia, especially when the black threw thinks to Travis and the taxi. Very psychological and suspenseful, Taxi Driver is not only a film classic, is New York. The second movie I saw form Scorsese (The first only was Gangs of New York, also a classic for me), and the first when De Niro was starting his long-living career, and Jodie Foster as well: Their performances were accurate and also their situations and conflicts. For the other hand Chinatown, directed by Roman Polanski, starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, is the representative of film noir, descendant of The Maltese Falcon and Rebecca. Jake Gittes was that detective that is unhappy with the world, anyway, somehow, I saw that the screenplay was perfect: No mistake, creative and hard-boiling. Perhaps Robert Towne could be a writer for a lot of prizes. When I saw Faye Dunaway, I expected no less: She act like that femme fatale, but she doesn't begin as that, but she evolves into becoming a femme fatale, thanks of that father, daughter, sister and husband. The society of 1930s, portraying in Chinatown, was very perfect: It contains tha social life, tha customs and everything. ¡¡I expected less from that part, I deserved my surprise!! Corrupt politicians, infidel wives, lovers, criminals and anti-semitic. Perhaps many people, that already saw the movie, would say ""The romantic part was incomplete: It needed to be more influential inside"", or something like that, however I think different: The Film Noir contains un-sentimental love and promiscuity, and the part of love was that: It contained everything I read about the genre. Indeed Chinatown is another classic masterpiece, directed by another living legend: Roman Polanski Taxi Driver is film noir too. And is that society the one that expresses each one of the elements of film noir, and historical if we think about Vietnam War, speaking about Travis Bickle. For the other hand, it doesn't need too much for understand his mind: He hates his world, he feels he's better than anyone of them, and he thinks he is some think of hero, trying to save society form itself: He's totally insane. I recognize I'm not very specific with some elements of these two movies, but I prefer to bring you a synopsis about what you are about to find out rather than explain you the details. And i'm not a professional film critic anyway.But I can say one critic: Academy Award should, at least, nominate this movie for more than just four Academy Award. ¡Screw them, for that and for ignoring Scorsese, especially with Raging Bull and Goodfellas! Remember the words for Mark Caldwell: They involve the AFI, but I would replace them for ""Oscars"": Thank you Scorsese. De Niro don't worry yourself about the AFI, their just a bunch of pompous elitist f**k'sWhen you go to videostore, look for these two movies, watch them and ask yourself: ¿Which one can be the Absolute Film Noir of 1970s? ¿Taxi Driver or Chinatown?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A dark character study,"I won't hide from the fact that Taxi Driver is one of my all time favourite films. This was my opinion before this re-watch and I was a little hesitant to watch it due to this.Travis (De Niro) explores his way through a decaying New York city, who obsesses watching a destructive society around him. This character study of a lonely and desperate man justifying his own actions through the downfall of the city truly brings out one of Robert De Niro's greatest performances. High praise indeed. There's likely never been such a mature performance by an actress aged 14 as Jodie Foster displays here (let me know in the comments) albeit, it's certainly not a role a 14 year old would be expected to do in today's age.""You talking to me"" is an iconic line of cinema provided by it's screenwriter Paul Schrader this is still widely recognised almost 50 years later. Schrader's script matched with Bernard Hermman's intense yet calming score and added with Michael Chapman's cinematography enables the viewer to become entranced with Travis's actions, rightfully or wrongly. All of this without mentioning Martin Scorsese who manages to bring all of this together.There is likely only one other film that he will later make in his career that could match Taxi Driver. It's cold portrayal of a character who wrestles with his mental health facing the challenges of it's upcoming world.

"Scorsese, Schrader, and De Niro combine to deliver a masterpiece","In Taxi Driver Scorsese gives us a deep character study of a lonely man, ""God's lonely man"" if we're to believe our narrator Travis Bickle (De Niro). Travis is a Vietnam veteran who takes a job as a taxi driver at night in New York because he can't sleep. He cruises around New York looking for a fare and constantly finds himself drawn to the seediest parts of the city, despite his hatred of everything these places stand for and the people who live and make their living there. Right from the start we have an idea of where Travis is going from when his cab emerges from the white smoke of hellfire. Not literally of course but there is plenty of similar imagery throughout from the overhead view of the guns that the dealer lays out on the bed like a priest looking down at the altar to when Travis holds his clenched fist above the gas fire stove. Like all of Scorsese's greatest films Taxi Driver is imbued with ideas of religion and guilt.There is little plot to this film but that is unimportant, real life has no plot. Taxi Driver is about character and the character of Travis Bickle is so frighteningly real that he is captivating throughout. This is a man who fails to connect with those around him on almost any level, his date with the beautiful, idyllic, Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) goes disastrously wrong and there is even a lack of camaraderie between him and his fellow taxi drivers who are the closest thing he has to friends. And yet Scorsese makes him fascinating to watch, of course De Niro is great here and how he manages to get us to empathise with Travis is no small feat.This is a film that I could watch again and again, and I surely will, it is a classic. The way Scorsese shoots the film, New York has never looked so gritty and Herrmann's accompanying score is fantastic, the only shame being that this was his final work.

"Well-Made Film, Though Not Sure It Stands Time For Me","A taxi driver (Robert DeNiro) grows sick of the filth he sees in society, or at least New York. Attracted to a political campaign volunteer (Cybil Shepherd), he tries to find some redeeming qualities in life... but his brief hope in politics is dashed and he realizes the only way to clean up New York is with his own hands.I am unsure how I feel about ""Taxi Driver"". I liked it. Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro are a great team, and the gritty violence of this film really is portrayed in a way that captures the viewer in a death grip. Jodie Foster is amazing, especially considering her age, and the historical place this movie has (given the Reagan shooting and all) makes it timeless regardless of the film's merits.But it has its flaws. The film quality is grainy (though, as i say, this adds to the gritty feeling). Harvey Keitel, despite being a great actor, is in the wrong role. And compared to some of Scorsese's other work, this doesn't come across to me as some of his better material. His more recent contributions -- ""The Departed"" and ""Gangs of New York"", for example -- are vastly superior in pretty much every way. While ""Taxi Driver"" is not a bad film, it is easily overshadowed by the other Scorsese offerings.If you haven't seen it, I would recommend you do. If for no other reason than giving Scorsese a fair chance, this is worth checking out.

"Profoundly disturbing but brilliant tale of urban isolation, obsession, and rage","Arguably Martin Scorsese's best film, writer Paul Schrader's best screenplay, and actor Robert De Niro's best performance. De Niro plays unstable Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle who the film follows down his rabbit hole of isolation, obsession, and eventual violent rage. The plot, as it is, has Bickle working nights as a NYC cab driver, becoming infatuated with pretty campaign worker, Cybill Shepherd, but when he sours that relationship due to his weird behavior, he becomes obsessed with saving pre-teen hooker Jodie Foster from her slimy pimp, Harvey Keitel. The plot could easily have become a simple Charles Bronson/grindhouse tale of urban vigilantism, but it's much more than that. Much has been written about ""Taxi Driver"" in terms of urban decay, isolation, desire, sex, misogyny, and as a critique of the media, all by others more eloquent than me, so I won't even try, but I will say that on a visceral level, the film is a ferociously disturbing piece of filmmaking. The audience is slowly drawn closer and closer to Bickle's madness, in a similar way to ""Repulsion"" or ""Peeping Tom."". The audience almost understands and sympathizes with his where his thinking is coming from and are found rooting for him against the even more despicable of characters during the film's disturbing finale. Scorsese has presented a New York City that truly is a brutal urban nightmare, but at the same time has created surreal hallucinatory vision of NYC that may only be Bickle's perception of reality. Also of note, the film features memorable performances by Victor Argo, Peter Boyle, and Albert Brooks. Additionally, this was the final film scored by Bernard Herrmann and he delivers a memorably unrelenting and oppressive score that ranks among his finest. Overall, ""Taxi Driver"" is one of the finest pieces of cinema ever committed to celluloid, though due to it's profoundly disturbing nature will likely deny the film wide appeal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

He falls for a woman named Betsy, but their relationship ends badly. He tries to become physically stronger and more intimidating by working out and using all sorts of weapons. He comes across an underage prostitute named Iris. He decides to free her from her pimp. This is a movie where there's a lot going on, but it's still easy to pay attention to, which is always a plus.Leonard Maltin shockingly only gave this film two out of four stars, complaining that it was too violent. Honestly, it's not really violent until the climax. What matters is how unbelievably 70's this movie is. It works so well as a time capsule, making you reflect on pop culture at that time. This film became infamous because it allegedly inspired Ronald Reagan's failed assassin, who wanted to impress Jodie Foster. Ironic seeing as how the film itself features a failed assassination, but no one is wounded. ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Dark look at 1970s New York City.,"I was able to watch this on BluRay from my public library. Being one of the more famous movies, there isn't much to say regarding ""review"" comments. The disc has a number of extras, some over an hour long, so any big fan of this movie should view the BluRay version, it will entertain you for a long time.Famously Robert De Niro played the off-kilter cab driver, Travis Bickle. As an example of his inability to understand 'norms' on his first date with an attractive campaign worker he took her to a theater showing porn movies. To him that was just normal. She walked out and he followed her.Jodie Foster famously plays a street prostitute, she says she is 12 1/2 years old. In fact during filming in 1975 Foster had not yet turned 13.This is a well-made movie for the times, mostly with very dark themes.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"One of the best character progressions ever written on screen, though the movie itself being slightly disappointing","""Taxi Driver"" is a good movie, it's nothing phenomenal, but it's good. Like Martin Scorsese's movies usually it is also over-hyped, or at least that's what I think. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but the rating of 8.5 at IMDb is probably a bit too much, it is not that great. The movie tells a story about Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who works as a taxi driver at nights. He is constantly disturbed by the life around him and that gets him mentally unstable. He thinks the streets of New York City are full of trash and by that he is referring to people, and all the injustice and corruption the world around him has. Bickle doesn't have any real friends and he starts to question his own existence, he is lonely and a complete outsider to everyone, failing to make any emotional contact with anyone. The film follows Travis's story's progress from attempts to desperation and it deals with mental issues along with the search of love and happiness.The best thing this movie has to offer is Robert De Niro, who does an amazing role performance in the role of Travis Bickle. The character itself is very well written as well, so De Niro only had to translate the character on to the screen and he managed that pretty flawlessly. The whole progress of the character is just brilliantly acted out, all the facial expressions and the whole body language changes along the progress in a fantastic way and De Niro makes one of the best role performances he has done this far. It was also pretty interesting to see De Niro in such a ""young"" age, as he was magnificent back then as well, even he actually was 33 years old when the movie was made. The story focuses completely on Travis and there aren't much scenes where he wouldn't be, although there are supporting actors/actresses along the way. The one in the most supporting role is Jodie Foster, who in the age of 14 plays a child prostitute. I was very surprised how good actress she was even back then, in the age of 14! She is so real and performs the role of Iris superbly, I just can't believe she was only 14. Two small parts are played by the legends Peter Boyle (god bless the man) and Harvey Keitel, Boyle in the role ""Wizard"", another taxi driver in New York City who gives advice to Travis and Keitel in the role of ""Sport"", a pimp in New York City who for example sells Iris for money and who Travis just can't stand.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie is definitely recognizable as his, as it certainly has that Scorsese touch in it, though I think it is darker than Martin's movies usually. Scorsese always seems to describe violence in a very violent way and he doesn't hide the truth, though sometimes a fictional truth, behind the true violence and other disturbing images. This movie is all in all very disturbing and like Scorsese's movies usually it's also pretty heavy, so the weak minded viewers won't be enjoying it and watching it all the way through. The heaviness is also caused by that slight dullness the movie starts to have after the first hour and it seems like stretched, you keep on watching these irrelevant scenes which don't even matter so much in the end and the movie sadly loses its flow. It does get better towards the end, but there's just this one part of the movie where it seems to stumble a little bit. Maybe I'm being too harsh, so don't slay me because of that, but after all that is just my opinion. The screenplay is pretty much only the building of the main character, the movie is after all a story about Travis Bickle and no-one else. Despite the fact of the screenplay being almost nothing else than the story about the character it still manages to have surprisingly much depth in the plot, which is a very nice thing, as it also drops the heaviness level a little bit.""Taxi Driver"" offers you a disturbing, yet psychologically clever experience, not forgetting the intelligence it has inside it. Robert De Niro is undeniably the best thing the movie has to offer, so I'm recommending the movie for everyone who is seeking a movie with an astonishing role performance. Like mentioned before this movie isn't for the weak minded, but if you still want to see it then it's your decision and you have been warned. ""Taxi Driver"" is partly all in all interesting, above decent without a doubt and it could be described as an artistic rather than an ordinary movie. So for those who are in search of a light and an easy movie for the Friday evening to watch with a girlfriend, then this isn't for you. It requires concentration and nerves, thinking and collecting pieces of the puzzle afterwards. It's not a phenomenal one, but it's definitely a good one. If all this still doesn't satisfy you, then for god sakes please watch it just because of the experience of seeing the hilarious long dark curly hair Harvey Keitel has in it. Marvellous.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Truly Mysterious Noir,"This truly mysterious film is not about a city but about the endurance of Travis' soul, and out of all New York he pegs only those details that sustain and bolster his fixations. He is an ex- Marine, Vietnam vet, composer of conscientious anniversary letters to his parents, taxi driver, killer. The movie seldom digresses terribly far off from the exclusive, deeply abstract manner in which he views the city and lets it traumatize him.It's a place, first of all, occupied by women he cannot have: unapproachable blonde women who might find him attractive for a second, who might join him for coffee, but who ultimately will have to shake their heads and sigh, ""Oh, Travis!"" because they find him odd. And then, even more inhumanly, the city seems colonized by men who can have these women, men ranging from clowning political hacks to street-corner pimps who, all the same, have in common the mystical aptitude to address a woman without getting everything wrong.Travis Bickle is an old-fashioned romantic at heart, but he settles for the lowest common denominator of diversion when he can't sleep because of how small his sociopathic mind is. He follows no political issues, music, movies, not much except his job. He could on paper look for fares anywhere in the city, but he's invariably carried back to 42nd Street, to Times Square and the whores, street freaks, and porno houses. It's here that an ugly kind of sex comes closest to the external, the sex of buying, selling, and using people. Travis isn't into that, he hates it, but Times Square nurtures his rage. His sexual frustration is focalized into a loathing for the dregs he consumingly scrutinizes. He tries to violate the repetition.There is a masterfully melancholy scene so painful that camera pans away into a doorway. It's as if we can't stand to watch Travis feel the grief of being rejected. This is fascinating, because later, when Travis goes on a murder spree, the camera goes so far as to assume slow motion so we can see every nuance of the violence.That Scorsese finds the rejection more disturbing than the murders is compelling, because it helps to clarify Travis Bickle, and maybe it goes to some degree toward defining one variation of urban violence. Travis has been ostracized so methodically, so frequently, from a piece of the action that ultimately he has to hit back in some such way.Scorsese's distinctive noir doesn't disclose more than a decent fraction of what we want to know, even through the narration of Travis himself keeping a diary, because his diary is given in present-tense. We're not told where Travis comes from, what his particular issues are, because this isn't an investigation, but a vignette of some days in his life. We don't know the niceties of Travis's abstractions, but in an eerie sense we know what we need to know of him. The film's a masterpiece of evocative character study. Scorsese's techniques sorts out fine points that suggest feelings, and that's the result he wants. The performances are both strange and realistic: He goes for moments from his actors, rather than slowly developed characters. It's as if the required emotions were written in the margins of their scripts: Give me anger, fear, dread.Robert De Niro, as Travis Bickle, evokes despondency, agitation and passion while totally maintaining mystique, and in many of his close-ups, Scorsese employs slow motion virtually below the threshold of our consciousness to prolong the foreshadowing and manifestation. Cybill Shepherd, as the blonde beauty, is an iceberg languidly retreating into sympathy. And there's Jodie Foster, shockingly cast as a twelve-year-old prostitute whom Travis wants to ""save."" Harvey Keitel, a veteran of Scorsese's earliest work, is the pimp who manipulates her, and he evokes the sure brand of severity that's all subterfuge.These people are introduced essentially in very brief moments, like smoky shadows forebode to utterly eclipse them. This cinematic shard of steel, to which John Hinckley's subsequent actions were frankly a testament, is a hell, saturated in Bernard Herrmann's fluidly disillusioned score, from the opening shot of a cab emanating from dark, gloomy veils of apparent overcast to the climactic killing scene in which the camera ultimately looks straight down.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This movie has one of the longest run ups of any story.,"The problem is one of two things: either the first half of the film is meant as a setup for the 2nd half, in which case that is way too long, or the first half of the film is actually meant to be an active participant, in which case it fails. it has a cohesive structure. It has events. It has characters. It has music. But what is the point? Oftentimes it seems there isn't one and it takes a long time for something meaty to arrive. And even the movie's ending is not a full stop.The film consists of a series of events in the life of a cab driver. Unfortunately, a lot of them are not interesting, even though on paper they should be. Scenes with little content last a good long while and then end in some awkward situation because the main character is mentally and socially unstable. Those scenes are reminiscent of movies like the Midnight Cowboy, an Oscar-awarded movie I would rather go to a dentist than watch.The film shows the various dirt you see in a city at night, but you can probably see it better yourself if you hang around the streets or watch a documentary. There are a few situations that are interesting, but every time they are followed up by a long nothing. If the long pauses are meant to create tension or accentuate the descent into madness, they fail, creating awkwardness instead. It would appear that the director asks the viewer to do the work and fill in a lot of the blanks instead of doing the effort himself and putting in the sufficient energy.As Taxi Driver enters its 2nd half, the cerebral content and the tension start seeping in and it gets more and more interesting, but you have to wait almost an hour to arrive at this point. It takes TWO THIRDS of the movie before Jodie Foster's character shows up. The pay-off in the 2nd half of the film feels worth it and the movie makes sense in the end, but it requires a ton of patience from the viewer. It is like a good joke that takes an hour to get to the punch line.The acting is good as you would expect from Robbert De Niro, but it is also appropriate for the role, which means it is subdued and realistic to the point of boredom. Again, as with the story, there are good moments, most of them in the second half. The camera-work is simple but also brilliant in its simplicity. When the camera movies, there is a real sense of purpose and weight.The ending is an interesting choice. Without spoiling too much, the problem is that mental sickness doesn't just end with a happy ending, so it is strange to see a rather positive open ending.Bottom line, this is not a movie for me, but the quality is there if you have the patience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Does for the people what he can't do for himself,"Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver bleeds with style and substance, and features Robert De Niro in, quite possibly, his best performance. He immerses himself in the role of Travis Bickle, an honorably discharged Vietnam Marine who is an extreme loner, basking in his sorrow, despair, and utterly melancholy woe. He gets a job as a night time cab driver that will hopefully control his insomnia, and maybe give him a purpose in life. He claims early on that while other cabbies refuse to pick up some people, like prostitutes and blacks, he doesn't care who you are. He'll get you where you want to be. If only he could do the same for himself.Early on, Bickle falls in lust with a political campaign volunteer named Betsy (Shepherd), he has been closely watching, but not stalking. He sees Betsy is crying out for purpose and love, and doesn't feel comfortable behind a desk on the phone every day, supporting some politician who probably wouldn't do the same for her. On top of vaguely balancing a respectable relationship, near the end of the film, he tries to save Iris, played by a very young Jodie Foster, a teenager involved in explicit prostitution, treated like meat by her despicable pimp and the rest of society.To me, Taxi Driver plays like an earlier version of the underrated Michael Douglas film Falling Down. Both films involve heartbroken loners, not only contemplating their purpose in society, but are also disgusted with the arrogance and mean-spirit that plagues the world. The blatant carelessness of the well being of other people. Both De Niro and Douglas give career worthy performances, but Douglas played more of a character going over the edge, while De Niro's character strives more on subtleties.There has been a looming debate on the film to whether or not the character of Travis Bickle is good or evil. This debate can go on for hours, because the film provides enough evidence for both sides of the argument. One could say Travis is good because he eventually sees society as a corrupt, evil place that acts on impulse and favors arrogance over honesty, and decides to take action, and one could say that Travis is an evil character because he ignores countless instances in the world and commits crime by eliminating it. I believe he is a good protagonist, with some flaws, just like many human beings. Either way, he makes for a very interesting and intriguing character in a film.Let's talk about the smaller additions that make the film into the work of art it is. For one, the writing, by Paul Schrader who would later work with Director Martin Scorsese on The Last Temptation of Christ and Raging Bull. Schrader's polished and commendable writing is not only sly on the themes, but definitely makes the film warrant multiple viewings. Just by seeing it once, I can tell it probably won't be my last. It seems Taxi Driver has layers that will gradually be peeled off one by one with each of the following viewings, and I can see this evolving into a film that seemed pretty upfront upon the first viewing but becoming more complex later on.The cinematography is award-worthy. Who would've thought Scorsese's next step would be a black and white film? The colors are vibrant, as well as the atmosphere, being very seamy, expressive, but also very ominous and eerie, especially in the night shots. Some scenes even allow us to experience them in detail with classical music nicely placed in the background. Some actually take place in Bickle's cab as we cruise down the street and are met with shots of the sidewalks, evoking prostitutes, pimps, and street-walkers all with a sort of sympathy and vague understanding of their hardships. It seems Scorsese wanted to breed life into those that seem like they have none, and that's where the picture comes off as wonderful. At the time, we were rarely shown the lower-end of the food chain, and now, there is a film resting on that end, wishing it would be in a higher, more respectable position, but continues to find that wish elusive and imaginary.Am I still coherently here, or have I lost you? Let's just end this way; Taxi Driver is a fantastic blend of urban isolation and alienation and is successful at providing humanistic characteristics to those who seemingly are void of any. The film is beautifully located even in its seamiest moments, elegantly written, and carefully directed, as Scorsese breaks new ground with this dark, very deep psychological thriller that may have you resorting to something happier afterwards. The man does it again.Starring: Robert De Niro, Cybill Shepherd, Albert Brooks, and Harvey Keitel. Directed by: Martin Scorsese.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"An existential reflection of anguish and loneliness, and character study, starting to function as a haunting psychological journey of a disturbed man towards total collapse","""Taxi Driver"" was conceived by screenwriter Paul Schrader as an existential reflection on his own anguish and loneliness; throughout production, however, Martin Scorsese's approach and that of his star, Robert De Niro, expanded the narrative as both thematic discussion and character study, starting to function as a haunting psychological journey of a disturbed man towards total collapse. Racist, sexist and spiteful, Travis (De Niro) sees the world as an observer from another planet, facing everything with a misunderstanding that soon turns to fear and, consequently, hatred. Presenting himself as an uncomfortable figure from his first few seconds on screen, Travis seeks a job at the taxi company due to his chronic insomnia, identifies himself as a Vietnam veteran (which probably explains the huge scar on his back) and does an awkward joke with the supervisor he just met, accompanied by an unnatural laugh. And if there was any doubt about the broad significance of the film's foreground, Scorsese eliminates it here by using Herrmann's somber score to accompany the protagonist's entry into the company's office - and, no wonder, he seems to bring the same smoke with him. Lugubrious that we had seen seconds before.This haze, in a way, can also be seen as a symbol of the subject's mental state, clouding his perception and contributing to his feeling increasingly isolated. It is revealing, for example, how Travis studies with an almost fascination the interaction of men and women on the streets of New York, as if trying to understand how flirting - or simple socializing - can sound so simple for others and so complicated for him. Traveling through the dirty streets of New York in the 1970s, when Times Square, now a tourist center, was a point of sale for drugs, prostitution and crime (as seen in Lost in the Night, for example), Bickle sounds like someone at the same time horrified and dazzled by what he sees. On the one hand, his revulsion is clear (""All animals come out at night""); on the other hand, he can barely look away, feeling himself being observed in return (which Scorsese demonstrates again through subjective shots and slow motion that evokes how time seems to slow down when the protagonist surrenders to his rabid paranoia). Incidentally, the filmmaker rarely allows us to depart from Travis' point of view, whose ramblings and ""philosophies"" are also punctuated by the narration of the letters and diaries he writes.It is a brilliant narrative exercise, by the way, since our tendency would be to run in the opposite direction to that of the character - and if sometimes the film can even seem racist to a contemporary spectator, more attentive to the way minorities are portrayed by the media, the fact is that ""Taxi Driver"" merely spells out how Travis sees everything. At one point, for example, it is not surprising to note that he points a gun at the TV precisely when a black man is found dancing with a white woman on the screen, and similarly curious to see how his self-established ethnic superiority is reinforced. Due to the fact that Sport (a pimp played by Harvey Keitel) adopts, with his scarves, with a feather attached to his hat and with long hair, a style that refers to indigenous culture, even calling Bickle a ""cowboy"". Well, if there is anyone who would see John Wayne as a hero and the Indians as barbarians who deserve death, it would be Travis Bickle.But this myopic view of the anti-hero played by De Niro also applies to women, who are basically divided between ""saints"" and ""wh*res"". When he is enchanted by Betsy (Shepherd), for example, he immediately says that she ""appeared like an angel"" - and, once again following the visual logic of reproducing the protagonist's gaze, Scorsese presents her in a seductive slow motion and wearing white (by the way, the director appears in this scene, sitting on a wall). Later, when deciding to invest his heroism in the young prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster, already fantastic at 12 years old), whom he decides to ""rescue"", the subject expresses his disgust with the usual clumsy and uncomfortable vocabulary when he says ""You sell your as***le for nothing?"" - using the diminutive as an unbelievable way of trying to highlight the girl's young age and delicacy (as if she didn't already look childish enough with her breakfast, which involves a sandwich stuffed with jam and sugar).Travis' awkwardness in dealing with sex, it is worth noting, is a direct result of the moral conservatism with which he views the subject and which again leads him to act with a mixture of attraction and disgust: if he has the habit of going to cinemas that show pornographic (and which basically function as a space for public masturbation), he also regards what is projected on the screen with patent revulsion. Incidentally, his sexual dysfunction is revealed in a revealing way also through his actions when he becomes enchanted by Betsy, when he starts to observe her like a stalker while she works (here, his spectator expression - with the right to a soda - is much more pleasant) , fleeing in panic when confronted by the girl's colleague, Tom (a character that Albert Brooks makes much more striking than expected). ""Loneliness has always followed me"", laments Travis, not realizing that it is self-imposed. His tragedy, however, lies directly in his inability to forge connections with those around him - something we witness, for example, when he tries to flirt with the clerk at the porn cinema (Abbott, De Niro's girlfriend at the time) and, rebuffed and humiliated, he buys several items from the bonbonniere to try to lose his embarrassment. Likewise, it is not out of malice that he takes Betsy to watch a pornographic film on their first formal date; misanthropic by nature, he just repeats with her the routine he adopts when alone. His intentions with the two women, however, are clear-and it is no coincidence that Charlie Rosen's art direction conceives the shop and the campaign HQ, spaces they occupy, as environments filled with red.The result of Betsy's (understandable) rejection can be seen immediately afterwards, when none other than the director of the feature enters Bickle's car and reveals that he is watching his wife, who is with her lover, a black man - matching, this time shape, the sexism and racism of the character into a complete package of hate. So, after hearing the passenger say that he will use a Magnum .44 revolver to kill the woman (but - of course - not the man), Travis decides to buy a gun exactly like that one, testing the scope of other possible acquisitions by pointing it towards some women who are in front of the apartment. The psychological symbolism of that particular weapon is, of course, not the most subtle: the phallic aspect of the Magnum, with its long barrel, is a compensation for its owner's impotence and his feeling of inadequacy in the face of the opposite sex - and notice how he holds the revolver while pointing at the TV while it is showing (attention) a scene that shows a woman breaking up with a man to be with another.Even at this point, however, the subject doesn't know exactly what he intends to do, only that he has to do something (""I have some bad ideas in my head"", he confesses to a colleague, unable to formulate his impulses better). What matters, for him to make his fantasy come true, is having an ""enemy"" to defeat in his ""cause"" - and that's why, after initially identifying Senator Palantine (Harris) as a nemesis, he often appears with his face hidden (after all, your identity doesn't matter) or assuming a grandiose posture that even emulates that of the statue in the center of Columbus Circle. Failing even in the mission inspired by his fantasy, which would return him to the prison of his tiny, crowded apartment with oppressive bars on the window, Travis then decides to direct his hatred towards a less ambitious opponent and, consequently, easier to defeat: the pimp Sport and his associates, resulting in the massacre that Scorsese conducts in a violent and graphic way at the climax of the projection, slightly softening the impact that could be caused by changing, through color correction, the tone of the blood that gushes through the corridors of the building.The meaning of Travis's actions, on the other hand, could not be clearer: like so many other men, the boy blames women and black people for his personality disorders and, above all, for his failures as an individual. When he vents that ""(the women) are like a union"", what he means without realizing it is that these, who ""should"" be subjugated to the employers (read: the male sex), are now in subordinating themselves as employees demanding their rights. This is a classic attitude, almost standard, since racism, misogyny and homophobia - hatred for any minority, in general - are nothing more than manifestations of insecurity, fear and frustration, since it is simpler blaming the other for their own failures than recognizing that they are due only to themselves. (And Bickle is such a failure that he can't even kill himself at the end of his ""mission"".)The ironic thing is that, even accidentally, the carnage ends up fulfilling its purpose and bringing some sense of accomplishment to the protagonist. Men like Travis Bickle, however, are never complete - and, thus, it is inevitable that little by little his impotent white male rage will come out again, which Scorsese indicates, in the final seconds, by including a jump in the image that highlights the insanity that gets closer, the gradual change in atmosphere of Bernard Herrmann's music during the closing credits (which becomes unsettling) and, not least, the once again red, menacing reflection of Travis's eyes in the rearview mirror.

Technically polished but ultimately a very ugly film,"I have this problem with a lot of Scorsese films but Taxi Driver is a thoughtful exploration of how a damaged psyche coupled with the Vietnam era violence, just below the surface, of the system, results in self destructive behavior. It deals with how media, capital and the disillusionment with America leads to isolation and alienation, especially for young white men of that time period. And how media narratives reduce such damaged people down to tropes which are often wrong. I see the cinematic influences of the French New Waver-i.e. jump cuts-and the legacy of cinema's past-i.e. this is a twisted noir take on the Searchers-that make the film pop cinematically. And De Niro's performance is extremely well considered. But for all that I simply don't care. I don't care how the techniques are used. And I don't care about the thoughtful exploration. At the end of the day Travis Bickle is the worse of us and while the film does not celebrate him per se I don't find much beauty or sublimity in exploring such figures.The film is ugly. I don't mean the film is displeasing to the eye, because it largely isn't. (And the sections that are are intentionally displeasing) I don't mean the film is morally abhorrent or treats its subject in a ethically comprised way. I mean at the end of the day this is more a thesis on a certain set of intellectual concerns than an emotive piece of art. It is not an experience. The film is fundamentally malformed as a piece of cinema. This may be a film lover's film but it is not what films are for. I want to be as clear as possible. The film's subject matter is not the issue-MIdnight Cowboy is a very beautiful film that explores related material from roughly the same time period-it is the manner in which Scorsese as intellectualized the material coupled with the darker themes that is the turnoff. This is technically brilliant film making put into service for the worse the cinema has to offer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
one of the biggest trash of all time,"Well there are few movies that you regret ever watching them and certainly taxi driver will be one of them to me. I was ""forced"" to watch this movie due to its fame, the caste and a excellent trailer shown in AXN ( where I watched the movie eventually ). I was shocked to see an actor of the calibre of Robert De Niro wasted his time in producing such trash. If you wish to bore somebody to death, my advice would be to ask that person to watch this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A tale of masculine loneliness and one of the greatest films of the seventies,"Taxi Driver is one of those films that a lot of people will be able to relate to. That might sound a bit melodramatic given that it culminates in the main character losing all control, trying to assassinate a senator and then shooting up a whore house, but it's true. Okay, maybe not completely true as its hardly likely that everyone who has ever felt a tad isolated is going to turn into a gun totting lunatic, but nevertheless, Taxi Driver will be a familiar story for any man who has ever felt serious disillusionment about life and a growing sense that something is terribly wrong, but are unable or unwilling to do anything about it. God's lonely men are everywhere, this film is their voice.Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle is a revelation. The Greatest Method Actor Of All Time handles his subject with aplomb, turning Travis into a very believable and troubled man. He is a sad, lonely individual who is also kind of creepy, but nonetheless he is a recognisable and even quite sympathetic one, De Niro all nervous smiles and delirious ranting. When he sits in a café with his fellow taxi drivers for instance, focusing on a set of painkillers fizzing away in a glass of water, the conversation drifting past him and staring into the water's healing potential, his position becomes all too clear - this is a man with nowhere to go, nobody to turn to and who blames the ills of society on his own self loathing.Furthermore, there is a very keen sense of urban paranoia running through. Surrounded by the seedy underbelly of New York city, Travis is faced with violence and sexual depravity every single day. And this turns into guilt on his part too - when a young prostitute barrels into his cab, pleading for help only to be snatched away by her pimp who leaves a crumpled bank note on the seat as thanks, its easy to see Travis's shame catching up with him. Soon, he is ranting about ""cleaning up the mess"" and ultimately becomes a vigilante, his disturbed mind resorting to simple, base aggression as he lashes out at the evil around him, trying to atone for his own sins.Needless to say, it is undeniably De Niro's film. Only two scenes focus on people other than Travis but even so, the support actors do a terrific job breathing life into their characters. The then thirteen year old Jodie Foster in particular displays incredible skill and maturity for her age, her depiction of Iris a jumbled mixture of cynical world weariness and teenage naivety. Harvey Keitel meanwhile has never been more sleazy than as 'Sport,' her pimp, a strutting, cocksure and thoroughly detestable scumball. You can't wait for Travis to take his new .34 Magnum to him, but this of course is where things get nasty.Taxi Driver you see is not afraid to show just how ugly violence is. Here, gun battles are gritty, dark and altogether real. Bullets tear holes in stomachs, blow hands apart and rip a man's face into a bloodied ruin, Scorsese may have been criticised for championing violence but such a criticism never really paid enough attention. When the blood flows as freely and bodies reduced to wreckage this easily, you find yourself revolted at the effects of Travis's rampage, despite yearning for it earlier in the movie.In short then, a dark classic and one of the best American movies of all time. Too much has been written on it for me to add anything extra but in terms of addressing masculine loneliness that like as not, strikes all of us at some point, nothing else comes close.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the best films I've ever seen,"~THIS CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERS, BUT EVEN IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM YET, I DON'T THINK THIS WOULD RUIN IT TOO MUCH. JUST WARNING YOU OUT OF CONSIDERATION~ I'm a huge fan of movies. I love them. I watch heaps. And Taxi Driver is one of the best. I'm gonna go buy the DVD when I get around to it.The film follows Travis Bickle in his job as a Taxi Driver (As the title suggests). Travis cannot sleep, so he works night shift. As he caters night after night to low-lives of all kinds, he feels hatred towards them, and regards them as being worthless.When he encounters a child prostitute, Iris, he becomes obsessed with her, wanting to save her from the dangerous life she is leading. This is perhaps where the best of Travis can be seen; He means well, but doesn't necessarily do well.I don't want to ruin the movie, so I will stop there. To anyone who hasn't seen this movie, I strongly recommend it. Robert DeNiro is a brilliant actor, and Jodie Foster's acting is a cut above average. All around good acting, and a brilliant plot.

I started to like Martin Scorsese after Gangs of New York,"because when I got obsessed with the director and his film Gangs of New York, I thought to myself, ""Why not see the rest of his other classics?"" So I bought Taxi Driver on DVD and the film was terrific. What I really liked about the film itself was how it portray loneliness in the story. The entire film was about Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle, a vietnam soldier that has nowhere to go or nowhere to start, so he chooses his new life as a Taxi Driver. He hates what he sees on the streets, he wishes that all the scum and filth would be rid of. Martin Scorsese treats New York as one of his stars because he shows what went on in New York in the eyes of Travis Bickle. Travis meets a beautiful woman name Betsy played by the seductive Cybill Shepard. She is like the perfect chick that any guy would like to screw in bed, including Tom played nerdy by Albert Brooks. After seeing a porn flick, Betsy breaks up with Travis and that's where Travis loses his mind. He starts getting guns, and practices by trying to figure out who to kill. Travis befriends a twelve year old prostitue name Iris(a young Jodie Foster) for whom he wants to help her by getting rid of her pimp Sport(played by Harvey Keitel).I forgot to mention Peter Boyle's character as Wizard, he is the only character in the film that tries to help Travis before he goes off the brink of insanity. I liked Peter's performance.All in all, everybody should talk to lonely people or befriend them no matter how weird or goofy they are. I loved Robert De Niro's performance as the psycho that just lost control of himself. I love the fact that Robert pulled a stunt like that. The film is good, the acting is awesome, and the dialogue is perfect. Not to mention Bernard Herrmann's music, his final score.10/10A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Jodie Foster's Sunglasses are the only good thing,"About this vastly overrated ""classic."" There's just nothing here beyond clever film-making trying to disguise a hopelessly thin screenplay. What do we have? Travis, borderline psycho to start the movie, goes completely psycho. No real reason given for it. He's full of hate at the beginning of the movie, he's full of hate at the end. No evolution at all. No convincing reason for him to go on a wild shooting spree. No convincing reason for him not to. The film is just one boring, pointless scene after another, often feeling like a really bad art film where the characters emptily mouth lines that the writer must have felt were deep, profound, and meaningful, but aren't, really. And so damn many times the characters *repeat* themselves, stretching 30 secs of dialog to 2mins of annoying chatter.Irony? Travis has none. And even if he did, De Niro doesn't do irony very well. Travis is a typical one-note De Niro performance--all weirdo, all the time. No shadings at all. Yeah, yeah, De Niro *is* Travis Bickle. Problem is, Travis Bickle *is* boring until right up to the end of the movie, where he gives us a few minutes of shoot-em-up, then, for absolutely no reason goes right back to what he was before.Realism? Give me a break. A guy shoots three people, one of them point-blank in the head, and is declared a ""hero"" rather than sent to prison for the rest of his life. Uh-huh. Sorry, but only in Scorcese's mind is New York that f'ed up. Doubtless some people see this as an ironic twist. For me, it's complete bunk, the final insult after having wasted almost two hours watching this crap.Points for De Niro's pre-punk 'hawk and Jodie Foster's sunglasses. Other than that, you're left with a lame ""prostitute with a heart of 14k gold"" storyline, and a main character who's utterly pointless.Some classic.Robert St. James Albany, Oregon.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A daily comment from Midget Emma: Taxi Driver (1976),"This was a alright movie. It may have been a different movie but it is in no way a masterpiece.I found it to be very boring. The only good bits were Robert De Niro talking to a mirror, the scenes with Jodie Foster and the end scene.It is very overrated and i don't see how people like it so much.I borrowed this because of its high rating and because Martin Scorsese directed it. It is nothing compared to The Departed and Goodfellas.One of the things that saved this movie is the acting. De Niro and Foster were great. Robert De Niro delivered a disturbing performance as a night time taxi driver who comes a across a prostitute who he feels he must save. Jodie Foster played that prostitute and her performance was great.The only reasons to see this is the acting and the good bits which i mentioned at the start of this comment.I recommend you see this some day.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You talking to me?,"I was amazed by this movie. Everything about it was perfect. Robert DeNiro gives what I believe is his best performance ever as Travis Bickle. He tells everything so well, so in-depth that I could actually picture every scene he described even when it was not shown. Travis Bickle reminds me a lot of myself. I could relate to him in so many ways it was almost scary. Im not saying we're the SAME but similar in many ways. This isn't a movie for the type who only like modern movies with ""200% action"". They have no soul. This movie HAS soul. This is a film for true movie fans. Robert DeNiro was great, but so were the others. Cybill Shepherd gave quite a performance as DeNiro's ""5-minute flame"" Betsy. Jody Foster actually played very well as the 12-year old prostitute Iris Steensma. Peter Boyle was very well cast as Bickle's cabby friend Wizard. Even Harvey Keitel shows a good performance as Iris' pimp, Matthew aka ""Sport"".

DeNiro is great - Movie not so much,"There is a lot of great acting in this movie. Most of all from Robert DeNiro, who even managed to make a rather unspectacular line in a rather unspectacular scene one of the most quotable in cinema. You talking' to me? I also enjoyed Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel and cute little Jodie Foster.However, the acting carries almost all of the weight in this film and doesn't eradicate the many dissonances.For example, the movie builds much on the ""filthiness"" and amorality of NYC. The state of the city is exaggerated so much, however, that it is difficult to relate to the characters being affected by it. Also, some of the characters' behaviors seem unrealistic for me. In spite of the long build-up, the ending doesn't seem justified, either.It's not too bad, but wouldn't recommend it.

Do we have scenes missing?,"We are supposed to buy that DeNiro's character descended into madness, all without a compelling storyline to lead us there. What did we miss? It seems almost arbitrary that he decided upon a complete change to his character.For what frustrates me about this film, we need look no further than the directorial choice of ending the climactic sequence by panning back through the aftermath of the scene, in a way that revealed no new information, all while blaring music that seemed to convey we were getting some eye-opening glimpse. I'd call it an odd choice, but that would imply some effort was exerted.Even with my strong ardor for jazz music, noir moodiness and slow-burn filmmaking, a director shouldn't depend on that being enough to carry a viewer's interest.But perhaps I'm too hard on someone who was still new in their career.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Taxi Driver,"Robert Deniro committed to history, signed his name, in this film with his acting a masterpiece and nothing less. The way his character was so dreadfully lonely and isolated, and the way his anger and loneliness grew into what it did, and the way the cinematography and jazz music captured that loneliness in the city, of a single man amongst the crowds, the desolation and hunger amongst the people in the city and the people he encounters, the destitution and darkness it's all powerful. What's even more heartbreaking to me is the fact that Travis Buckle is a smart, optimistic warmhearted caring person full of humor and how that sort of shrivels away the longer he is in his environment. I love how his taxi becomes a ghost like figure. I also thought it was interesting how almost everyone was isolated or a depressing figure in some way, how most of the men especially in the film were lonely and how that loneliness effected all the women around them",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Stunning portrait of an alienated sociopath,"Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is a disturbed man. Stricken with insomnia, he decides to enrol as a taxi driver in order to pass the time. What follows is a descent into madness, brutality and vigilantism.De Niro portrays the titular protagonist/antagonist in what can only be described as a masterpiece, both for him as an actor and for Martin Scorsese as a director. The film's intense depiction of urban decay, and Travis' equally intense reactions to this corruption, have gone down (and will continue to go down) as a milestone in cinematic history.Initially, it is relatively easy to sympathize with Bickle. He is a lonely man, lost and without purpose. After several failed attempts at socialization, he finally manages to acquire a date with a beautiful political volunteer (Cybill Shepherd). When this ends miserably, Bickle's personality takes an even more twisted turn, with him becoming increasingly concerned with ridding the streets of New York from the scum that inhabit them and his taxi. His actions (and his motives) become more and more elusive. By the end of the film, amid all the bloodshed and mayhem, it has become nearly impossible to understand Travis.Scorsese's use of New York City is remarkable, with obscure angles and shots highlighting and contributing to the alienation and seediness that Travis and the audience are made to feel. Bernard Herrmann's ominous score likewise punctuates this overbearing feeling of dread and despair.Performances from now-veterans Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster all help contrast with De Niro's. Whilst Sport and Iris thrive and survive by indulging in the corruption of the city, Travis attempts to destroy this corruption, yet in doing so becomes something far more sinister.The film's ending has inspired countless debates as to its meaning, with critics and audiences seeking closure. In my opinion, this lack of closure is a perfect ending, as we are left to decide whether Travis is at all redeemable, ultimately an unanswerable question.If I have one complaint (and this is only a minor one), it is that the violence, due to the inevitabilities of time, has lost a bit of its impact. Today, you'll be hard-pressed not to find a modern mindless blockbuster that contains more hard-hitting violence and gore. Yet, the film's message (and a depressing one at that) remains as strong as it was thirty-six years ago.Must-see viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Singing In The Rain for the manic depressive set,"A disturbed and damaged Vietnam vet returns to his native New York and take up a job as a taxi driver; which gives him a perfect viewing platform for the horrors of big city life.As a portrait of New York inner-city sleaze in the 1970's - the city really was broke and  falling down (literally and morally) - it is important and accurate, but sadly descends in to the morbid and then the ludicrous, in that order. Thankfully with have prime-time De Niro in the lead, one few actors that can go crazy without totally alienating the audience.While many focus on the nonsensical ending as their main quibble, mine is with the main character. If you want to condemn sleaze you have to do so from a position of being above it or beyond it: Our anti-hero seems to be right at home in the gutter with drug dealers, pimps, whores, gun sellers, porn theatres and general riffraff. He as much a consumer as a  condemning witness.Very good acting by all concerned and well regarded, but also a very disposable movie. What are we learning here - that Times Square was (it has been cleaned up since) a sleaze pot? Or that the big city has an ugly underbelly? How stupid and ignorant does Scorsese think we are? I found the whole thing slightly depressing and even dangerous - political assassination as a way of making a love gesture?(Talk about handing out irresponsible ideas to the general public!)This is the voice of a man (with writer Schrader) saying ""nothing can be done."" As we have seen, things can be done and things can be made better.

One of the Most Influential Films,"The Story: The story is of a lonely man named Travis Bickle, he is a loner by day and a Taxi Driver by night.

This is for many reasons, One is because of Scorsese, he is a living genius, just like Kubrick. Whether it's the screenplay he chooses, or the camera angles and sheer brilliance of how he portrays a character's emotions on screen. He is truly the master. Another is Mr. Robert DeNiro. Probabally the greatest actor of all time. His method acting is clearly present in this piece of groundbreaking film. It is one of the only films where I can say, ""I relate to this guy..."", after watching the film, you will know how crazy that sounds, to say ""I can relate to Travis Bickle.""

A New-York-style self-exorcism,"There is something intrinsically poetic in the neo-noir delivery of Taxi Driver. A run-down New York City of the 70's, the soft jazz score that permeates in and out as the story progresses in the midst of the eventual, yet ever so present, lack of absolute register on film; all of which contribute to the strong screen presence of a young DeNiro playing Travis Bickle, a fellow that double takes as the story's protagonist and narrator.Travis Bickle, a mentally unstable Vietnam veteran, exorcizes his demons by working as a night-shift checkered cab driver in New York City. Under the cloak of the night, he cruises the City and gets to witness a reality that is not socially suitable for daytime mores. In the course of one of such rides, Travis is faced with a wilting flower that causes him to pause and reassess the many spheres he transits through daily. Out of this dualism, Travis' perverted views of reality start to materialize and, as such, he becomes both hero and hitman.A catalyzing Mohawk, then, ensues.But one miscalculated move leads to a heartbreak that drives Travis over the edge. Then, heavily armed and washing his meds down with beer, he sets out to right two wrongs; one perceived and the other actual. A failed murder attempt, symbolic of Travis' inner naïveté, leads to an impetuous and bloody showdown that brings him to a near-ultimate atonement before a pseudo trinity.As a result, one Iris is set free and is back in due full bloom. With a mended heart, Travis lives on to tell the story.Lack of absolute register returns, fades to black.The End.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"My personal ""favorite"" film","This is the great American classic that reminds us all what passion can really come out of film. The movie gets better after every viewing, when you start noticing all the small details you may not have noticed in your last viewing. The film has something that very few films can ever achieve and that is making the audience feel the world Travis Bickle lives in. You can sense the smell of the city air, be dazed by the city's lights, and be torn apart by the loneliness of every cold and crowded street. You can feel Bickle's sickness with all the pimps and low lives who are able to obtain woman, while he struggles with them in all his efforts. Travis realizes that his life has been lead in one direction that will let him make his imprint on the world before his sad and inevitable end. The acting is De Niro's best performance, the directing and imagery is superb, and the musical score is phenomenal. In other words this is my all time favorite film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The appeal of Taxi Driver,"Why does taxi driver have so much appeal? Well simply because there are so many Travis Bickle's in the world. I have to ask you a question, have you ever felt alone? Walked down a street full of strangers, realising there is no-one around that you know? I'm sure most people have felt that sometime, but Travis Bickle takes that to the most extreme degree, he feels like that all the time. The man who bring this character to life happens to be the rather obsessive, meticulous, method actor, that is Robert Deniro. Travis is such a complex character, miles away from most two dimensional Hollywood blockbuster heroes, for Robert Deniro to bring him to life, well to me makes him one of the greatest movie actors. He doesn't have a ""catchphrase"", he doesn't have friends, basically all he has is his job and his own loneliness. So basically I would say that Travis is the ultimate anti-hero.I feel that anyone who has ever had a time in their life where they've spent a lot of alone time, maybe people who have simply seen a friend be like that, can relate. I think this is where the mass appeal lies. Another aspect is that Taxi Driver follows a real life murderer, he isn't portrayed as a monster though, just a misfit, who is a very real person.Finally, the film just has a certain touch of class. Just the intro scenes made enough of an impact on me. That music and the visuals of the taxi. The speech at the beginning already confirming that Taxi Driver is going to be one of the darkest films you've ever seen (all the animals come out at night). It's brutally honest about New York (at the time), it doesn't paint some sort of false picture about it. It's all there, the drugs, the prostitutes, the porno theatre. How many other films dare talk about these things? Even now? But guess what, though I've never been to New York, I could show you all of these things if I went down to London. Most places have this side to them.People understand this film. Whether they relate it to themselves or to someone they know, or simply find it interesting to watch Travis' descent until he finally cracks. The surroundings of a big city like New York, with a dirty underside, still relevant. All of these aspects, which I've discussed, make sure that the film is still watched and still relevant today. Sure it will be lost on some people who demand a much faster pace, people who are wondering when the killing will begin and even take joy in it when it does, but Taxi Driver is not supposed to be that film. It's a portrayal of emptiness, loneliness and alienation. People don't watch films like this, they become immersed in them.So in short; Great acting, great music, great visuals, great script. Really, what else are you looking for in a film? Tell me, what?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Dark Film that is a Masterpiece,"Taxi Driver is an absolutely stunning film. One of Martin Scorsese's original masterpieces that was nominated for best picture in 1977. This film is absolutely amazing in that nothing is wrong with it. It has wonderful acting, direction, writing (screenplay), and filming.There is nothing wrong with this film. The filming is absolutely phenomenal, some of the best filming I have ever seen. The dark and horrible images of New York City are captured beautifully on camera. The footage taken from the Taxi Cab is brilliant, giving us the feeling we are driving that cab. The viewer gets the feeling that they are seeing and even feeling everything that is happening. Absolutely brilliant camera work! The story is brilliant. It focuses around the actions of a disturbed individual (Robert De Niro) who drives a Taxi cab during the most dismal times in New York City. The result, is an increasingly growing anger for all the filth and scum that he sees around him living in the city.Robert De Niro portrays a psychotic and isolated Taxi Driver named Travis Bickle who is a Vietnam veteran. This is, in my opinion, De Niro's best performance in a film. His character is extremely unstable and his portrayal of the anger, hatred, and cockiness in his character is phenomenal. The intensity he has on screen is unmatched by only a handful of performances I can think of. This is Robert De Niro at his best. Jodie Foster plays an extremely convincing young girl who Bickle tries to save from the scum of the city. Cybill Shepherd and Peter Boyle deliver wonderful roles as well as Harvey Keitel, who plays the pimp named ""Sport"" who you just love to hate.The ending of the movie is brilliant. I did not see it coming and it actually made me feel good. There are plenty of different interpretations about the ending and hopefully you can come to one you agree with after you see it.The film is so great in that little things make it amazing. One example, is the way Robert De Niro delivers his lines. They come out so smooth and invigorating that you are left captivated by him. Not just his lines, but other quotes from the film that leave you shocked or laughing. Another example, is simple actions performed by the characters. De Niro is not just amazing in how he talks, but also his actions. Small things like when Bickle smiles or smirks and when he points his finger to his head and starts to make gun shot noises is incredible. And the background music at that point is amazing. It really adds to the intensity of the scene.Taxi Driver is a masterpiece. I truly believe this film beats out Raging Bull as De Niro's best performance.

This is NOT a great movie.,"Taxi Driver is a right wing, racist wet dream that Schrader wrote just after the break up of a bad relationship, and he was looking for easy targets.In the movie, Travis wants to save the white women from those people who, in his mind, have led them astray: he wants to save the Cybil Shepherd character from the liberal political candidates (Palantine, who gives a speech about how the masses suffer for the few) and their Jewish supporters (Albert Brooks). Travis is unable to get close to the politician to shoot him, so he transfers his loneliness into ""saving"" the young prostitute, (Jodie Foster) from the pimp (originally written as a black man), who, defying all case studies of runaways in real life, was somehow running away from a safe loving family back in Pittsburgh. This is not a great movie. I've never understood why it was popular, except for, I suppose, DeNiro's intensity. If this what the supposedly ""free"" filmmaking of the 70s was all about, you can count me as one whose glad that era is over.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Possibly the best character bio of all time,"The film was released when the darkness of our culture began creeping into the theater. Movies were more raw, authentic and made a huge impact on audiences. Many of them made strong cultural and political statements. More young filmmakers were stepping out of traditional techniques and adding their own unique, artistic vision of style. Among these was Martin Scorsese, who has now become one of the most powerful directors of all time. And his successful career took off in 1976 with the release of a masterpiece... Taxi Driver.This is a near perfect film, held together by intriguing story, brilliant direction, and perfect acting. Shot almost like a documentary, the film is entirely in the main characters perspective. With Paul Schrader's structure, every line has a meaning, every shot has a purpose, all adding to the story. The almost dreamlike sequences make you question whether or not what you are seeing is really happening. This film will make you realize the impact the vision of a great director can have on a film.Robert De Niro gives one of the most realistic, most haunting performances in film history. The character of Travis Bickle was portrayed with such subtle authenticity. He fully inherited the character, mentally and physically altering himself for the role. He didn't have to act... he was Travis Bickle. He adds so much to the character that makes this movie unforgettable. His famous quirky monologues add a touch of humor to the film, but are also quite disturbing and effective. There's a reason Robert De Niro is dubbed as one of the greatest actors of all time, and his performance in Taxi Driver is that reason.This film may not be for everyone. Many viewers may find it hard to relate to the character of Travis Bickle. He is the ultimate antihero. But if you like like well made, character driven films, this is a classic that is just as strong today, if not stronger, than it was when it was released in 1976. I highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Take a trip with Travis,"Don Quixote got crazy after too much reading and too little sleeping...Martin Scorsese takes us on a trip around New York City in a yellow cab driven by Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a Vietnam veteran who, due to his lack of sleep, decides to work also during the night. He falls in love with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign worker with whom he shall attempt to go out. But the world Betsy and the presidential candidate she works for live in does not coincide with the one Travis sees from his taxi every night: that other world, shown to us through Travis's eyes and through the eyes of the taxi he drives, is one inhabited by people like Iris (Jodie Foster), a too-young prostitute whom he will try to rescue from her ponce 'Sport' Matthew (Harvey Keitel).'Taxi Driver' is not a film about the night in the big city, in spite of its showing the apparently hidden reality that remains behind the curtains of neon and light. We follow Travis on his working trips and also during his resting time, when he finds entertainment seeing pornographic films. 'Taxi Driver' is about someone who cannot confront reality.Night-shift taxi drivers and prostitutes: two figures that maintain a close and strong relationship all over the world. Business-like, for sure, although Travis does not know what to do with the money he gets from Sport. In fact, Travis spends a lot of money on buying an arsenal, and a great deal of time on body building.It is not difficult to think of Travis as a mentally ill person. What is really difficult is to allow the spectator to understand how a mind can go through the downhill process of mental catastrophe, and yet that mind be desperately seeking relieve. What rather than who drives that taxi? Is it only the consequence of the Vietnam experience? Is it disgust, racism, or a pitiful feeling of not belonging to anyone, of not being loved by anyone? The frequent nocturnal sequences of the film acquire a nightmarish dimension not only by means of the appearance of the prototypical smog of New York City but also by the use of subjective and over-the-shoulder shots of both the driver and his taxi. ""The job becomes the man,"" says one of his work mates, the only Sancho Panza he meets. Travis, travel, taxi, taxi driver: the name becomes the title, the title becomes the film.The seminal work of John Ford in 'The Searchers' and 'Fort Apache', for instance, with both John Wayne in the former film and Henry Fonda in the latter performing functional roles not too dissimilar from the one represented by De Niro in this film, shows us heroes(?) who may seem necessary to many but with whom few people would like to live. The main difference between Ford and Scorsese does not lie in the place, neither in the genre'Taxi Driver' can be plainly read as a late western, with the people of the night as the Native Americans, as the others, nor in the historical moment they date their stories, but in the state the spectator is left in by each director. Ford leaves us wondering about the reason-ability of his main characters, Scorsese lets us enter the mind of Travis as the privileged passengers who will never forget the experience of having taken a trip with Travis. Perhaps we shall not want to remember that we have been in that taxi. Perhaps we may prefer to think that it was only a dream, only a film.José Díaz-Cuesta",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
arguably DeNiro's second best screen performance,"In the seventies, Robert DeNiro was scoring one great performance after the other, under the direction of such masters as Coppola, Bertolucci, Kazan and, of course, Martin Scorsese. In ""Taxi Driver"" he achieves, in my opinion, his second best performance next to ""The Deer Hunter"". The whole film is about his character, really. This haunted taxi driver haunts the spooky streets of New York City every night, like a ghost summing up those tormented souls that ""came home"", from Vietnam. The camera captures the interior world of Travis - where the usual nocturnal ""fauna"" becomes a gallery of zombie-like, crawling creatures - while filming the surroundings in which the characters evolve. Scorsese superbly directs the young Jodie Foster and also, the beautiful Cybill Shepherd, whose performance was ignored by many critics raving about Foster. This atypical American film was awarded ""The Golden Palm"" at Cannes while Tennessee Williams was presiding the jury. The famous playwright must of found some truth in Scorsese's vision, right?",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the Greatest Movies ever,"There are some fine film actors outthere but standing above all of them is Robert De Niro and this is one of his finest acting performances. The character he played Travis Bickle was recently voted the greatest anti-hero of all time and anyone who has ever watched Taxi-Driver would have to agree with that.De Niro gives a masterful performance as Travis Bickle a Vietnam veteran who is a loner and is slowly going mad. Through De Niro's performance we can watch him going mad as he drives his taxi through all the scum of New York. He chooses to work at night where the worst of New York can be seen.Travis Bickle gets himself armed to the teeth and you know its only a matter of time before he explodes. He shots dead a punk trying to raid his local store and the owner is grateful to him. His character shows genuine concern for Jodie Foster's character who is only 12 and a prostitute. It seems she wants help but is trapped in a world of pimps and junkies. Travis Bickle takes it on himself to take them all on with very bloody results.This is a truly classic film and probably one of the best De Niro-Actor Scorese-Director collabrations. Scorese evens has a cameo in the film.De Niro didn't win an Oscar for his performance in this film amazingly enough though he was up against Jack Nicholson's performance in One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. In fact De Niro has only ever won two Oscars but his performances in Film's over the years should have netted him at least 10. Taxi driver was made 29 years ago but hasn't dated and is still relevant today. I would love to see a sequel of Taxi Driver and see what happened to Travis Bickle. The DVD is really good, the extras include a 70 minute documentary where all the main characters talk about the film. It is rare for De Niro to give interviews but he does here and he is clearly proud of this film. The only disappointment is there is no Directors Commentary. Hopefully one day they will rectify this and Both Scorses an De Niro can get together to to do a commentary for this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best dramas of all time.,"The best Scorsese/De Niro picture, and that speaks volumes. Though somewhat depressing and very melancholic, this film can be viewed many times, unlike other dramas. A very unusual film in which it is impossible to predict exactly what will happen next, due to the main character's confusion and hence unpredictability. De Niro is perfectly cast, and Keitel and the young Foster are also very good. The soundtrack is excellent and the movie owes a lot to it, as well. The decadence is realistic and captured terrifically by Scorsese; the photography is superb in all its 70s grainy glory.Now, hang on to your seats!... Before Scorsese took over the project, De Palma and Spielberg were potential directors. Christ Almighty! Thank God they didn't get their hands on this script. Imagine what kind of crap they would have made out of it...The De Palma version: A lonely Vietnam vet decides to drive a taxi cab for a living, but he has to get to New York first. He travels across the country, and one day decides to spend the night at a motel where a certain Normana Bates works - played by Nancy Allen. While taking a shower on that same evening he is being attacked by Normana with a knife and cut into little pieces. The next morning Normana wakes up, thinking it was all a nightmare and goes into the kitchen to make some coffee. There she is ambushed by a perfectly healthy De Niro, who is holding the same knife he had been butchered with that very night (in the dream; or is it?)! (Makes sense? Not really. It would just get worse from there...:) Allen manages to escape from De Niro in the last moment and drives off to Mount Rushmore. Only hours later De Niro catches up with her and they get involved in a spectacular chase around the four presidential heads. While both of them are hanging on Lincoln's nose (each per nostril) Allen shouts ""Why are you chasing me?"". De Niro responds that he is working for the KGB and must eliminate her for she is an FBI agent who knows too much. Allen then denies any involvement in any spying activities, claiming she is merely a pimp. De Niro asks for proof. Allen opens her mouth to say something when suddenly another Allen appears at the top of Lincoln's head! De Niro and Allen 1 look at each other in disbelief. The mysterious Allen 2 shouts to them that they're both as good as dead. De Niro asks why. Allen 2 says it's revenge for Allen 1 using her daughter as an underage prostitute. De Niro says he had nothing to do with it, and then remembers that he has a fear of heights. He starts panicking. Allen 2 machine-guns him, saves Allen 1, and the two of them get attacked by vicious birds on their way to the motel...The Spielberg version: A Jewish rabbi - played by Whoopie Goldberg dressed as a man - decides to become a cab driver in order to get in touch with the ""real people"". One of his customers is a small alien with a heart of gold (literally) who is fighting for the rights of whales on his planet, and was sent to Earth by the planet's nasty right-wingers as punishment for his liberal activism. The rabbi offers his help, but not before inviting the alien to a trip to Disneyworld. There the rabbi and the alien meet Mickey Mouse and Goofy, who are more than thrilled to help the alien go back to his planet in time to save the whales. On their way to the Kennedy Space Center they make a dangerous enemy: an unscrupulous pimp - played by Tom Cruise - who will do anything to get the alien laid with one of his 12 year-old girls, simply for the pleasure of being the first intergalactically successful pimp (plus, he wants that golden heart). Cruise is assisted by the evil Republican Party to catch our merry bunch, while the good Democrats - who sing happy songs during the film - do everything to rescue the alien and his friends. The movie ends by the Democrats winning the Congressional, Senate, and Presidential elections and jailing all Republicans while introducing a state-run economy - not to mention helping the alien go back to his planet to save the whales. President Gore gets his life's wish fulfilled when the alien - just before lift-off - gives him advice how to save the spotted owl (the alien: ""Just kill all the humans living near its habitats, and you've saved it."")",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
College years,"College are the years that are supposed to be the most enjoyable for many but for me they were anything but. I got put on academic probation, I didn't make any friends, I alienated myself, and I spent what seemed like most of my time reflecting on downfall of the world. I was not interested in getting wasted or the party scene. Long story short I really at that time in my life related to Travis a lot. Too add to it I went to a large school where I felt loneliness more. Paul Schrader the films writer had said to experience real loneliness you have to be around a lot of people, I agree.Robert DeNiro plays Travis Bickle and introverted loner who spends his days driving a cab and nights writing journal entries about what he sees as the decay of society around him while somewhat hypocritically visiting porn theaters. Travis though does try to better himself and become ""a person like other persons"". He finds the courage to ask out Betsy a beautiful woman he watches from a far. Eventually though his inexperience with social norms get the better of Travis who then sets out to change the world.A lot of the movie looks dated from a visual standpoint, especially NYC today. However, the meat of the story still holds up well I think. What isolation/alienation can do to a person and how easy it can be to fall into that trap. DeNiro killed it. Also, Scorsese had a great and memorable cameo as an angry customer of Travis",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very slow Paced and Down right Depressing,"Let's be brutally honest here. The film is extremely slow paced with next to no storyline making it dreary and boring. I know it's one of the great films for it's time and its not that it was acted poorly, but instead the message being portrayed in the movie was very depressing. The main message in the film is seeing the mental state of a cab driver, while we watch him live his daily life and how those condition can make a man go to the extremes. He's depressed... He has a crappy job... His social skills are terrible... I understand setting a scene and a mood for a character, but the entire film was about setting the scene and the mood. It was only at the very end that the movie picked up when the character finally came to the end of himself and made a decision to do something about it. Perhaps the deep meaning of the film is powerful and well portrayed, but its depressing to watch. The one thing that did catch my attention in the movie was Robert De Niro. He's so young in this movie and he acts a little different than his usual roles, it was nice seeing a different side of his acting and as always he never disappoints. I wish there would have been more scenes with Jodie Foster, as this was the movie that helped bring her into the publics eye with her talented acting at such a young age. I was surprised how little of a role she had in the film as they brought her in during the end of the movie, but she definitely doesn't disappoint with her acting skills.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"a film that's beautifully ""organazized""","It's not everyday when you come across an ""out of body' experience. The last time I felt it at the movies was when I saw Star Wars. That was before I saw Taxi Driver. I rented Taxi Driver with some friends seventeen years after its theatrical release.I was blown away. My friends and I didn't say a word until ten minutes after it was over. How was it that a movie like this could have such an impact?The film stars Robert DeNiro as Travis Bickle who takes on a taxi career after serving in the Marines in Vietnam and suffering from some horrible discharge. From the beginning we already feel something unpleasant about Travis. We can see that he's lonely, reserved and a bit socially awkward. We sense something more intense underneath but we don't really know what it is. Wandering into porn movie theaters makes him seem even more lonely and perverted. This is his quality time after long days of witnessing a violent atmosphere of pimps, prostitutes and homeless drug addicts.Taxi life sure isn't the solution to his miserable and solitary life. Bur one day, Travis spots a girl played by Cybil Shepard who works at a campaign headquarter for a presidential candidate. We watch Travis trying to flirt and ask her out and although it seems charming to an average bimbo, it comes across as totally awkward. There are long pauses of silence and observations that sound creepily insulting. ""I can see the way you carry yourself that you're not a happy person"" he says. When he takes her out to lunch, we see Travis's loneliness amplified with a a mild sense of paranoia. This scene is utterly ironic in how we see a typical first date as sounding nervous and alienating. Who is this guy? Cybil seems intrigued by him and is reminded of a Kris Kristoferssen song: ""he's a poet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction."" It's a great description of Travis but he immediately gets insulted. Rather then analyze the song, he just gets defensive."" ""I'm not a pusher and I never have pushed."" He proves himself wrong. After a bad date of trying to take her to a porno movie, he can't take ""no"" for an answer. We start to see more of Travis's creepy personality unfold as he obsesses over her by sending flowers and finally bursting in the office to yell and scream at her. Why does'nt he get it? After all the drunks, weirdos and psychos he picks up, could'nt he learn something ? No, instead, he is driven to a plan of madness. We don' know exactly what but its definitely building inside him. We see this in an amazing scene with Peter Boyle outside a cafeteria. Their interaction reinforces the loneliness and alienation between these characters. Its a quiet scene but its so true in its portrayal that it seem scary.The film looks like a documentary at times because we see street action in the background that weaves in and out of the foreground giving you a sense of real life drama. Some of the shots are particularly shocking and so matter of fact. When an encounter with a pimp turns bloody, we see it from a distance as if we were pedestrians witnessing a crime. The violence in this film is anything but glorified. It puts the film in a gritty and dirty atmosphere that we don't want to participate in. But its not just the violence that hooks us in, its the bizarre and psychological mysteries that carry the story. How did Travis get infatuated with Cybil Shepard? Was it coincidence that she worked for the presidential nominee? How events happen and get traced in this film is utterly disturbing. I still can't explain how a film could have an impact to the magnitude that it did. One thing I do know is the director (Martin Scorsese), the screenwriter (Paul Schrader) and the main actor (Robert DeNiro) were all going through similar experiences during the making of this film. That is rare in a field that involves a lot collaboration. When it does happen it as it did, it becomes truly magical. This is without a doubt, Scorsese's best film to date.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Without A Doubt One Of The Best Movies of All Time.,"Taxi Driver is one of the greatest movies of all time. A film about a nice guy turned tough guy. De Niro plays Travis Bickle. A Cab Driver who is sleepless. An election is going on in the city of New York. Everything sucks for him until he changed his life.A Movie like this needs to be done carefully. The main character must be liked in order to get people routing for him. Unlike his other film Raging Bull where he played one of my most hated characters, De Niro's Travis is awesome and lovable. All the characters have points of being in this film. I don't think this movie would have worked if you cut out Tom or Sport.Taxi Driver is not a action film but a drama film. Drama worked in with violence is more like it. Its all about character and not violence.

"There is good in every person, as Taxi Driver proves","Taxi Driver is a very simple title for such a powerful movie, the strange story of a kind but mentally unstable ex- Vietnam soldier who at first seems like the biggest psycho in town. Living in an urban area by day and driving a taxi through busy streets full of what he calls ""scum of the earth"", he plots in his slipping mind to tear down the neon signs and drugs and corrupt politicians in what he calls ""the rain"". Things only get worse when his sudden love interest, Betsy, rejects him after he awkwardly takes her to a porno movie and she sees something sinister in him.Well, poor Travis may be falling off the deep end but he will do something good before he snaps completely. A thirteen-year-old prostitute, who calls herself ""Easy"" (her real name is Iris), thinks the life of a hooker is glamorous and cool, but she fails to realize that if she doesn't head back home to Pittsburgh soon, she'll be trapped in that kind of life forever. Travis ""buys"" her but not to do anything with but to convince her that the streets is no place for a kid. After giving her every last cent of his money to help get her home, he dedicates his own life to stopping the man who has her under his control.One thing you've got to take note of, whether you enjoy this film or not, is the amazing acting job from all members of the cast, especially Jodie Foster, who was already acting in two other major roles that year (Echoes of a Summer and The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane). And Taxi Driver proves that no matter how far gone a person is, they always have the potential to do good. Travis saved the life of a little girl and although ""off"" at the best of times he certainly wasn't a monster. If you're a fan of the X - Files, you might recall the Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). His character was certainly corrupt but he had a difficult life and did do some good things. Just like him, Travis in Taxi Driver has a bad side, but also a good one that shines through in the end. Like the C.S.M. Travis is very mysterious and viewers never know whether he'll do good or bad, even at the ending.A few reviews mentioned that the movie was perverse and that it had pedophilia in it (Iris). But it was all acting, there was nothing really going on, and it served a purpose, it was supposed to seem really perverted and wrong. Because it is. Despite prostitution being illegal in Canada, Vancouver still has cases all the time where girls even younger than Iris are ""recruited"" as prostitutes. They're usually either confused runaways, kidnapping victims or addicts. So if Canada still has this issue, it's much worse in the United States. Taxi Driver is not some sick film for pedophiles to enjoy, it's a movie about a man who has lost everything in life but has the chance to make a difference in someone elses'.The soundtrack was great, that nostalgic 1970's stuff that today you can get really cheap at record stores because sadly it's no longer a popular genre. The plot was original, and Taxi Driver is certainly up there as one of the best 1970's - no, one of the best ever - movies around. I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""Someday a big rain will fall and wash all the scums off the streets.""","Travis Bickle is perhaps the darkest character director Martin Scorsese has ever dealt with and perhaps his darkest film as well. This is a character and film with a lot of hate. Some consider Bickle to be a loner, but sometimes he appears to be a man with a lot hatred to his surroundings. Could it be a political or social statement by Scorsese? Or perhaps that Paul Schrader was going through depression when he wrote the script? Whatever the answer might be, all I can say is that this is a very powerful film. If you are like me when this film is over your mouth will be wide open. Bickle (in a perfect performance by Robert De Niro) is a scary character. Although his motives are positive (sometimes) the way he gets results is a little extreme. Then again it was the '70s.

A  tour de force by the brilliant Martin Scorsese,"Martin Scorsese establishes himself as one of the greatest directors of all time with the movie Taxi Driver. He examines, urban loneliness and despair through the character of Travis Bickle, brilliantly portrayed by Robert Deniro. With direct homage to the classic John Ford western The Searchers, Scorsese traces the events that lead to the release of a young girl being prostituted by a pimp named Sport. Similarly,in The Searchers a character named Ethan, played by John Wayne, is in a desperate search for his niece abducted by an Indian named Scar. The main characters in both films are both lonely wanderers and war veterans. Travis's destiny takes a turn after an unsuccessful attempt to establish a relationship with a girl played by Cybill Shepherd. He subsequently purchases several guns, which symbolically represent phallic symbols through which he will ultimately release his suppressed sexuality. In the final segment,when he ultimately confronts Sport, he points the gun at him and says ""suck on this"". Then he proceeds on a bloody rampage to release the young girl, which metaphorically represents a cathartic sexual release for Travis. This scene is absolutely riveting. The direction and the pacing throughout is impeccable.The mood is greatly enhanced by a superb score by Bernard Hermann. A modern masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Building a character,"Today it is practically undeniable that 'Taxi Driver' is one of the best films by director Martin Scorsese.
The premise is quite simple, a night taxi driver is fed up with the filth in his city and begins a violent mission. The main character, Travis Bickle (an excellent Robert De Niro), is the model of a broken, marginalized and lonely man, something that Scorsese transports to the visual plane. But really the great success of the film is the construction of the protagonist, which is so perfect that the protagonist himself is the film and all the events in it lead to it in a negative or positive way. The final purple catharsis is only the result of everything the film has built to bring the character to that point.
This highly negative character, from whom thousands more like him have emerged in the history of cinema, is proof of how the protagonist is enough to be the column of a film and fully support it without the need for other elements. Travis Bickle has gone down in history as one of the most recognizable characters and this is not for less, without him this film could not have become what it is today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Martin Scorsese's best film, and the best film of motion picture history","Taxi Driver is easily my favourite film of all time. Why? It's simple. Robert Di Nero plays a Vietnam veteran named Travis Bickle, who is emotionally unstable, socially inept, depressed and lonely. He suffers from insomnia and decides to become a taxi driver, working at night shifts from (and I quote) '8 in the evening to 6 in the morning, sometimes 8 in the morning. I work 6 days a week, sometimes 7 days a week. It's a real hassle but at least it keeps me busy.'I'm not gonna give away any major plot details about Taxi Driver; it's a film everyone should see with no spoilers. It didn't grab my attention at first, but I was blown away after seeing it through to the end. I think it's the most important, powerful film of the 1970s, if not, motion picture history. As an only-child and insecure teenager, I often feel incredibly unstable and lonely, so I can really empathise with the character's isolation and descent into madness and alienation. I guess another thing that makes me tick about this film is the superb acting by Robert Di Nero. Before I saw the film, the only knew him from Meet the Parents, in which I perceived Di Nero as a strict, yet well respected, cool, wealthy, 'winner' type guy; a real catch. Watching him play a violent, unlikable, menacing loner who later gets a mo-hawk, in 1970s X-rated Taxi Driver, however, cranks me up, so as you can imagine, I am in awe of the actor's amazing versatility.Taxi Driver is a timeless work of art; a masterpiece. I haven't seen a film depicting mental illness as well as this. I first saw it last year and it hasn't dated one bit, unlike Scorsese's other work such Mean Streets and Raging Bull. It's full of chilling moments, and Robert Di Nero does a flawless, monotonous narration, fuelled with quotes I will never forget such as 'by the time I finish my shift, I wipe the c** off the back seat. Sometimes, I wipe off the blood.' and (talking to his passenger President Palatine 'I think it's time we moved on flushed it down the f***ing toilet.' (I am aware that my quotes are not entirely accurate). There are no other films that have provoked me as well as this, and I doubt there ever will be.Classic! 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Taxi Driver - A Masterpiece,"Taxi Driver is one of those few movies that makes you want to watch it again right away. The story is not only well written and fantastic on paper, it is beautifully executed. Martin Scorsese does a fantastic job directing this film, and the shots he manages to create are nothing short of iconic. Everyone remembers the famous scene where Travis Bickle looks in the mirror, but even outside of moments like these the movie has a fantastic sense of where to place the camera for maximum effect. Robert De Niro gives a fantastic and layered performance as Travis which, after your first viewing, will make you want to go back and study the character and his psyche even more. The world of the movie is very dark in tone, and this helps to reflect it's themes beautifully. Overall this movie deserves my highest recommendation and ranks up there with the best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Not Scorsese's Best, although the Performances are Outstanding,","Taxi Driver is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. The highlight of the entire movie would have to be the actors, Robert De Niro shines as Travis Bickle, one of his deepest and most intense performances, the best scenes had to be between him and a very young Jodie Foster, their on screen chemistry is sublime, you could see that she understood acting from a very young age. However, I found it hard to get pulled in to this story, mainly because Travis was not a likable character, he's strange, suspicious and we are never made entirely clear of his intentions, the final scene is outstanding, but somewhat confusing, he may have been saving this girl but it was far more extreme than anything he had done previously, which made sense, but there was not enough build up to drive the character to that level of insanity, I understand that he is an anti-hero, but I had no support for him whatsoever. I think Cybil Shepherd was miscast in this movie and is without a doubt my least favourite part, she had no chemistry with De Niro, I know she was suppose to be confused and unsure of her love for Bickle, but I felt nothing from her, she was reading her lines. The story is also quite messy, I expected better from Scorsese, Travis goes from an everyday taxi driver to a corrupt one so easily that we never feel a proper transition, he seems to become crazier by each scene for no apparent reason, and a proper arch to this story does not come around till we meet Foster's character, but this still feels underdeveloped, their relationship could have been established more, so that the last ten minutes would not just feel like they were tying up loose ends. I am a huge fan of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, and while I appreciate their work on Taxi Driver, I have come to expect more from the people who brought me such greats as Raging Bull, The King of Comedy and Goodfellas, but it's an iconic movie that should not be missed by any movie buff.A troubled man spirals in to vigilantism and revenge while working with a taxi service.Best Performance: Robert De Niro",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Opens up a different side of loneliness.,"I thought this was an action movie at first but I quickly got over that and knew where the movie was going. It was easy to say it was a good movie.The way the cast played their roles was enough to understand what was going on without having to show it through dialogue. The conversations within the film are interesting rather than something to bear with. Some of them are funny and silly while some are ponderous and insightful.Maybe the only character driven film I completely enjoyed, not to mention relate to. Every character and scene is important in motivating DeNiro's decisions and subsequent actions. Having seen it, I have to say it's an important film that depicts one's isolation and it's dangerous effects. It's something to think about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A good watch.,"""Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scums, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is someone who stood up.""Taxi Driver is a difficult movie to digest, part of what makes it so infectiously uncomfortable is how it tackles themes of existentialism through a mentally deranged yet charming Robert De Niro. It has this uneasy morbidness and hypnagogic tone covered throughout and although I think the movie has definitely aged, it still is as compelling to watch and relate to in this day and age. A major part of it comes through Robert De Niro's anti-villainist depiction of Travis and him trying to put his lost consciousness back in place after being a social outcast. 7/10, would recommend. A dark hit from the legend Scorsese himself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""characterized by an almost crushing boredom and emptiness""","According to another reviewer on this site, JosefSerf: '""Taxi Driver"" is about loneliness and loneliness is characterized by an almost crushing boredom and emptiness and Travis Bickle's character reflects that. His life is dull and boring, hardly anything happens to him and that is what ""Taxi Driver"" shows - Bickle's pathetic life.'And that's what you get, a crushingly boring movie about a deranged man. If that's how you want to spend a couple of hours of your life there's probably something wrong with you.The ending, while not as dull as the rest of the film, is equally stupid.I watched it because it's supposed to be one of the great cinema 'masterpieces'. I've come to the conclusion that 'masterpieces' should have some sort of government warning attached along the lines of ""WARNING: MASTERPIECE - ONLY VIEW IF YOU'RE A TERRIBLE BORE WHO LIKES THESE SORTS OF THINGS - YOU CANNOT GET THOSE TWO HOURS OF YOUR LIFE BACK.

Journey through New York's Grimy Underbelly,"As I ventured into the captivating world of Taxi Driver, I found myself immersed in the unique perspective of Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran battling insomnia. From the very beginning, the film skillfully painted a vivid picture of the grimy streets of New York, where Travis spent his nights as a taxi driver, navigating a city teeming with desperation and darkness in Travis's own words, ""This city here is like an open sewer, you know. It's full of filth and scum. And sometimes I can hardly take it.""What struck me the most about Taxi Driver were the unforgettable lines that echoed in my mind long after the credits rolled. Travis's iconic words, ""You talking to me? Well, I'm the only one here,"" showcased his internal struggle for connection in a world that seemed devoid of understanding. This sense of isolation was further emphasized when Travis wrote in his diary, ""Loneliness has followed me my whole life, everywhere, in bars, in cars; there's no escape. I'm God's lonely man."" These poignant lines resonated deeply, serving as a haunting reminder of the profound loneliness that can consume a person. As the narrative unfolded, I became intimately acquainted with Travis's encounters, particularly his relationship with a young prostitute. His attempt to help her and make a difference in her life showcased his underlying yearning for redemption and a desire to alleviate the suffering around him. It was through these interactions that I witnessed the depth of Travis's character, his inherent compassion shining through the cracks of his hardened exterior.In the end, Taxi Driver leaves an imprint on your consciousness. It serves as a reminder that within the darkest recesses of our minds, there exists a fragility that can either propel us towards self-destruction or awaken our capacity for compassion. Martin Scorsese's masterpiece stands as a timeless exploration of the human condition, etching itself into the annals of cinematic history.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"The pinnacle of quality film making ,Timeless classic Dark and gritty film just the way I like it.( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10",Taxi Driver is one of the greatest films of all time. It's Martin Scorsese's best work! This film is flawless.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very Powerful movie even NOW! Best so far.,"I have seen this movie 3 times. Today when I watched it again, I was thinking what a wonderful masterpiece it is. I've always loved De Niro, not just for how handsome he is but how good he is at dialogue delivery and expressions. Also, other reason that I might be biased towards writing only positive comments about this movie is because of the director, Martin Scorsese. These two have never disappointed me in the work they do. 
Talking about the movie, which can be considered more about a story of a taxi driver named Travis Bickle starts with his little introduction that he served in Army and he is a Marine veteran. This introduction establishes a lot about why Travis behaved certain way in rest of the film. The way Scorsese has directed the movie by unfolding about Travis's character is just brilliant. You will learn so much about Travis's character that not just he hates all the filth in New York but also how the small things that he notices everyday during his job affects him. For example, the guy who sits in the taxi and talks about how he is gonna kill his wife and her lover for infidelity. All the loneliness in Travis's life, the filthiness around the city and his past encounter with violence make him want to go back to being violent.
Travis's life in the movie is shown to be very lonely. But, it's shown that he does like a girl and go after her. But, after she stops taking her calls. His dialogue that says a lot about how he feels about people, "" I realize now how much she's just like the others, cold and distant, and many people are like that, women for sure, they're like a union.""
Travis wants to save the world from that filth and it can be seen when he says ""Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is a man who stood up.""
To sum up, the movie depicts urban alienation and loneliness very well with great acting by Robert De Niro. It shows how Travis starting as just a cabbie end up saving a child prostitute by killing some people and becoming the hero he wanted to be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I just don't know,"I watched it puzzled and remember it confused. So close to the edge and the ultimate cutting edge of dysfunctional. De Niro is weird, freaky, almost normal then imbecilic. The only other performance close to this is Jack Nicholson in Cuckoo's Nest. Scorsese doesn't punch or sensationalise... he ambles the film along - no drama. Jodie Foster acts like a seasoned, isolated, vulnerable? Underage, encapsulated empty cracker. It's still De Niro who spooks one out. Although strange as fruit it's totally believable.The score from.

Taxi Driver,"Robert De Niro is outstanding in this dark and gritty depiction of former marine ""Travis Bickle"". He spends his time, alone, driving his cab at night then watching seedy movies during the day. This relentless cycle is broken when he takes a shine to ""Betsy"" (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign worker for a would be US Presidential candidate. There is a glimmer of hope for him, as she agrees to go out with him for a movie - but when he takes her to his usual haunt for a Swedish film that perhaps wasn't quite Ingmar Bergman, he ends up back at square one. Simultaneously, he takes a more protective interest in the young ""iris"" (Jodie Foster) - a teenage hooker who is being used abused by her pimp, and to that end he acquires some firearms with which he is perfectly proficient, and so finally starts to see a purpose for his hitherto rather rudderness existence. Director Martin Scorsese and veteran scorer Bernard Hermann have created a wonderfully convincing and evocative scenario emphasising the seediness of a night time New York in which De Niro is able to thrive as few other actors could. He exudes a sense of helplessness but also of decency; he has integrity almost in spite of the indifference of his city, his peers - and by the end, I was firmly in his corner. If you can see it up on a big screen, then do so - it lends a great deal to this wonderfully atmospheric and potent piece of cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A classic of film that inspires many from a single performance.,"Taxi Driver is a interesting film that captivates audiences with its raw intensity of De Niro's outstanding performance. The film expertly delves into the mind of a one man in 1970's New York City, offering a powerful and thought-provoking experience.De Niro's portrayal of Travis Bickle is great. His ability to convey the complex emotions and inner turmoil of the character draws you into his troubled mind. Bickle's transformation from a lonely, disillusioned taxi driver to a vengeful vigilante is portrayed with utmost authenticity, leaving a lasting impact on viewers. The rest of the cast compliment De Niro rather well, although he is obviously the star of this show. He is also the only performance I would credit as being great or better than. I do see however that some people will struggle to connect to a character that's as broken and simply mean spirited as Travis. However even if you haven't had and similar experiences (obviously to a lesser extent), I still believe the movie is a thought provoking watch. But many may not see what i (and many) see. A negative here however is Travis Bickle and the performance of him is by an absolute landslide the biggest reason for this movies positivity. Everything in this movie would not be what it is without a performance like this one. That being said I believe it to be more of a credit to the director for having him cast. He is part of the movie after all.I've seen online that people believe the movie to be rather slow paced and this is a negative. But honestly I didn't feel that at all throughout the entire movie. That being said if you're not enjoying a movie this can happen so most movies can have this happen to some viewers. But I wanted to throw my two-cents into the mix and state that I do not believe at any point it gets longwinded and/or boring.The ending is great and something that leaves a profound impact. The conclusion is both shocking and thought-provoking, sparking discussions. It's hard to talk about for fear of spoilers, however it is very good and you may see differently to how the ending was originally planned from the director.Overall, Taxi Driver is a cinematic classic that showcases Robert De Niro's acting brilliantly. Although the movie is not as good as later (but similar toned) movies, it still manages to make you think and get somewhat invested into the character of Travis. The film's overall impact and unforgettable ending makes it a must see classic that continues to resonate with audiences and film makers to this day.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Due to this feeling created by the film, you can really understand the Travis character.  He is the only film psycho, which I can really empathise with.  He is completely over the edge, and yet at the same time completely understandable.

A peerless cinematic experience,"""Taxi Driver"" is a timeless cinematic masterpiece that has captivated and inspired generations of audiences since its release in 1976. Directed by the legendary Martin Scorsese and written by Paul Schrader, the film represents a dark and disturbing immersion into the mind of Travis Bickle, an alienated taxi driver who roams the decaying streets of New York City. From the opening shots, Scorsese transports viewers into a chaotic and disorienting world, perfectly capturing the claustrophobic and unhealthy atmosphere of the city in the 1970s. The gloomy photography and neon lights contribute to creating a surreal setting that serves as the perfect backdrop for the protagonist's inner turmoil. At the heart of the film is Robert De Niro's extraordinary performance as Travis Bickle. De Niro delivers a masterful and compelling performance, bringing to life a complex and tormented character. His physical and psychological transformation is stunning, revealing a vulnerable and unstable individual obsessed with the idea of purifying society from corruption and moral decay. Schrader's narrative offers an intimate look into Travis's mind, through his unspoken reflections and internal monologues. The protagonist's voiceover acts as a guide through the labyrinth of his disturbed psyche, revealing a profound sense of loneliness and alienation from the society around him. One of the most iconic elements of ""Taxi Driver"" is its soundtrack, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The evocative and unsettling music amplifies the atmosphere of tension and paranoia in the film, accentuating Travis's moments of anguish and desperation. But ""Taxi Driver"" is not just a visual and auditory work of art; it is also a powerful social commentary on urban decay, violence, and human isolation. Scorsese skillfully uses the backdrop of 1970s New York to explore universal themes such as alienation, madness, and the desire for redemption. The climax of the film is a sequence of raw and viscerally real violence, in which Travis embarks on a frenzied bloodbath to rid the city of his perception of evil. It is a moment of pure cinematic catharsis, where the emotions of the protagonist and the audience merge in a whirlwind of anguish and despair. At the end of Travis's tumultuous journey, we are left with a profound reflection on the nature of humanity and the fragility of the human mind. ""Taxi Driver"" is much more than just a film; it is an extraordinary cinematic experience that continues to provoke debate and reflection even decades after its release. In conclusion, ""Taxi Driver"" is a timeless masterpiece that remains a landmark of world cinema. With its combination of masterful direction, outstanding performances, and universal themes, the film continues to have a powerful impact on anyone fortunate enough to see it. It is a work of art that deserves to be celebrated and admired for generations to come and will forever remain one of the cornerstones of my love for cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Its tooooo good,"Hmm where to start with Taxi driver. For me it's a very personal film, a film I can relate to.I know to a lot of people who watch it end up idolizing Travis and think that it's all about the Mohawk or about the ""you looking at me"" line but for me it's like a million more things .It's not a perfect film but I'm not looking for perfection. Yet with its imperfections, to me it couldn't be more authentic. I can relate to Travis on so many levels. The loneliness, the desire to clean up the city, trying to save Iris the list goes on. The acting is beyond phenomenal, I can't even fathom how you go about playing something like this.First of all credit goes to the guy who wrote the script, Paul Schrader. He's like my hero. I mean the dialogues and the conversations, De Niro is beyond ridiculous and Jodie Foster is amazing especially for her age and Cybill Shepherd and ""Wizard"" Peter Boyle that guy is so fricking talented.I mean that's acting you know. The first time I saw it I stumbled upon the movie accidentally while surfing channels a long time ago. I started half way through but it was such an engaging film that I just got caught up and years later I actually saw the whole film and I remembered why I wanted to see it so badly.The way Travis is infatuated with Betsy and how he goes up to her and asks her out you know and also the conversation they have on their first date.That blows my mind. When Travis says, ""you know you have very beautiful eyes"" there isn't anything awkward, no sexual tension (to me anyway) and it was so honest you know. And how he says we had a connection and whether Betsy felt the same way and Betsy says, "" I wouldn't be here if I didn't"".The conversation with Wizard and Travis just blows my mind you know when Travis's is like ""I got a lotta bad ideas"" I mean how did they do that! It looks to be totally improvised but I don't think it was. Also love the pie and coffee (I think).Jodie Foster was incredible. She's just incredibly gifted and one of my favourite scenes is when they go out for breakfast. Jodie Foster is just phenomenal in that scene.The music is perfect and it really accentuates the movie brilliantly. I can't even talk about this movie. It's just beyond incredible. I can't even believe that such a film exists. And I gotta say the ending when Travis gets shot and I immediately think oh know he's gonna die you know, its so sad. But to my delight, he's a hero the next day in the papers and then he drops Betsy off,to me right there, there was closure. I was a little confused at first with the ending but after reading more about the film I understand the ending now. I was really happy with it of course.I could go on and on about this film probably write a book, which is why my review was more like some of the immediate thoughts I get when I think about this movie. It's a very rare film something that will never be duplicated and it's a gem really. I can understand why a lot of people don't ""get it"" and have all these questions. But I think its again one of those things you either love it or you don't. To me its one of the greatest films ever made and I'm very thankful for its existence.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A SCORSESE DE NIRO CLASSIC LOST IN COMPLEX METAPHORS,"The classic film which, weirdly enough, I hadn't watched before but was always intended to experience the start of Martin Scorsese's & Robert De Niro's careers. The movie mainly revolves around a taxi driver, as if we experience the whole 2 hours through his eyes. The nightlife of New York in the early 2000s, the locals of the city, and funnily enough the ongoing elections that have everyone rounded up. The film explores the themes of classic rivalries as with the taxi driver (lower class) vs. The running president, Coca Cola vs. Pepsi, the sophisticated vs. The slums of NYC are some of the themes that make the audience really connect with the director's vision. Although the story is mainly a monologue of the main lead, the story is somewhat interesting and seems to lead somewhere. The whole movie for me was pretty engaging until the 2nd act where it does get a bit boring and doesn't seem to end. Even with the standard of early 2000s, the film seems to be held by the brilliant acting of De Niro who we are being molded into a character denied by everyone. It is a very good commentary on Society and how we look at things differently depending what emotions we decide to overcome us. All in all, pretty good movie which might seem boring at parts but a classic nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What a movie.,"Reading the above comments just makes me reach for the bucket-I may have to reach for the toilet bowl before I finish reading all of them.This movie is a sad excuse for a B-movie. De Niro's acting has never been so poor, with half-lines and a semi-hashed script which would put a soap opera to shame. The movie is slow, for no apparent reason, the ending is nonsensical and the entire movie is random and without purpose or direction. Now, I hear some of the 'fans' out there shouting ""it's meant to be random, that's what Travis was feeling"" or some other wishfully throughout tripe, but come on, give it up, you've pushed this movie up to #37, you've taken the joke too far, give it up.I don't know what Scorcese was thinking, maybe he was going through a lonely period in his life feeling a little down, a little alienated, who knows? He must have gone through a similar patch before making Gangs of New York.I think the only reason why people exaggerate this movie is because they approach it with the formula: De Niro+Scorcese=Ingenious film-making. Hey, it worked for Mean streets, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino. Sorry life, like film-making isn't so simple.

Taxi Driver,"Taxi Driver is the best film of the century. Martin Scorsese's use of point of view show the mind of the tortured Vietnam, veteran, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro).

Martin Scorsese was not nominated for an Academy Award, but it is his best work. The movie was almost given an X rating for extreme violence. Jodie Foster as the 12 year old prostitute received her first Oscar nomination (best supporting actress). The film lost out in the Best Picture category to John G. Avildsen's Rocky.

Taxi driver is not a psycho or maniac, he is neither a radical nonconformist nor a disappointed downer. Just another one. Because of what? War? Could be. Or, maybe, because of his primordial another being ? On these kinds of questions is hard to answer. Psycho? But only in the estimation of the public which gave him no choice how to be. This man only reflects society's sickness and moral turpitude. Furthermore, he is a creation of society's rejection, indifference, emptiness. Travis tried to be like everybody (not to follow the crowd): without self-analysis and mentioning on bad things, indulging in an affair with a woman. Tried but failed. I think the last action he did hadn't pushed on him for his further violent actions but only confirmed his inability to be like others because of his loner and idealist being. This movie shows us two sided problem: on one side is society which cannot accept another individuality, on the other is individuality which cannot join society. And then, the only way to be is to be own self, to have own purpose. ""Taxi driver"" is an essay to look at the unsolved problem by existential attitude.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A dark and compelling tale of loneliness, unmatched to this day","Written by Paul Schrader and directed by Martin Scorsese with Robert De Niro taking the lead role, there really was never any chance of 'Taxi Driver' being any less than brilliant. Its one of De Niro's best roles, his performance is so good that it sends shivers down my spine every time I see it. To anyone who hasn't seen the film, De Niro plays a character called Travis Bickle, a man who takes a job as a taxi driver having been discharged from the army. It is through this job that he becomes disillusioned by all the crime and ""filth"" he sees around him and decides to take matters into his own hands. He is a challenging and multi layered character that De Niro brings to life with huge success. He may be a very extreme depiction of loneliness but even so he still seems every bit as real as you or me, he is a likable character to whom most people will be able to relate. That's the real genius of De Niro's performance; he makes you believe in Bickle no matter what he does.It was an early film for Scorsese who has since gone on to become one of the top names in Hollywood, but I would still regard this as his very best work. The night scenes are unmatched for their dark and gritty atmosphere, and the sense of loneliness that you share with Bickle throughout the film is chilling no matter how many times you watch it. However, Scorsese and De Niro alone don't make this a great film, there's Paul Schrader's masterpiece of a script, the haunting Bernard Herrmann score, and the A-list cast, that all come tougher to make this a living classic. The 70's brought many greats, and this is one of them. If you haven't seen it yet you really need too, especially if you're a Scorsese or De Niro fan, it's a superb film and a great addition to any collection.

"Vastly, Vastly, Vastly, Vastly Overrated","Okay, so I'm 30 years late seeing Taxi Driver for the first time. But I find that I didn't miss much. Aside from watching Robert DeNiro in his first role, I thought there wasn't much to like in this movie --and I'm not just talking about the violence. The ""romance"" between DeNiro's character and Cybill Shepard's sleek young professional is improbable to the nth degree, and even a clueless shmuck like DeNiro wouldn't be stupid enough to take a high class girl to a porno film on his first date. I suppose the viewer is expected to infer the reasons for every other unexplained development in the movie: DeNiro's purchase of an arsenal of weapons larger than some U.S. units are equipped with in Iraq, his sudden urge to rescue Jodie Foster's child prostitute, the approach to the candidate for president (couldn't get close enough to kill him, I guess), the final scene driving Cybill Shepard's character in his taxi (a dream sequence while he's still in the hospital or after he's died?), the letter of thanks from the parents of the child prostitute (also a dream sequence? also after he's died?). Frankly, Scarlett, I don't give a damn. As for the direction, if Scorcese hadn't done better work than this, he'd be an obscure footnote. I expected to like this movie a lot more than I did.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Truly one of the best films ever made,This movie gets better and better every time i watch this. Robert De Niros amazing performance of a lonely man who is badly misunderstood by a society of charming 70's. A man who trays to make world cleaner and better place by driving taxi is martin scorseses absolute masterpiece and truly his best direction so far. I just cannot find nothing to complain. Did you know sexual scenes between Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster aren't really between them Jodies sister had to do them because she was full-aged and Jodie was Really only 12. And did you also knew that Cybill Shepherd who acted Betsy in movie was scared for real couse Robert De Niros performance was so real.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My favorite Scorsese film of all time,"There is no doubt that Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is a cinematic masterpiece. This movie shows how life can be flipped once you've isolated yourself from society. Also this movie inspired many other films like Joker and maybe even uncut gems. I love Robert De Niro in this, Hes scary and almost true to the character 😭",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A masterclass in filmmaking and acting,"Unhinged and unable to sleep, Vietnam War veteran Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) takes up a job as night-time New York City cab driver. Amongst the filth and depravity of the night-time New York streets, Travis comes across a twelve-year old prostitute called Iris (Jodie Foster). Feeling like it is his duty to protect his preadolescent, Travis begins to succumb to a previously-suppressed urge for violence within him.'Taxi Driver' easily ranks amongst the greatest films ever made, and is arguably also Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro's best film (though there are other valid contenders too). What makes the film so good is that it's the perfect snapshot of the time – late seventies, an America that is still reeling from the horrors of Vietnam, with that disillusionment and depravity so beautifully portrayed. But, despite the film being so rooted in time, it manages to remain relevant today almost 40 years later. This could be watched in 2013, and still resonate with the viewer as much as it would have done in the seventies.Obviously, the main draw of the movie is Mr DeNiro. And, yes, he is incredible. From the very first shot, he is sublime. The film has often been described as a horror movie and, if you go with that line of thinking, then DeNiro is easily the monster. His cheeky grins and boyish looks are hiding a sinister side – as the film goes on, and the façade slips, Bickle becomes frightening. It's amazing to see DeNiro make that transformation.In the deserved praise heaped on DeNiro, I think the power of Jodie Foster's performance is somewhat underrated. At only twelve years, having to play the role she does, Foster is amazing. Not many kids that age would play a prostitute, but she does it, and does it brilliantly. I've never been a massive fan of Foster's work, but she certainly does a stellar job in this movie.Another great aspect of the movie is the score. Again, the horror movie theory is backed up by the downright frightening theme music. More than an actual tune, it is almost a warning drone. Rising brass instruments, loud and brash, it is haunting and creates the perfect ambiance for the film.I could go on and on about all the other good things about the movie (Cybill Shepherd, Scorsese's cameo, the aesthetic violence, the visceral nature of the film, the script), but I'd be here forever. If you haven't seen it already, shame on you. See it now. It's an education in cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Remake  in preproduction,Remake is slated to start filming soon staring Eric the midget as Travis Bickle and Colon Quinn slated to direct. Some speculate that this project might not get off the ground due to Colins busy schedule and Eric's ability to become difficult to deal with. Colin has a short list of other actors he would like to use in various roles such as Crazy Alice and High Pitch Eric though none can be confirmed. Diana Degarmo and Katharine Mcphee are said to be in negotiations with the films producers. Look for an early fall release of this sure to be epic.Spoiler note Eric the actor will fly with balloons. Eric says he is looking forward to filming soon and the posiblity of a love scene between himself and Degarmo,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Full Crackdown on a hypocritical lonely mind,"Robert De Niro was born August 17, 1943, but he came alive when Taxi Driver hit the screen.Quite frankly, all angles looked at, all emotions carefully examined, every inch of this movie thought about, you are left with one thought... ""Is what is pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods"" See, you can watch this movie with an IQ of 100 and come out saying woah that was quite an amazing movie, but if you are just slightly smarter than the average person you will come out pondering your own sense of good/evil.Right wing views, left wing views, centralised views are all presented in this wonderfully crafted movie through the eyes of De niro a common guy, a taxi driver, a lonely law abiding man who just cannot stand the very society he lives in.I could ramble on the series of flawless performances in this movie especially De Niro but I commenting merely to point out that this movie deals with some very important questions.The bottom line is that if you react to crime with a harsh line does that make you equal to the original crime or is subvertion to law allowed in extreme cases?

My extended review of the film,"'Taxi Driver' has deservedly earned a reputation as one of the best films of 1976. It has however also often been called one of the best films of all time. Whilst it is a brilliant piece of cinema, with a superb lead performance and some excellent camera-work, it is nevertheless hard for me to agree with the claim of it as an all-time great.To start with the good things, 'Taxi Driver' is excellently directed. The whole atmosphere of the streets of New York is captured very well, both in the daytime and at night. The film has a great visual style, giving the streets a dreamlike quality, and it all feels very realistic, or at least up until the final 15 minutes. The cinematography captures De Niro's journey perfectly, with zooms, steady-cam and panning all carefully distributed and edited into the film.It is a character study of a man alone and it definitely digs deep into the protagonist. We are given an insight into his loneliness and are subjected to his social ineptitude. Some of his actions still seem a tad unrealistic, like with the movie date he goes on, but in general, Travis Bickle is quite a well written character, and De Niro plays him sensationally. Every single movement on his face is carefully observed, and it left me wondering all the time whether or not he is insane.However, this is a point when some of the quirks I have with the film occur. For a character study we get to know relatively little about Travis' background. He served in the marines and now he is a taxi driver. At one stage of the film he listens to a speech about Vietnam vets fighting for better treatment. Does this mean that Travis served in Vietnam, and did Vietnam drive him insane? We never really get to know. This is not necessarily a bad thing as such, as it adds to his mysteriousness, and the film still survives, but it did at least have me groping for a bit more.Also while discussing De Niro's high quality performance, what pops into mind is how the other performers in the film were. And that is a bit of problem in my books. Foster received a lot of critical attention at the time of the film's release for playing a prostitute so young. Yet, looking at her in retrospect she hardly does anything with her character. Or what there is of her character, and there is not all too much there, other than that she is younger than the average prostitute, and like the average prostitute, she is sort of unhappy with her work, but yet manages to get by okay. In fact, none of the characters other than Travis' are well developed or well acted. Sure, they aren't poorly written and performed, but 'Taxi Driver' does have to survive on just one good performance and one good character. And actually, considering that, the film gets by quite well.But all that said, Martin Scorsese has a memorable cameo role as a taxi passenger who might just be slightly madder than Travis. Interestingly, from what I've read, Scorsese only took the part because the actor assigned to play the character did not show up on the day of shooting, and despite that Scorsese actually gives off the second best performance in the film, right after De Niro's.A couple of other points worth noting on the negative side are the meandering nature of the film and the music. Neither of these aspects subtracts much from the film, but they do add to the charge that it is not quite a perfect film. The picture wanders around quite a bit to show the nature of De Niro's mind, but this does make it a tad tiresome to follow about. As for the music used in the film, Bernard Herrmann's score is highly memorable and great to listen to, but it is more so dinner music rather than a fitting score for such a realistically grim film.In spite of the problems that I have with the film that I have already mentioned, it is a very solid watch until the final 15 minutes. The film is all rather well put together, and if were not for the film's reputation of perfection, the points I've mentioned would be hardly worth going into detail about. But, the final 15 minutes of the film do seal it as something that I would be cautious to call perfect.The ending is not weak, but compared to the rest of the film the final few scenes are highly unrealistic. The violence and brutality is the type that you would expect in a cartoon, and what happens to Travis in the end is so unrealistic that some have their own interpretations about a sense of reality. But it is hard to discuss this without revealing details that may ruin one's first viewing of the film.At this point in time, I have only seen 8 films from Martin Scorsese, and 'Taxi Driver' is one of only four that I've seen twice. However, I would still be inclined to call it Scorsese's best film. It pretty well made all round, even if not pretty to watch, and perhaps it is one of the best films of the 1970s. There is however enough in it for me to have my reservations about saying how great it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scorsese's Masterpiece,"This movie have everything, from great script and direction to great performances and edition. We all know, and for those who do not, that Martin Scorsese is an auteur type of director so that he introduces a little of his persona into the film so that we may find things like the music of rock n roll or jazz, plot in the streets or gangs in his movies, because of the life he lived on the streets plus his drug addition to those times. But anyways, talking about the film, Taxi Driver it's indeed a masterpiece. The main character is an unstable Vietnam veteran that uses to work at nights as a taxi driver and every night he encounters new situations with his passengers that even can lead to a murder of another person. This man hates the people that are prostitutes, murderers and all kind of low persons out in the street that he sees every night and he decides that if government don't eliminate people like that, he will get rid of them by himself but as time passes he meets this young girl who works as a prostitute and decides to help her get out from her misery.In this movie we often hear the jazz music and see variations of camera angles, which it all describes the protagonist puzzled mind. It's really enjoyable to watch,one of the best performances by Robert De Niro. If you're a Scorsese or De Niro's fan this movie is for you, only because is a drama film doesn't mean you'll get bored, instead, you will grow more interested into Martin Scorsese films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best films of all-time,"Taxi Driver is an important film of the 70's and above else is one of the best films of all-time for sure. The whole story to this magnificent movie is simply great. Even though it basically tells about a taxi cab driver the whole time and him just driving around and picking up scums. Robert DeNiro who the main character in this movie is also the narrator and it's just simply amazing how he tells about the bad people on the streets and how this city needs to be cleaned up. I just couldn't put in words how much the movie was very descriptive. The actors were excellent and that was the first movie, I think Jodie Foster has played in as she was a 12 year old forced to be prostitute and Harvey Keitel, being the rude and furious owner.

kind of reserved and quiet no matter how bad-ass his character is,"I have always been a fan of Robert Deniro, so I went into this movie already a little biased. That being said, I loved this movie. After finally watching it after years of hearing it referenced (without knowing it most of the time) I am so glad I finally watched it. For years I had been referencing ""You talking to me?"" without knowing where it came from. Being on the younger side of the audience for this film, I am used to seeing Deniro in rolls as an older gentleman (grandfather/father/older gangster type), kind of reserved and quiet no matter how bad-ass his character is. Travis sure was, for lack of a better word, a character. I got weird vibes from him in the beginning, then I hated him because he was creepy, then I realized he's a pretty good guy and I started to like him, then I was back to hating him because he was weird and kind of a jerk and really getting crazy when it came to Betsy and then Iris. In the end, he is the creepiest yet the most self-sacrificing, thoughtful character I've seen portrayed. The plot of the film itself was crazy, all over the place, constantly keeping you on your toes. I love how the narration and voice over is set up, I think that's what really sealed the deal of this being great for me. I will definitely be watching this again and it will be added to my long list of favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Critical Reflection on Taxi Driver,"Taxi Driver (1976) is undeniably a masterfully crafted and thought-provoking film, though it may not represent the pinnacle of Martin Scorsese's illustrious career. While his direction here is superb, other films in his repertoire, such as Raging Bull or Goodfellas, arguably achieve even greater heights in storytelling and thematic depth.The film stands out for its meticulous portrayal of urban decay and personal alienation in 1970s New York. Scorsese's use of lighting, framing, and the city itself as a character immerses the viewer in the dark and gritty atmosphere. The story of Travis Bickle, brought to life with an iconic performance by Robert De Niro, serves as a vessel for exploring complex questions about morality, loneliness, and societal dysfunction.De Niro's portrayal of Bickle is a high point of the film, balancing the character's paradoxical traits. Travis is neither a hero nor a helpless victim; he embodies a mix of good intentions and deep flaws, which positions him as both a redeemer and a disruptor. Supporting performances, particularly from Jodie Foster as the young Iris, complement De Niro's intensity and contribute significantly to the film's emotional weight.The narrative critiques the urban culture of violence and isolation but leaves the viewer wondering why Scorsese chose to focus on these themes. While the film's exploration of loneliness and societal collapse resonates deeply, the motivations for such commentary feel slightly underdeveloped, leaving some ambiguity regarding the filmmaker's perspective.Bernard Herrmann's score is another standout element, amplifying the emotional tension and surreal qualities of the film. His music encapsulates both the chaos of New York and Travis's internal struggles, creating an auditory experience that lingers in the audience's mind long after the credits roll.Despite its many strengths, Taxi Driver is not without flaws. The pacing occasionally falters, with certain scenes feeling drawn out or repetitive. Additionally, the blending of social critique and personal narrative, while compelling, sometimes leaves thematic threads underexplored.In conclusion, Taxi Driver is a cinematic achievement that combines powerful storytelling, exceptional acting, and masterful direction to delve into the complexities of human nature and societal decay. While not the ultimate representation of Scorsese's genius, it remains an enduring classic and a must-watch for those seeking films that challenge and provoke.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Martin Scorsese shows his immeasurable genius with this CLASSIC movie!,"Taxi Driver has become such a staple of modern cinema that it's become cliche to call it a classic film; needless to say I firmly stand by this status-quo for the film and I love it for the neo-noir psychological drama I see it for. This is a film truly exploiting its complicated time-period and all the post-'Nam trauma Americans suffered because of the costly tirade. And who else other than Robert De Niro to showcase a grungy story about late-1970s New York involving cinema's most famous taxi-driver: Travis Bickle?This is not a film for casual-movie lovers: Taxi Driver is a subtle, psychological and violent film that speaks volumes about the psychology of war-veterans trying to keep a normal life for themselves. Travis Bickle is a traumatized but street-weary soul who means well, but he can't overcome his droll post-war trauma and day-to-day; he's a misunderstood man who is never truly empathized by any of the supporting characters, but the film's audience does. Travis is the sort of character made for cinema whereas any other medium would've worked against the point they're making with Travis; loneliness is hard to depict in a non-expository manner and it takes the big-screen to show how isolation really feels. Travis wants to clean the streets of what he sees as 'filth' but he has involuntarily BECOME part of that filth himself. We're with him all the way, but we can't help but feel sorry for him and his mental-illnesses that he carries with him throughout the story.Taxi Driver is one of cinema's finest masterpieces that's still as relevant today as it was in the 1970s. It's period-cinema that still has a lot to say about mental-illness in its 70s context, and in a contemporary context. Truly a genius work of art that has no equal. 5/5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"One of the most curious, thrilling films I've ever seen","""In every city in the world, there is a nobody, wanting to be somebody."" That's what the words said on the poster for Martin Scorsese's masterpiece of a movie, ""Taxi Driver""!! Our ""nobody"" here is Vietnam War Veteran, Travis Bickle, a taxi driver in New York City. He's a very lonely man, despising the crime and scum brewing and lingering in New York, wondering when his Sign will come to him, so he can take a stand against it all. Eventually, with the addition of a pretty woman named Betsy, a mysterious, but seemingly well meaning President candidate, Charles Palantine, and a child prostitute named Iris, Travis sees his Calling, and prepares to destroy his loneliness, and fill his life and mind up with something he sees as loyalty. He's ready to embark on a mission and adventure, the world will never forget!Travis Bickle is one of the most curious movie characters I've ever been introduced too! Through his narration, and hobbies, he really makes you want to acquire the power of mind reading; I really was wondering, ""What is going on inside his head?"" Travis's personality really made me think and wonder...
For a few years, I was very unsure of watching this movie, particularly because a young Jodi Foster was playing a child prostitute. But after seeing her performance in this movie, and in another movie of her's called ""The Little Girl who Lives Down the Lane"", I must confess, that I've highly underestimated her!! She was excellent! So smart and mature, knowing exactly what the scenarios were, and how to find the right character and personality! She and Robert DeNiro had pretty good chemistry together; I loved how Travis truly cared for Iris, wanting to save her from this life she was living, believing, ""This is no way for a pretty, innocent, 12 year old to live!""
As the movie progressed, I constantly found myself asking, ""How's it gonna end?!"" Well, it ended in an excellent, breathtaking, and hopeful way! However, I won't spoil it for you; you MUST see it for yourself! I HIGHLY insist!!As the credits rolled, I was totally flushed with giddiness, happiness, and hope!

Take time to hitch a ride with this eerie Scorsese masterpiece.,"What a wonderful and timeless film Taxi Driver is, a film that delves into the human mind and gets stuck into the psychology behind certain living conditions and past events that still haunt. The film was written by a man then on the brink in Paul Schrader, but a man with a brilliant mind all the same whilst it was directed by one of America's more up and coming contemporary filmmakers in Martin Scorsese. The two minds come together and Taxi Driver is the result, one of my personal favourites and a landmark of sorts in modern cinema.I wonder if Taxi Driver is one of, if not the, closest examples of an American film that is an out-and-out art film. A film that is shot on everyday locales with no intent whatsoever to prolong any sort of cause and affect driven narrative and quite deliberately focusing on the development of one individual who shares every single scene the movie presents us with, bar one. It's the sort of film that could very well have been happening as it was being shot and certainly, with events involving a certain John Hinckley in 1981, dug so deep as to inspire real life. In this sense Taxi Driver could well be compared to certain famous and recognised films found in certain cannons; films like post-war Italy's 'The Bicycle Thieves' and Mexico's neo-realistic 'The Forgotten Ones'. Shooting into the 21st Century, we have a recent effort from Mali entitled 'Bamako', again a film shot on the streets with no real narrative to speak of but a progression of a situation driven by politics and study.Taxi Driver's anchor is its study of its locale as seen through the eyes of its lead character, Travis Bickle whom is played in a globally recognised performance by Robert De Niro, himself on the verge of greatness amongst Hollywood's acting circles. The space in which Bickle inhabits could be seen as a 'post-war' space; a space of which has become decayed and of a lower 'quality' through the government's focus on Vietnam happening several thousand miles away, something few people believed in as it wore on. As a result, the government's attention to its own home has waned and the metropolis that is New York City has become what it has become according to Travis himself, who incidentally chastises a politician for the state as to which the city has got to.Travis Bickle is a lone soul in a setting complete with the sorts of individuals that make it more unbearable. There is a lot of gazing in the film, indeed the second shot of the entire film, and the first that doesn't establish the title of the film, is Travis' eyes following something as the film's theme plays over the image. Slyly, it is a shot at the very beginning establishing the general theme of observing what's around you and figuring a subjective viewpoint. What Travis sees is what he tells us through his diary entries and voice-overs as he drives past the subjects late at night, going through a list of derogatory words. Additionally, his fellow taxi drivers talk in an un-pc manner and the resentment is consistent.But Bickle's perspective is only as distorted as it's ever going to be. Travis doesn't choose to visit museums in order to observe works or art or indeed go to the cinema in order to watch the latest movie in an attempt to escape life for a brief few hours; instead, he delves deeper into the grime and watches pornographic films in-between bumping into underage prostitutes and their pimps as well as organising deals with gun runners. What Travis believes to be the one shining light amidst all the garbage lies in Betsy (Shepherd), a woman working as a campaign volunteer for the mayoral candidate Charles Palantine (Harris) and the same individual Travis gave a lift to. His attraction to this girl brings about some of the more harrowing scenes the film delivers and moves the film, perhaps somewhat unfortunately, into a study of the stalker. But that only runs from him getting her out on a date to a certain phone call that even the camera is supposedly too embarrassed to eavesdrop on.Scorsese shoots the film in a grimy and gritty fashion, using low angles and utilising the steam that pours out the vents dotted around the streets - an open sewer indeed. A lot of the film is shot at night; the daytime is almost an escape from the madness we're being forced to focus on through Bickle's own unhinged perspective. Bernard Hermann's score sets a perfect pitch for the film during the opening shots of the taxi gliding by, combining a smooth and easy to listen to jazz melody with a more brutal, more hard hitting grungy theme that beautifully sets in motion Bickle's overall mindset of this 'one thing on the surface' but is able to change into something far more violent all the same. Taxi Driver is one of those films anyone serious about cinema should see and it has remained right near the top of my favourites ever since I first saw it a couple of years ago and was blown away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great lowlife film,"The most interesting thing I found in it is the tender scene of Sport and Iris. I still couldn't figure out what exactly does it mean. It came from nowhere and took a long time and Sport looked so full of true love and compassionate to Iris and even the entire human race! I think that's the most unusual element. And Martin Scorsese's madness is also interesting, maybe that's what persuaded the killer finally made up his mind. When Travis pointed his gun to the mirror and talked ironically to himself: ""You talking to me?!"" I couldn't laugh, on the contrary I feel sympathy for him, maybe myself too. Good movies sometimes are like a mirror that reflects our own weakness. And the camera-work is brilliant, as hypnotic as the jazz score, and those slow motions which show us what Travis see with his tired eyes recall the beautiful opening of the Last Waltz. This film also reminds me a lot of Joy Division's Love Will Tear Us Apart. A young man who suffered from the material world, tried many solutions but all failed (When routine bites hard, and ambitions are low, and resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow), then he decided to do something really usually (And we're changing our ways, taking different roads). But is he saved? The streets were still dirty and Betsy's smile couldn't move him anymore.

Deniro is excellent as the disturbed Travis Bickle and carries the picture.  Scorsese's direction is unusual but effective and although at times we don't feel like the story is going anywhere we don't care because this film is more about the life of a disturbed man rather than a ""movie"" about the life of a disturbed man(if you know what I mean).

A Dark and Intense Exploration of Loneliness and Despair,"Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is a haunting, atmospheric portrayal of a man's descent into madness and violence. The film follows Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a mentally unstable Vietnam War veteran who works as a night-shift taxi driver in New York City. Struggling with feelings of isolation and disillusionment, Bickle becomes obsessed with the idea of cleaning up the city's moral decay, leading him down a dangerous and unpredictable path.Scorsese's direction is masterful, capturing the gritty, neon-lit streets of 1970s New York and blending it with Travis's inner turmoil. The film's sense of unease is amplified by its slow-burn pacing, allowing the audience to feel Bickle's growing paranoia and alienation. De Niro delivers one of his most iconic performances, transforming Travis into a complex and tragic figure, whose erratic behavior and twisted sense of justice keep the viewer captivated.The film's exploration of loneliness, alienation, and the dark side of urban life is profound and unsettling. Bernard Herrmann's haunting score adds to the film's atmosphere, underscoring the tension and despair that permeate Travis's psyche.

Are you talking to me?,"Personally this is my favorite Martin Scorsese's film, I've watched it maybe five times and I still didn't get tired of it. Actually every time I watch it, I find something else good about it. Also I think that this is the best Robert De Niro's role, he is one of my favorite actors and I've seen many his movies but this one is the best. This film is about a guy who has sleeplessness problems, so he get himself a taxi drivers job on a night shift. Because of sleeplessness and some other problems in his personal life he gets more and more obsessed with idea of cleaning the city from all kinds of low-lives. All characters of the movie were portrayed very realistic.

Taxi Driver: My Favorite,"Taxi Driver (1976). A movie about a Viet Nam vet, who takes a job as a nighttime cab driver, and eventually loneliness makes him what to do something violent. Now I normally don't put this up for older movies but I must say SPOILERS, because I will probably be giving away major plot points. Robert De Niro plays our main protagonist, Travis Bickle. De Niro's performance as Travis is the best I've ever seen in a movie, he's able to be a very relatable person with a hint of insanity in him, to the second half of the movie being psychotic, but somehow still likable The rest of the cast did pretty good. Jodie Foster's performance as Iris was good especially considering she was only 14 at the time. I loved the way the movie was able to show nighttime New York. It made it seem very reasonable why Travis hates the scum in the city. The music in the movie, was just a glorious thing to hear, it was mostly the saxophone and it fit the way New York's atmosphere was set up really well. The way the camera moves and catches whats happening, the angles and all are another reason why this is a great one. Palentine is the fictional senator in this movie that Betsy, the girl Travis is trying to date, works for. Betsy is at first a very likable character, but as Travis starts to dislike her so does the audience, a very good feat in the movie. The part when Travis's psychology takes a turn is when he takes a passenger to watch his wife silhouette in another man's apartment. Its a very disturbing and unsettling scene in the movie, but it's also one of the most important moments, because you can tell from the way the passenger is talking about killing his wife with a 44. Magnum and how Travis reacts and looks, that the passenger had given him an idea. This is when the loneliness starts to turn to violence. After that Travis starts to build himself an arsenal. A very good scene is when Travis is buying guns from easy Andy, it's great because of the way it's all played out. Another great thing about the movie is how you slowly start to see what Travis's plan is . Until it's revealed that he's going to kill Palentine, the buildup to the assassination is extremely suspenseful, all the tension rises until, the assassination fails. Most people probably know that the climax of the movie is a shootout among Travis and pimps, and lowlifes to save Iris. It's a very violent and shocking part, for today's standards, I can only imagine what it was like in 76.The movie overall, was downright amazing, one of the best and favorites of the movies I've seen. It's strengths lies in it's excellent performance by Robert De Niro, the amazing directing from Martin Scorsese, the incredible writing from Paul Schrader, the music, everything that's set into motion makes this movie as great as it is, and it earns a 10 out of 10, one of 10 to get this high of a rating form me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
It's a long way from Hollywood to here,"Watching ""Taxi Driver"" again, after a thirty year gap from my first viewing, it's clear that the film has lost none of its power. It's dark, grimy and utterly without redemption. Ambiguity pervades the story from start to finish. The ending could be the beginning with the cycle starting anew. Marvellous.Robert De Niro, as disturbed war veteran Travis Bickle, is the beating heart of the film. Except that he doesn't have a heart. Or maybe he does but he just can't find it. He's as isolated from himself as he is from the rest of humanity. He can't relate to them and every attempt to connect shines a light on his dysfunction.It's a remarkable performance from an actor at the start of his career where all of his preparation for the role pays off. I mean would a modern actor really work as a real-life cabbie for several months to get into the head of his character?Anyway Bickle's disconnect is amplified by the wonderful cinematography and soundtrack. This is a world of moist darkness and hard edges. Neon lights glisten and disorientate while the score jags and saws relentlessly emphasising the ever present sense of danger both on the streets and as reflected by Bickle.Around him we have Jodie Foster as a child prostitute (which is as disturbing as it sounds), Harvey Keitel weighing in as her pimp and Cybill Shepherd providing the angelic contrast to Foster's descent. It's top-notch casting with each of the characters managing to look normal (which they are not) compared to Bickle.Does ""Taxi Driver"" deserve a spot in the Top 100 films ever made list? Well I don't know but probably yes. What I do know is that the movie impresses in just about every dimension which is impressive for an arthouse flick. Sure the names on the screen are pure Hollywood but I've got to believe that the producers didn't know what they would be getting!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Truly Amazing And Remarkable Character Sketch.,"This is Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese's best movie. Although Scorsese has done better pieces of film, this still surpasses them. De Niro does his best performance and was robbed of his Oscar win. Yes, his performance in better than Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. Raging Bull is Scorsese's best piece of film and De Niro's second best performance.Taxi Driver is one of those movies that are almost biographical as they centre on just one person. Centring on just one person means the character and plot development are going to be very sharp and deep. This is about a former soldier scared from his experiences and gets a job in New York driving a taxi during nights for twelve hours. He falls in love with a girl named Betsy, but the relationship fails. As he keeps slipping into a world of isolation, depression and anxiety, he becomes determined to fix up the streets and make the world better. He plans to assassinate a Senator and save a child (Jodie Foster) from prostitution and her pimp (Harvey Keitel). We see exactly what is in the mind of De Niro as he grows more into a mentally unstable state. What's cool is, he becomes a hero in the process. The American Film Institute ranked Travis Bickle (De Niro) in their list of Top 50 Villains. I don't get why that is. He cleans up the streets and saves a child from prostitution.This is the second best character study film in history, on after Citizen Kane.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""Are You Talking To Me?""","In my opinion I think that Taxi Driver is the best film ever made. Really I do, and I think this for many valid reasons.1) The cast is so well integrated together that the overall effect of the characters is amazing, they have believable feelings and reactions to each other, and they carry the proper responses that real people would be considered to have, such as when DeNiro fantastically slips in professional fillers into his conversations with Betsy (Cybil Sheppard) or Iris (Played brilliantly by 14 year old Jodie Foster) and he seems to act accordingly to what is meant to be spontaneous speech, and the way he does this makes everything seem that more realistic, he also make for convincing viewing as he begins to lose his mind and buy guns and talk to himself. The slow winding down is portrayed to perfection by DeNiro and the more paranoid and more extreme his behaviour becomes, that little by little you know something big will happen but you don't know when, and it is this subtlety that makes it hard to tell when he actually became mad, it is feasible even to say he was mad at the start. It is this outstanding performance that he SHOULD have won the Best Actor Oscar in 1976 for this outstanding performance.Cybil Sheppard makes a believable love interest, and her interest in music and the finer things is seriously well shown through her sheer displeasure in Travis Bickle (DeNiro) taking her to a porno movie for a date. Jodie Foster is a 12 year old hooker who even though she hides her yearning to get out of the sleaze you can still tell she wants to, heck scratch that, you can tell that she needs to, via her occasional moments of jokiness and solidarity with Travis.Harvey Kietel and Peter Boyle also make for good support, and even Martin Scorsese is convincingly repulsive as the man who wants to kill his wife and her lover.2) The story is totally unpredictable and original. The story is just mind-blowing, it is like Paul Schrader pulled it out of a hat or something, or he cut bits of one story, and bits of another and bits of something else and then glued them together to get a story of such brilliance and such suspense. It is this unpredictability that makes it so good. It isn't like an Alien sequel in which you know that half the crew of dick heads will get killed by the creature in some unimaginative way, and somehow one or two will end up killing it, or escaping. Taxi Driver is different in the way in which it is unpredictable and makes for compulsive viewing.3) The quotes are fantastic. Things like - ""Are you talking to me..."" and others that are quite astounding such as Betsy saying "" You're a walking contradiction.""This is surprisingly true, DeNiro talks about the sleaze and dirt he hates so much but indulges in porn movies. He claims to hate the trash that clutters the streets but his apartment is still pretty dirty. This revelation of identity is quite good to watch.4) The film has undertones of comedy, drama, suspense thriller and maybe even horror. It is a funny character study and is unlike anything else I have ever seen.These are the valid reasons and I think that Taxi Driver deserved more awards than it got, and should go down in history as a true cult classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Robert De niro at his finest,"This is one of the best drama movie I've ever seen..and once again, Robert De niro satisfies me with one of his best performances ever (behind 'The Godfather part 2').The real brilliance of this movie is that you can still enjoy watching it after 30 years since it's been made (like I did). The development of the events is convincing and hilarious. The direction is nearly perfect for its year, Martin Scorsese proved with this movie that he'll be having such a wonderful future in direction which he really showed us after that with such amazing movies (The departed, Casino, Goodfellas..etc).The cinematography did serve the picture very well and helps you to see the world from Travis's point of view...the dark side of the city..the dark side of the world. Finally, I must say that the movie score is one of the best scores ever been made to keep you tension and nervous so that you can feel and understand what Travis feels and wants. I recommend this masterpiece to any one who wants to watch a real classic masterpiece and enjoy two hours of excellent acting ad direction...",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Well Done but Poorly Marketed,"I was expecting a lot from Taxi Driver, which is appropriate considering it's ratings. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations.Taxi Driver's biggest problem was that it was poorly marketed. It claimed that the plot was about a taxi driver trying to save a prostitute, and it was...for the last 20 or so minutes. Not that the other 1 hour and 40 minutes was uninteresting, it just wasn't what I expected.The acting is done very well. De Niro sells his character extremely well in particular, and makes him feel very real. The other actors are great too, but De Niro really takes the cake.The plot was still interesting, despite the poor advertisement. It was simple for the majority of it, yet it was still interesting. It was well-paced and at times funny.Overall Taxi Driver is a solid movie that was just poorly marketed. When I read about it it sounded more like an action/drama/crime movie, but it was more drama than anything. I'll probably watch it again, this time with a more knowledgeable mindset now that I've seen it once. Nevertheless, it's well done and I probably would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The loner who wants to bring in the Apocalypse,"I will be honest, I struggled to appreciate Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"". Despite the insightful script by the self-consuming Paul Schrader who created one of the most opaque and great film characters of all time, Travis Bickle, frighteningly good portrayed by Robert De Niro there was nothing that I could put my hand on. But I did not hate it either, and I felt if I was not praising it, I would be doing something wrong.The reason why I believe it was so difficult to enjoy this film is because this film is not made to be enjoyed, is made to be experienced. We are put in intimacy with Travis Bickle, but he is a sick man. An incurable loner and a racist, he seems unable to connect with anybody. It is like a disease. So we feel his frustration and his anger. He blames his inability to bond with other human beings on the world. He would want an apocalypse that would clean all the ""scum"" off the streets yet throughout the movie, he keeps attempting to connect with it. This inner struggle and his lack of understanding of his own condition makes this movie a nightmare, yet one constructed on a deep psychological level.I feel Scorsese has a love-hate relationship with New York, the city where this movie takes place. He depicts it in a noire-inspired style, steam rising from the canals and surrounded by a bleakness as if hell itself lurks just below. But New York is something else for everyone and here, we see it through the eyes of a self-inflicted sociopath. Throughout the movie, Travis tries again and again to socialize and it is difficult and painful watching him fail. He first tries to flirt with the cashier at an X-rated cinema he frequently visits, he then briefly dates a political volunteer--everything ends in failure yet he keeps struggling through this Sisyphean nightmare just hoping to find something.Travis Bickle it's a difficult man to comprehend. Another reason why I struggled to love this movie is because I felt like so many of his philosophies, his thoughts were hidden away from me. He does not speak a lot and the gap between his words and his actions leave much to the interpretation. Scorsese and Schrader briefly reveal to us his thoughts through narration but these are more haunting and disturbing than explanatory. The way he would repeat his last sentence with emphasis denotes an insane determination, almost like a mind-control.But there is one thing to realize about Bickle--he is looking for a purpose which he finds when he attempts to rescue a young prostitute who ran away from home. In his insanity, his appearance and mannerisms become more and more twisted yet you can feel a determination because he feels he is heading towards some sort of peace. Then there is, of course, the ending. It's impossible to know whether it is real or not but in both cases this is true--it represents his most hidden desires. He just wants to mean something. The sudden way in which the film takes a turn towards a more positive atmosphere is so sudden that you have a feeling it was done intentional. It is impossible for Scorsese not to be aware of such a sudden slope.""Taxi Driver"" can be a depressing film. The way Bickle drives his yellow cab through the slums feels like Dante taking his tour through hell. But what an achievement for Scorsese and Schrader. They took a man impossible to connect to and they made us connect to it. What I realized after watching this movie and what made me decide that it is, indeed, a masterpiece was just how relatable Travis Bickle can actually be. How many of us are looking for peace? How many of us have attained it and how many still have hope that they will attain it eventually?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good film,"The directing is first class and deservedly made path for Scorsese as a world renowned violent artist. Some techniques he used here are unusual for American cinema, like focusing on details for a few seconds. The movie is enhanced by an excellent music soundtrack by jazz composer Bernard Herrman who died before the picture was even released.Two of the actors also deservedly made it to stardom. Robert de Niro plays a very unglamorous character, but his presence on screen is so intense that it's no wonder it made such an impression. As for Jodie Foster, she already appeared in films as a child, but playing a teenage prostitute was certainly not an easy challenge, and probably it was that role that really turned her into a major actress.""Taxi Driver"" was a big hit when it came out, both for the public and the critics. It won the Palme d'Or in Cannes, and served as a trend setter for many later films, like for instance Quentin Tarantino's and Abel Ferrara's. But even today, the original model seems difficult to emulate, probably because achieving a masterpiece is a rare thing, by definition.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Experience the raw intensity of Scorsese's masterpiece:,"Taxi Driver, directed by Martin Scorsese and released in 1976, is undoubtedly one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of cinema. This powerful film tells the story of Travis Bickle, a lonely and disturbed Vietnam War veteran who drives a taxi through the seedy streets of New York City. As he becomes increasingly disillusioned with society, he becomes more and more unstable, and ultimately sets out on a violent mission to clean up the streets.From its stunning cinematography to its deeply complex characters and themes, Taxi Driver is a film that has stood the test of time and continues to resonate with audiences today. Robert De Niro's performance as Travis Bickle is nothing short of extraordinary, as he brings to life a character who is simultaneously terrifying and deeply sympathetic.One of the film's greatest strengths is its exploration of the dark underbelly of urban life in the 1970s. Scorsese's direction is both raw and poetic, as he portrays the city as a place of both beauty and decay, of hope and despair. The film's iconic score by Bernard Herrmann is also worth noting, as it perfectly captures the film's mood of alienation and dislocation.Ultimately, what makes Taxi Driver a masterpiece is its unflinching honesty and intensity. Scorsese does not shy away from the violence and darkness that permeate Travis Bickle's world, but he also finds moments of hope and beauty amidst the chaos. This is a film that challenges its viewers to confront some of the most troubling aspects of the human experience, and it does so with an uncompromising vision and a rare cinematic power.In conclusion, Taxi Driver is a film that has rightfully earned its place in the pantheon of cinematic masterpieces. It is a raw, powerful, and unforgettable work of art that continues to inspire and provoke audiences today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""God's lonely man"" is about to leave his mark on the world.","Taxi Driver is a dark psychological film about how deep a man can lose himself in his thoughts. Travis Bickle(Robert De Niro) is the anti-hero in all his glory. Travis feels like he is the loneliest person on earth, filled with an emptiness he cannot escape no matter where he goes or what he does in life. He is surrounded by all the dirty, disgusting, horrible things this world has to offer and craves for something to wash it all away. That something is Travis himself, the weapon against the scum of humanity. Scorsese's direction is very inventive in Taxi Driver, he uses shots that one would not expect and which brilliantly lead the viewer into Travis' subconscious. Paul Schrader's screenplay is realistic and colorful. Robert De Niro delivers one of his most true-to-life performances and shows just how involved an actor can get in developing a character. Taxi Driver is a film about a nobody, just like anybody, but who hides in his distorted mind's realm. This will always frighten audiences.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
a sometimes painfully slow movie,"first things first - THIS is probably robert de niro's finest performance. the movie though did not win a single oscar, whch is a bit strange, esp. considering the kind of cult following it has AND the critical acclaim it has received.i for one found the movie to be too slow nd meandering and very soft. i think the plot deserved a more hard-hitting script ... which shows the mental troubles of robert de niro in starker light. the movie failed to evoke much feeling in me, the characters felt too distant, i did not feel any pain or pleasure for any of the characters.the dialogs in the movie though are outstanding and memorable. the movie is still definitely worth watching, just for the way it shows the decadent lonely mind at work, in its destructive frame. robert de niro showcases this mind in its stark naked self. however, one just wishes that the movie had a little more punch to it.a moderate 7",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
It's like an urban fever-dream from the 1970s.,"Taxi Driver is one of my favourite movies: it's easily one of Martin Scorsese's finest works and this film further consolidated Robert De Niro's career and stature in the greater Hollywood landscape; this guy masterfully showed Travis Bickle as a truly traumatised, yet super engaging, war-vet attempting to fit in 1970s New York. De Niro is truly in a class of his own in this movie, which portrays loneliness in a way few movies have successfully captured since. It's a sad but excruciatingly well-done neo-noir thriller that gave us the big-screen career breakthrough of Jodie Foster, playing under-age hooker Iris. Yeah: quite the breakthrough right there.Taxi Driver is now over forty years old, and since its release in 1976 it's been cited as one of cinema's GREATEST movies ever, and it's easy to see why. This is was a story that related to outsiders: not just in the broad Western-cultural sense, but in a universal humanistic way. It set the benchmark for lone-wolf stories trying to understand (let alone fit in) society, and showed that Martin Scorsese knew his cinematic senses from the artistic to the uber-sensual character studies and synergy of dedicated actors working off each other like real pros. Travis tries his best to fit in, but he's only really accepted when he's behind the wheel, transporting the city's filth in his yellow vessel. He tries to impress his date Betsy with a recording disc be bought, but Travis just doesn't get what makes for acceptable means of social interaction outside going to a cafe (like taking his date to a porn cinema). We see New York through Travis' eyes and it basically all 'washes over him' until he bumps into Iris, and finds out about her 'job'. He won't have anymore of the city's filth, so he decides to try and help this timid girl escape the deprived lifestyle she's been stuck in for some time; Travis needs to take matters into his own hands and fix what he can in New York City.Need I say anymore about Taxi Driver? It's a neo-noir masterpiece that's managed to transcend space and time in the cinematic medium, with comparable impact to other masterpieces like Citizen Kane, Bicycle Thieves, Seven Samurai, Vertigo, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Godfather, Chinatown, Star Wars and so on.Taxi Driver is the equivalent of Holy Text in cinema; it's that masterful and it's that good a watch. If you're one of those film buffs that's somehow missed out on this movie, just give it a watch right away. This is film history at its finest. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Major TD Fascination Factor is...,"...not the plot, or anything of that sort!It actually amazes me that everyone has missed it, so far.There was once a former U.S. President named Ronald Reagan and a wee, mentally deranged lad named John Hinckley, Junior.Well, this story rather lives on in infamy and will probably do so for a *very* long time.http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reagan/peopleevents/pande02.html---- On March 30, 1981, John Hinckley Jr. set out to win actress Jodie Foster's heart. As ""the greatest love offering in the history of the world,"" the 25-year-old attempted to assassinate Ronald Reagan outside the Washington Hilton hotel. Though flanked by administration members, police officers, and Secret Service agents, Reagan was shot under the left arm. The bullet malfunctioned and failed to explode on impact, seriously wounding but not killing Reagan.In Hollywood, Hinckley saw Martin Scorsese's film ""Taxi Driver"" at least 15 times. A confirmed loner, he apparently identified strongly with the Robert DeNiro character Travis Bickle. In the film, Travis is infatuated with Cybill Shepherd's Betsy, a political campaign worker who rejects him after he takes her to see a porn film. To regain Betsy's attention, Bickle plans, but fails, to assassinate the candidate she works for. Bickle then shifts gears, obsessively devoting himself to protecting 12-year-old prostitute Iris, played by Foster. He decides to shoot Iris' pimp, thereby ensuring his status as a hero to Iris and the media.Screenwriter Paul Schrader based his portrayal of Travis on Arthur Bremer, the would-be assassin of George Wallace whose diaries equate political assassination with celebrity and revenge against impotence and invisibility. Consciously or not, Hinckley began to emulate Bickle, accumulating an arsenal of weapons and fixating on Jodie Foster. Foster would not be his target, but his inspiration: To ""rescue"" her, he began to stalk Jimmy Carter during the 1979 presidential campaign. ----So, this film is really more notable as a ""fuel for the fire"" (so to speak) than it is for anything else that it may have been intended.Interestingly, it escaped condemnation, unlike so many other books, recordings and other such ""bad influences"" that are associated with bad deeds done by demented individuals by various organised (or not) groups that work so hard to attempt prosecution, or oppression of those with whom they do not agree, or find offensive.Such is life. ;-)",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It Would Be So Easy To Go Like Travis Bickle. A MASTERPIECE,"What can be said that hasn't already been said & researched & talked about & obsessed over when it comes to a true pure CLASSIC of cinema history as Martin Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER.This movie really spoke to me because I've felt like Travis most of my life & totally understand that rage, anger & loneliness. I think Travis Bickle is one of the greatest characters ever written & Taxi Driver is easily the greatest film by Director Martin Scorsese. This 70's Masterpiece is timeless with it's themes of loneliness, mental stress/illness, rage, anger, hopelessness & the fear of our savage society. Crime will always be a problem & sometimes Vigilante justice is the only thing that works as we all know the justice system is a joke & doesn't work. Scorsese tapped into something primal & raw within us all & writer Paul Schrader of course.This is Scorsese's Masterpiece.Robert De Niro gives one of the greatest performances to ever grace the screen in the history of cinema & created a character so lost & damaged that he can be so easily relatable as even I've felt like his character Travis Bickle many times as our world is full of evil people & scum ruling the streets & a joke of a justice system so it's so easy to feel that rage & pure anger & hatred for what's happening all around us & we can't do anything!!!So yes Travis Bickle is a legendary classic movie character who i personally can identify with.The sleazy crime filled gutter called New York City of the 70's is gritty & raw on screen & with all the hussle & bussle you can see how Travis would be completely lost in this grimy city of sin.The music is beautiful & the night time world that Travis is cruising around in is captured beautifully with it's glowing neon signs & colourful backgrounds very neo-noir with a touch of urban gothic Horror in a way.Taxi Driver is a vigilante Thriller & a twisted dark crime drama & the greatest of Vigilante film ever made, yes i love Death Wish (1974) but Taxi Driver is a better movie. Also it's supporting cast is excellent with Peter Boyle as Wizard, i loved this character so much & Boyle was fantastic, also Harvey Keitel as pimp, Sport & Jodie Foster as little Iris.We all know the story so I'm gonna leave this review with this:

At the very end when Bickle looks into the taxi mirror with sudden intensity, you know the story of Travis Bickle is not really over.I get a kick out of seeing (semi) old movies and seeing things that have now faded into the past as a part of everyday life, in this case, typewriters.Check out the DVD with the hour-long ""Making of"" documentary added.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Brilliance!,"De Niro at his best. Scorsese at his best. Can't go wrong? Well no you can't. This is one of the greatest films ever. De Niro was robbed of the best actor award in the Oscars that year as was the film itself by Rocky, much as I love the Italian Stallions debut outing. This is a dark and murky character study of a sociopath and a loner who can't seem to find a way to vent his disgust at the world around him. It eats away at him until he finds some focus in a 12 year old prostitute, played excellently by Jodie Foster. Scorseses bleak and unreserved portrayal of New Yorks dark side is often graphic in visual and dialogue and often unsettling but the film is engrossing. It's full to the brim with darkness and pessimism about it's setting and it's central character who seems on a downward spiral until the end, when he finds some redemption thanks to Foster. De Niro is electrifying in a truly legendary performance, told mostly through De Niro's physical performance and telling a story through his eyes. Travis says little but we start to learn what makes him tick because of De Niro's brilliant performance. Also this has a brilliant and unique score.*****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A movie so famous people can quote a line from the movie without having ever seen the film.

Are You Talking To Me...??,"If you are a Scorsese or DeNiro fan then you must have watched this movie. However for those who didn't I would say that this Duo has given us hell of the movies and Taxi Driver is from one of their earliest collaborations. As 90's kid looking DeNiro that young was itself a treat. Travis a nightshift Taxi driver having insomnia, more specifically a Psychopath yet charming indulging himself into scenes and totally go nuts out of nowhere are some of the characteristics of Travis played by DeNiro and he nailed it perfectly the iconic mirror scene 'Are You Talking To Me' is still one of the best scenes I've come a crossed till date.
Cybill Shepherd looked beautiful and looking at 12 years old Jodie Foster was such a delight playing a role of prostitute.

European style of film-making adopted by Martin Scorcese and Paul Schrader.,"Taxi Driver is a good film.There is no doubt about it. However,at this point of time it would be too early or rather naive to call it a classic.This is because there are certain weak spots which deny ""Taxi Driver"" its fair share of a classic film tag.It is a different matter that this film has been hailed as a classic film by various intellectuals,academicians and critics because it is one of the few American films which has managed to have a tremendous socio-political impact on the minds of many young people worldwide no matter where they come from whether Thailand or India.This is the reason why any aspiring actor worth talent can have his/her chest swell with pride while uttering ""You talking' to me?"".In ""Taxi Driver"",director Martin Scorcese and screen writer Paul Schrader have not so successfully amalgamated European style of cinema in an American film.However,this new innovation appears a little tedious as a lot of questions remain unanswered in the film.A good example can be the appearance of Martin Scorcese in a minor role as a cuckolded husband.One could surmise that it is quite possible to leave many questions unanswered as mostly Europeans films adopt such a dissipated story telling technique to perplex audiences.However,this is something new for American cinema as it is traditionally known to favor simple narrative structures.In ""Taxi Driver"", it is scandalous how many characters have been belittled in order to make a valiant hero out of the title character.This will surely irk audiences who are keen on seeing an equitable distribution of roles.There are many academic critics who have spoken about Christian motives of this film.But this is not entirely correct as the truth of the matter is that any film can contain scenes where candles are lighted in front of god's image.The saving grace of this film is Bernard Herrmann's musical score which has given this film its raw and destructive energy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the Top Movies i've ever seen...,"on my list of BAD movies. This movie, of course as you might as well have seen is pretty high ranked in the IMDB top 250 and is also acclaimed by many critics, but I can tell you, this movie sucks. Mainly because of the good grades this movie got by critics and also from critics and I like De Niro and some of Scorsese's films (most of all GoodFellas) I taped this movie when it was on TV a few weeks ago. I started this movie thinking it would some kind of average or just above average movie, because I tend to not like some of those movies that are generally being enjoyed, like The Godfather, I think, even rated very high all the time it deserves a 6 or maybe 7 out of ten. But now getting to the movie, in my TV guide it got 4 out of four and the plot was outlined as, whacko Taxi Driver's life changes dramatically after a meet with someone. After the film starts you get some kind of average, what happpens in the life of a Taxi Diver, then he goes nuts (after 1 hour) and you think, YES, now it'll really begin. He buys guns and eventually even shoots a guy. And then evantually as before ... nothing, it goes on for another 20 minutes or 30 like that and then I just couldn't stand it no more. Nothing happens, this is JUST an average story about the pretty normal life of a man, that changes at a moment(I don't know  if this happened I didn't finish the movie), with average performances from the cast, without any thrills, chills, laughs, brutal scenes, touching moments and so on.......... Seen his good grade on IMDB makes me wanna give it a 1 out of 10, but I'll be nice, I'll give it what it deserves, a 3 out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Harvey Keitel, as always, is very good. And it was great to see Albert Brooks in the movie! The director, Martin Scorsese rocks. Paul Schraeder's screenplay is tight and brutally honest. I really like the score too. The New York street scenes were all very real and gritty.I don't know why they haven;t decided to do a sequel.

You talking' to me?,"Another seminal classic that's been discussed way beyond the point of my input being of any importance. What I will say though is this- if you don't get the hype around either Scorcese or De Niro, then let this change your mind. For me, the real strength of this film is its unrelenting darkness- it's a true horror film in my view and, as a character study, I think it's one of the finest pieces of cinema that I've seen to date. Also, a quick shout out to the score which provides a gritty jazz backdrop which only serves to further the chill that this film will leave you with. Why not a perfect 10? I'd say that the film is pretty slow-paced and, whilst the payoff more than delivers, you may find your patience tested a little bit in the meantime.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Taxi Driver,"In its exploration of the surreal visually, alongside simpler, realist daytime shots of New York City, shows how that line can blur because of something like insomnia. The night shots of the city streets, bathed in different colored traffic or marquee lights, is both visually appealing for the audience and a way to show how Robert De Niro's character, Travis, sees the people who occupy the city.As a cabbie, Travis sees the seedier versions of people, which, when added to his restlessness, turns him to violence, noble or not.The lighting is everything I've been told to expect from footage of the 70s, and it serves the movie incredibly well. Colorful, but not too bright, and often even fluorescent, keeps the movie looking more like the sleazy New York that Travis sees, rather than a professional set.Travis is caught somewhere between the uber-professional and ""normal"" world of Betsy(Cybill Shepherd)(shown primarily in daytime shots of ""normal"" buildings and people, and the seedy underbelly occupied by Iris(Jodie Foster)(shown in the nighttime, blurred by colorful lights, deep shadows, and violence). His ties to both are through wanting, he wants to occupy Betsy's world, and he wants to save Iris, so the combination of these two worlds is strange visually. They're tied together by Travis's internal narration.The filmmaking gets less typical as the movie goes on. As Travis becomes more aggressive, there are scenes like the famous testing of lines in case of confrontation (""You talking' to me?""), clearly chopped together. They really come to a head after a particularly violent point in the movie, seemingly frozen in time.Taxi Driver creatively and powerfully blurs the night and day to tell the story of an insomniac living within that blurry line. It's good-looking, witty, and aggressive (though it exists somewhere between awake and sleep).",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The need for change hides in plain sight,"Even though it's a decade after the beginning of the ""counterculture"" movement we see in films, this one still is a representative of that, even if only a minor one. This film we have Travis, a taxi driver. And one never really thinks about it, but we've all done or said something of a private nature with a sense of security when in truth we weren't alone. So a taxi driver, for example, anyone can hail him, so he has exposure to virtually anyone from all different walks of life and belief systems. A quote from the film is, ""People do anything in front of a taxi driver, I mean anything. People too cheap to rent a hotel room. People who want to embarrass you, it's like you're not even there. It's like, you know, a taxi driver doesn't even exist"" , and ""This city is like an open sewer. You know, it's full of filth and scum He's seen the worst of it. And he does this job everyday. He's had enough and sees a need for a change. When talking to Iris, a child prostitute he tries to save, when planning to assassinate a presidential candidate, where he says ""no"" to going with her somewhere, he says, ""Doing something for the government"".

"A real work of art, in it's unique kind!","This is one of those amazing movies that people learn to like. It is an amazing portrait of New York in the mid-seventies.I think that De Niro is a fabulous actor, and this is his second great movie, doing a fine job as Travis Bickle, the mentally disturbed taxi driver.Martin Scorcese takes you in a trip to the universe of a vietnam veteran who was mentally ill because of that same war. In a time when that theme was so trendy, Scorcese manages to face that theme and escape from the cliché of the patriotic movie, where the americans are the good guys and the eastern (always treated as communists) people are the bad guys, the oppressing dictators. When watching this movie, you get the message of what the war does to one's mind, without looking at war pictures (after all, the action is in NYC, there the war is another) and see the inner battle of a struggling man urging to release all his destructive energy and killer instinct. You don't get many chances to see a movie where a guy starts killing people without  any particular reason and manages to get away as a hero.There are three actors to really look at in this movie, Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster.De Niro, as i said, has his second big movie and really shows us  Travis as a disturbed man, you start to get into the action because he does such a fine job with his charachter.Harvey Keitel is one of those actors that you just love to watch, because he is so charismatic. Whatever his character is, you'll like it.And Jodie Foster had here her big leap for the stardom. She was only 14 and played a runaway girl that starts on hookery for the need of money, i think that's really complicated for a 14 year old girl...It's not a main stream movie, and that's probably why it's so good, it wasn't made to entertain the mass public (for that you have the box-office recordists...). One of the most amazing things in this movie is that, after all the killings, he continues with his life, as if nothing happened. And, of course,  it's one of those movies that have those little lines that stay in everyone's mind for generations...9/10(Are you talkin' to me?!)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
modern masterpiece,"Paul Shrader's undeniable masterpiece of urban alienation.

I know how it felt not being able to see a movie until he was 18, and then having these floodgates open to a world a fleshly pleasures that you aren't quite ready for. As Shrader said, ""it takes a certain kind of white boy"". The combination of Bernard Herrman's magnificent score and Scorcese's direction makes the audience feel somehow sympathetic for this man who seems normal to his peers, yet mentally disturbed to only those who see him when he is alone, the audience.

I would have liked to se a bit more playing around with the script, the movie could have had a bit more depth by adding dynamic interactions between the characters or more effectively using the Taxi theme witch is brilliant.What I believe lifts this movie a notch is how Scorsese does a wonderful job with the scenes giving this movie some parts that I will soon to forget.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Looks like art to me,"I remember beeing a little disappointed after watching Taxi driver for the first time. What's so special about this movie, Travis Bickle just looks like another one of them psychopaths. I just couldn't understand what made this movie one off the best ever, even though De Niros acting was outstanding, possibly his best ever. (Maybe except from Raging bull and Awakenings)Anyway, even though I thougt it was a very good movie altogether, I had problems understanding a few things. Like why did Travis bring Betty to a porn movie, he couldn't possibly be that stupid. Luckily i got the chance to see Paul schraeder make a few remarks about his script, and then,slowly, the whole thing started making sense. If you haven't seen this film, you should stop reading now.Travis Bickle is not stupid, he's just unaware of who he is, a victim to a self-imposed loneliness. He is his own enemy, but he doesn't realize it. The reason he brings Betty to a porn cinema, is that deep inside, probably unaware, he feels that he has to be alone, that's just the way it's supposed to be. He avoids all kinds of actual progress in his life, he has to continue doing things his own way. Another example is the part where he decides to improve his physique. He does 50 push-ups every day, but at the same time he eats all kind of unhealthy food, too make sure he doesn't really get anywhere.Some people say the ending is unrealistic, that Travis Bickle would have gone to prison in real life, instead of becoming a hero. I think that he actually did go to prison, and that the ending we saw was just in his mind. And if I got it wrong, I have too say that I like the irony, even tough it can seam misplaced.The main reason this movie is one of my all time favourites, is that it made me reconsider my life. I realized that I was much more like Travis than I dared too admit to myself, but now I had no choice. Therefore I honestly believe that this movie has gave me a better understanding of who I was, and what I had to do. In other words, it made me aware of my own feelings. Isn't that what art is all about?Remember:You don't need eyes too see, you need VISION.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Psychological,"I was assuming the taxi driver was going to be more of an action/gangster flick. I wasn't expecting it's deep message.This film is on every level psychological. And maybe not something you'd want to watch if you're feeling particularly lonely either. But it's nothing short of entertaining!!De Niro plays a quirky young veteran turned nobody. This is sad to watch. He's suffering and has no guidance, no connection, no support. We don't know too much about his past or what his goals were before the cab gig.He meets Betsy, a charming and educated career girl. He is more simple minded than she, but I wouldn't say Travis is dumb. He expressed his feelings in a very moving way. Enough to convince her for a second date. Cybill's performance was amazing. I was incapsulated by her charm and confidence. She was sensual in stylish way.But in the end, Travis blows their date because he clearly didn't think deeply about the film he was taking her to. He just knows what he knows. I can confidently say: I was very uncomfortable. For a 70s film to feel that way in 2025, that's a pretty big deal.It's about as gritty as you can get. In no way does the film romanticize anything. Not Travis, not New York, not his friendships or relationships... Everything feels bleak, chaotic and unpredictable. It feels cold and we never get a break from it.Scenes without any soundtrack create a visceral experience. You watch this young man crack and waste his potential. Why was I reminded of the Bjork stalker while watching this?Travis is a very complex character that will have me reading essays later online!!(I shuddered at the scene where one of his fine costumers explains what a gun does to a woman's face... those were some pretty cold lines)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Masterpiece of Cinematic Art,"At the heart of ""Taxi Driver"" is Travis Bickle, played masterfully by De Niro, a mentally troubled Vietnam War veteran who drives a taxi in New York City. De Niro's portrayal of Travis is nothing short of iconic. He embodies the character's isolation and growing disillusionment with society, capturing the profound sense of despair that permeates his life. The now-famous line, ""You talking to me?"" encapsulates Travis's internal struggle and his yearning for connection in a world that feels increasingly hostile and indifferent.Scorsese's direction is brilliant, as he expertly crafts an atmosphere that reflects the gritty and chaotic nature of 1970s New York City. The city itself becomes a character in the film, with its neon lights, rain-soaked streets, and seedy underbelly serving as a backdrop to Travis's descent into madness. Scorsese's use of close-ups and dynamic camera angles immerses viewers in Travis's psyche, allowing us to experience his growing paranoia and frustration firsthand.The screenplay, written by Paul Schrader, is a profound exploration of existential themes. It delves into the fragility of the human mind and the impact of societal neglect on individuals. The film doesn't shy away from uncomfortable truths, presenting a stark commentary on urban decay and the moral ambiguity of its characters. The narrative is both compelling and unsettling, prompting viewers to reflect on the complexities of human nature.A standout feature of ""Taxi Driver"" is its haunting score, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The music enhances the film's emotional depth, evoking a sense of unease and tension that underscores Travis's turbulent journey. The score is as much a part of the film's identity as its visuals, adding layers of meaning to each scene and amplifying the impact of Travis's actions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I fear we see too many like him in the news, committing horrific crimes that they may not always receive proper punishment for.

"In my humble opinion, Robert De Niro's best performance to date!","I had seen this classic before which in my view pretty much stabilized director Martin Scorcese's awesome array of films. In this one Robert De Niro in a stellar performance plays Vietnam War vet Travis Bickle who due to being slightly imbalanced (now i know people will be questioning the slightly part) from the war, can't seem to sleep at nights and takes a job as a night cab driver. A lonely trade for a very lonely individual who spends the nights travelling through the scum and filth of New York's seedy underbelly seeing prostitutes, crazed patrons etc. This line of work only feeds Travis's contempt for society slowly driving him into insanity. Along the lines he meets up with a very young Jodie Foster who portrays a young prostitute named Iris. Maybe saving Iris from this wicked world just might make him a hero instead of a vengeful assassin!

It honestly might be the best movie ever.,"My god...The direction by Martin Scorsese proves his talent.  The script by Paul Schrader proves his talent.  The acting by Robert DeNiro proves his talent. This is a movie dripping with talent.  It was marinated in talent and then wrapped up in a talent crepe.Scorsese uses inventive camera angels and great color techniques.  He gives the actors an obvious motivation.  It's hard to explain great direction, but Scorsese was magnificent.Before I praise Schrader's script, I'll say that a lot of the movie was ad-libbed.  In fact, the famous ""You talkin' to me?"" was totally improvised by DeNiro.  That being said, It's fantastic writing.  The very minute details that were written into the script, (I know this because I got the DVD special edition), make him fantastic.This movie MADE Robert DeNiro for me.  I think almost anyone can testify to DeNiro's talent, but you ain't seen nothing till you've seen this movie. He's so subtle, but manages to be really powerful.  The viewer is torn among hating Travis, feeling really sorry for him, loving him, etc.  There's something about his eyes...there's no way of knowing what's going on behind them.  He's so multi-faceted.

Tax driver is a must see for fans of classic cinema,"Martin Scorsese's 1976 classic, Taxi Driver, is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences with its haunting and thought-provoking portrayal of isolation, madness, and redemption. This iconic film tells the story of Travis Bickle, a mentally unstable and socially isolated taxi driver who becomes obsessed with saving a young prostitute, Iris, from her pimp, Sport.From the opening scene, it's clear that Taxi Driver is a film that will leave a lasting impression on its viewers. The cinematography is stark and gritty, with a muted color palette that perfectly captures the bleak and unforgiving atmosphere of 1970s New York City. The score, composed by Bernard Herrmann, is equally effective, with a haunting and pulsing rhythm that perfectly complements the on-screen action.But it's Robert De Niro's performance as Travis Bickle that truly makes Taxi Driver a masterpiece. His portrayal of the troubled and isolated taxi driver is both captivating and terrifying, as he brings to life a character who is both deeply human and utterly unhinged. De Niro's performance is a tour-de-force, as he fully immerses himself in the role and brings a level of depth and nuance that is simply breathtaking.As the film progresses, it becomes clear that Travis's obsession with Iris is not just about saving her from her pimp, but about saving himself from his own feelings of isolation and loneliness. His descent into madness is both heartbreaking and terrifying, as he becomes increasingly unhinged and detached from reality. The film's climax, which features one of the most iconic and influential scenes in cinema history, is both shocking and thought-provoking, as Travis's actions raise important questions about the nature of violence and the impact of societal isolation.One of the most striking aspects of Taxi Driver is its exploration of the theme of isolation. Travis is a character who is deeply disconnected from the world around him, and his taxi cab becomes a symbol of his isolation, as he drives through the city, observing the world around him but never truly connecting with it. The film's use of long takes and point-of-view shots adds to the sense of isolation, as the viewer is placed squarely in Travis's shoes, experiencing the world through his distorted and fragmented perspective.The film's supporting cast is also noteworthy, with Jodie Foster delivering a remarkable performance as Iris, the young prostitute who becomes the object of Travis's obsession. Her portrayal of the vulnerable and exploited Iris is both heartbreaking and thought-provoking, as she brings to life a character who is both a victim of circumstance and a symbol of the darker aspects of human nature. Cybill Shepherd is also excellent as Betsy, the campaign volunteer who becomes the object of Travis's affections, and Harvey Keitel is memorable as Sport, the pimp who becomes the target of Travis's wrath.In terms of its influence, Taxi Driver is a film that has had a profound impact on popular culture. Its exploration of themes such as isolation, madness, and redemption has influenced countless other films and television shows, and its iconic scenes and characters have become ingrained in the popular consciousness. The film's influence can be seen in everything from the works of Quentin Tarantino to the music of Kendrick Lamar, and its continued relevance is a testament to the enduring power of Scorsese's vision.Overall, Taxi Driver is a film that is both a product of its time and a timeless classic. Its exploration of themes such as isolation, madness, and redemption is both thought-provoking and haunting, and its influence can still be felt today. With its stunning cinematography, haunting score, and remarkable performances, Taxi Driver is a film that is not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
dumb standard gun-story,"Unless I'm hopelessly not getting it, the plot suggests that do-it-yourself-justice, including death-penalty, is very cool and stylish.The ""hero"" (De Niro) is made as a figure to identify with [the viewer is put into the hero's point-of-view most of the time, and, more important, into the hero's mood all the time - the monotonous melancholic soundtrack (basically, solo-saxophone) reflects the hero's extreme loneliness, and loneliness is a feeling known to everybody], and the hero's fascist ideology (some people are 'dirt') is not questioned anywhere. The film glorifies violence and fascist ideology, and that's about most disgusting message I can think of, and not very original either.Every James-Bond does the same, I admit, but the difference is, that in case of James Bond, noone expects art, makers and viewers know, that a new James-Bond is  going to be the same old entertainment via special effects, completely lacking a story apart from standard testosterone-phantasy. Taxi-driver is like James Bond minus the special effects. If the message actually should have been ""the hero is an asshole"", then the film is inane. If not, it's worse.The most overrated film I ever saw.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A great psychological film from a master director called Martin Scorsese.,"A great psychological film from a master director called Martin Scorsese.It's difficult to say who is greater , if it is Robert De Niro as Travis or Martin Scorsese who made the Travis. I'd give in to the argument and come to terms with diplomacy and say both are great but personally, I love Martin more than Robert. Robert sure is a great actor but the way the whole film is handled by Martin is one thing that made a fine beginning for a man, who gave us very very significant films in his career.Lot goes on in creating an atmosphere that makes us delve into the film as audience and lot more goes into such writing and detailing. Right, from making the room like that of a reckless taxi driver to the setting up of a brothel room the environment is such dream like that it seems like to be a place we see at times in reality and at time in our dreams. Salutations to the Art Director, Cinematographer and the Director who have envisioned such ambiance and resented the same.The writing.. the screenplay is one that on the face is simple is simple, like Travis (Robert De Niro) preparing for a shoot meticulously and a few shots of holding gun and looking himself in mirror and all will make that. But the execution and enacting the writing is what makes this film special. It's not an easy thing to direct psychological films and that's the very reason I respect guys like Welles, Polanski, Hitchcock and Scorsese above many.The music score also helps a great deal and thanks to Bernard Hermann to have given such a score that is jazzy, psychedelic and at times creepy too.OK, now to Robert De NIro, he would have got all the best actor awards, had there not been a ""Network"" coz he carried the character Travis Bickle with such ease on his shoulders that I had felt the same pain as he did, when he is rejected by a girl. Thus, all through he made me empathise with him and took me into his mood, his reason of doing a certain thing. I just gave into Niro's character I must say.When the last time I saw in 2006 post my engineering days, I could not see any Indian actor but now I see Ranbir Kapoor can replicate a Taxi Driver as he has got in him everything. But I hope, this film is not remade ever and even if it does, it has to be someone like Anurag Kashyap directing Ranbir Kapoor.A 4/5 for a great film and very important film that has defined psychological films, and indeed was the arrival of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Everyone is Travis Bickle,"This is my personal favorite movie. Everyone has a Travis Bickle in them. I suggest this movie to anyone who feels as though the world is crashing down on them. Some scenes are so breath taking when you can actually see what Travis is feeling. Harvey Keitel does a magnificent job of playing a desperate pimp who can only find love from one of his underage prostitutes. I believe this film captures a broad view of early New York life, before all of the strip clubs and ""scum"" were washed down the drain. Robert Deniro truly found himself in his early roles, such as Raging Bull, Deer Hunter. However, I truly believe this is his best role.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An all time masterpiece that will remain immortalised as a cinematic classic.,"It's hard to believe that Taxi Driver is almost 40 years old. Released in 1976, Taxi Driver has earned a well deserved spot in cinematic history as an all time classic masterpiece. In the early stages of many collaborations as an actor and director, Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese bring to life an urban tale of alienation and one lonely man's struggle to get a grip of his sanity in a rapidly decaying New York City. Robert De Niro is also strongly supported by an all star cast, including Jodie Foster, Harvey Kietel, Albert Brooks, and Peter Boyle.Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a former U.S. Marine who gets a job as a taxi driver in New York City. He is also plagued with insomnia, loneliness, and the inability to connect with others on an emotional level. Throughout his night shifts he witnesses society at its worst, and often longs for the real rain to wash the scum off the streets. When he is not working, Travis spends time in a variety of pornographic theaters and keeps to himself in his small apartment. Travis often keeps his personal thoughts written down in his diary. He is still quite guarded around fellow drivers including Wizard (Peter Boyle). Travis' life takes a successful turn when he becomes infatuated with Presidential campaign worker Betsy (Cybil Sheppard) and he successfully asks her out on a date. The date starts off on the right foot but ends badly when Betsy is disgusted with Travis taking her to a pornographic theater and thus Betsy breaks it off with Travis. Travis tries to make it up to Betsy but she constantly rebuffs him. The relationship ends for good when Travis berates Betsy at her work and Tom (Albert Brooks) kicks Travis out. After a chance meeting with Presidential candidate Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Brooks), Travis turns his unhealthy obsessions towards Charles Palantine. Travis also befriends a teenage prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster) who wants to leave but is unable to do so as she is under the thumb of her pimp and lover Matthew ""Sport"" (Harvey Kietel). Travis prepares for a confrontation by physically transforming himself and obtaining several handguns so he can do what needs to be done. The only question here is, is he going to be a hero or the villain?Robert De Niro has enjoyed a stellar career and his filmography over the past 40 years has been very impressive. Taxi Driver is often mentioned as one of his best movies, and rightfully so. No other actor could capably portray the troubled Travis Bickle, and Robert De Niro has done an admirable job. Robert De Niro earned an Academy Award nomination for his role as Travis Bickle, but unfortunately lost to Peter Finch who posthumously won for his role in Network (1976). Jodie Foster went on to become a successful actress as well as a two time Academy Award Winner for her roles in The Accused (1988) and The Silence of The Lambs (1991). Her role as the teenage prostitute Iris made critics and audiences sit up and take notice. Harvey Kietel has also enjoyed a great career and Taxi Driver sits up near the top of the list along with such movies as Reservoir Dogs (1992), Bad Lieutenant (1992), The Piano (1993), and Pulp Fiction (1994). The late Peter Boyle is well known to TV audiences for his role in Everybody Loves Raymond, but here he does a great job as fellow cab driver Wizard.Martin Scorsese's direction is pure brilliance and it can be said that Taxi Driver proved to become a pivotal moment in his career. Martin Scorsese has gone on to direct further excellent movies in his career, but Taxi Driver highlights Scorsese at his best. Paul Schrader's screenplay is extremely intelligent and also has dark moments of humour. Bernard Herrmann's hauntingly sombre jazz score (which was also his last before his untimely death) is outstanding.Though Taxi Driver is a very intense and violent movie, it is no stranger to controversy. Taxi Driver attracted negative publicity in 1981 when it was revealed John Hinkley Jr, who attempted to assassinate Ronald Regan, was deeply obsessed with the movie. Hinkley Jr also became infatuated with actress Jodie Foster, and carried out his assassination attempt in order to win her affection. Hinkley Jr was later found not guilty by reason of insanity but later confined to a psychiatric hospital.Many people commonly perceive Taxi Driver as an action movie. When I think of action movies, movies such as the Lethal Weapon series, the Die Hard series, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Rambo, and Jason Bourne instantly come to mind. Taxi Driver is a gritty drama which doesn't come close to an action movie. Travis Bickle is certainly not an heroic character that audiences find themselves cheering on. Travis Bickle is an emotionally troubled, paranoid, and mentally unstable person, and the movie portrays him as an anti hero instead of the villain.Nobody can dispute the classic scene where Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle is acting out an imagined confrontation in front of a mirror which gives him a chance to draw his handgun. The line ""You talking' to me?"" has firmly embedded itself as one of the greatest lines in cinematic history. It's also amazing that this line was not in Paul Schrader's script, but in fact improvised by Robert De Niro.""You talking' to me? You talking' to me? You talking' to me? Then who the hell else are you talking' to? You talking' to me? Well I'm the only one here. Who the f*** do you think you're talking to? Oh yeah? Okay.""Robert De Niro has never been better in his iconic role, Jodie Foster's career later skyrocketed, and Martin Scorsese's first masterpiece will always remain immortalised. Taxi Driver is a cinematic classic that will stay with you forever.A well deserved 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
God's Lonely Man,"I've seen this movie at least a dozen times in the twenty five years since its first release.  I saw it when it first came out and it played in second-run theatres on double bills with other Columbia releases like ""Shampoo"" for a long time in Jersey when I was in high school.Story is of a man who has little or not human interaction in the jungle of the big city.  He can't sleep and figures he might as well make some money out of his insomnia.  He becomes fixated on Cybill Shepard who then rejects him - on their first date he takes her to the movies but it happens to be a dirty movie.  This always seemed like a very poignant moment for me - to him, that was what couples did, they went to the movies on a date.  He was not able to differentiate between that movie and a regular movie, it wasn't that he was coming on to her or anything.  And it wasn't that he was completely ignorant either.He becomes increasingly frustrated and is egged on by an encounter with a psycho passenger (played by Scorsese) who discusses in detail what he plans to do to his wife, who he can see is cheating on him from the back of Travis' cab.  This scene is a riot and you might hate yourself for laughing, but Scorsese obviously is enjoying himself.  I don't think DeNiro says a word in their scene together.  He also fancies himself as Saviour - he tries to appeal to a young hooker (Jodie Foster) to go back home and live a normal life.  She seems stuck in her world until all hell breaks loose.This movie has become a classic over the years, mostly because of DeNiro's towering performance.  Many other things contributed to the greatness of this movie, not the least of which was the score by the great Bernard Herrmann, to whom the movie is dedicated.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Tortured Hero or Curious Villian?,"Like many Scorsese films, Taxi Driver leaves the viewer questioning the morals of the main character, and somehow resonating with the most lonely and arguably evil parts of him.Throughout the film, it feels as though you are being teased by Robert De Niro's performance. As you are taken deeper and deeper into the disturbed psyche of Travis, your mind goes on a philosophical adventure. Is he a secret genius or just a really, really bad guy? All that is subjective.Overall, this is one of the most perfect pieces of cinema. To see Travis and his mental instability stand out so much in the ""scummy"" setting that he simultaneously fits perfectly in, is a real treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

After watching Taxi Driver, I must say, I have never been more disappointed by a film. I am struggling to find anything positive to say about it. Yes Robert De Niro's performance was good but certainly not his best. The film felt extremely slow-paced and boring due to the simplistic plot which was like a straight line - no twists, no fear, no emotion just utter boredom.

"""Here is a man who would not take it any more."" –Travis Bickle","Human beings are generally lonely, from birth to death. Most of us make good friends between these periods. The rest aren't so lucky because they're not wired, seeing everything and everyone but not bale to relate, let alone be respected. They're ""God's lonely people"", and Travis Bickle, depicted by the down-to-earth yet brilliant Robert De Niro (""Mean Streets"", ""GoodFellas"") is one of them, being the lead player of ""Taxi Driver"", a gut-punching, head-slamming, urban noir masterpiece directed by Mr. De Niro's longtime compeer, Martin Scorsese. If you can call it the unofficial sequel to J.D. Salinger teenage-angst tale ""Catcher in the Rye"", you're more than right.A Vietnam vet who's obviously haunted (probably even before his tour of duty), Bickle suffers from insomnia. He becomes a cabbie to handle it, but it's no use. His workplace is New York City, 1970s style, and the streets are infested with pimps, hookers, pushers, junkies and other social reprobates. Therapy and religion are afterthoughts because the man's too smart and deep. Bickle tries to connect with fetching campaign worker Betsy (a pre-""Moonlighting Cybil Shepherd), but it goes south when he takes her to an intellectually pretentious porn film (I may have to see ""Swedish Marriage Manual"" myself). In his nadir, he gets the notion to ""be somebody"" by killing her boss, a presidentially ambitious senator (Leonard Harris), but is thankfully sidetracked by under-aged harlot Iris (a cherub-faced, Oscar nominated Jodie Foster), who's carelessly exploited by her sleazy pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Red Dragon""). When Travis saves Iris, he's just not only ""God's lonely man"", but a force of nature commissioned by God.A lot has been said of ""Driver"", and it's all good. Scorsese sharply takes the literate script by Paul Schrader (they later worked on ""Raging Bull"" and ""The Last Temptation of Christ"") and puts it on the floor as he films this character study of a man driven to the edge, but not willing to fall without doing something of importance. On the surface, Bickle's a mentally unhinged loser, but, via honest diary-based voice-overs, he's really a man who has the rotten luck to be in the wrong era, surrounded by cynics, phonies, leeches and predators. Oscar-nominated for the role, DeNiro triumphs in Bickle's skin and inadvertently gives a thespian class while doing it. Don't get me started with the Mohawk cut.The supporting thespians compliment him. Shepard and Foster represent polar opposites of womanhood, in age, appearance and sensibilities, which equally alienate Bickle. Keitel's scumbag role can be the exact mirror image of Shepherd's nebbish co-worker (Albert Brooks). The Wizard, a vet cabbie (the late Peter Boyle of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and Schrader's ""Hardcore""), is quirky with his profane tales and wisdom with fellow cabbies, but he can't ""get"" to the film's anti-hero. If you can spot the two appearances by Mr. Scorsese himself in the film, you deserve three lollipops.The score by Bernard Herrmann (his last gig here, and the film's dedicated to him) is alternatively sweet and gritty, a great soundtrack that belongs in Travis's throbbing head. D.P. Michael Chapman, under Mr. Scorsese's guidance, echoes European films behind the camera.A magnificent barrel of celluloid, ""Taxi Driver"" is one of those films that has been a longtime influence. ""The Wackness"" (its' director Jonathon Levine was Mr. Schrader's assistant) and ""Watchmen"" (both film and graphic novel) are more than obvious examples. Though the film's main stage, Times Square, has been ""Disney-fied"" over the years, the 1976 film still resonates today because they are many Travis Bickles in our society, and you can't get rid of them with a business-restriction law.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Seeing this film was a personal milestone.,"This film is one of the most enthralling pieces of cinema I've ever seen. No matter how often I see it I cannot move until the final credit has passed. In Travis Bickle we see a character as dark and moody as the setting. While sympathising with the character I also was given a wake-up call in....oftentimes the dark loner is portrayed on film as being something to strive for, a romantic ideal even, but within Travis we see the darker, more realistic side of things. A life of isolation can lead to one losing touch with reality and becoming so introverted as to almost fail to function as human being. This is most evident when Travis takes Betsy to a dirty movie and doesn't understand why she is so upset by it. To sum up, an outstanding essay on the darker side of the human condition.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Critic's Film,"I just went back to this film for the first time in several years, and I'm afraid a dispassionate look at (and perhaps a re-examination of) Taxi Driver is in order. I was stunned by how substandard I found it, and made me realize that as many people as I've heard talk about how great a film it is, hardly anyone at all actually says they ENJOYED watching it. Just because something's bleak doesn't mean it can't be enjoyable; I'm sure you can all think of many films that fit both criteria (if you can't, go rent Saturday Night and Sunday Morning).  Not that there isn't a lot that's great about the movie, mostly down to Scorsese and De Niro, who both turn in extraordinary efforts. But--and the DVD version of the film helps point this out--the script is third rate (and could only have been written by a film critic), the story never really develops (the episodic format of the screenplay is an easy way out to avoid watching Travis Bickle's descent into anomie, instead we get to measure the regress by watching his hair grow shorter), and the other characters are little more than caricatures, as we never learn more about them (other than De Niro's and Jodie Foster's) after the first minute they are onscreen.Rent or buy the DVD, read the script, and see how much better this film was made by Scorsese's ability to interpolate the ad libbing on the part of De Niro (and Harvey Keitel), and his amazing ability to capture NYC at its absolute nadir, when Bickle's description of the city to Senator Palantine is not overstatement. As for other performances, Jodie Foster is extremely good in a role that doesn't have her on the screen that long, Cybill Shepherd acts like a very attractive block of wood (her forte), and Albert Brooks plays yet another annoying guy. Keitel is superb as the pimp, but his chemistry with De Niro is the only such instance in the whole film.It's ultimately a beautifully filmed weak story, and even the line that everyone quotes ad nauseam (and no, I'm NOT talking to you) was ad libbed by De Niro. Wish he'd written the whole thing. I think the film critics' union banded together here to support one of their own. Watch it, but keep your eyes open.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Analysis for Taxi Driver (1976),"This one is a good movie in terms of a lot of things. The film depicts a character who is very lonely. I like the way that Robert De Niro did Travis Bickle, the character who is very lonely. It kind of resembles a little bit of my lifetime. I used to be lonely when it comes to friends who are very important. Anyways, another thing about this is that the music. I like the way the songs were put in the film and how they were from different artists. What Martin Scorsese did was unbelievable in a good way. He not only directed this film, but he also participated in the acting. We may not see him exactly in the film, but his silhouette is very good. The only bad thing about this is that there was a little too much crime in this film for me. I'm not used to crime, unless I see it in superhero movies. Overall, this is another film that people have to see again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The OG Incel,"Let's be honest. Have you ever felt so lonely in a place where noone really understands you, and you never fit in? Some people have, some people haven't.Travis Bickle is an amazing representation of what it feels to want to mean something and/or be special when you've spent your whole life meaning nothing. He's a desperate and lonely sociopath but if you look deeper into the meaning behind his actions, you'll realize it all fits in and connects with his state of mind.He's not a good person nor is he a hero, but he sure as hell is a well written character in a well written movie.His meeting with Betsy and his idealization of her is something we can all understand. When you've lived your whole life seeing bad people, who wouldn't fall in love with the first decent person you meet? But still, Travis' lack of social skills makes him come off as creepy. Again, nothing can excuse his behaviour, but we can all understand where he came from.I think Travis Bickle's whole life really, is something that plays a lot into the male-fantasy of ""protecting the pure"" or whatever. Either way, I can't remember the last time I found a film about a sociopathic incel more interesting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Reprehensible to some.... brilliant to many,"People may find this film, repellent, disturbing, disgusting. Some scenes, and I use the word more here, are just repellent. But it's not a nice world out there on the cold streets of New York's lower class areas, populated by all types of sleaze, Deniro so flatteringly describes, as well as to it's solution., many will agree with. He's an unforgettable hero icon, who's been a living inspiration to a lot of wannabe tough guys, and movie goers, and we shares Travis's views, all down the line. He's a fictional character who will never be forgotten, in one of Scorsese's most brilliant and daring works, contrary to many unsavory critics. We shares Travis's world, anger, annoyance, aggravation, frustration, denial, all pent up, but when it explodes towards the end, it's deadly, culminating in him being praised a hero, when returning twelve year pro, Iris (Foster) to her family. Travis, on the account of a lack of sleep, takes a job as a hack- taxi driver, cruising all over town to the worst of it, picking up some real dirt, where too from Deniro's perspective, includes a senator running for the coming election, who again, is all talk. The cab ride scene, with him is interesting to watch from Deniro's slightly tipped mind, praising him, where really he's taking the p..s out of him. It took me a few viewings to grasp onto the concept. Harvey Keitel in one of his best performances, is great as a lowlife, scum sucking pimp. It's a performance of detestable brilliance, while Cybill Shepherd holds your attention, as a sexy campaigner, who's becomes Travis's short lived love, and he is a acute observer of people too. Deniro of course is masterful as Travis Bickle, his eyes, penetrating, sometimes gives us cause to think, violence is only seconds away, his whole body form takes on character, like nothing you've seen before, showing many anxious and nervous emotions. He does have a sort of perverted sense of humor too, but we know where this is leading. Taxi Driver only becomes gory towards the end, in two graphic frank scenes, where he really explodes, but this is what the whole movie has been building up. This is what we've been waiting for. Those scenes are truly warranted. Taxi Driver is masterful work in it's almost now, 40 year existence, and will live on many many years yet as a movie classic, steered by one of the greatest actors on earth.

Travis seems to be in a hazy state, he appears to be slightly doped on some anti-anxiety medication, we can also see him having occasional drinks of booze as he wanders or drives, restlessly, through the sometimes crowded and sometimes nearly empty streets of the city.Travis is a lonely man, kind of locked in himself and looking for a way out, portrayed with amazing skill by De Niro as he shows us the sad, scary life of a lonely man's journey and slow descending into darkness, it all feels completely real. The actors around him also adds to the feeling that what we watch could be a documentary. It's a blunt, honest wiew of a big city; some live, some try to live and some have no life left.Harvey Keitel does some great work in this, the first times I saw the movie I had no idea it was him, he portrays his character with no problems as he always does.The ladies that enters the life of Travis are also nicely portrayed and especially Jodie Foster, (like Keitel she is starring in an early role), does some outstanding acting against De Niro in this film.Possible spoiler ahead now...::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: possible spoiler:possible spoiler:possible spoilerScorsese himself does a cameo, he does a guy with serious issues... I didn't know that it was him either until later but still it doesn't matter as he does the role so well, a man with such intense paranoia and aggression it makes me scared and thinking about how the claustrophobia, drugs and roughness in the city turns humans into wild animals.possible spoiler:possible spoiler:possible spoiler:possible spoiler :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::End of possible spoiler::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::I think Taxi Driver easily deserves its place among the top flicks, there are so many emotions and kinds of people in it that you can watch it several times and get different thoughts about what happens to Travis and the ones around him.It feels real but is filmed with great camera work that makes it smooth and enjoyable as a movie, too. I believe it's based on a true story as well, haven't really looked into that but thinking about that adds to the feeling that De Niro's interpretation is a real person, the former marine that becomes the taxi driver and has problems with the social life, trying to cope with the depravity and the lost souls that dwells in the living hell that a big city becomes for an alarming amount of its residents.This movie is a piece of history that doesn't feel old...True force...all the kings men couldn't put it back together again...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great movie,Just saw this movie for the first time and it really is great.  Has more of a '60s feel to it then something from the disco era.  Great slice-of-urban-life from point of view of loner/cab driver.  Unpleasant scenes never quite become unwatchable; and film's resolution redeems earlier violence.  Killer cast and musical score.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Good Film, Great Scorsese",This film is very intense and a classic directed by the famous Martin Scorsese. The intense film pairs well with the intense actor Robert De Niro. His character Travis Bickle sums up to be a very odd character and even a psychotic character. His psychosis grows throughout the movie and quirky sense of humor can be found to be disturbing at some points. Yet he shows a lot of affection towards Becky he is still a hopelessly alone character throughout the movie. Travis' thought grow more dark and disturbing and even violent throughout the movie. Scorsese really created a masterpiece with this film and this film will continue to be known as that for many generations to come.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Hugely disappointed.....,"I honestly don't know what to say. I think I was expecting too much from this movie. Some say this is a phycological thriller, perhaps physcological , definitely not a thriller. This movie just doesn't fit this genre. I saw one of the IMDb posts where people were saying that ,if u were lonely then u would understand this movie.But come on !! Travis could have had lots of friends if he wanted to,the guy just doesn't talk to any of his taxi colleagues. I felt like i watched ""drive"" again with less plot and gore.But you can watch this for Mr.Nero's awesome performance.More than him watchout for the young budding Jodie Foster's Oscar nomination worthy performance and the b-e-a-u-tiful cybill...My final words , this thing is seriously overrated.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Duality of Man,"I understand the craze for this film. It is incredibly unique, one of a kind. It is so well made, and the writing is close to perfect. Not to mention its a great biopic of the mental decline of an otherwise seemingly normal man. Seeing any man descent deep into darkness is going to be disturbing, and this film is, but there are also some pretty interesting psychological things to learn here.So yes, it is well made (bar a few strange edits). Incredibly acted. Masterfully written. It fulfills everything it sets out to do very well... It is very depressing and disturbing. Not a film i would reccomend to a friend or family member, but as an avid movie watcher it made for a very interesting night.To be honest I am desperatley trying to find things wrong with this movie.

Hypothetically enhancing and very influential on general views of the world in the big city,"I got interested in this film because of the nature of me watching movies that have reputations of eccentric detail, in which this movie has much of. And the great qualities of it are so unique. Robert DeNiro, and his character Travis discovers his wandering life as a Taxi Driver with all that is going on around him. And of course, with all the situations he deals with and witnesses, it really makes some kind of alter-egos of him. And this movie builds up one of the best climaxes made in cinema history, with its editing of slow altitude movements as day goes by, with the dialogue. And all that is disturbing in this film, makes it difficult to find a tranquil light to this. Although I'd say the light is metaphorically translucent, as of being hard to see what is really so wonderful. And this movie actually makes you realize what is wonderful and how you manage and use those expressions. Although it is hard to pertain in the film. Just something that is perspective.

The characters were written well (skip this sentence, spoiler ahead) and the scene with the man trying to kill his wife was beautifully directed/written.

The story of a majority?,"Why am I adding 1 more comment to 514 existing ones? I simply cannot take the movie off my mind 6 days after the viewing.The movie eloquently pictures the loneliness that follows many many Travis Bickles in the real world. The narration is phenomenal -- thanks to a scriptwriter, a director, and a lead character who understand or at least who manage to empathize those lonely (wo)men. The most scary part of the movie is not the violence but the loneliness that is lurking and ready to ""kill"" people.A more mediocre movie would present loneliness as unwarranted tears or some other exaggerated actions (most movie-goers want ACTION) (see Babel, for example). Here, the feeling is conveyed by the endless streams of views on the street, distorted by the windshield, reflected from the windows. These are views and people of an ""outside world"" -- untouchable and surreal -- while the protagonist watches ""inside"" (the taxi is metaphor of an inside space totally separated from the outside and is constantly going nowhere). That feeling's heightened with the few painful expressions or dazed stares of DeNiro, and the haunting background music. Do we need to zoom in the anguished face of Travis when he last talked to Betsy on the phone? Is that one-sided conversation not unbearable enough? The presentation is so much stronger by leaving it to the viewer's imagination, and shooting the quiet hallway, with no one around and leading to nowhere. (This second technique showing isolation is also used heavily in most movies by Kar-Wai Wong.) The movie is great in being so engaging, while very little is going on. In the first viewing of mine, I was overwhelmed by fear and suspense. In the second viewing, knowing more in hindsight, I was simply struck by sadness.Life is slow and aimless, and people can be full of contradictions and void of characters. That's life. Some other commentors have problems understanding these, and I envy their blissful disconnection with such painful reality.I am no fans of Scorsese-style grandness but this movie really surprised me.There are certain parts of the movie that are overly sentimental. There are also plot holes. For one thing, the sexual desires of Travis is quite contradictory -- the habit of watching porns vs the hatred of prostitution, and the nearly unbelievable act of taking Betsy to a movie (would he at least ask the girl to choose the movie)? Or is he really so much of a walking contradiction as Betsy calls it?** MILD SPOILER HERE ** The ending -- my guess, after seeing the documentary, is that, the film-makers literally meant what they showed since Paul Schrader mentioned that Travis had not changed, and the ending was the beginning of his next violent act. But most viewers correctly voiced the legal problems (assuming the movie is one of reality than fantasy), and some came up with a much better alternative ending that the last portion is the flash-back and wish of Travis upon his death (though the actual scenes don't support this well). If I were one of the film-makers, I would definitely let people take their sides, esp if that covers up an original plothole :) I DISAGREE THAT this open-ending is intended or is a sign of greatness.

"Not as disturbing as I thought, but QUESTIONABLY weird","Lets face it this is a good movie (if your talking weird) in its own way but I didn't find anything disturbing about it. I found that the twelve year old prostitute made me very uncomfortable when(spoiler) talking about selling her crotch or unbuckling a grown man's pants but I guess that's the life of a prostitute. Anyway this could be a nineteen-seventy six batman film if the man didn't kill because hey who knows if batman loves porn or not. Back to the script, a 26 year old discharged military man that thinks an awful lot, writes in his journal and has trouble sleeping drives a taxi cab for money and travels through the bad parts of New York. As he sees the scum and filth of this city, he wants to do something about it but what? While he decides, he tries to talk to women but sucks at it so he stalks a woman at a newspaper center who notices him sitting in the taxi. This gives him the chance to be Dr. House and analyze her feelings which some how impresses her... Odd. Well not knowing a woman's worth nor movies takes her to an educational booty movie and she leaves him boo hew. Any-who he talks to a senator running for president about the scum and filth and surprisingly (sarcasm) could care less. So he runs into the 12 year old prostitute again(the one mentioned at the top. Note: the first time he saw her was on one of his routes though she was doped up trying to escape. The second time he nearly ran her over & then decided to follow her to a traffic light)and promises to get her out of the game by becoming a vigilante though the girl thinks he's weird (don't blame her). He goes and kills the pimps and all is well. It doesn't sound to exciting(because it ain't) but it is very interesting in its own way. DeNiro's acting as his character is very well done playing a young man who is weird and so on. I'd say give it a rent or buy it cheap on DVD ( trust me, it might bore you & you'll never watch it again),just don't show this to your kids as a lesson parents with sense(especially those with no sense.)Masterpiece, Not in my eyes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Amazing film,"This is such an amazing movie. Okay so first off right of the bat, I've noticed the opinions of this film is very some find the travis boring and believe its a very overrated movie while others love it. I'm definitely on the more love it side, while it's definitely not perfect I find myself really enjoying the character of travis. Travis is social outcast, who doesn't know much of anything about the outside world, has no knowledge on pop culture or how to socialise and is basically a incel, he does quite a few unlikeable things even before he starts undergoing his transformation and is incredibly awkward and painful. But they some how make him so relatable and likeable, you really get a feel for the character and despite his awkwardness you can't help but be invested. We see how awful his version of New York City is and along with the loneliness he suffers through all of his actions make sense and while you never once agree with them, they make sense. The character of travis is such a well written and interesting character and quite frankly I wish the is movie got a sequel because I feel there is so much more you could explore with him. My only real issue with this movie is the ending felt slightly anti climatic, and when slightly I mean slightly. The ending is most definitely not bad, but I feel they set up a massive climax throughout the film only for it to be a much more smaller scale. The ending is also incredibly confusing especially now, but if you research the time this film takes place it makes a little more sense, nonetheless it's still a bit of an awkward ending. Overall this is a great psychological drama that makes a character you wouldn't really want to be friends with, but you still feel for and like.

class conflict in the love department.,"It always seemed to me that Taxi Driver is illustrating how class struggle is not limited to the economics, but it also extends to human relations and love.

One day, Travis is ravished by the beauty of Betsy (Sheperd), who acts as a campaign agent for a senator in the presidential race.

"Oooh, that music!","This was a pretty enjoyable film. I understood and related with a lot of the themes that were present within Robert De Niro's character Travis.

I can see how Travis would literally manifest his sense of self-righteousness and purpose into twisted violence.I loved the music. I believe that the repetition of the theme song and the subtle changes of the orchestration due to the mood of the film were excellent! This movie tied the soundtrack to the streets of New York forever. I will always hear the music when I see NYC.The editing and cinematography were top notch, especially in the last scenes. I found it very interesting that Travis entered a new relationship story arc near the last 3/4 of the movie with the prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster). I wished that they would have had breakfast in the middle of the movie. I didn't like the slower pacing during the last 1/4 before the shootout. It felt anti-climatic to me.The screenplay and acting were great. There were so many memorable lines and parables for life on the streets that we could publish the screenplay as a book for how to live on the streets.

The Magic of Scorsese,"Taxi Driver (1976) directed by Martin Scorsese is an interesting piece of filmmaking. The film's main star Travis Bickle played by Robert De Niro ,is an edgy character with many moral flaws. The film has an excellent plot alongside an equally satisfying setting. The quality during the violence is top notch. It is artistically gory, and the colors used during the violence is different and interesting. The film has iconic dialogue such as the famous ""are you talking to me"". The film could not have shined if it hadn't been for De Niro's performance.

'Taxi Driver' is an unforgettable ride,"Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' is certainly chin-deep in the zeitgeist and aesthetic of America in the 1970s--specifically New York City--, but Robert De Niro is captivating as Travis Bickle, a deeply disturbed man who slowly grows more and more isolated in the most populous city in America.Scorsese shoots the film in such a way that you feel like a fly on the wall as Bickle--piece by fractured piece--begins to drift off into his own parallel world.Though it's often a deeply unpleasant film, 'Taxi Driver' is a compelling movie experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fascinating!,"Taxi Driver is a really fascinating movie, not just because of the fantastic direction and writing, but also due to the incredible De Niro's performance as Travis Bickle. The movie provides us a real picture of a true society drama, the loneliness of a man, who lived a traumatic situation during the Vietnam war. The whole picture is psychologically disturbing to the viewer and it's ending is very violent, as the climax of a disturbing and revolted person. Robert De Niro is really great and I think it is his best performance because he really lives Travis inside and outside, he is Travis. This wonderful ability of De Niro to disappear from himself into the screen and into the character he is playing is, for me, the most important issue that an actor must have to succeed in his performance. By the way, Taxi Driver is very well written by Paul Schrader. It's dialogs, it's descriptions about the lonely life that Travis takes are wonderful rich. Martin Scorsese is also an important person who made this movie epic. It's directing is synonymous of hard working, dedication, passion and a tremendous knowledge about filming...

Violent Fare,"A lonely, disillusioned taxi driver is disgusted by the filth he sees around him in NYC and decides to take matters into his own hands. As with his other films, Scorsese does a fine job of capturing the seedy side of NYC, helped tremendously by a moody score by Herrmann, who died before release. Although the film is told entirely from the point of view of the driver (well played by De Niro), we are given few clues as to what makes him tick or what pushes him over the edge. It shows the actions of a disturbed man but does not explore his psyche. Scorsese's overly busy camera work is a distraction at times. Ultimately, the film falls short because it glorifies violence and pushes a fascist agenda.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Perfection at its most bleakest,"As with every film ever made there are those who like that film and those who don't like it for whatever reason. What most people don't understand when reviewing films is that different people enjoy different types of film. An invisible barrier seperates these two factions of people and very few can actually understand that even if they hated a given film every person has the right to an opinion.        After reading numerous comments from Taxi Driver it finally clicked that people need to be more tolerant towards others and that just because somebody didn't enjoy it doesn't make it a bad film. What makes a great film is that an overwhelming majority of people who have seen it enjoyed it. Now getting back to Taxi Driver, this film is absolutely outstanding and is one of the key turning points of 70's films. I can understand that people may not warm to the violence and unfriendly look at modern life but few can deny that this isn't a well made film.The standard of acting from Robert De Niro and to a lesser extent Jodie Foster is remarkable and very few actors would have the natural ability to become Travis Bickle as De Niro does. What I find noteworthy of the best of De Niro's films is the way he tries so exceptionally hard to become that role. For example in preparation for this role he actually got a cab license and would drive around and pick people up. Other examples of this is in The Untouchables where he even got Al Capone's tailor to dress him.The film is deservedly one of the greatest ever made and ranks very high if not at the top of the best films of the 70's even when there is the likes of The Godfathers, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and others to contend with.With repeated viewing especially now it is hard to understand why Hollywood strayed from this standard of film making and went into the over the top and abismally made which has dogged the cinemas every since. Taxi Driver marks the up and coming stars - De Niro and Foster and also one of the only remaining talents of directing of the noughties Marty Scorsese. Although dark and disturbing this is a pinnacle film and I can't recommend this film enough.Grade A*",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"A profound , dramatic yet realistic view of the world","Taxi driver is one of that movies that gets you up at night. The main character, Travis Bickle , is a lonely, xenophobic , angry man who strives each day to get out of the bed. He's an average Joe. However , he isn't that average. He can't stand the scum and the filth that walks on the street, the walking garbage that fills the city.Robert deNiro's character want to do something ; he wants to become something , to find it's purpose , it's destiny.He eventually understands what he has to do and that's when things get red all over it.Throughout the film, we also see the more sensitive side of the character - a rather clunky one, trying to grab attention of a beautiful , intelligent woman . Needless to say, that fails immensely.We are also granted with the classic moment -""Are you talking to me"".My only downside to this movie is the music , i don't think it really captures the mood of the overall theme , and can be annoying some times. Of if it does get it, it's just so depressing and atrocious you just wish to fast forward.Ultimately, Taxi Driver bring us some few questions about our role and the integrity of the common individual in the modern world : what can we do to grow as a person. It also lights the question about how thin is the line between a hero and a monster. It isn't a light mood-ed movie so don't expect the most enjoyable time - do expect though a profound , realistic and human review of the actual status of mankind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

De Niro is Astonishing!,"An extraordinary depiction of a young man's developing psychosis; from his deep-seated sense of moral superiority to his inevitable descent into madness, everything is conveyed with grace by the sheer brilliance of Robert De Niro and his evocative eyes.The manner in which he communicated his thoughts and emotions through a variety of gesticulations & nuances in his body language speaks volumes about his acting prowess and what can I say about the physically demanding transformation he had underwent. No wonder that this particular role has been hailed as one of, if not his best work to date.From a film standpoint, It tries to say a lot, but, if truth be told, I did not connect with the story as much as I had hoped to. Since the majority of the themes explored here are centred on post-Vietnam era, I feel that those who lived during those times, or the people who have a thorough understanding of the culture and the history and are quite familiar with the societal references unique to the nation of U.

De Niro gets driven crazy,"Now three decades old, 'Taxi Driver' enjoys widespread acclaim that has grown with each passing year. It had its release during what is arguably the greatest year in American film history, 1976, which also saw the premiere of 'Network,' 'Rocky,' and 'All The President's Men,' amongst others. Despite its occasional rawness and open-ended conclusion, 'Taxi Driver' will undoubtedly hold its place as a social document and an example of the art that can be generated when great names are brought together in their creative prime.Most film enthusiasts have knowledge of Taxi Driver's plot. Robert De Niro stars in an Academy Award-nominated performance as Travis Bickle, a 26-year-old man who has been discharged from military service in Vietnam and is now living in Manhattan. We are introduced to Travis at his interview for a cab-driving job, where he is looking to spend insomnia-ridden hours behind the wheel. The opening sequence gives us a tour of his routine, with Travis offering voice-over passages from his diary. From the film's early stages, it is clear that Travis is a victim of circumstance and unfit to exist in 'normal' society. While desperate for interaction with others, his social abilities are so badly stilted that he has trouble holding a conversation. He seems to have no interests or hobbies outside of attending porn houses, watching a fuzzy television, drinking brandy, and writing in his notebook. To make matters worse, he is ensconced in the driver's seat of his cab through all hours of the night, rolling through some of the most depraved streets in New York City.Trying to find some ground in his life, Travis begins dating Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a young woman assisting the presidential campaign of Senator Palantine (Leonard Harris). Travis fails miserably when he takes Betsy to a sex film in Times Square, perhaps assuming that she will reject him in the long run anyway. Things build from there, as Travis becomes more and more alienated from his surroundings until a genuine homicidal maniac who feels ordained to wipe out society's ills. He buys an arsenal of black market handguns from a local runner and spots his first target in none other than Senator Palantine, who is about to make public appearances in Manhattan. Also drawing his wrath is Matthew (Harvey Keitel), a pimp who is holding a 12 ½-year-old prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster) prisoner in an East Side tenement. 'Taxi Driver' inevitably explodes into a wave of bloodshed that will leave viewers shattered.What makes 'Taxi Driver' such an effective film is the honesty of Paul Schrader's screen writing. Travis is an average, blue-collar man who acts pleasantly and has good looks, all of which masks his psychotic behavior. Robert De Niro conveys his thoughts and impulses to perfection, allowing us to clearly follow Bickle's downward spiral into madness. While shocking, 'Taxi Driver' is extremely believable in tracking a man's futile attempts to reenter the social loop. In Iris, Jodie Foster brilliantly portrays a girl who looks streetwise but is inwardly suffering. Harvey Keitel pulls no punches as a foul-mouthed slug whose death could actually be welcomed. Interesting conversation also takes place between Travis and Wizard (Peter Boyle), an easy-going cabbie who uses what knowledge he has to advise others. Leonard Harris is effective as Senator Palantine, the political hack who gets his way through doublespeak. Albert Brooks also co-stars in a limited role.'Taxi Driver' is a vital commentary on mid-1970s America, when the prior decade's upheavals and chaos resulting from the Vietnam War brought urban life to the verge of collapse. In this sense, Travis Bickle is a personification of the era, when an America overrun with crime, poverty, and corrupt politicians found itself standing on the edge of an abyss. During the film's intense buildup, Travis seems to become one with the ticking meter of his cab, grinding out fares in a world that is counting down and ready to explode. The film also has a lot to say about our media-drenched culture that raises violent behavior to messianic levels, as Travis becomes a hero just hours after attempting to kill a political figure.The film is not successful on strong performances alone. 'Taxi Driver' was a labor of love for then-obscure director Martin Scorsese, who devoted a great deal of time and effort to his conception. All of his direction is finely-tuned and never does the film suggest pretension or overindulgence. The superb cinematography by Michael Chapman offers a self-contradictory New York City, a place that is frightening yet colorful and vibrant. The last film score by Bernard Herrmann (he died on the final night of soundtrack recording) uses the dark compositional technique that made him a powerhouse for most of the twentieth century.'Taxi Driver' enthusiasts should not be disappointed with Columbia Tri-Star's recent collector's edition DVD, which includes a 70-minute 'making of' documentary, production photo montage, director's storyboard of the murder scene, interactive version of Paul Schrader's screenplay, advertising materials, theatrical trailer, and four-page booklet. The film itself is presented in widescreen with immaculate visuals and two-channel surround audio that gives fullness to Bernard Herrmann's score. Subtitles are also provided in six languages. With the DVD now available, there are no excuses; 'Taxi Driver' is a staggering film experience that is not to be missed.*** ½ out of 4",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A movie like this one comes along once in a lifetime.,"It's hard to know what to say about Taxi Driver that hasn't already been said.  This is probably one of the most highly acclaimed movies of all time, yet most people either love it or hate it.  Thankfully, most people love, and my only explanation for those who hate it is that they just don't get it, and probably never will.  Forget the violence - many critics of Taxi Driver simply point to the film as being too violent - and just watch it, soak it in, and really let it get under your skin.  The violence is part of the story, and the story is one that, though it may make you uncomfortable, it does get to you and leave your mind reeling.

Scorsese's best movie,"Taxi Driver, Scorsese's best shot movie.A dark and twisted drama, Surrounding the life of one taxi driver from New York.It truly was a masterpiece.A masterpiece that inspired many other movies.It's truly amazing how the movie could focus on two different things in one solid story.One being Travis Bickle, The taxi driver.And the other being New York, and how it's chaotic out there.The story itself was simple, Yet, That's what makes it so good.The simplicity in the story was just unbreakable.The whole movie was just about this one taxi driver.The movie was like his own personal diary.His own story, His own experience.And that's great.The character development for Bickle was also terrific.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Review,"A man who is a taxi driver hates people who are into drugs or prostitutes in the street. He is disgusted by them and takes to the extreme way to mend them. Also, he wants to show the existence of himself to everyone. This film is one of New Hollywood and an empty atmosphere prevails throughout the story. I like a series of films of New Hollywood because the story shows a unique sense of values or a view of the world and the main characters are antisocial, but they have their own idea and try to express themselves and insist on what they think even though it may be wrong. I think this film also tells us that what the right justice is as well as the importance of holding their own justice. It is a deep story. I recommend everyone, especially those who like New Hollywood to watch this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I consider this film to be the best ever made.,"Taxi Driver in my opinion is the greatest movie of all time. Robert De Niro gives the performance of the century as Travis Bickle.

Unrealistic ending and scenes that didn't belong hurt an otherwise good movie,"Taxi Driver has some definite strengths, but scenes that did not fit into the plot and an ending that seemed unrealistic hurt what could have been an excellent movie.I thought that Robert DeNiro was solid in playing the role of Travis, a loner who becomes a cab driver. After incessant exposure to crime and sleaze in New York City, Travis decides it's his job to clean up the streets. The knee-jerk anger, the obsessiveness and delusions that Travis experience were convincing and done well by DeNiro.The problem I had was with some scenes that did not make sense. There is no way in real life anyone could get away with the vigilante tactics shown in this movie, especially in New York City, unless no one discovered who the vigilante was. The movie started to paint a picture of a man who could not get over being rejected by a woman, but failed to follow through on this idea as the plot suddenly focused on other topics.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Important, Timeless, Masterful","This is an amazing character study and I believe every man should watch this movie at least one time in their life. There is more and more Travis Bickle's walking amongst us in 2022 than in 1973. This is exactly why recent movies like the Joker are as successful as they were. Travis' daily life is super relatable to the average man in this day and age (even though devices were different) and how shallow and empty he is, is played so well by DeNiro. Making a movie with a main character like this was so risky at the time, considering Travis is a background character in most people's lives who isn't important whatsoever. Even for 1973, this movie has some of the best looking shots I ever seen. It's a movie I can see being interpreted in many different ways and it's done in a way where this was intentional. It is so commendable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A must watch Tax driver,"I once watched this movie Taxi Driver,"" directed by Martin Scorsese and featuring a haunting performance by Robert De Niro, is a gritty exploration of urban isolation and mental instability. De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a disillusioned Vietnam War veteran who becomes a taxi driver in New York City. As he navigates the city's seedy underbelly, his growing alienation and obsession with cleaning up the streets lead him down a dark path.The film's cinematography captures the chaotic energy of 1970s New York, while Bernard Herrmann's haunting score amplifies the tension. De Niro's portrayal of Travis is both compelling and unsettling, making viewers empathize with his struggle while questioning his sanity.""Taxi Driver"" is a powerful commentary on loneliness and the search for purpose, leaving a lasting impact on audiences. Its iconic lines and themes continue to resonate, solidifying it as a classic in American cinema.

"Angsty, depressing: in the best way possible.","TAXI DRIVER is a late 70's film is timeless. The soundtrack may not have any similarities in today's movies, but the values that are present are universal. The loneliness of the main character, the wrongs of the world, the alienation of modern life is all present in this masterpiece of a movie. By the presentation of the main character, it avoids all the usual clichés of cinema, which is a relief. The city that is portrayed in this film is one that is decaying, one that is covered by filth and dirtiness. The film's main appeal is its focus on the human desires, such as trying to find purity in impurity. This is evident in Bickle's (played very well by Robert De Niro) interest in Betsey. The ending of the film is one of a masterpiece, with well done shots, memorable lines. It's gusts is something to be admired, that when doing with a subject matter such as drugs, prostitution it should be met with grit and realism as opposed to gloss. It will forever be a universal film, not because of the performances or script (which did help), but the universal themes and Martin Scorsese's uncompromising directing style. A must see film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Bob de Niro at his best,"This movie is amazing. Aside from the famous (and unbelievable) scene in which he stands in front of the mirror and says, ""You talkin' ta me?,"" de Niro's acting in this movie is top notch. Scorsese is as usual a brilliant director in the flick, portraying how this homocidal psycopath named Travis Bickle slowly goes nuts. I was also surprised to see Scorsese with a cameo in the movie as a jealous husband. And believe me, this movie has one of the bloodiest endings I have ever seen.

"A subversive and unflinching character-study with one of the most nuanced, well-realised protagonists of all time.","'Taxi Driver (1976)' is an interesting, subversive and unflinching character study, an amalgamation of genres that provides unexpectedly affecting results. You'd expect it to be a thriller, but it is actually more of a slow and methodical drama - despite all of its violence and otherwise seedy elements. As with most of Scorsese's work, the picture isn't interested in judging any of its characters or mindsets, no matter how deplorable they might be. Rather, it depicts its events with a candid honesty and asks us, the audience, to make up our own minds about them. This could sometimes be misconstrued as glamorisation, especially in its sequences involving guns and the 'cool' portrayal of 'masculinity' surrounding them, but I don't think this is the case. By portraying every scene in the same 'flat' way, the feature opens itself up to analysis, which is necessary on the part of every viewer - or, at least, those willing to think. It invites interpretation and critique, not of itself but of the choices of its characters. Speaking of characters, this features some of the most deplorable characters in any of Scorsese's work. These mostly arise in the latter movement of the piece, surrounding Jodie Foster's child prostitute character, and the moments including them are uncomfortable to say the least. As is the implication that more of them exist within the city, unseen but ready to crawl from beneath the surface or having just scuttled back down below. The feature is disturbing, especially in these harsher sequences, but it never crosses the line. It just maintains its method of being as candid as possible, portraying its seedy situations and asking us to do the judging for it. These moments don't make it hard to understand our protagonist's mindset that the city is filled with scum, though. Speaking of our protagonist, 'Travis Bickle' is easily one of the most unique and well-realised characters ever put to film. He certainly isn't a hero, he isn't even an anti-hero, but he also isn't a villain. He's just a man struggling, alone, to cope with his mental-illness and otherwise keep himself afloat. His deterioration from lonely and despondent to angry and disturbed, ultimately homicidal, is a compelling and engaging one. You like him and want him to be okay, but the events of the film weigh down on his already damaged psyche and turn his disillusion to all-out rage. The delusion that his violence could be motivated by pseudo altruism, a need to save - or 'clean' - his city, is one that only serves his need to justify his actions. He needs to act out his newfound impulses for no-one other than himself. Whether his first attempt fails due to extenuating circumstances as it appears or if it is due to his conscience is up for debate, as is if he wants to 'save' anyone at all. What isn't, is that he needs to act out his urges on someone, and he just so happens to do it on the right people. That's the only way he could ever be labelled a 'hero', and dangerously so. The 'downward spiral' arc isn't often done, though, and that, along with the fact it is done so deftly, is why it is so captivating to watch. The structure of the overall piece is unconventional, too, with a dream-like feel compounding its sort of 'aimed aimless' vibe. The performances and writing are excellent, both combining to make one of the most nuanced characters in film history. For me, this is the definitive Robert De Niro role. He should have won an Oscar for his work here. The two-handed score is phenomenal, as well. It combines flashes of our lead's possibly traumatic past with another character's certainly traumatic present, foreshadowing their fateful meeting. The direction is great, too, and serves to add to the effect that we are peeking into a man's life, a man who could be living next door. That makes the film quite scary. It's also sublime. A fantastic piece of work that's subversive, unconventional, uncomfortable and deeply affecting. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
De Niro and Foster's show,"Robert De Niro is Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle a deranged individual whose character is loosely based on Aurther Bremer, the man who shot Alabama Governor George Wallace.

Someday a real rain/reign will come down and wash away,"Martin Scorese's 1976 direction of Paul Schraeder's script `Taxi Driver' depicts the decline of civilization in urban America and one man's driven obsession to clean up the defilement.The protagonist of the film, Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) cannot sleep at night and begins working twelve hour and longer shifts driving a cab in New York City. Bickle is a Marine veteran from the Vietnam era (although it is unclear if he ever saw combat) who through his daily existence observes the filth, scum and urban decay of the modern metropolis. An interesting part of Travis's observations and life is that he does not seem to notice, or care that he is a part of the same hypocrisy. He is disgusted by the city and its urchins and yet he drinks and pops pills constantly, is racist and practically lives in porno theaters during his off hours. Through all of this he reaches to try and find a real human connections.Travis is obviously lonely and seeks to find the company of a woman. A presidential campaign worker, Cybil Sheperd, infatuates him and he does well with her for one and a half dates until his moment of undoing when he takes her to the movies. Sadly for Travis, he only seems to know about porno movies and Cybil quickly leaves him. Bickle also tries to befriend the concession girl at the porno theater (Diahnne Abbot) only to have her quickly call management to remove the harassing patron. The true find and motivator to action for Travis is the twelve year old prostitute played by Jodie Foster (Iris.) He runs into her a few times early in the action and later decides that he wants to try and rescue her from the world of drugs and pimps, particularly her pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel.)Nobody understands what is bothering Travis; not Betsy (Shepherd) or his fellow cabby, Wizard, played by Peter Boyle. Wizard seems to simplify all of the problems of the world into categories that work for him, like the notion that a man becomes his job and that all problems can be resolved by getting `laid.' Travis needs more than this to correct his problems.The acting in this film is superb all around. DeNiro, Foster and Keitel are all brilliant. Cybil Shepherd plays her role well; there is a lot of depth in the character even though she is not on screen for long. Her coworker, Tom (Albert Brooks) is so totally annoying you just kind of hope that he enters Bickle's rage. The fellow cabbies are portrayed so well and given such great dialogue I really think that they are cabbies and not actors. Like Hitchcock, Scorsese always puts himself in his own movies. In `Taxi Driver' he has more than a mere cameo as he portrays a passenger in Bickle's cab who is hell bent on setting his faltering marriage straight with the aid of a .44 magnum. Even Travis seems scared listening to his rants and raves. Scorsese should act more often.The climax is near when Bickle decides to meet with one of his colleague's friends, Easy Andy (Steven Prince.) Andy is the type of person that Travis is reaching out to destroy in this movie and yet he has no problem dealing with Andy because he will help Travis obtain the means to his end. Travis ends up purchasing a large assortment of heavy-duty handguns from Andy that he will use to invoke is reign of terror on the pimp, Sport and his associates.The ending of this movie seemed unbelievably gory and violent at the time of the movies release, and it still does to this day. The main difference is that now in the post-Bundy, Dahmer, Hinckley, Chapman, Columbine, Susan Smith, 9/11 world it is not as shocking. Post-modern society has bred a number of people who have murdered indiscriminately for no apparent reason except of their overwhelming hatred of society and their inability to fit in. I have always seen Bickle as something more than this; perhaps as the rescuer of a kid trapped in prostitution and a cleaner of street scum. But we cannot overlook Travis Bickle's flaws and contradictions. Isn't he a part of what he eradicates?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

DeNiro's second best performance of all time.,"Haunting, chilling, disturbing, and simply great film making. For a low budget film, Taxi driver delivers, and only a great director in Martin Scorsese can accomplish that. Robert DeNiro steals the show, his portrayal as a vietnam vet who slowly loses his mind due to the terrible things he witnesses day in and day out. He can't sleep, and everything seems to bother him, especially Newyork City's dark, hell on earth atmosphere which is actually the way it was back in those days. I almost felt as if i related to DeNiro's character personally in this film. I myself sometimes get so fed up with politics and drug dealers and pimps abusing young prostitutes, the crime, etc. Newyork is always exaggerated as a hopeless hell on earth in Scorsese films, but it is a very stressful place to live in and It could be depressing at times. (but i love it here too much, and will never leave) but besides that, this movie so great, DeNiro was only better in one film (the Raging Bull) in my opinion he was at his best in that movie, the way Pacino was in Scarface and the Godfather. Also, the soundtrack in this film is haunting and adds to that psychotic feeling that is going on in DeNiro's head as the movie progresses. Overall i rate this a 10 out of 10 **** 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Films Are Rarely As Powerful In Depicting A Tortured and Lonely Soul,"In the early '70s, Martin Scorsese was a young director who was slowly emerging as a talent for being one of the finest directors in cinema. In 1976 Taxi Driver was released and provoked fierce controversy across the US, as well as a stunning amount critical acclaim, some naming it, ""a landmark film of the 70s"". Over the years it gained reputation for many things, the most obvious being the hugely iconic ""you talking' to me?"" and De Niro's epic performance of the lonely, Travis Bickle.Taxi Driver follows the story of taxi driver, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro). A Vietnam veteran, struggling to accept the harsh, sleazy reality of New York slowly drifts away from reality and becomes obsessed with the idea of ""wiping the scum from the city"". It's a story that is structured with elegance and a slow ease. The script is memorable and flawless in its delivery, deserving the iconic status.When I first watched Taxi Driver I was not sure what to make of it, I certainly felt it was a tour de force work, littered with excellence. Yet, I always felt something was missing and that I was one of a handful of people who felt it was nothing more than a ""good film"". Over the years I have re-watched Taxi Driver and it has slowly grown on me. On my fourth viewing it finally hit me that Taxi Driver is a masterpiece. Something caught me, full-on and I felt so naïve to have not realised it sooner. I've always considered Scorsese to be one of the greatest visionaries in cinema, I've always loved his films and yet, Taxi Driver was his only film that took me time to truly acknowledge.Few films are as deep and offer so many re-watches with what is such a lurid, downbeat and disturbing subject matter. It's not easy viewing, yet it's a film that you'll be able and more importantly want to watch countless times. Few dramas are as fascinating and striking in visual style as Taxi Driver. The ability to engross you inside the mind of a mad-man and make you become the passenger in the taxi is astounding. You become apart of Travis' journey, a man plagued by insanity and yet one who holds frighteningly similar views of the revolting aspects of society. Except Travis is a man who takes it to the extreme because of the fact he has become traumatised by society and through society's transformation over the Vietnam period.Robert De Niro is the greatest actor to ever grace cinema, he also holds the greatest performance in cinema for Raging Bull and in Taxi Driver he gives another one of his other mesmerising performances. Travis Bickle is different to many of the other characters De Niro has wonderfully portrayed other the years and prove his dynamic versatility as an actor. He pulls off his performances with ease and that's because he steps inside the shoes of his character. We slowly watch Travis Bickle's charisma change as the film progresses, we note the difference in his reactions to a situation and we also observe his manners and the differences in how he treats himself after having his rage bottled up. It's a performance that has the important depth which is a key part to the film; Taxi Driver is about as captivating as a character study gets. The amazing cast; including, Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd and Harvey Keitel give career highlighting performances, perfecting their on-screen skills.Taxi Driver has a lot to say about the life we live in, giving us a portrait of some of the darkest elements of humanity. It's a film that bursts with its individual flare of film-making. The editing is sharp, clean-cut and filled with some beautifully haunting slow-motion footage. It's plagued by De Niro's poignant narration that echoes noir undertones and political insight. The cinematography is also astonishing in the way it captures the urban jungle of gritty culture. Then you have those magnificent metaphors; for example, the rain on the car windscreen to represent the washing away of guilty sins and the bubbling water to show the boiling up of suppressed anger. You've also got the tender score, mixed with a sleazy jazz ambiance which perfectly accompanies the experience. Martin Scorsese stamps his trademark of film-making style, making it impossible for another artist to plagiarise his work.There are no doubts that Taxi Driver offers the viewer many questions and ones to study till your heart's content knowing that your perception of a film like Taxi Driver can always change. For me it's evident that Taxi Driver remains Scorsese's most difficult work for a viewer and also one of his most perfected. It's a pure and simple fact that Taxi Driver is without hesitation a true cinematic masterpiece. Few films even come close to the indisputable power and fulfilment of Taxi Driver. One of the few films that becomes a greater experience every time, it's a personal and essential experience of film art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

So tjhis flick captures it all very well .It even alludes to the hippy commune phase which was very big for a time. This passed also .. I believe this is the fitst of the
Vigilante series of movies. Charles BRONSON MADE ALOT OF THEM. The American solution seems to be individual action with a gun. Wild West, In the east.. Disturbed people carry out their disturbed ideas. PerHaps that is why we have so many mass shootings. You have quite a cast of solid actors in this. Keitel,Deniro, and Foster went on to big careers.

Black elements in Taxi Driver,"Film noir has its own primary characteristics and conventions. For instance, most film noirs are shot in gloomy grays, blacks and whites. And the peak of production of film noir is from about 1945 to 1950. Taxi Driver, which was produced in the period of American Film Renaissance (1967-1976), was also one of film noirs because of the black elements in it. The film showed the dark and inhumane side of human nature cynicism and doomed love like all the traditional film noir. Travis fell in love with Betsy, who firstly appeared as an angel according to Travis. She found Travis attractive at first and was willing to go out some times with him, which was concluded as strange finally. There were all kinds of women in the society. But he could not have one, only because he was contradictive as Betsy described, though he had a clear-conscience. On the contrary, those who had not clear-conscience could have those women, such as dirty politicians and even pimps. It's the unfair and dark side of not only the human experience, but also the society. It's a world filled with entrapment, menace and squalid in which people were tend to go wrong and crazy. Usually, the protagonists in film noir were driven by their past or by human weakness to do something very wrong. In Taxi Driver, Travis came back from the army with no work, no friends, nothing, but a clear conscience, a sensitive heart and ability of action. The story was of urban night scenes and mostly took place in murky streets and dimly-lit buildings or hotel rooms. The director often took Travis's sight as the camera angle. When he observed the world from the front window of his taxi, the director of Taxi Driver used expressionistic lighting in making lots of disorienting and colorful sights to allude to the distorted world. And he also skillfully edited a succession of jarring scenes, like prostitutes, queens and fairies walking on the street, together as all kinds of epitomes of the dark society. Sometimes, narratives of a film noir would be made by the male protagonist as self-confession or backward look. Taxi Driver just changed the narratives into self-talk, diaries and letters, which, I think, also marked the movie as black. ""I go all over. I take people to the Bronx, Brooklyn, to Harlem. I don't care. Don't make no difference to me."" pointed out that Travis was lonely and alienated to the society by others or maybe by himself. Without any intention to join the sick and venal world, Travis wished that someday a real rain would come and wash all the scum off the street. It was the murky world and the failure of approaching other people that disappointed and despaired Travis and got him out of the belief for God. Travis bought four guns and decided to clear up the dirt of the world himself as he cleaned up the blood on the backseats of his taxi, which had been his expectation to the president candidate. When Travis used the gun at the first time to kill a robber in a convenient store, he was at loss about what to do now. The store keeper was very calm and told Travis that he could just leave and he would handle it himself. This detail revealed us a fact that this kind of robbery and killing was not fresh but happening all the time and all around in the city.He wanted to be the never-coming God and tried his best to rescue and change the doomed destiny of the innocent prostitute, Iris, who was a comparison to Betsy. He did it, but still failed to be God. The red lights, showing all the time, symbolized that he would be stopped and dragged slow from time to time. After he killed Matthew and other baddies, everything went back to facial peace again very soon, as if nothing had really happened. He was and would never be a tragic hero. He was only a general taxi driver or even merely a pair of common eyes watching and witnessing what was happening in the world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Yet another Scorcese masterpiece,"Martin Scorcese is one of the world's most talented directors. If you're reading this review then you know this already. This is one of his earlier efforts but that doesn't mean that this film lacks power or quality. It's a shame that more movies aren't like this. Robert De Niro plays the Anti-hero Travis Bickle, the typical everyman, with skill and intensity. Jodie Foster shows her early acting chops as a prostitute that Travis fancies. The city of New York in the 70's is practically a character in the movie and is shown in all it's gritty glory. Travis grows tired of watching the human scum polluting the city get away with everything and decides to take matters into his own hands. The result is a view of the transformation of the character that De Niro handles with aplomb. The movie deserves all the kudos that it gets in the media and is well worth viewing. Bottom Line: You can't call yourself a movie fan and not have Taxi Driver on your shelf. Movies this good are rare and worth appreciating.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"In retrospect, quite funny, in an odd way","When I saw this movie again a few years ago, what struck me the most-compared to when I watched it on VHS as a teenager for the first time-was the humour of this movie. Hmmm, maybe the humour is unintentional...I dunno. Funny in any case.Here's a brief and (very) vague synopsis of the plot: a veteran of the Vietnam war (Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle) returns to the U.S.A. and works as a taxi driver. He forms relationships as a result of his work with two people on opposite ends of the social spectrum: a young, beautiful, middle-class woman (Cybill Shepherd as Betsy) who is helping a politician run for office, and an underaged sex worker (Jodie Foster as Iris Steensma). Perhaps the movie is part social commentary on the time of the Vietnam War...I dunno. In any case, Bickle seems to damaged by his experience in The Nam and by the world he comes back to. Towards the end of the movie, there is some gory violence, so, if you don't like the sight of blood, this might be one to avoid.Now, for the real reason I posted up this review...to share the parts of the movie that made an impression on me: firstly, as a young teen, I can't really believe how I did not form a giant exclamation mark over my head when Bickle takes Betsy to a hardcore porn movie on their first date. Man, that is just SO funny, on reflection! So yeah...that's another thing I should mention-you do see some shots of what the 'love birds' are watching...and I can't remember how explicit it is-there is naked flesh though.Lastly, another funny thing about this movie-who'd a thunk that taxi drivers discuss philosophy amongst themselves? And Bertrand Russell to boot! That's another thing that didn't trigger an epileptic laughing fit the first time I saw it. Hmmm...maybe if Bickle worked at McDonald's the scene would have been more believable?Parting shot-De Niro is very good in this movie. Can't say the same for ""Mean Streets""-well, I mean that the movie is not that good, not Bob. He does have a great scene in Mean Streets where he reveals his true nature. Kind of like a similarly great scene in the Australian movie ""He died with his felafel in his hands"", where the main character's emotions bubble over the surface.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not the classic everyone thinks it is.,"Martin Scorsese made far better films like ""Raging Bull,"" ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" and ""Goodfellas."" They have actual narratives and the plots make sense. ""Taxi Driver"" has a confusing narrative and the ending left me annoyed as it wasn't clear what the ending was meant to be! Robert DeNiro - who has made some good films - is well cast as the mentally disturbed Vietnam veteran who gradually loses touch with reality. The way he begins to come loose at the seams - psychologically speaking - is quite disturbing. Martin Scorsese's direction is very good on the whole. As witnessed in previous films from the decade, we are given a truly honest look at city life in New York. The dirty, trashy streets and the dirty, trashy people all contribute to the look of the film and also the way that Travis Bickle (DeNiro) views the world. The violence is explicit, which I except. After all, a film like ""Taxi Driver"" can't be glossed over with ""comic strip"" violence. What I don't particularly care for, is the language. It isn't difficult for actors to use all the 4 letter words they can think of and this partly defeats the film. I cringed on occasion at some of the foul language used and the manner in which it was intended. It is the climax that ultimately lets ""Taxi Driver"" down. Somehow, I doubt whether such events would have finished that way in real life. This is a misfire but an interesting misfire.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A brilliant and dark nightmare of the Urban Citylife.,"""He is a Prophet and a Pusher. Partly true partly fiction, A walking contradiction""- These lines are the best to describe the character of Travis Bickle as played by Robert De Niro. Yes you guessed it right. Today we are going to review one of the masterpieces of 70's ( not THE MASTERPIECE of 70's ) directed by Martin Scorese - TAXI DRIVER. In one word , the blend of Schrader's script , Scorese's direction and De Niro's performance is both compelling and disconcerting.
STORY
Travis (played by Robert De Niro) is an ex-marine and Vietnam veteran , suffers from Insomnia and lives in isolation in New York City. His Insomnia makes him take a job as a night taxi driver , driving passengers around the city. He used to maintain a diary and often he used to watch pornographic films thinking that is the only type of films existing in this world. ( A note : This film should not be taken as a New York Film , it is not about a city but about the weathers of a man's soul ) Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy ( played by Cybill Shepherd ), a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, then takes her out for coffee. On a later date, he naively takes her to see a pornographic film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His numerous attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers and apologizing over the phone are rebuffed, causing him to become embittered and convinced that she is exactly like the ""cold"" people he detests in the city. Rejected by beautiful political aide Betsy after a catastrophic date at one of the ubiquitous porn theatres, Travis becomes ambiguously obsessed with child prostitute Iris (played by Jodie Foster), abused by her pimp Sport (played by Harvey Keitel). The violent pressure inside his skull is made worse by listening to the psychotic fantasies of a creepy passenger, a cameo from Scorsese himself.
That evening, Travis drives to Sport's brothel. Travis shoots Sport in the stomach, causing a shootout to start. He shoots Iris' Time Keeper in the hand, but Sport gets up and shoots him in the neck before Travis guns him down again. Then Iris' customer comes through the door from her room and shoots him in the arm and Travis kills him with the sleeve concealed gun. He is attacked by the Time Keeper again who he stabs through the hand and finally shoots dead before the crying Iris. As the police arrive, Travis attempts to commit suicide, but runs out of ammo. Travis' shootout is seen by the police and press as an attempt to rescue Iris from armed gangsters. He is not prosecuted, and is hailed as a local hero in the press.
He receives a letter from Iris' father, thanking him for saving her and revealing that she has returned home to Pittsburgh, where she is going to school. After weeks of recovery and returning to work, Travis encounters Betsy as a fare. Travis drives her home, then refuses to let her pay the fare, driving away with a smile. As Travis drives off, he becomes suddenly agitated after noticing something in his rear-view mirror. Thus the film ends leaving us to a disturbing picture of social disarray.
CAST :
ROBERT DE NIRO was an excellent choice for the protagonist of the movie. He clearly proved that loneliness is the cancer that allows self destruction to reach its peak. His eyes clearly had an expression of disgust and an aim of removing from the streets of New York. Although he could have run his taxi throughout the cities he preferred to roam around in this nasty lanes of NewYork. His dialogues also had a special significance as his words perfectly fitted his character. There is a scene where he says ""you talking to me?"" Watch this scene and you will fall in love with the MAN. ( Comment down if you want a detailed character sketch of this character and how Todd Phillips got inspired from this movie to make JOKER-2019 ) here's Jodie Foster, chillingly cast as a twelve-year-old prostitute whom Travis wants to ""save.""
DO I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE ?YES. YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY WATCH THIS FILM IF YOU LOVE GOOD FILMS. THE FILM IS MUCH AHEAD OF ITS TIME AND IT PORTRAYS THE LIFE OF EVERY CITY. NO MATTER HOW CHARMING OR ATTRACTIVE YOUR CITY MIGHT LOOK LIKE BUT IT MOSTLY ENDS UP WITH THIS SHADY STREETS , DIRTY BUSINESS AND WHAT NOT. AS A COMMON MAN WE ALL THINK OF BURNING THE SYSTEM AND THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY TRAVIS. ALTHOUGH HE IS PORTRAYED AS A HERO AFTER THE END OF THE CLIMAX BUT THE FILM ENDS WHERE TRAVIS LOOKS AT THE CITY WITH HIS SIDE VIEW MIRROR WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION AS HE HAD BEFORE SHOWING THAT HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS THIS CITY HAS REMAINED THE SAME. THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IS BRILLIANT. IT HAS CAPTURED THE 70s AMERICA LIKE NEVER BEFORE.

"Robert De Niro is one messed up ""Taxi Driver""","There are so few films as intense and cinematically powerful, and relevant, as Martin Scorcese's 1976 hit ""Taxi Driver."" The film is powerful, provocative, intense, disturbing, and violent. At the center of it, is a powerful, landmark performance by Robert De Niro as a mentally disturbed ex-Vietnam vet-turned-nighttime New York City taxicab driver named Travis Bickle.In a city of well over four million people (and counting), De Niro's Travis Bickle character is so lonely, so unable to relate to other human beings, and so isolated from the rest of society that he might as well as not even exist. He takes to driving around a cab a night in an attempt to deal with an intense bout of insomnia. He also seeks a cure for his loneliness by attempting to date the pretty Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign volunteer for an aspiring presidential candidate who's running on a platform of radical social change. But his plan goes sour when he takes her to a porno theater and she refuses to speak to him afterward.This tiny mishap pushes Bickle over the edge.He's taken a radical dislike to what he sees as the ""scum of the earth"": the crime, the violence, drug distribution, decadence, sleaze, perversion, prostitution and general amorality that is causing the city to decay from the inside-out, both morally and spiritually. And it doesn't take long for him to begin to act on his violent impulses, since he now has an outlet for his rage. He embarks on an intense physical fitness regimen and eventually purchases a series of illegal firearms to aid him in his mission of ridding New York City of society's undesirables. That's why he's currently gunning for Sport (Harvey Keitel), the slick-talking pimp of teenage runaway-turned-prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster), which ultimately culminates in a bloodbath ending that truly has to be seen to believed.""Taxi Driver"" was widely acclaimed upon its release in 1976, especially after claiming the prized Palme d'Or at Cannes. But it was also heavily criticized for its controversial subject matter that included its ruminations on the violent thoughts of its mentally disturbed lead character and gore-laden climax. It is also not enough that Paul Schrader's screenplay was reportedly inspired by the private diaries of Arthur Bremer, the gunman behind the attempted assassination of George Wallace in 1972. It is also not enough that the screenplay is semi-autobiographical in more ways than one - not just because of its relation to a real-life would-be assassin, but also because the anger, rage, frustration, and isolation behind the life of screenwriter Paul Schrader also feeds into the film's pervasive anger, grittiness, paranoia, and oft-violent mind-set.""Taxi Driver"" may have reached the peak of its controversy - more like, infamy - when John Hinckley, Jr., a noted obsessive of the film, attempted to assassinate then-President Ronald Reagan in 1981, in an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster, whom he had an obsessive romantic infatuation with. Talk about life imitating art, since in the film, Bickle makes an attempt on the life of the politician Betsy is working for (like Hinckley would try to do for Jodie Foster in just five years' time). Whether or not Bickle did this to get her attention in the film, is not totally clear.""Taxi Driver"" is my favorite picture by Martin Scorsese, who also appears in a not-so-self-serving-and-actually-pretty-effective cameo in the middle of the film as a man on the trail of his adulterous wife, whom he plans to kill when he gets the chance. After this film, I would consider Scorsese's next great pictures (in order) to be ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (1988) and ""Goodfellas"" (1990). I would put ""Raging Bull"" (1980) in there somewhere but I haven't seen it yet.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Impeccable Masterpiece, Scorsese´s dark poetry","In this brillant movie the creators (Scorsese-Schrader) introduced strong parameters to invert the way to see good and evil. The principal character (Travis / Robert De Niro) could be a `hero' and at the same time be completely evil, it depends our point of view. Robert De Niro composed one of his best roles, memorable, anthological. And there´s another way to observe the movie: the religious way. Catholic God becomes very upset and sent a Revenge Angel to put the order of the human world again on the way. New York, considered one of the first cities of the `New World', is the perfect place to show how the human beens lost his spiritually. Travis -first taciturn and polite- becomes the eyes of the spectator, our eyes, and then he start suffering like Christ but he can´t stand this, so he turned to be the hand of Spiritual Justice. He do all `we want to do' when we saw the scum of the streets, the lies of the politics or a woman so ungrateful: Kill with the Sword of Justice. But he is a man, he is an ex-marine who was in Vietnam´s Inferno for his Ungrateful Country, a poor simple boy with nothing to do... except one thing. He can `see' the things with innocence and perspective at the same time. The Cab is his `house' and the Night his be st moment -a spirit of the night-, he has a name but it seems that he came from nowhere. He is real and a ghost at the same time. Each tackle is a personal problem to solve for Travis, each person became his personal difficult task to do. The camera an the edition are both technically perfect showing the particular character´s behaviour. The eyes of Scorsese an his personal way of filming show early evolution, complexity and subtle. With this film one of the best american (and wolrdwide) directors composed a remarkable movie.There´s more: Bernard Hermann´s outstanding `bolero' music making a perfect ambient -his last work -; excellent Schrader´s script and talented support actors like Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Cybill Shepherd and young Jodie Foster; all of this contributions showed one of the best portrait of the American Nightmare with polished style, magnificent work, strongly expressive.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

They were both nominated for Oscars and De Niro should have won.Other things in the movie that make it perfect is Paul Schraders Original Screenplay.

"Left in the dust by ""Bringing out the Dead""","""Taxi driver"", still shocking and disturbing, is far from the masterpiece it seemed when first released.  Watching it on DVD and listening to the cast discussing the film is revealing - the script is incredibly uneven, and events almost incidental to the main ""story"", of Travis and his decline.The acting, timing, and direction still shine, but the far inferior script is shown up by the brilliant ad libs and character work of the actors.  For a far more complete view of Hell's Kitchen, and the other side of the darkness, you should really see the mature ""pseudosequel"" to this, ""Bringing out the dead"".  Far more coherant, in script, acting, and direction, it shows up the many flaws in this underdeveloped mess.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A modern French new-wave,"This film is a truly modern reworking of classic cinematography. Yes - I know it's over 30 years old, but the shot of the soluble aspirin, the montage and overhead pan of the final crime scene - very new-wave and very well presented. The characters are perfectly researched and very well performed, the soundtrack is perfect.The only criticism I have is that Bickle's character isn't properly developed at the start of the film. He's this ex-marine with a rough streak - but this is barely touched upon, instead the film presents him as some literary recluse - writing elegiac passages about his life in a diary by lamplight to a jazz soundtrack - and his character isn't like that - he rants about scum on the streets to Palantine - he takes a chick to a porn movie...But that's all - I thought it was terrific.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

After all the flowers are gone in post-sixties America,"This is one of those milestone films in America cinema about which millions of words have been written, and everybody who's anybody in filmdom has seen.It received a mixed reception when it appeared twenty-five years ago, and of course the Academy did not reward it.Taxi Driver remains a difficult movie to evaluate. On the one hand there can be no doubt about the brilliance of Martin Scorsese's direction in which he makes excruciatingly real the street level life of a taxicab driver in the big city. Harsh, multi-hued lighting of predatory street scenes, the cheap, bleak interior of the taxi driver's apartment, the vacuous phrases and promises of the politician, the brutality of guns and knives, the sordidness of things left in the backseat of cabs, and the gritty litter of the streets have the effect of immersing us into the cabby's world. Nor can there be any doubt about the brilliance of Robert De Niro in the title role.He portrays the alienated, misfitted psychotic mentality of Vietnam vet Joshua Bickle poignantly, compellingly, and with a larger than life lividity. Jodie Foster is the very essence of a post-sixties flower child morphed into a twelve and a half year old prostitute. Her childlike ability to find sustenance amid the objective horror of her life compelled our sympathy. Foster's flawless projection of the little girl's pathetic street-wise facade rightfully catapulted her to national attention. Cybill Shepherd was also excellent as a post-Kennedy era political strawberry, and Harvey Keitel was very good as the sleazy pimp, as was Peter Boyle as a cabby philosopher.On the other hand, the stagy blood splashing toward the end, and the lingering thereon, seemed a little cheap, as though Scorsese did not have complete faith in his production and thought a violence fix was needed to satisfy his audience. Also the fantasy ending in which the unlikely happens like a cartoon joke seemed a contrivance from someone not sure about the import of his movie. The scene in which Cybill Shepherd enters De Niro's empty cab, seemingly to entice him, plays at first like a fantasy, but after he deposits her on the curb, we know it is supposed to be real. Incidentally, the fact that he doesn't notice her until he sees her in his rearview mirror, although he walked up to the cab with her in it, suggests something hurriedly dreamed up during production as a quick commentary on what has gone before.Nonetheless the ending is transcended because Scorsese had a great movie all along, with outstanding acting and a compelling story artfully shot, leading to a socially-conscience experience vividly reflecting the disillusionment of post sixties America.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Scorsese's First Masterpiece,"Taxi Driver is a groundbreaking and classic film, showcasing DeNiro's brilliant performance of Travis Bickle which in my opinion tops that of La Motta in Raging Bull. DeNiro plays the ultimate loner and violent psychopath in Taxi Driver, yet he displays enough charisma causing the viewer to care for this unsavory character he portrays. This is a rare feat for an actor to accomplish. Given Paul Schrader's screenplay refrains from resorting to manipulative cliché to generate sympathy for an unsavory main character like Bickle. Robert DeNiro deserved the best actor Academy Award for this film.Scorsese's direction is immaculate. The ""Late For The Sky"" sequence is a prime example of the depth DeNiro puts into his performance, conveying so much about the character he is playing without saying a single word. Harvey Keitel is very good as Bickle's foil, Sport. Foster is terrific playing a kid who is more wise to the ways of the world than Travis. Taxi Driver is flawless. A Character study of a troubled & lonely individual who feels ignored by society and driven crazy by his surroundings of urban decay. Bickle feels the only way he will ever get noticed by the girl he adores is by becoming a vigilante. This he feels will get Betsy to notice him. Travis feels he is making a difference by cleansing the city of unsavory elements and rescuing a 12 year old prostitute from her pimp, Sport, and his accomplices. The film which was made in 1976 showed a dark underbelly of society in America which still holds true today. More than ever in fact. Taxi Driver is a comment on society. Too often in the news you hear of disturbed and psychologically damaged people who obviously feel leaving their imprint on society through a shocking outburst of violence is the only way to get noticed.Bernard Herrmann's memorable score fits the mood of the film perfectly. Michael Chapman's cinematography is perfection. The debated controversial ending is open to interpretation. When Bickle is Driving Betsy in the cab. Thus ultimately one of the many brilliant aspects of Taxi Driver, without giving too much away. A thought-provoking and fascinating cinematic experience.

We call him an anti-hero because he murdered. But to Travis it's not murder, it's war. In war you find your spot, you watch and pick out your enemies, then you prepare to combat knowing that a soldier must learn to fight with one thought in his mind: fight not for survival but for the benefit of others.

An intelligence film,"Taxi Driver is a big movie, but perhaps at present it would not have so much success as it had it in the 70.

It has spectacular moments, as the attempt of murder of the president of the USA, remembering the mortal offense to Kennedy or the mohican look that Robert De Niro shows in the final stretch. An essential movie for lovers of this genre, with a big re-duck and with the spectacular director, who shows a New York of the 70 that was advancing towards the crime and the vice at big speed, and in that an unstable person was unable to escape of this underworld that him was making a detour.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Second Time Around,"Ok, now I saw this movie for the first time when I was 16 and I have to admit I was rather unimpressed with it. I found it to be a leaden, disorientated trudge through the dregs of New York. I thought that Travis Bickle was an underdeveloped and incoherent character who never gave us a satsfactory reason for his psychological collapse. ""But that was then - hell I liked the Matrix back then and I even gave the Two Towers a second chance"" I thought. So I gave it another whirl.I'm glad I did. Taxi Driver is one of the most atmospheric and intricately explored character studies in American cinema. Scorcese drags the audience through the gutter and pulls no punches in his portrayal of NYC and its denizens. He highlights Bickle's(DeNiro) increasing detachment from society by jamming him in the corner of his shots, even placing him off camera at times. This is offset by a more subjective POV in scenes where Bickle is alone...Bickle's fantasy of being a 'somebody' manifests itself in how he perceives himself in the guise of a movie star, best illustrated in the iconic ""You talkin to me"" mirror scene. This is further illustrated in scenes where entire crowds turn their heads to look at his taxi....he tells hiss parents that he cannot reveal ""his location due to the sensitive nature of his work for the government."" Evidently his grasp on reality has suffered a blow because of his failure to fulfil 'the American dream' - some say its the after effects of the Vietnamese war that have caused this, I don't think this is true largly because Bickle is an unreliable narrator - he may never actually have been in the army and even if he was he may never have seen combat after all his gunmanship certainly leaves a lot to be desired. Essentially Bickle has deluded himself into believing that he may be ""the rain to wash all this filth away"". Look at his intervention with Jodie Foster's young prostitute or his relationship with Cybil Shepard. Clearly he sees himself in the guise of a modern day messiah. When it ended I was left in awe at the skill with which this movie was made the acting and direction was first class and Paul Schrader's screenplay was wonderfully ambiguous. The moral?

Tax driver the best 90's,"Not only one of Scorsese's best films, but one of the best of the 70s. It is very hard hitting, dark and still has the resonance and power to shock. The cinematography is measured and chilly, yet very atmospheric, while Bernard Hermann's swansong score is superb, yet more proof at how amazing a composer he was. The story is unsettling but wonderfully told, and the script is brilliantly written. Scorcese also directs impeccably, while the acting is just excellent. Robert DeNiro gives one of his best performances, the whole film is worth watching just for his performance, that's how good it is, but that's not to dismiss Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel and Cybill Sheppard in the supporting cast for they are just as good while Scorsese's own cameo is genuinely frightening.

A superb depiction of a darker facet of New York,"It took ""Departed"" in 2006 for Scorsese to finally get his first Oscar for the Best Film awaiting through the several nominations he earned for almost each of the films he directed including ""Taxi Driver,"" which is hailed as one of the quintessential film-noirs. The film was especially popular for the performances of Robert De Niro as a former marine veteran and Jodie Foster as a 12 year old prostitute, both of whom earned Oscar nominations for their roles. Though unlovely and inadequate in its motives, the best thing of the film is the picturesque depiction of hell of a metropolis including the gangsters and pimps. Besides, it stands an epitome of the period gained through the vivid characterization, which is to haunt your mind for a time. No wonder if you are a serious film buff, you will enjoy the ensemble of Hollywood talents in their early days including Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, and Harvey Keital. While watching it, I couldn't help myself from comparing it to Scorsese's less known movie ""Bringing Out the Dead,"" following the similar theme.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Post-modern masterpiece,"The very embodiment of a post-modern masterpiece, director Martin Scorsese's gritty hymn to big city desperation remains one of the most haunting films ever made. Robert De Niro is outstanding as the titular anti-hero. Driven to insanity by the rejection of the unobtainably beautiful Cybill Shepherd, and intent on saving child prostitute Jodie Foster, De Niro's mentally unstable Travis Bickle is the exact type of morally ambiguous character that becomes an insane murderer to some and a martyred hero to others. It is a difficult and risky maneuver to ask audiences to enter into the world of such an individual, but De Niro and Scorsese never make a single wrong turn in their attempt to provide an understanding, nonjudgmental view of such madness.The film is intentionally filmed in very grainy, muted colors with relatively poor definition and contrast, which perfectly suits the film's uneasy subject matter. The atmosphere is so vivid, you'll swear you can smell the stench of the back alley garbage piles and the odor of freshly spray-painted graffiti. And De Niro's towering performance is far from the only standout in the cast, with Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle, and Harvey Keitel all turning terrific work. This particularly true of Jodie Foster, who, at the right old age of 14, gives a performance of startling maturity and unsettling weariness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The eyes of a lost soul.,"Some movies have the power and the immediacy to get into your head and wash way any preconceptions and reservations of how they are made. Movies like Gone With The Wind, Star Wars, The Godfather, and 2001's A Space Oddessey, are one of the few that can achieve this goal. With Taxi Driver, directed by Martin Scorsese, this film pulls you in and never lets go.The premise of this urban tale deals with a lost soul living amongst the gritty decadence filled with sleazy, unscrupulous individuals, violence and crime. He goes about his days picking up fares along the way. However, his mind descends further into madness and anger until he finally....snaps.What Scorsese has achieved is nothing short of amazing. The cinematography completely absorbs you into '70s era of NYC with an air of authentically mesmerizing atmosphere punctuated by on the edge lashing out fury with a riveting score that sets the tone of the film perfectly. Overriding this all is the stunning performance of Robert Deniro, who gives the central character of the piece a conflicting angst antihero whose only chance may be that of possible redemption is when he meets a a young prostitute (played by Jodie Foster)torn between her family and the doomed society that she inhabits. Cybil Sheperd and Harvey Kietel give good supporting performances as well; although Cybil's is a little weak in spots but still tops it off.This is more than just a film. It is a diatribe of a man who views the world as dark, bleak, and violent. It is the story of a man who longs for companionship. Ultimately, it is the story of a man who lashes out at the world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A film about taxi driving has never so good,"Dark, gripping and shocking. It will make you feel uncomfortable but it's suspose too. From the sweet jazz music to contrast of dark and murkey new York City. A powerful movie which by an large is mostly about nothing. Not a bad performance by any of the actors and de Niro performance is captivating. The plot for most part is easy to grasp however I do feel there are two scenarios which really let the film down towards the end of movie. The ending itself did not overly impress me and seems to run on just a touch too long. You could also say the movie is two paced with alot more happening towards the end however personally I found this worth waiting for and truly gratifying.

Wonderfull character study,"Films as these are not often made these days, in which character and narrative are at the core of the movie rather than the plot. It took me several times to appreciate this movie, and maybe it is best suited for age peers of the protagonist - De Niro, Scorsese and Schrader were al in their mid-twenties during shooting.

It's all about craziness. It's a mathematic problem, when you should solve both Schrader's theories and Scorsese's mind to translate Schrader's theories. It's complicated. One of those films who wins the Palme d'Or in Cannes. Though, it's bizarre how you still think about the film after you've watched it, how you still try to understand why he tried to kill Palantine?

DiNero created a cinematic hero out for a city that tosses him rightfully aside,"A 1970's disaffected Vet who never fully matured is the subject to be observed, if not actually studied.

Cybill Sheppard, Albert Brooks, Jody Foster, Harvey Keitel and even Peter Boyle are props for DeNiro's epiphany.The jazz score makes no sense and Travis' date at the porn theater is almost out of context and these stand out as over-reaching, which has become a Scorsese trademark. Never the less a classic character movie with some unforgettable sequences. Is Travis Bickle a vigilante, a criminal, a folk hero, a war victim, a savior, or a psychopathic bomb just waiting to explode? You talking' to me?"" The epilogue meanders yes!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
**** out of ****,"""Taxi Driver"" is an amazing movie in every sense.  Beautifully directed, scripted, and acted, it is one of the most outstanding pieces of cinema created in the 20th century.The story revolves around Travis Bickle, a lonely, disturbed man totally out of step with society.  He takes a job as a cab driver because he can't sleep at night.  He goes through several different events that have an impact on the story.  First, he meets Betsy (Cybil Shepherd), a campaign worker for Senator Palentine, a man running for president.  His relationship fails with Betsy, and he moves on.  He then meets a young prostitute, Iris (Jodie Foster), which leads to the bulk of the rest of the movie.I have deliberately left out many important plot points, because the movie should be viewed for itself.  The themes and characters of the movie are among the most well developed and complex in any movie ever filmed.  The beauty of the film is in Schrader, Scorsese, and De Niro's ability to present a character so off the wall, so despicable, and so unique, but yet one that we can all relate to in some ways.  There is a little bit of Travis Bickle in every one of us.How so?  Travis is ""God's lonely man"".  He sees himself as being different from everybody.  He describes them as ""cold and distant"".  He doesn't approach it in a hostile way, rather going about his business, blending in as a nice, charming man.  But, the loneliness is there.This theme of loneliness is central, but so is the theme of redemption. Travis needs to do something big.  He doesn't know what, but he has to do it.  However, as he attempts to do it, he slips up, several times, because of his inability to connect with the real world.Everybody has felt this way, some of us more than others.  We've all felt out of step with society, in need of some form of redemption, if not on the scale that Travis Bickle has.  De Niro's flawless performance, in my opinion as good as or better than that in ""Raging Bull"", communicates this loneliness to the viewer.Aside from the themes, the characters, and the performances, the movie is a technical masterpiece.  The lighting, camera angles, the editing - all are perfect.  Scorsese created a work that technically stands up to any film ever made.Watch this movie.  If not because it is a cornerstone of modern cinema, a must see for any movie buff, then because it can present an emotional connection to the main character that few films have ever done before.  Many viewers will dislike it because it lacks a fast pace, a Hollywood storyline, or an action or explosions.  But, for those who can truly appreciate cinematic greatness in all of its glory, this movie must be seen to be believed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Taxi Driver,"Taxi drivers may be the loneliest occupation. They also shuttle in the red and wine every day, but they can't get into it all the time.

Fantastic character study with a brilliant ending,"""Taxi Driver"" is a movie that thrives on the fact that anything Travis Bickle does is incredibly interesting. There's not much to the first hour, he just hangs around his apartment and occasionally drives a taxi. And yet, it's incredibly fascinating because there's so much suppressed rage in the character. You don't know what to think of him, but somehow you do know it can't go well for very long. When everything goes to hell you get a fantastic and pretty unpredictable ending, but it's the suspenseful build-up that really makes this movie a classic. Bickle is slowly driven to the edge by this filthy town full of whores, robbers, killers and Harvey Keitel with a stupid hat. You never know how he's going to react to a certain situation, which makes the violent outbursts very effective. In ""Taxi Driver"" Scorsese has very much the same style he was developing in ""Mean Streets"", but it seems like he has a lot more to say here. A truly unique movie by a director at the top of his league.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""Are you talking to me?!""...","This film is a milestone in cinema, and elegantly combines a good story, good actors, an exceptional director and a technical execution full of talent and well-achieved artistic notes. A perfect movie? Maybe not... but it came close!The film takes place in New York during a summer of the seventies. The city is dystopian, ugly and dirty in every way: the ubiquitous garbage, the amorality that dominates, the characters from the marginal environment, the misrepresentation of sexuality, the normalization of prostitution and pornography, the violence and crime that occasionally appear to us. In the midst of this, Travis Bickle, a Vietnam War veteran who lives an unhappy existence in a filthy apartment, makes a living as a night shift taxi driver. A lonely and depressed man, he internally represses his anguish, bitterness and the thoughts of violence that assail him, until a Platonic love for a deified woman results in a heartbreak that leads him to a dramatic and brutal outcome, where he will decide the fate of a young minor prostitute who, by chance, crosses his life.I could talk a lot about this movie, because it's one of those movies that is worth watching carefully to see all the little details. The sexy clothes of the prostitutes, the extravagant clothes of the men, drug dealers and pimps, the dirty and disorganized environment of the protagonist's apartment, the symbolic detail of the burning of flowers or that camera that, leaving the protagonist on the phone with his love interest, shows a hallway as empty and bleak as his personal life. Martin Scorsese gives us one of his most masterful works, with impeccable execution and a magnificent sense of aesthetics and taste.The cast includes several well-known and talented names, but it's Robert De Niro who makes the movie work. With a powerful, charismatic, brutally intense and sharp performance, the actor achieves one of the most significant works of his career, an authentic business card that will open many doors for him and help to make him one of the consecrated and iconic actors of the second half of 20th century. Equally striking, an extremely young and beautiful Jodie Foster balances herself, harmoniously and paradoxically, between the childlike sweetness of her character and the harshness, inhumanity and vice of the world she inhabits. Harvey Keitel is excellent in the role of a pimp for teenagers and Cybill Shepherd, despite being an ephemeral and extremely deified character, fulfills her role wonderfully. Even Scorsese decides to appear, in a cameo with an apparently sterile dialogue, but which places the weapons inside the protagonist's mind, as a subliminal message.Technically, the film is extraordinary. Personally, if I were a film student, I feel that I would have to see this film with a student's eye, observing the details and the technical, artistic and stylistic options adopted. Nothing is thoughtless, from the neon ads to the fading of colors in the gunfight scene, which is one of the most bombastic and graphically violent exchanges to date. The cinematography is amazing, the filming work was executed to perfection, the sets and costumes are really well executed. With few effects, the quality stands out. The soundtrack is excellent, atmospheric and powerful, and was the last to be composed by Bernard Herrmann, who would die even before the release of the film, which was otherwise dedicated to him.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
not worth two hours,"I'd say Taxi Driver was good enough to hold my attention, but not good enough to entertain me.  DeNiro is simply a good enough screen personality to make any movie watchable.  Heck, I could watch him read the paper and be intrigued.  There were a couple of memorable scenes, and we all know what they were, which made me glad to have seen it.  The rest was just weird and hard for me to identify with.  Jody Foster was annoying to me.  I'm not saying the film was bad, but that's about it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Good enough, albeit...","First of all, this is a cinematic gem for various creative aspects, which is excellent from that perspective; however, this doesn't always translate into a film that endures over the years. The slow pace with a chaotic plot or abruptly slowed-down scenes doesn't translate very well into modern cinema, although it was common at that time. For this reason, I felt a certain friction throughout the entire movie, even until the end. Nonetheless, there are many aspects worth highlighting, and this is why it may deserve a place in our times. For example, the acting is brilliant in most cases; it was a pleasure to see Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster. Additionally, the photographic composition of each scene is brilliant, and even the script, in certain scenes, did a good job. I wouldn't say in everything, but in some plot twists, and even by characterizing the identities of the characters.In summary, I would recommend this movie, but especially to those who can appreciate those details; otherwise, this film might feel boring, particularly due to the slow narrative pace that takes place over 90 minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This is a world we don't want to live in but we all live in it. We don't want to live in this world but we do and there's no escaping it. Thats exactly what Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) tries to do. He's not a hero, not by any means. This is an incredibly sick man who somehow manages to kind of maybe do something ""good"". The whole film is just twisted and unsettling. We watch Bickles decent into madness. DeNiro is perfection. He is so good in this movie. Harvey Keitel is brilliant in his smaller role as a pimp. Their scenes together are some of the best in the film. Even when DeNiro is alone his acting is incredible. The camera work is flashy but in a detached and bleak sense. Scorsese gives it his all.

Harvey Keitel, Cybill Shepard and Peter Boyle also give strong performances, but watch out for a young Jodie Foster who plays a 12 year old hooker in the film (If not for De Niro, Foster totally steals the film).

Still important after all these years...,"I've been drawn to revaluate this film recently by four critical opinions other than my own that made me question my initial judgement.The first was hearing a story on tv that I've never come across before: a governing body forced the filmmakers to colorise the blood in the climatic final sequence to a lighter, less graphic colour. This explains why DeNiro's neck spouts orange blood as the effect unfortunately turned out to be irreversible.Secondly I read a magazine review that highlighted DeNiro's performance. Normally negative criticism of such a revered actor is never dared uttered, yet this particular review suggested that there was nothing ""behind the eyes"" and that DeNiro's performance was all surface and definitely no substance.Lastly, I recently lent the tape out to two friends. One returned it to me half-watched, it's mid-70s pacing (none of the much touted scenes of violence taking place before over an hour) boring him. The other friend brought to mind quite a valid point. That we never see exactly what makes the DeNiro character, Travis Bickle, psychopathic. On first viewing I perhaps appreciated the characterisation more as what seemed a slightly disaffected young man gradually became warped by the decadence and hostility of a harsh New York. The genius of the film is that you follow his descent into insanity and see things through his eyes. We hear his thoughts, we get to read his journal, his presence dictates the movie. So much so that we almost support his mission to ""eradicate the scum off the streets"", we almost cheer when he shoots a store raider dead and we agree with his justification for murdering the pimps who harbour a 12-year-old girl into prostitution. Then it hits us. We have followed, willingly, a man into a mass execution and the violence, which we have mentally encouraged, is displayed graphically before us. It causes us to question our own sense of morality and that is why it is such an important film.Except on second viewing it is quite clear that Travis is mentally ill from the outset. The world of New York doesn't consume him, he reflects it. An alienated, socially inadequate man who takes a girl on a date to a pornographic movie. My friend questioned that there was no impetus, no genuine cause of psychosis, but that Bickle is psychotic from day one. Maybe this was a race interpretation. My friend is Asian, and perhaps had been fortunate enough never to encounter the extreme, right-wing WASP mentality that is prevalent in a thankfully small minority. The Travis character is racist, homophobic, misogynist, he rallies against the ""pushers"" and the ""skunk pussies"" that litter the streets. In many ways his views are not those of the mentally disturbed, merely those of  `middle America'.The similarly-themed ""Falling Down"" fails for me, chiefly because of it's self-conscious and incongruous bouts of humour, but also because it has nothing to say. Taxi Driver has plenty to say. Maybe what shocks about the violence (tame by today's standards) is it's moral ambiguity. The ultimate ironic play-out, that a murderer should become a hero, leads us to look again and question ethical behaviour. How different is the self-righteous from the wretched? What distinguishes the viewer from the `scum' of the movie? One of the most subversive pictures ever made, it ultimately carries no distinction between right or wrong and it's lead character is completely unsympathetic, an extremist who attempts murder for no other reason than personal notoriety. These are important issues it raises, and it succeeds as it doesn't spoon-feed its audience, but throws up a myriad of questionable motivations. Just how different is Bickle from the clientele in the back of his cab?Taxi Driver succeeds over populist fare such as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs as, fine films though those may be, it occupies a space of reality that they can't, or don't wish, to encounter. Plus Scorcese gives a better cameo than Tarantino ever did.Without question one of the ten or twenty greatest films ever made. In MY opinion, anyway...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great Film,"It's a great movie. This was my first time watching it and although, I know it's probably unpopular, I do not see this movie as a ""masterpiece."" It is a good character study and you follow the mind of Travis Bickle. I was entertained by this movie and thought the score was absolutely amazing. Robert Deniro also has a great performance as well as a young Jodie Foster. Scorsese does a good job showing what it's really like in New York in the 70s and I did like how he shot that ending shoot out in the brothel. Making it slow motion really made it seem like you were in Travis's head, how Travis doesn't even flinch when he gets shot in the neck. The story wasn't all that complex though, but that's not really a bad thing. I didn't really like the cinematography all that much in certain scenes and yes the story was good but I honestly felt like it could have been done better. Not a masterpiece and definitely not Scorsese's best, but nonetheless it is a really good movie. Although not amazing, but it's really good. I'd watch it again as well, and maybe after seeing it a second time my opinion will change. But as of rn, it's not.

Incredible De Niro Performance and Foreboding Atmosphere,"I've loved listening to Rancid's Travis Bickle for the best part of 15 years, but it took me until now to watch Taxi Driver for the first time.It's certainly one of the most powerful films I've watched and will no doubt stay with me for some time. Being powerful doesn't necessarily equate to being enjoyable to watch though - at least in my experiences. I was never bored watching this, but damn - if I wasn't depressed before this, I certainly am now.Robert De Niro is the obvious standout here. His performance as Travis Bickle was mesmerizing and impossible to look away from. The character transformation throughout the film just added to the tension and impending sense of doom and dread.Think I'll be having that little jazz theme stuck in my head for a long time. I also enjoyed finally seeing the classic ""you lookin' at me?"" scene. Young Jodie Foster was excellent too. It was interesting to see how so many films have borrowed heavily from Taxi Driver since.Do I think it should be talked about among the greatest films of all-time?

Throughout, the film seems dark, but it ends optimistically enough, with a sense of completion. If you're an 80s kid, and haven't seen this yet, make sure you do.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A grimy and shockingly violent movie in the hands of competent filmmaker,"I can see the fingerprints of Martin Scorsese and the reflection of Travis Bickle in films that came after Taxi Driver, but I have to admit that I wasn't wowed by this movie. It was much slower than I expected and the score, while done by Bernard Herrmann, was distracting and felt like it was made for a different film. However, even though this is a grimy and shockingly violent movie, I understand why it made an impression on audiences back then.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Another Pseudointellectual Movie,"This movie joins the likes of Dr. Strangelove, Citizen Kane, and 2001: A Space Odyssey . It's not clever at all and it's about nothing. Some mentally ill taxi driver boogies around at night - That's all. Most of the film is taken up by slow scenes, totally unrealistic dialogue and situations, and a totally unrealistic portrayal of New York, yet Taxi Driver is currently rated 8.4 on IMDb.There are two reasons for this: One is that wannabe gangsters will vote any film like this high, and the other is that people like Roger Ebert are the perfect example of a modern day Emperor's New Clothes. If the plot and script are nonsensical, they'll hail it a masterpiece and tell you that you are just too stupid to see the genius involved (for the record, 2001: A Space Odyssey doesn't have ANY story at all, but is still called ""deep""). Those of us with an ounce of sanity are not happy sitting through a film that's about nothing (with the exception of a few scenes with Jodie Foster, who plays an underage prostitute) and has a pace slower than a tortoise on whiskey.The acting isn't bad, but the talent is wasted on a script as crap as this.I'd only recommend watching this to tick the 'seen it' box.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
10/10,"It's a lovely classical film that can be fully appreciated for its craftsmanship. The director, Martin Scorsese, has maintained a particular style of filmmaking from the olden days to the present. The gangster theme of the movie is very engaging. The story and plot are superb; they include twists that make it interesting and arouse curiosity.The main protagonist of this movie, Travis King, played by actor Robert De Niro, has performed exactly as a character should in the role of a taxi driver. De Niro portrays Travis as a typical taxi driver. Then, he desires to make a change in his life, transitioning from the mundane taxi driver life to the life of a gangster. Travis progresses step by step, practicing with guns, knowing well the dangers associated with being a gangster. When he fails to make the change, a drastic turn occurs when he has the chance to save a teenage girl from a prostitution. This plot twist allows the audience to witness Travis's transformation.The cinematography in this film is aesthetically pleasing and attractive. Set in New York City, the film beautifully captures the essence of city life in every outdoor shot.""One of the most striking elements of the film's cinematography is its use of lighting. Scorsese and Chapman employ chiaroscuro lighting techniques to create a sense of mood and atmosphere, casting deep shadows and stark highlights that reflect the psychological turmoil of the protagonist, Travis Bickle. Whether it's the neon-lit streets of Times Square or the dimly-lit interiors of seedy nightclubs, the interplay of light and shadow heightens the tension and suspense of the narrative.Moreover, the cinematography of the movie ""Taxi Driver"" effectively conveys the isolation and alienation experienced by Travis Bickle. Through carefully framed shots and long takes, the audience is placed in the passenger seat of Travis's taxi, witnessing the city's diverse inhabitants from a voyeuristic perspective. The use of handheld camera techniques further enhances the sense of immediacy and intimacy, allowing viewers to experience the urban landscape through Travis's eyes.This movie ""Taxi Driver"" is a character study of Travis Bickle(Robert De Nairo), a Vietnam War veteran turned taxi driver who becomes increasingly disillusioned with the decadence and moral decay of 1970s New York City. Schrader's screenplay skillfully navigates Travis's descent into madness, capturing his existential angst and alienation through introspective voiceovers and sparse dialogue. The script is unflinching in its portrayal of Travis's inner turmoil, offering a compelling exploration of loneliness, isolation, and the desperate search for meaning in a world devoid of humanity.Scorsese's direction shows Schrader's screenplay to new levels, imbuing the film with an atmosphere of palpable tension and unease. From the film's haunting opening sequence to its climactic and explosive part, Scorsese demonstrates a keen eye for detail and a mastery of visual storytelling. The directorial choices, such as the use of slow-motion, dynamic camera movements, and striking compositions, effectively convey Travis's unraveling mental state while immersing viewers in the seedy underbelly of New York City.This movie ""Taxi Driver"" is celebrated for its innovative storytelling, complex characters, and its exploration of different themes such as loneliness, alienation, and urban decay. This movie has had a significant impact on popular culture and has influenced large number filmmakers and artists over the years. Its enduring relevance and continued critical acclaim firmly establish it as a standout example of classical cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
City of Night,"One of the most lauded and influential films in cinema history, ""Taxi Driver"" is one of the highlights of the gritty realism that characterized American film during its peak in the 1970s. A near flawless panoramic view of one man's world and state of mind. Travis Bickle is an ex-marine who drives a cab in New York City. Soaking in the streets of the big city the sights and sounds of the great metropolis with its attendant hub of activity: noise, dirt, rude and bizarre individuals, violence, crime, he's equally dismayed and repulsed at the world around him. Disappointed in his personal life the harsh existence slowly gnaws in him as the ugliness of society gets into his head culminating in a series of events that lead to an end that's equal comedy, pathos and liberation. Robert De Niro perfectly embodies the lead character with his unhinged, wasted, weary, awkward, autistic-behaving simpleton personality who gradually takes the viewer into his steady descent into madness. The Big Apple is the perfect background to the dark and grimy flick mirroring its own decay and collapse at the time. Justly regarded as one of the most distinguished and important films ever made this is a prime example of art doing justice to life and one work of art that only gets better with time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You Talkin' to Me?,"After dinner today, I felt like watching a movie set in NYC, so I chose ""Taxi Driver"" by Robert De Niro. This movie was made before I was born. Robert De Niro was young and like a different person. He had a unique presence.In the 70's, there was a retro atmosphere, such as calling landlines and buying vinyl at record stores. Young people in their teens and twenties today will be unfamiliar with those old things.Perhaps, in the future, Uber will become a major transportation, and the profession of a taxi driver like him may disappear. NYC in the 70's hasn't changed much from now, but I thought it was cleaner now with less trash on the roadside.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
God's lonely man,"Since its release in 1976, Taxi Driver has started to become somewhat misrepresented over the years. Being considered an indisputable classic, Taxi Driver has spawned considerable talk and speculation among audiences, mainly in regards to its violence, fabricating the film a reputation similar to that of an intense action thriller. But any viewer who sees Taxi Driver and dismisses it as a thriller has completely missed the point of the film. Taxi Driver is by no means an action movie fraught with gratuitous violence, nor is the violence the centerpoint of the story. It is the study of a very lonely man, isolated in a world of filth and corruption, and his struggle to overcome it.It's very difficult to capture the appeal of Taxi Driver in mere words, as the film transcends them. The script, masterful as it is, is used incredibly sparingly, as director Martin Scorsese chooses instead to paint his masterpiece more in pictures than in words. As it is, the film produces an utterly unique atmosphere, so thick and powerful it seems to soak into the skin, drawing the viewer in, and holding them, intoxicated, from the film's iconic opening shot of a taxi driving through a cloud of steam to the film's craftily ambivalent ending (is Travis merely hallucinating, or is the film making a point about unlikely heroism?) to the end of the beautifully shot closing credits. As such, there have been complaints that the film is slow moving and dull for the most part - again, such comments merely bring to light that the viewer has missed the point. This is not a film about non-stop, heart pounding action. It is an atmosphere piece and a character study, using the careful, steady pacing to slowly draw the viewer further and further into Travis Bickle's world of loneliness and contempt, the monotony of his life developing a steadily sinister edge. Again, words fail to fully describe the sheer force and slow hitting impact the film generates, short of telling the reader to see it for themselves, to experience Scorsese's harsh but calm, unflinching view of city life in all of its grimy decadence.Scorsese's simply masterful camera work is what really sells the effect, and Taxi Driver is arguably one of the finest shot films in cinema history. The camera seems to drink in the heart and jet black soul of New York city, from Travis' moody late night processions of the city, eerily beautiful in their quiet despair to the slow, famished sweep as he views his gun for the first time, perfectly backed by Bernard Hermann's exquisite minimalist score. It also goes without saying that screenwriter Paul Schrader's script is one of the most bleakly powerful pieces of writing ever transferred to celluloid, almost seeming to speak more in its silence than in it's brief but poignant bits of dialogue. From start to finish, the film is deliberately paced in a truly stunning fashion, allowing the mass of emotions to slowly wash over the viewer - it is rare to see a film so subtle yet painstakingly crafted.It goes without saying that as breathtaking and essential the film's atmosphere is, it would be nothing without the iconic performance of Robert De Niro sinking it home. If De Niro was to be singled out for a single role in a career filled from top to bottom with flooringly powerful work, his sensitive yet brooding Travis Bickle would without a doubt always come out on top. Once again, De Niro seems to have more of an impact with what isn't said than with his straightforward and bleak nighttime voiceovers and journal entries; while his speeches about cleaning up the scum of the city put the viewer's hair on end, it's his eyes that really sell the role, displaying a haunting inner passion despite the blank apathy of his exterior; the most memorable shot in the film is Bickle, having just completely his cleansing bloodbath at the film's finale, raising a single blood- dripping finger to his mohawked head, and miming shooting himself - the sheer power of this brief moment is beyond description.De Niro's stunning performance is backed up by several brief but incredibly memorable characters portrayed by the supporting cast, including Cybil Shepherd as Betsy, a seeming shining beacon of hope in Travis' dark and despairing world, Harvey Keitel's entertaining yet gut-churningly devious pimp, Jodie Foster giving an astonishingly capable and powerful performance as the child prostitute Travis strives to rescue, Albert Brooks in a subtly comic role as Shepherd's co-worker, and Peter Boyle as a down to earth, savvy fellow taxi driver of Travis. Director Scorsese also has a cameo as a homicidal passenger in Bickle's cab, proving to be one of the more memorable parts of the film, Scorsese's charismatic brief performance driving home a message of violence in the common man in a rather poignant and disturbing fashion.Taxi Driver is one of the few films which defies comparison - exquisitely crafted by the genius of Martin Scorsese, it is a superbly moody atmospheric reflection on the mindset of one man, tortured by the crime and corruption around him. What makes the film perhaps the most interesting however, is however much Bickle may be billed as a violent psychopath, it's doubtful that a single viewer failed to identify with his views and personality at least once throughout the film. Travis' incredibly perceptive and sensitive persona seems to speak volumes on the inherent loneliness in us all, and the desperate, violent need to be accepted in a society thriving on distance, corruption and alienation. Do not be fooled into thinking the film is simply the tale of a psychopath, fraught with gratuitous violence - Taxi Driver is far too soulful and intelligent for such a predicament, and as such is worth seeing by any and every audience willing to stomach a harshly retentive tale of despair and redemption.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

HUH?,"A film like 'Taxi Driver' makes me wonder whether, perhaps, it's just my fault, not being able to appreciate ""great"" cinema. 'Taxi Driver' is, unarguably, one of the most highly regarded works ever committed to celluloid, and many claim that the chance to essay the character of Travis Bickle, the tormented protagonist of the tale, is every actor's 'wet dream'.Travis Bickle, unquestionably, is unforgettably portrayed by a De Niro at the very top of his form. Every move is measured, nuanced, and honed to perfection. As a performance, it is a tour de force. No questions about that.But what about the film itself? I read both the reviews, of this film, by the highly regarded and universally respected Roger Ebert, who, clearly, is overawed by it, as he is by Scorcese himself. Myself, I came out of the experience with a ""Was THAT it?"" feeling. Internet reviews of the film had raised my expectations so high that, at the end of it all, I felt as if someone had hit me with a wet sock.Ebert, in one of his reviews, meditates considerably on the ending of the film, which, he wonders, might be a dream, and partook more of the character of ""music"" than of ""drama"". To me, it seemed nothing of the kind. To me, the film appeared to be a straightforward story of a vigilante, who - to avoid straying into spoiler territory - achieves something honourable, and is lauded for it. I found nothing dreamlike about it, and, with all due respect, felt that the film ended on a note which was disappointingly flat.I do not intend to expound on the story of the film, which is straightforward, and would be well known to net surfers, having been discussed ad nauseam an interminable number of times. The Wikipedia introduction to the plot of the film, though, I felt was misleading. It claims the film to be the story of Bickle's
""descent into insanity"". To me, it seems nothing of the kind. Bickle appears just as sane, at the close of the story, as he was at its start.Apart from De Niro's performance, which invited the four stars I have, somewhat hesitatingly, awarded this film, I found nothing really to right home about. Sure, Jodie Foster, at twelve and a half, is cute as a button, but she really has nothing much to do. And I also feel that the wonderful Harvey Keitel, who stays on screen for exactly two scenes, is sadly wasted.All in all, a disappointment.Or is it, perhaps, that I just do not appreciate great cinema? Maybe. Who knows?",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Wonderfull movie,"Though not particularly uplifting, the film is captivating and remarkable, well-deserving of its renown.

The film progresses because of this plunge into a very contemporary kind of craziness, yet the narrative is excellent because of how captivating the details are. Travis possesses a recognizable enough quality that it's quite easy to accept the rest of his insanity.

Unique.,"I have seen few films with such diverse reviews as Scorsese's `Taxi Driver'. Roger Ebert has sighted it as one of his `Great Movies', yet Leonard Maltin gave it only two stars. There is a definite schism between the two critics, but I am personally also dubious in commenting on `Taxi Driver'.The film is a complex portrait of a man's descent into violence. Travis, played by Robert De Niro, is continually exposed to the horrors of the city as a New York City cab driver. Already seriously disturbed by the war, Travis is the product of several experiences that seriously impair his view of reality. He becomes hopelessly infatuated with an angelic woman he finds in this panorama of horrors, only to be denied by her because he takes her to a dirty movie. He watches such films all the time, but because his perceptions are so skewed, he doesn't understand what is wrong with them. Later he gives a ride to an erratic man who is determined to kill his cheating wife. The man proudly tells Travis that he is going to blow his wife to pieces with a .45 Magnum. Later, when encouraged to buy a gun for protection, Travis requests a .45 Magnum, and buys every gun available to him. He becomes a soldier, ready to face the evil of New York. He works-out diligently, devises methods to draw his guns, and all the time growing farther away from reality. Armed to the teeth, he comes to the aid of a child prostitute. In the end, he lashes out at his demons with violent results.I have heard rumors that the films premise is based on the film/novel `The Searchers'. Both films center on disturbed veterans that want to save a woman that really doesn't want to be saved. He is simply trying to save the girl from what he hates above all else.`Taxi Driver' doesn't have a distinct plot, it's simply a character sketch of a disturbed individual; an exceptional sketch. I personally don't see a point to the film, but there's a subtle one and somehow it gets across to viewer.`Taxi Driver' strikes me a potential disaster. The film is perplexing at times with a difficult protagonist. The script is heavy-handed and too complex to be correctly interpreted. Here's the good news: the film doesn't attempt to explain confusing points, the film just moves forward. De Niro is a godsend to the film, his exceptional acting makes his character understandable but still appropriately detached from the viewer. Martin Scorsese is exacting in his direction with the additions of excellent camera work and film editing.The violence of the film is superfluous but compelling if the viewer can take it. `Taxi Driver' is not for everyone, but is worth a viewing. 8/10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""Are you talking to me!""","(1976) Taxi Driver
PSYCHOLOGICAL DRAMA""Are you talking to me?"" Are the very first words I heard incited while flipping through the channels on my television. That scene alone motivated me to check out the whole film. By the time I did see the whole film I ended up watching this film multiple times. The appealing of this film is more of a character study, that after coming back from the war, Travis Bickle created another war in his own mind about NYC- the ugliest conditions he had ever witnessed on the streets of NYC which created paranoid thoughts about who and what was responsible for this kind of environment where law abiding people has to put up with like the drug addicts, the pimps, prostitutes, murderers etc... Bickle (Robert De Niro) at first, attempted to take this kind of frustration on one of the runners of the consulate, and then after failing that, almost to the very end of the film took his anger on the very people that condone these criminal acts he has always despising witnessed while driving a cab, since he wasn't able to do anything with the gov't that was supposed to protect and properly governed it's citizens. There's so much to say about this film, that to characterize the overall film would create a lot of discussion (like a five page essay) and perhaps a certain amount of controversy, because how many Travis Bickles are there in the world and should be treated. Also included are themes of vigilantism, laws and the system, gun running, identity, chaos, customs of society and especially government. It may have also have contributed a real life incident involving the attempt and failed assassination of the late Ronald Reagan in March 30, 1981, by John Hinckley JR to whom clearly admitted that ""Taxi Driver"" was his all time favorite film and had also watched it multple times. This radical also wrote to Jodie Foster multiple times(wikipedia) ""Taxi Driver"" also garnered Jodie Foster's first Oscar win as ""Best Supporting Actress"" and was also Bernard Hermann's final music score film. This is also one of the most important films of any generation since it does have a lot to say about the times in which we live. (Do NOT watch this film if you're as demented as the militia that were captured the other day or if you are a young radical, it's basically anybody who feel the need to incite any violence to solve peoples problems) Masterpiece 10/10.

Scorsese's break out film is a classic!,"Taxi Driver is Scorsese's breakout film. It is dark, visceral and haunting. Only his fourth film, this classic bears all the marks of a seasoned auteur. Intricately crafted shots, perfect timing, and on top of that, De Niro gives one of his most disturbing performances. Together they paint a portrait of a man slipping into insanity and his personal self-destructive fantasy. That said, I don't believe this film is as insightful as everyone says it is. I've seen in three times now and I can't understand it's 'purpose.' What is the point of this? Is Travis a representation of the angst filled youth (of the 70's era) -- wanting to change the world, but misguided in how they try? Is this a portrait of how isolation destroys a man? Is this a tragedy? But these ideas aren't overtly clear. Especially by the happy ending (how he is somehow turned into a hero). Only after watching documentaries with interviews with the creators did I understand their intentions with certain scenes. But like most creators, the writer/director here were so close to their art that they thought what they were doing was self-evident (when sometimes it wasn't.) The character Travis himself is not sympathetic, while even anti-heroes have some part of them that you can connect with, some part that makes you want to root for them. Maybe that's why it works. Taxi Driver is an unfiltered look at New York in the 70's. Most of the film captures this in such detail and finesse, it couldn't have been staged better (which many of the background shots weren't). And Travis is a dark portrait of a reject on the edge, pushed over by the madness of the city/society/humanity(whatever you want to call it), and this story has proved itself to be reality again and again since. This is a mark of accurate art. Maybe that is what Taxi Driver is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The entire first part of the film for instance with Cybill Shepherd serves no purpose in the storyline but is rather a fully interchangeable/disposable introduction to the film and means to merely convey the notion Deniro's character longs for emotional connection and companionship, but they could've replaced that entire part with a number of other ones in a way that wouldn't shake up the story at all.There's no explanation or significant reason for the turn of events and the change in texture and atmosphere of the film as Deniro's character becomes exceedingly more extreme: just as everything in this darn thing, conclusions are jumped to and never given a prior development. Things just happen, because the movie-makers (writer and director) were disturbingly inept at their jobs of creating coherent structure and developing a plot and its various ideas.Some scenes are just purely random (why the attempted assassination of Palantine ?), added to the just as unnecessary violence and this here is only a 'personal nightmare' for the viewer, not Deniro's character and what not.Philosophically bleak, not dark or haunting just bleak, as in stupid and morally violent, and pernicious.

Taxi Driver – Martin Scorsese (1976) (Darrell Ron Tuffs @ aworldoffilm.com,"I will be honest, It took me a very long time to see Taxi Driver. It is not that the film was unavailable to me or that I was unaware of it. The problem was that I was very settled with the sorts of movies I enjoyed, I thought I only enjoyed old Hollywood classics or human dramas, anything with a slight mention of violence or action would turn me off. So for a very long time I put off seeing Taxi Driver – this was the biggest misjudgement I have made in all my life when it comes to films. When I finally did see Taxi Driver it changed my opinion of cinema and left me feeling very silly for thinking that I could pre-guess what I liked before I had seen it. I had sat down thinking I would get nothing out of the film, however after it had ended I was blown away. Taxi Driver is a highly regarded film but I knew in that moment that this film will never be regarded highly enough.The films main character Travis Bickle (Robert De Nero) is a truly fascinating human. On one hand it is feasible to see him as a possible saint, someone who wants the world to be a better place, someone who wishes to fight and strike out against evil. On the other hand one could see him as the most messed up of all humans. To me, neither is true. He is in fact in the same mindset as all other humans in the film, but is way past the psychological stage which lets them deal with the faults of humanity in humane ways. In a way, Travis is just an extreme version of all of us. He has more anger to want to clean the streets of evil. However, there is a good and evil way to go about this, but in the end Travis chooses the latter. This sees him kill several evil people in the name of something good – but what's to say that in doing this Travis has not become an evil force himself?Taxi Driver is a brilliant visual treat as many of Scorsese's other films are. Its imagery ranks beside the most iconic in the history of cinema. The films editing leaves you on your toes at every scene, not for one moment is there even a hint that pace will slow or that the style will steer off course. Yes, the film is very violent at times, while this is horrific, it does evoke a very strange reaction in me. Questioning whether this violence is necessary to beat evil, or if by becoming violent one only adds to evil in the world. This is such a hard moral question but is one that Taxi Driver presents very well.One of my favourite things about Taxi Driver is its main theme by Bernard Herrmann. This was Herrmann's last big score before his death in 1975. The music works extremely well with Scorsese's gloomy imagery of night time New York and submerses the audience very deep into the mind-set of Travis Bickle, which at times is a very scary place to be.Taxi Driver is an in-depth character study of good and evil, how they work with and without each other and how they can both lead to disastrous consequences.

A stunning masterpiece by Martin Scorsese,"Martin Scorsese has made a name for himself in Hollywood, and with his directorial efforts in the classic films like 'Raging Bull', 'Goodfellas', and 'Casino', it's not hard to see why. Scorsese is a man with a God-given talent in directing and writing, especially those pitted in the crime genre. This bleak crime-drama starring his most collaborator Robert De Niro is the film that really put in Scorses in the cinematic spotlight during the early years of his career. De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a mentally disturbed Vietnam War veteran living in the crowded streets of New York City. In the efforts to deal with his insomnia, Bickle takes a full-time job as a cab driver. Along the way, he meets a political campaign worker Betsy (played by Cybill Shepard) who he develops a relationship with. On the night of a botched date, their relationship fails to work out. Even worse, Bickle grows increasingly disillusioned by the crime and corruption in society, and he learns of a 12-year old girl named Iris (played by Jodie Foster) being a sex slave of a local pot-smoking low-life named Sport (played by Harvey Keital), Bickle decides he must take matters into his own hands and make a stop to his madness.Martin Scorsese puts directorial compelling efforts in the film, as does Robert De Niro as the main character who immediately grabs your attention when he is first introduced. The film takes viewers on a journey through the mind of a mentally disturbed war veteran has taken serious offense to the cruelty and corruption going on in our society, and the story progresses through how it affects him as a person to where he transforms from an average New York City guy to a anger-fueled gun-wielding vigilante who does not take crap from anyone. This leads into some dark and shocking scenes that always keep the film the moving, particularly during its aggressive climax. Robert De Niro serves as the pinnacle of this film with his arresting performance, and the intense conviction he brings his character is more than enough to make his character believable and someone you do not want to be on the bad side of. By today, this is easily stands as one of his landmark roles of his career. Jodie Foster who was only 13 at the time is quite good what was her debut role in her career. Then Harvey Keital who plays Sport, the low-life pimp who forces Jodie Foster's character into prostitution is very strong with his performance, putting well effort into such a creepy and utterly deranged character who will have viewers rooting for justice brought upon his madness. The characters are incredibly well written and developed with pride. Another interesting gem comes from the cinematography. The imagery of nighttime New York City soaking with neon lights is outstanding and beautiful to look at, especially for a 70s picture.Taxi Driver is a profound masterpiece by Martin Scorsese, and one of the most cinematic achievements to this day. Robert De Niro is thoroughly irresistible in his role, and shows why he is the brilliant actor many know and love today. Martin Scorsese may have some new films in store in the future, none of them will ever measure up to this. Scorsese is a filmmaker who many can find deeply admirable and his works show a powerful demonstration.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Are You Talkin' to Me?!,"The movie is cool, at least as I recall. DeNiro is perfect in his role as a man who is fed up with the evil society and turns against everyone - he portrays the role of a sociopath perfectly.The story is interesting, brilliantly filmed and told. After all, the director is none other than Martin Scorsese :)Not my type of story though and maybe that's why I've downgraded a bit, but then again if I watch it now as an older I might change my mind.Overall I enjoyed it and I think every person who likes 70's cinema should watch this Scorsese classic. Quite a few new films are trying to imitate DeNiro's character.Final score: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"As dark and depressing as Se7en,  But also as brilliant.","Travis (De Niro) is always something of a question mark from when we first meet him. He's never predictable in motivation, conversation or deliberation. An intriguing and brilliant character, who'll make you feel like you have the wood to be lit but he'd rather sit there and watch you shiver.Ironically though this character makes you feel this way through his stony silences - often filled with a narration of thoughts; he detests the filth and scum and deterioration of the city he serves faithfully. An almost pre-Rorschach figure in the smoky mist, or the modern 'goodie' who fights fire with fire in a city full of conflicting flames.Despite meeting Travis in this uncharismatic surrounding it's characters such as Cybill (Foster) who he meets while gazing in his flamboyantly obvious vehicle, that indicate the real people who need saving, not just the city itself. Controversial though her character (or more precisely her age) may be for such an unheard of role (again for the age) it doesn't take a historian to realise with bad times, comes bad professions and the wrong types of people in those professions.The blunt but accurate deterioration of a society, so lost in its bad reputation doesn't make this Scorsese's best. Sadly. Goodfellas proved much more, with much more style that wasn't all thanks to the direction and the lead actor. Second best? Absolutely.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Madness,"Robert De Niro delivers his iconic mirror, ""you talkin' to me"" scene in this classic psychological masterpiece. The scene which has become a timeless piece of film in Hollywood lore is perhaps an embodiment of De Niro and the film's brilliance as it depict the madness that has consumed the protagonist. This descent into madness does not happen dramatically but was compounded by everyday madness of a busy and violent cityscape. In fact, it is the familiar chaos of a city like New York that allows viewers to relate to the film amd its characters. Much like ""Falling Down"" that came later, the film is a classic because De Niro plays an individual driven to lunacy not far from how an average persons may be driven to extreme temperaments in an average day in an urban jungle of cold steel and colder bodies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Scorsese's dark-lit, trancelike aesthetic accentuates every form of decay and decadence","Martin Scorsese's universally hailed combined mood piece and character study from the night streets of New York City has remained compelling for half a century. We follow young cabbie Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) around on duty, where he falls into a downward spiral of mistrust, disgust, and ultimately complete isolation and alienation leading to extremist thoughts. The picture doesn't look timeless - it has an aesthetic and an artlessness which affirms Scorsese's low budget and relative inexperience at the time - but there is an undeniable thematic timelessness in the portrait of Bickle and his challenges, both the perceived and the factual ones. And Scorsese helps him along by creating a dark-lit, trancelike aesthetic which accentuates every form of decay and decadence he can point out. Through Travis Bickle, human goodness is put to the test. He is a man caught in a perpetual search for just a fragment of meaning in a life he has already given up. And De Niro's lead performance is consummate. He delves into Travis Bickle with heart and soul, and at no point can you separate the actor from the character. Only a young Marlon Brando could have done this better. Add to that the perfectly cast 12-year-old Jodie Foster as the child prostitute. There arguably was no other actress her age who could convey the same rare combination of risqué worldliness and childish disregard. Taxi Driver is almost devoid of optimism, which of course is why you cling onto the small rays of light it offers - lurking underneath, sometimes seeping to the surface, a vague hope for something better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
lets go back  to films that said something - like Taxi Driver.,"Offers simplicity and style of filmaking that I wish some directors would go back to today - even Scorsese. Reminds me of the films we made as students at USC, UCLA and Art Center in the 70's. Whatever happened to American auteur films anyway. Like everything else, big money and big corporations rule all I guess.

Mean Lean Scorsese,"Hot summer nights in New York City,rain soaked black patent leather streets shine and glisten as a lone, looney & lonely taxi cab driver stalks the streets in his bright yellow cab. This is Martin Scorsese's taxi driver played by Robert DeNiro, at the height of his powers as an actor. He's so young, taunt & handsome & totally out of it, in a totally out of it city. DeNiro plays Travis Bickle (great name) who we see in a series of memorable scenes is a time bomb ticking away, ready to blow up in society's face. And even though we know the big bang is coming, we are still shocked, surprised & disturbed by the bloody ending. This was Scorsese's second big time Hollywood feature, done after his light but very likeable ""woman's picture"" ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" which won Ellen Burstyn an Oscar. This is a young director's movie, exciting,dangerous & full of great images & scenes, that exhibit a willingness to take chances which mostly pay off big time. It's also a scary movie, an urban horror show for real. The city of night in this movie is both beautiful with neon colors reflecting on wet streets, and ugly in its deprevation and decay. The film is ""religious"" & spiritual taking us along for the anti-hero's long dark journey through hell, both internal & external and his violent and bloody redemption. This Scorsese landscape is littered with human garbage: child whores & pimps, criminals & politicians, crazies who want to do terrible things, politicians who want to get elected. This is a beautifully made and crafted film, full of memorable lines & images. Gliding taxis with steam rising from the streets, Bernard Herrmann's last great score, jazzy and mournful rides along for the trip. Notable performances by little miss Foster, before she became the Oscar winning movie star, rigid & uptight. She's so good eating her toast & jam, trying to sex up Deniro, slow dancing with Harvey the greasy pimp, that we almost think she's the real McCoy, a miniature Mary waiting to be saved. Also good are the already mentioned Harvey Keitel, Albert Brooks as the campaign worker luckless in love with blonde venus Cybill Shepherd (also never better) & the director himself as the taxi passenger from hell,who wants to do terrible things to his cheating wife's private parts. This guy is so bad & creepy that even Travis is frighten. Also of note is Michael Chapman's candy colored cinematography & the gorgous Diahnne Abbott (married at the time to DeNiro)in a bit part as the porn theatre cashier. Although I'm not crazy about the epilogue ending,(was this used to make us feel better?) this is still one of the great films, if not the greatest film of the 70's, and one of Scorsese's masterpieces. Hard to believe that he did not receive a best director Oscar nomination, and that the film itself lost out for best picture to the simple and sentimental Rocky. Well actually maybe I shouldn't be surprised.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
