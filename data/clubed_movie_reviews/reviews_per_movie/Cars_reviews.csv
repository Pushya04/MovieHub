"""It's kind of nice to slow down every once in a while.""","""Cars didn't ride on it to make great time; they rode on it to have a great time.""It's not hard to make a successful movie. It's simple, really. Exceed my expectations. Make me feel. Force me to care. Deliver a somewhat clichéd message, but deliver it in such a way that the meaning resounds. Teach me the same lessons that your characters learn. And above all, entertain.Pretty easy, right? Well, at least Pixar makes it look that way because with Cars they have once again succeeded.I'll be honest; I had my doubts about the movie. How would they be able to take a story featuring nothing but vehicles, with nary a human in sight, and keep my interest for a full two hours? Animals are one thing, but could Pixar successfully master the personification of modes of transportation?Yes, they could, and they did.Thanks to Director Lasseter's strong attention to detail, going so far as to insist that the vehicles bend and gesture in ways that were true to their construction, every car and truck truly becomes a unique character and personality. And along with those characters and personalities comes a story which yes, contains a well-traveled theme, but it comes with so much charm that even Grouchy McKilljoy's hard little heart can't help but be warmed.Don't worry if you're not a racing fan; I assure you it's not a requirement to enjoy the movie. I love watching muscle cars race the quarter mile (ask me about my '69 Camaro), but NASCAR doesn't do it for me. That's another aspect about the film that gave me pause. I once fell asleep at a NASCAR qualifying race, despite the 90-degree heat and ear-splitting decibel levels, so would Cars keep me awake and interested? Within five minutes my worries began to slowly subside as I happily settled in for the ride.Animation should be about bringing imagination to life. Give us something that can't be done in live action. Cars does this so effectively that it almost seems a redundancy to comment on how Pixar continues to raise the CGI bar. The scenery on screen is awe-inducing to the point that it's getting harder to distinguish the real from the created. The filmmakers have gone so far as to perfect reflections in the cars and to pay careful attention to weeds growing out of cracks in the sidewalk. I don't see any way you could not be visually stunned.But impressive visuals are little comfort if I'm not presented with a story that I care to follow. No problems there. If you're the kind of person who loves to go ""awwwww"" at movies then prepare to be satisfied. What I appreciate the most is that, at the risk of causing some youngsters to become restless, time and attention has been given to character and story development. Lasseter and his team stood their ground and resisted any pressure to trim this to a runtime more suitable to those with limited attention spans, and I thank them for it.As I said earlier, Cars hit the starting line with a disadvantage. I didn't greet it with a warm smile. I crossed my arms, furrowed my brow, and dared it to prove my preconceived notions wrong.It proceeded to exceed my expectations. It made me feel for its characters and forced me to care about McQueen's journey, both to California and to a different viewpoint on life. Sure, the ""slow down and enjoy the scenery"" message may seem a little routine, but it's a message I took to heart.Immediately following the movie I was on the Internet looking up information regarding Route 66. I'm now ready for a road trip void of interstates and efforts to beat my best time. I feel like slowing down a bit and exploring the unknown. Give me the scenic route, and give me more finely-tuned, detailed movies like Cars. That's all I ask. Two hours of entertainment that make me care, even if briefly, about something other than myself and what goal has to be accomplished next.See? It was simple, really. At least Pixar made it look that way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar does it again,"Pixar just keeps hitting them out of the park. Larry the cable guy was a great cast as Mater. Owen Wilson as Lightining was another great decision for the makers of Cars. There is never a dull moment while watching this film. I guess that is obvious by the overwhelming success at the box office. Working at a movie theater I get to see the reactions of our patrons after seeing each film we show; Cars is a must see this summer. There are very few genuine family movies released now a days, this is a clean movie that families can come together and enjoy without worrying about having to screen the film before bringing the kids. I recommend everyone go see this film and then go see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Exquisite and fun. Visuals steal the show.,"Pixar again shows us their superior skills in 3D animation and to a lesser extent this time, the storytelling. There is so much attention to detail, that you are left gazing at the screen in awe. The 2 hours races by, and afterwards you are left with the satisfaction of having just seen something quite unique and surreal.It's a kids film of course, so there is little need to point out the predictable story elements - which exist in Cars more so than previous Pixar films such as The Incredibles. Cars is less daring, is safer in its approach. There are no surprising or wild deviations on the fairly straight road the story follows. But nevertheless, it's all very cool stuff, and the story is entertaining enough. Cars is a must see Pixar film - even if the visuals steal the show.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Cars is great!,"I'm a man (71). I took my son (40) and my granddaughter (10) to see ""Cars"". It was wonderful exciting entertainment for all our ages. I grew up with the old cars and have traveled Route 66 a few times so I was able to relate to the story and talk about the old times after the movie with the younger kids. My son and his daughter love NASCAR so they got a lot from the movie. The scenery though computer modified and generated was beautiful and true to the area portrayed. There is so much going on that this is one movie I want to see again. I have more grandkids, I think I'll have a valid excuse to go once more. Please!, if you see this movie remain seated until the very end of the credits, you are in for a treat.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar keep the good line,"I found this movie to be enjoyable enough: Even when it is true that it wasn't at the same level than some of previous Pixar films (Such as ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredibles"") it was a good film anyway, with an entertaining story and likable characters.Despite the strangeness of the premise of a world inhabited by living cars, the execution is fairly convincing, with a neat character development and many funny and heartwarming moments.Without being perfect, it managed to be something totally worth-watching from beginning to end, and in many ways this could be easily considered one of the best animated films from the year 2006 (Which was a terrible year, in my opinion)7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
This movie is great,"But WHY is it great?1. Visually. From the very first moments of the film, my mouth was hanging open. I mean, what the hell? Nothing looks this good. I have no idea how they made the cars look so much like real cars, and STILL make them look so much like characters. And the settings? Having grown up and traveled all over the South West United States (including more than one pilgrimage down Route 66) They captured, not only the visuals, but the atmosphere and character America's Main Street Perfectly. Frankly, if you put real actors in many of the scenes, you wouldn't realize it was computer generated you know, if the landscape wasn't made up of old car parts.2. Creativity. Talking animals. Every cartoon HAS to have talking animals. Only so many cartoons can be about talking animals trying to bamboozle around with humans. Thank goodness for Cars. They create an entirely believable world populated by machines, with tractor cows, and somehow they still have George Jones and Hendrix. The story IS quite predictable, but it's still quite creative. With this level of creative juice flowing in one of John's babies, I can't wait to see what he has in store for further feature animation and theme parks.3. Characters. I have a beef with Hollywood. They have no idea what life in a small town is like. They either try and stuff their ideals and attitude into a western shirt, or else fill America's heartland with dolts, ""we don't like outsiders"" sheriffs, or crazed murderers. Thankfully, Pixar did their homework and featured small town folk as they really are: eclectic, eccentric, loyal, creative with their fun, friendly with visitors, and really worth while. The subtle touches, such as the lovable rivalry between the Hippie van and the Army truck, or the crazy old Model T talking to the memorial of her dead husband (very touching), gives a complex and wonderfully, realistically diverse view off small town life. The same is true with the racing world. Wilson and Newman are, of course, fantastic. It's funny how the gravel in Newman's voice fits perfectly with the rumble of his engine, likewise Wilson's distinct voice sounds just like the high-tuned growl of a race car. Every voice is so paired. Bottom line, you leave loving virtually every character in the movie.4. Story. A little bit A Christmas Carol, a little bit The Sting. The story starts out fast and exciting, like the race it portrayed. The big second act meanders lazily from one fantastic story point to the next, just like Route 66 drives from one landmark to another. I can see why some may say it can get slow, but, as is one of the points of the story, the joy is in the ride. And again, the third act flows quickly and furiously like, well, another race.I give it a score of 10 out of 10. I can't wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Vroom Vroom for Pixar's blend of excitement, nostalgia and friendship.","As pretty much noted by everyone who has seen it, Cars is visually stunning but unable to live up to the narrative standards set by previous Pixar big hitters. But mid tier Pixar is still better than most other animation offerings from other stables. Plot simply finds arrogant race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) about to hit super star status, only to suffer a highway crash that leaves him stranded in a ghost town called Radiator Springs. A once thriving town, Radiator Springs is now only home to the loyal locals and very much a product of an era long since gone. Forced to stay due to community service, Lightning is desperate to leave the place he calls ""Hillbilly Hell"", but as he comes to know the people of the town he comes to find a new perspective on things.Cars is made up of three segments, the beginning where we are introduced to Lightning and the other cars involved in the race circuit, the action rip-roaring and setting up the film nicely. The middle section in Radiator Springs where it becomes a coming of age-life lesson-friendships formed-piece. And the final section as we get back out on the track for more wonderful racing and the character development reaches the winning line. It's the middle (bulky) section that many have problems with, and not just the children anxiously awaiting more athletic car shenanigans, the adults too have found this something of a chore to get thru. I liked it, felt it was a nice move from Pixar to get ""Shawshank"" like with the characters, a nostalgia nod to yesteryear and we get to spend time in the company of Doc Hudson, voiced poignantly by legend Paul Newman.How you find that middle section may determine how much you enjoy Cars, but rest assured that even if you find it too talky, too slow, what bookends it is pretty darn great anyway. And of course the visual treats available on every inch of the screen make it a winner as well. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
All time classic of Gen Z childhood. Amazing.,"This is EASILY the movie I've watched most in my life. Back when I was young, I would have this on repeat. My parents said I used to HAVE to watch this movie every day for a certain period of time or I would get mad. Well, until now, I hadn't seen it in like 6 years until now. It was just as I remember, and extremely nostalgic. I can't be bothered to wonder why this movie gets the hate that it does. In fact, it's one of the best Pixar films. Idk if the nostalgia is blinding me, but for me this was (so far) one of the better Pixar films. A great character arc for Lightning McQueen, an amazing redemption for Radiator Springs, just a magical movie. I will forever hold this movie close to me and never let go. Imo, this is one of THE movies.Fun fact: I own all 36 original car action figures from the race at the beginning.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
delightful and entertaining.,"i went to Pixar Studio building to watch an early screening of cars couple days ago. First i must say that i didn't really have a high expectation on this as much as i had for previous movies from Pixar, but since its Pixar so i was pretty sure that it would turn out to be good. it actually much better than i thought it would be!!. it was funny [ not stupid funny tho ]. it was a good movie with a good story telling, a fine script, and spectacular animation. this movie has heart and full of feeling that make people love the characters and enjoy the movie. the movie has a really good opening, but after 30 minutes of movie, it went slower and has a kind of boring moment. but toward the end, its getting better and better.this is a really good job presented by Pixar, but not yet a masterpiece. i still think that The incredibles is the best one so far.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar has done it again.,"I had my doubts. I knew that Pixar would fail this time around. No way were they going to pull this off for a seventh time.I was very, very wrong.I went to see a special screening of ""Cars"" a few weeks ago, and this movie blew me away. The animation is gorgeous, the story brings a smile to your face, and you can't help falling in love with all of the colorful characters. It definitely has that genuine Pixar ""heart"" that you rarely see in any other CGI film. At first I thought the movie would be centered around a lot of NASCAR-like racing, but it really wasn't, much to my surprise (and pleasure). This movie is definite Pixar gold. I absolutely loved it.Although I don't want to give any spoilers away, I will say that my favorite scene would have to be when Mater drags McQueen out to do a bit of ""Tractor Tipping"". The whole theater was filled with laughter. Heck, it even got some laughs out of me, which is rare when it comes to a kid's movie.Be there on opening night. This is movie is worth all of your time and money.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
When Cars can talk,"Well I think that CARS was OK ,but very, very, very slow paced. Although some of it was good, some was not. The part where Lightning McQueen visited the city of Radiator Springs was good. Seeing a little town full of talking cars was fun. The movie was sort of interesting and was sort of boring. The boring part of the movie was in the beginning when Lightning McQueen was in the race and talking to the other race cars and when he got lost on the way to the final race. But I think all sorts of children will like it. However I do think this because as I was in the movie theater,in my seat the movie was starting and heard a few little kids yelling out saying:awesome or cool or just plain yelling. The movie was A-OK! And I would recommend the movie for youngsters and everyone over five years of age. I was very happy to watch the movie. and I would be even happy to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Yeeeeeeoooowmm!!!,"After the eco-friendly murmurisms of Over The Hedge, the genius behind Toy Story offers up a fable about a world dominated by cars. Those noisy little things that, along with TV and fast food, stopped everyone from walking. The visuals are fab, the jokes somewhat drab but the racing is top notch pixar. Even when they aren't quite on form, it is hard to fault what they do best.Owen Wilson voices Lightning McQueen, a hot shot race car who, after drawing with two other cars in the final of the Piston Cup, is the favourite to win, a first for a rookie. On his way to the playoff race in California, his way of carriage decides to take a nap whilst trotting along the intersection. As a result, McQueen ends up in the charmingly barmy town of Radiator Springs, the kind of place you'd want to visit, but wouldn't like to live in. His holier-than-thou ways don't exactly impress the simple townsfolk, not least Doc Hudson (Newman), the wise old granddad of the town. He learns those familiar lessons of ""There's more to life than racing"" and yaddy yada. And it is all perfectly charming and fairly amusing whilst never being particularly effecting.Except, of course, for it's visuals. Cars is gorgeous, every pixel is beautifully rendered, so we have superb backdrops of waterfalls, the glow of traffic lights and rim lamps in the night, and of course rust. Lots of rust and dirt. Then there's the racing: the nascar-style drives are electric for both kids and adults. So in the end, whilst it has a decent, if predictable cast of characters, it is the aesthetics that win you over. Whilst Cars is probably lacking that great wit of The Incredibles, or indeed the benchmark film Toy Story, but it isn't disappointing. It doesn't necessarily go nought to sixty in 3 seconds, but manages to keep a relatively enjoyable pace for it's overlong duration.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A different kind of Road-Movie,"As Pixar, Blue Sky and DreamWorks continue to tick off the list of cute cuddly animals to make films about, director John Lasseter and Joe Ranft (the latter sadly and ironically died in a car crash last year) brings us a story about cars in incongruous human setting. Nine years of hard work in combining Lasseter's two great interests, cars and animation, finally gives us a satisfying end product but regrettably 'Cars' is just that. Satisfactory and utterly charmless.The story, for one, is one of the most predictable riffs I have ever seen in an animated feature. It zooms in on an exhilarating, high-profile race for the prestigious 'Piston Cup' and the third lap offers a sense of impending doom. It is Lightning McQueen  rookie at the top of his game, and voiced by the energetic Owen Wilson  that races in pursuit of prestige... so much that he alienates everyone around him, even his pit crew. The race becomes a three-way tie between him and his competitors and now the final showdown will be held in Los Angeles in one week. It is on the way to L.A. that 'Cars' really starts up its engine, specifically when McQueen takes a detour across the desert-laden terrain by route 66 and gets caught for speeding by the local sheriff. He is sentenced to community service in the seedy little nowhere-town and, predictably, here the arrogant McQueen learns the true meaning of friends.For a movie about fast-paced vehicles, 'Cars' starts slowly and keeps in this lane for far too long. One hour into the film, Lightning still has not learned the mandatory 'morals & message' lesson that you know Disney is just waiting to dish out with a wagging finger. Undoubtedtly its fatal flaw is its length: there is absolutely no need to stretch a Disney comedy across two hours. This problem escalates as the extremely safe and passive approach to humour makes its mark; soon it is clear that the film is not going to tip over into goofball or absurdist humour but remains sedated and expects us to find the mere facial expressions of the cars hilarious  and they are not, because cars are too clunky and mechanical to effectively emote.Yet it needs to be said for all its comedic shortcomings, 'Cars' remains afloat simply because it makes no pretense about being a Disney/Pixar film of a different calibre. It is obvious that it caters more to the younger audience than, say, the heavyweights Shrek, Nemo or Ice Age that are all about adult references. Only once or twice does the film sneak in a subtle racy element such as the bitch-tag at the back of the female Porsche's rear or the 'organic fuel' that the hippie-van uses. On that note, ""hillbilly hell"", as McQueen bitterly spits, is beautifully crafted in terms of animation. The CGI environment is crisp, fluent, lean and simply superb in capturing the well-oiled sleek machines of superstardom juxtaposed with the rusty hicky complexity of the hillbilly town. 'Cars' is possibly Pixar's greatest feat in animation, but its weakest jab at story and entertainment.Although Paul Newman brings perfect charisma to his bitter-and-doomed-but-good-old-mentor character, none of the other cars shine. Indeed, there is a frightening lack of funny sidekicks with assigned quirks and the closest Cars gets to this is its shy firewagon truck Red. This wide-ranging mediocrity also applies to the soundtrack which is noticeably sub-par and unimaginative: either cheesy mellow 'mood' music or Sheryl Crow pop. Where's the oomph in the engine of 'Cars'? Step up, Disney, because you cannot ride on the success of Finding Nemo forever.5 out of 10",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A visual treasure hunt in a heartwarming storyline,"I read a write-up about Cars several months ago, so I was vaguely aware of it when a friend suggested we go see it today. I had no idea where the plot would lead, but figured a Pixar film was a good bet.The film was marvelously rendered; several times I could have sworn I was watching real film footage instead of animation, especially scenes showing passing landscapes.The characters were also cleverly drawn, with subtle touches viewers might or might not notice, such as goatees, mustaches, horns, and udders (I'll say no more about that - you'll have to find out for yourself) represented by various car or tractor parts.Finally, the ""Monument Valley"" sort of landscape where the majority of the story takes place was a car lover's dream, where you could pick out parts of Tuckers, Deusenbergs, Packards, and Rolls Royces, carburetor filters, hood ornaments, and other automotive goodies.Even if you're not a motor-head, the story is heartwarming, the characters are entertaining, and the humor keeps coming at you at all levels - kids to adults. I'll be getting the DVD because I know I'll have to watch it over and over to catch all the puns and ""in"" references.I look forward to it already.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A feast to the eyes, good medicine for the heart, and a good flick for everyone, Pixar remains running without a disappointment  yet","The only problem with setting the bar so high is that then you are expected to always perform at that level. Pixar set the bar so high with some of its masterpieces that whenever they come out with an above-average animated film, its still ""disappointing"" because it's compared to its other brilliant creations. The Incredibles suffers from this, and so does Cars. But, just like The Incredibles, Cars is a superb tour-de-force that should entertain the entire family. From the beginning fun-filled race to the great ending, Cars is a technical achievement, visually appealing, and also contains a great message, one that does not seem forced unlike other animated movies. As a matter of fact, this is perhaps the best animated movie since Finding Nemo three years ago.Cars focuses on Lightning McQueen, who is a fast-talking, cocky, arrogant, independent rookie whose first year in racing has proved to be a very successful one. Yet, during his drive to California in attempt to claim his first Piston Cup trophy, he becomes sidetracked and is stuck in a secluded town called Radiator Town full of friendly cars led by a quiet yet bitter car with a mysterious past. Throughout the movie, Lightning attempts to leave the town, but the citizens are not going to just let him go without a fight.Casting is amazing. Owen Wilson perfectly matches his character, Lightning McQueen, and Larry the Cable Guy actually provides some laughs as Mater. Paul Newman is excellent as the humble Doc Hudson, and the rest of the cast (Cheech Marin, Tony Shaloub, George Carlin, John Ratzenberger, Michael Keaton) did a great job as well. Pixar separates itself from most other movie companies because there is a lot of focus in storytelling, and the script was very good, and the dialogue has many humorous moments as there are one-liners sprinkled all-over the place. Watching the credits, one would see the amount of research put into the movie as well as dedication and effort, and that is something that really doesn't happen much with movies nowadays, especially those that come out in the summer.While it is not the funniest Pixar movie nor is it the one with the saddest moments, the blend of comedy, drama, and hint of racing action is spectacular. The pacing totally slows down as the setting changes, which is a rarity in itself. You sometimes forget that they are all cars as they showcase their happiness, sorrow, and pain through their dialogue, tone, and also their facial expressions like a human being. Some moments actually had the audience collectively saying ""awwww,"" or collectively gasping, or collectively breaking out into laughter. If anyone complains about the pacing of the film, then they obviously missed the message. Cars shows that at times, its best to slow down and take life slowly, not constantly have to go out their to win the gold, to earn the money, to gain respect. If you complain about the pacing, then you are a victim of the fast-paced world we live in.Animation is utterly startling, so rich in detail, so rich in color. Everything visually is practically perfect, from the tire tracks in the background to the little scratches in the main character's car, to the thousands of spectator cars witnessing the race. It is hard to blink because missing a moment of Cars would be a punishment to the eyes. Showcasing emotion through facial expressions in automobiles is not easy, yet Pixar pulls it off like it was no problem at all. It is obvious years were put into this movie.Bottom Line: I can't put enough praise on this film to fit into this review. In a world of sequels, remakes, and disasters, it is nice to see that there is still some creativity out there and that there is still a company that can flesh out quality movie after quality movie. Cars has excellent casting, a great story, detailed animation, a superb ending, and a hefty dose of drama to blend in with the humor, Cars is a blast--much better than previous Dreamworks efforts, better than any Blue Sky movies, and even better than the latest Wallace and Gromit production. You would have to go back to 2003 to find a better animated film, when Finding Nemo surprisingly destroyed the summer competition for a very long time. Cars should add some nostalgia for the adults, and should also entertain the kids despite it being almost two hours in length. 10 years and still running well, good job Pixar. Cars: not the first good movie of the summer, but the first great movie of the summer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Truly Moving Picture,"I saw this film on May 31st, 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.The most famous streak in sports is probably Joe DiMaggio's 56 game hitting streak. The most famous hit streak in film entertainment is probably Pixar's feature film animation streak. With ""Cars"", it's seven in row for outstanding storytelling that is well executed and is (or will be) rewarded with blockbuster box office grosses. ""Toy Story"", ""Toy Story 2"", ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Finding Nemo"", ""The Incredibles"", and ""A Bug's Life"" are the other six gems.The story is about Lightning McQueen a rookie NASCAR-type racer. Of course, he is a car and not a human; or, he is a human in the form of the car. Take your pick. Either way, he is not an attractive persona. He is selfish, unappreciative, greedy, two-faced and has no real friends. But, he is a great driver and is tied for The Piston (read Winston) Cup annual championship with two other drivers. On the way to the runoff race in California, he accidentally gets off in a sleepy and forgotten town on Route 66 named Radiator Springs.In this hillbilly hell of a town, he is punished for speeding and tearing up the road by the sheriff. As he serves his sentence with community work, he discovers the town is inhabited by rejects and misfits, who all have hearts of gold. Can they change Lightning and make him over to have positive traits like honesty, integrity, respect, honor, sacrifice, humility, and compassion? That's the drama that unfolds. Lightning is a hard case, and the outcome is always in doubt.The cars/people are incredible. Shortly into the movie you forget that the people are cars or the cars are people, you suspend disbelief, and you just begin to watch an engaging story about real people. The windshields are their eyes, and the grilles are their mouths, and they display emotions as well as any human actor. The story is serious and light-hearted at the same time. The puns are too numerous to catch. And this is a must-see-twice-to-get-it-all movie.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Nice ride,"As usual, you've gotta hand it to Pixar.In ""Cars,"" their latest film, they show why they are still the cream of the crop when it comes to the field they revolutionized more than a decade ago. Well, yeah, it doesn't have the sophistication and cleverness of ""The Incredibles,"" nor the universal appeal of both ""Toy Stories"" and ""Finding Nemo."" And I have to admit that the idea of animated cars was the least riveting as far as Pixar film premises are concerned. But as with its predecessors, beneath those excellently rendered 3D images is the soul that sets Pixar apart from what has become of most animated films nowadays.Up-and-coming rookie race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), is about to win the prestigious Piston Cup. The championship ends with Lightning finishing in a tie with legendary ""The King"" (Richard Petty), who is in his final race, and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton); thus, a tie-breaking race is set in California.But a road mishap leads Lightning to the forgotten town of Radiator Springs, a part of what was once Route 66, a place that once basked in glory, but has since been thrust into oblivion. There he meets an array of other cars - including Doc Hudson (Paul Newman!), Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and Sally (Bonnie Hunt) - who teach him that ""life isn't about the destination but about the journey.""First of all, Pixar's animation is first-rate. It's that sort of greatness among their artists I can only geek about and dream of grasping while in my 3D animation classes. The cars have a definite realistic look, especially with the rendering (man, the reflections!). The film is also vibrantly colored, making use of a whole variety of shades of dark colors during the race, and warm ones whenever the scenes shift to Radiator Springs. Even the old, vintage car models have that chic look that brings some of the essential charm of this film. There are lots to be admired on this film just for the brilliance in animation. But among those that stand out are the race itself, and when Doc Hudson gets to bring back his good old days. Somehow, it's like watching NASCAR on IMAX again, albeit minus the über-big screen and the 3-D effect.But what's really nice about this film is how director John Lasseter and the writers effectively tell the story and how they pump up the visual feast with humor and sincere emotions. It still all boils down to the story and how it is told - the very essence of cinema. Granted, when it comes to the standards set by previous Pixar films, it isn't quite up there with it's predecessors; but considering how lofty the bar has reached and the mediocrity that has become of the genre in general, ""Cars"" more than gets the job done.As for the voice cast, Wilson brings that sort of cockiness to the protagonist of the story and it fits with his smug humor. Larry the Cable Guy gives Mater an amusingly disoriented state without being irritatingly so. You can't help but care about him and arguably, he's the nicest member of the cast. Newman lends an authoritative quality to Doc Hudson. (During the end credits, there's an in-joke about John Ratzenberger, who has his voice featured in all Pixar films thus far.) However, ultimately, the cast is somewhat unmemorable and lacking in diversity. The rest of the voice talents are also underused. Keaton's Chick Hicks is a formulaic one-dimensional villain, which could have utilized his voice more with a little more motivation for the car's part. But then again, that may be beside the movie's point.All in all, ""Cars"" is a visual feast outside and an effective storytelling inside. When it comes to the basis of their appeal, it doesn't keep up with the rest of Pixar films which have sped up far ahead and this may yet be their first underachiever. But for what it is and what it achieves, it's a nice ride.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Adult scepticism turned to real delight over this film animation,"I saw a trailer of this and made the adult(without children) mental note: ""won't bother""! So glad I saw it when visiting my niece and her two young children. We had a movie outing together and I chuckled more than the rest of the audience, in between trying to figure whose voice was ""Humber Hornet"". Too distracting from the sheer pleasure of this action-packed animated frolic. It was Paul Newman! I like to think I am a movie buff, so going to a kid flick I brace myself for being dumbed out. Not so here. I loved every second of the masterful fusion of human emotions,and believable characters, with mechanical objects.It is still good to get into the child in all of us - but probably most of you know this already? I am a convert to this genre. Next stop will be ""Over the Hedge"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
best Pixar movie since Toy Story,"upon entering the theater I wasn't expecting anything wow and big from pixar since the last few movies they made really didn't hit it off with me. But I Love ""Cars""!! its the best movie that pixar has created in a long long time. Not since the early days of ""Toy Story"" have I enjoyed a Pixar movie so much that I wanted to write a comment about it. This movie is fantastic! It has everything you could ever want in a movie plus a whole lot more. The team over at Pixar really went over and beyond with this movie and all that hard work really shows.although the gags references and storyline are more for the adults than the kids, I still would recommend this movie to absolutely everybody. 10++++",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"My least favourite Pixar movie, but I still enjoyed it","Don't get me wrong, Cars is a good movie, it's just that it isn't a great one. Personally I do think it is my least favourite Pixar movie, but there was still a lot I enjoyed. So what were its problems? Well, firstly I felt the narrative was a little too slack and sedate particularly in the middle act. Secondly, while there were some nice jokes, some didn't quite work and the script had its weak spots, could've done with more sophistication. Thirdly, the film's message is a little muddled.But there is a lot to enjoy. The animation is superb, the backgrounds are beautiful and the character movements are crisp. The film has some really bright and inventive colouring which was a delight to see. The soundtrack is quite exhilarating as well, and the race scenes themselves are like mini-masterpieces of editing.The characters are at least likable and engaging, Lightening McQueen(a refreshing retread from the dull and flaccid hero), female Porsche Sally(who is really cute) and Doc Hudson(the wise old-timer with a secret past) are the best characters in my opinion.The voice acting is very well done. Owen Wilson gives a spirited and appealing vocal performance as Lightening, this was really refreshing to see and it really helped that Lightening himself was likable, yes he is cocky and arrogant then again even the best characters ever in film have a flaw or so of some kind. The late talented Paul Newman is a sheer delight as Doc, and Bonnie Hunt is delightful as Sally. Larry the Cable Guy, Michael Keaton, Tony Shalhoub and John Ratzenberger also give solid turns in their roles.Overall, Cars is my least favourite of the Pixar movies but for the animation and voice acting especially, not to mention the race sequences it is well worth watching. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
awesome movie,"I thought the story looked very lame from previews, and the concept didn't appeal to me. But when I saw an early screening I was surprised, it was well written and well executed. They didn't overload the movie with automotive jokes, which I think would have hurt the story and character development. Owen Wilson's voice is great for his role. Overall, it's on par with other Pixar films, even if it may not be their best so far. The animation is superb, definitely the best they've done. Giving something like cars distinct personality and characterization seems like it would be pretty tough, and they do a great job with it. See this movie the day it opens.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Not a classic, but I still like it...","when Pixar announced their idea for ""Cars"" (a world exactly like our own but inhabited by living cars instead of humans), I thought that the film was going to be an instant failure. Then, as the images of the new graphics and the plot outlines started to came out I was still unimpressed by them, seeing at how unoriginal the plot was and how everything seemed to be aiming for showing off their technical progress, my hopes for ""Cars"" were really low. I guess that's why I ended up liking it so much.""Cars"" is the story of a cocky, arrogant and very ambitious young racer named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) who has become the new sensation in the racing circuit. During the trip towards the final race of the circuit (a race that would give him the Cup if he wins), he gets lost and accidentally ends up in a small forgotten town on Route 66 named ""Radiator Springs"". Without knowing how to return to the Highway and forced to repair the damage caused by his arrival, McQueen will discover the simple way of life of this quiet town and its inhabitants.Visually, the film is perfect; the computer animation has reached a point where it seems that the only limit is to create a human being, and I bet that Pixar is not too far from it. Light effects, water effects, reflection, chrome and other phenomena are represented with great detail surpassing everything Pixar had done before. However, this tale of a young and ambitious car living in the fast urban world and his clash with the simple and slower life of rural U.S. is nothing really new or original, and this is where the directors/writers John Lasseter and the late Joe Ranft make a difference.""Cars"" is a new version of a familiar old story. Sure, it is by no means an original story and it is very predictable, but the details added by the writers are what makes the film different. The lovable and different characters give soul to the apparently lifeless ""Cars"", and they make the difference in what otherwise would be a dull boring and predictable film. every character has been carefully detailed, not only visually, but also in their personalities, antics and voices. This care in the characterization department is what made ""Toy Story"" or Fox's ""Ice Age"" different among other animated films.The voice actors are very good, and it is noticeable the care taken in assembling the cast. Owen Wilson makes a very good McQueen, making him an arrogant, ambitious city boy; Paul Newman brings his experience and makes a wonderful Doc Hudson, Radiator Springs' mayor. Bonnie Hunt and Larry the Cable guy complete the cast and all of them are equally competent in their jobs. Their performances give the final touch to the film.As written above, the film has only one big detail that may turn off some viewers. Its plot is nothing really new or unseen, and it could be said that it is one of their least funny scripts. Sure, it touches an important subject, but a few more laughs could had helped the final product. However, credit must go to the writers, who have crafted a movie that will keep the kids interested even when it is not a laugh riot.""Cars"" may not be have a multi-awarded script or even an original plot, but it has a lot of heart, and it shows how much Lasseter and Ranft cared for the story. Despite its troubles, it is a fine film to take the children. If you keep the expectations low and relax a bit it will be a nice ride.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
touching film...one of my favorites for 2006,"The movie is made by Pixar, the creators of another one of my favorite films, Finding Nemo. In this new film, they make cars come to life like real human beings. The story revolves around Lightning McQueen, a cocky hotshot race car. Enroute to California to compete for the Piston Cup, he gets lost in Radiator Springs, destroying their main road. The sheriff sentences him to fix the road before he can leave and head on to his race. At first, Lightning, like the arrogant self-important person -- err -- car that he is, looks upon this job with resentment and does a bad job. But as he gets to know Sally, Doc Hudson, Mater, and the other cars, he too falls in love with the town and realizes that life is about enjoying the journey, and not the frantic race to the finish line.In the end, I was in tears. No, no cars died in this film, to answer my friend's question. The final race scene was just so touching. Something straight out of Chicken Soup for the Soul. So what are you waiting for? Go!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Can't Say Enough Good Things About This Animated Gem,"Wow, this was fantastic! As I was watching it, I asked myself, ""Is this the best animated movie I've ever seen?' I think the answer is ""yes.""After watching ""The Polar Express"" last year and seeing the most beautiful visuals and fabulous sound, I thought it might be awhile before anything topped that, but this movie beats it. That's because it's equally beautiful, color-wise, and more entertaining because of the excellent humor. The humor isn't just a bunch of funny lines; it's also funny sights on screen from the cars' ""faces"" to a lot of clever material in the background. There is so much to see that multiple viewings, I'm sure, would catch new things each time.For me, watching an animated film for two hours is usually asking way too much but not with this film. It's so much fun to see and there are no boring lulls, yet the action after the first 10 minutes is light. The characters are varied and the kind you care about, or want to find out more about, all of which translates into scenes which continually keep your interest.At times, the colors in here astounded me, especially with the nighttime scenes. The sound also is excellent, especially in the opening and closing race scenes. With surround speakers, it's almost like being at the track.The message is a nice one, too, and not delivered in any heavy-handed manner, either. Having a team to work with, people to be there to help and be helped, is better than going alone in life. Thy didn't beat us to death with it, but that is the unmistakable message in this story.I can't say enough about this film. It's really good stuff for anyone of any age. I was extremely impressed. Oh, and as a final note: don't turn this off when it's over; stay with the ending credits because there are some really funny comments, mostly by John Ratzenberger .",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Amazing Visuals,"In a world inhabited by locomotion machines and cars, the little abandoned town of Radiator Spring languishes until it receives the visit of a posh race car, Lightning McQueen. His stop and meeting of the old- style cars living there will change his perspective on life and on what he wants to achieve.The mate drawing of the landscape and town settings is magnificent. The cinematography and shot angles used to film the story are truly artistic. The design of the cars is equally impressive regarding animation, colors, texturing and lighting. The night scenes in the open field are among my favorites, so beautiful and realistic. The whole film is a long wow in that regard, and you feel like clapping to those big artists working for Pixar in this movie. In that regard, the movie deserves a 10.The voicing of the characters, done by A-list actors (Paul Newman among them, in his last acting role before passing away), is extremely good, very charming and effective, as the viewer really feels that the voices match the cars' personality and bring a big cozy feeling to the movie.However, all of this is not enough to save the movie, which suffers from an absurd point of departure, stereotypical script and characters/role models, and a childish storyline feeling in general. This will delight children, guaranteed, but will not engage enough most adults. I thought that Pixar had lowered their storyline standards and made a movie that would suit more Disney's requirements. No wonder that Disney bought Pixar little after the movie was released.An enjoyable movie for kids, with spectacular animation and eye candy colors to be enjoyed by all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Perfect for the Kid Who Loves Matchbox Racers - His Parents, Less So","There's really nothing wrong with this; it fits the mold as a smart kid's movie with enough subtle nudges and winks to keep the adults happy, a formula that Pixar has mined extremely well over the past decade and a half. It's even got that one weighty central topic, the moment the entire picture balances upon, when the collective audience presumably takes a sharp breath of air and has some sort of mini-epiphany in connecting it to their own lives. The major pieces are all there, truly, so why didn't I find this picture as rewarding as the rest of the animation house's legendary catalog? It's got something to do with the moments in-between. Usually, it's precisely those instants off the beaten path that Pixar absolutely swallows up, enveloping the screen with tiny jokes, dazzling visual wizardry and deep, circumstantial character development. In Cars, for whatever reason, the power in such moments is lacking. The studio goes through the motions, which makes for a more-than-decent facsimile, but in the end it doesn't feel as complete and engaging as their other masterworks. I would've loved it as a kid, and plan to share it with mine some day, but as an adult I'd rather throw in Toy Story or The Incredibles.Revised thoughts, nearly three years later:My boys are absolutely bonkers for Lightning McQueen and Tow Mater right now, but had never actually seen the movie. Needless to say, they loved it, and I discovered that my own opinion has softened over time. Of course, it still can't hold a torch to the innocent humor of Toy Story, the sentimentality of Monsters, Inc. or the pulse-pounding twists of The Incredibles, but it fits in snugly on the second tier alongside A Bug's Life and Ratatouille. The theme may have seemed transparently concocted to sell merchandise, but as a product of the era when Pixar didn't do anything they didn't believe in, it still resonates with thoughtful care and well-placed emotion. Perhaps unfairly cast aside at first, it's a well-made, lovingly executed film that tugs shamelessly at the heart strings when its points bubble to the surface. I'd upgrade my score from 7 to 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
involving thanks to likable characters,"Over the decade all full-length Pixar's animated flicks kept incredibly high level and provided wise entertainment for the whole family. In addition, no other studio gained such an acceptance not only from viewers, but also from critics. Alike in case of previous Pixar's movies, I also had a big expectations with regard to ""Cars"". It turned out that ""Cars""is the least enjoyable of all Pixar's productions. The animation is as always breathtaking. The film is obviously visually stunning and a great number of scenes is beautiful. The idea of humanized talking cars was awe-inspiring and provided a room to display screenwriters' talent. However, they missed a chance to make other instant classic. The plot is rather typical and painfully predictable with an obvious message known from the very beginning. What's more, the script is not abound with wonderful ideas (I found only allusion to Road 66 interesting) and humorous situations, which was a trademark of previous Pixar's films. The emphasis is rightly placed on likable characters humanized by the excellent voice cast. Although not so great as ""Monsters, Inc"" or ""The Incredibles"", this flick is still worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The variety of humor suits all generations, too, making this the first ""summer must see"" for the family.Being an artist I was struck by the vibrancy of the animation.

Ka-chow!,"""Cars"" is the right movie to watch whenever one feels the need for speed. I'm not really into CGI films, but at least this one is much better than other CGI productions. It's fun to watch. Unlike most CGI films with annoying humor, weird and awfully designed characters and often weak visuals, this one has brilliant graphics, funny and clever humor and some great visuals.A very creative, imaginative, original, funny and interesting detail is that the eyes of this film's anthropomorphic cars are placed on the windshield. Plus, the cars have mouth and teeth.This is Pixar's greatest achievement. Pixar has never done anything like this before or after.The way how the story is made is funny and entertaining. Many hilarious quotes can be found in this movie, especially from Lightning McQueen and Mater. Mater's jokes combined with Lightning McQueen's sarcastic humor results in a real scream and a full plate.Lightning McQueen is hilarious: overconfident, arrogant, talkative, sarcastic and snobbish. He is also selfish, especially towards his pit crew. But I like this rookie race car exactly like that. After becoming kind, he's not as funny. Also, I like his original race car look better than the changes he makes later in Radiator Springs, which make him look much more conservative, something like a 1953 Chevrolet Corvette. But, focusing only on his race car appearance, he seems to be a mix of a Dodge Viper, a Ford GT40, a Lamborghini Miura, a Ferrari 250 GTO and a Mazda RX-8.His name seems to be a reference to Steve McQueen, who was a fan of cars and speed. Owen Wilson does a fantastic job as Lightning McQueen's voice. Others do great voice jobs as well, especially Larry The Cable Guy as Mater and Paul Newman as Doc Hudson.Other cars include Doc Hudson (a Hudson Hornet of the original model - to be more specific, the Fabulous Hudson Hornet), Mater (a rusty old wreck), The King (a Plymouth Superbird), Luigi (a Fiat 500), Guido (a forklift which resembles an Isetta), Lizzie (an ancient Ford Model T) and Mack (a humorous Mack Super-Liner lorry). All of them are great characters and even Bessie is... if that counts, LOL. Mater is like ""Tow Mater"" but without the ""Tow"".Chick Hicks is the only character I don't like and even hate. He is vindictive, obnoxious and nasty. He is very greedy and actually way more selfish than Lightning McQueen. Although Lightning McQueen is what he is, at least he never rams any car and he'd never do that, unlike Chick Hicks who purposely rams all the cars in his way and causes them terrible accidents (including The King). He hates both The King and Lightning McQueen and yet copies Lightning McQueen's jokes.When it comes to visuals, they can be easily described as real-looking, fresh and modern but done with high standards of quality comparing to most many terrible CGI creations. Visually, the best part is the beginning: the electrifying and powerful noise of the racing cars's engines, the cars running in a big track and amazing race, the fabulous and realistic sceneries (with sparkling lights and entire crowds of cars watching), great music...The soundtrack is not brilliant but the opening song is pretty cool, as well as the song ""Life is a highway"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar and Disney did it again!,"Without giving away any of the story, here's my take. I attended the premiere of CARS at LMS on Friday, May 26. True to Disney form, the premiere itself was spectacular. Four giant screens, live entertainment,lots of fireworks, great inclusion of military personnel, and as good of a red carpet as you can do with chain link fenced areas... This movie rates right in the middle of Pixar releases for me. I place it above Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, but not as good as the ""original"", the best ever, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. Everything just looks so real in this movie. The dust stirred up when Lightning drives off, the scenery around Route 66 (well, maybe not those mountains that look like the fins of old cars). Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. As an adult, I enjoyed the story line. I can't tell you how the kids would like it, as by the time the movie finally started, my kids were asleep. As always, don't leave your seat until all of the credits roll. Sometimes they are some of the funniest clips in the movie! You'll love them this time, as they tie back to prior Pixar movies, in a car sort of way. This is definitely a movie we'll add to the DVD collection. I really hope this movie does well since it's the first release since Disney bought Pixar. Don't go in looking for the action or adult humor of The Incredibles. If you do you'll be disappointed. Just go in looking for the ""Disney always has a good moral behind its animated movies"" type of movie and you will really enjoy it. Paul Newman and Larry the Cable Guy really have the best characters in the movie. And while John Ratzenberger's character doesn't have a lot of screen time, I really enjoyed him! I'll be going back to see it when it releases in theaters so I can get a better feel for the sound, as it wasn't the best in an outdoor setting.

It was OK,"I was slightly disappointed I had hoped for another movie geared for the kids like a ""bugs life"" instead it was geared more for older kids and adults. There is nothing in the movie that would be mature in nature. It just seemed the plot was made more for adults than kids. The grandkids lost interest with it about half way through. It was well done technically but the kids didn't understand things like the drug references by Carlin's character. All in all as an adult it was an entertaining movie worth watching.

"Eerily prescient of the Urban, Rural divide that drove much of the zeitgeist in the 2010's","I think if this film was released today it would have done better with the critics. It didn't do badly in 2006 but there was a lot of people complaining that it was Pixar's first flawed film and that it was a little bet too rote. That was my original impression as well. The film plays like a family version of Doc Hollywood mixed with a sports coming of age story. What the story is doing is rather basic, conventional but it does it do it well. The animation is very beautiful and the film really captures American Car culture c. 1955 and Old Route 66. The characters are a collection of stock characters-Mater is a hick, Fillmore a hippie, etc.-but they are fully realized stock characters with a perfect voice cast. I can understand why someone would be rather cool on the film. I was back in 2006.But the film is a pretty insightful piece of populism in which rural, small town Americana is celebrated instead of marginalized and in a sense degraded. Radiator Springs can stand for a whole bunch of ""forgotten"" men, women because technology, i.e. the highway system, leading to ""American carnage."" I am not saying the film is overtly political but it does celebrate a the small town American experience and longs for a past that was simpler, slower. The nostalgia googles the film places on America car culture feeds a need a lot of people share. McQueen-like a lot of people-need to get back to the roots of society. We all could learn to slow down and appreciate the dainty and dumpy. To often the national conversation is centered on the cosmopolitan experience when quaint charm is more meaningful for a lot of people.I think this film strikes at something very real and very important that has happened in America.

Mind Space,"Steve Jobs, we're gonna miss you in the movie creation business.Of all the things that Jobs is credited with, the one that matters in the creative process is the notion of parallel metrics. In the computer business, he'd (with much advice) draw up a set of traits for a product and then independently seek excellence according to each list. It sounds obvious but this isn't the way it is normally done; usually you have one trait you sell and you attach others done well enough to not ruin the mix. So in computers, consumer electronics and films.Ah, in films. Within the first few minutes of a film, you can pinpoint the one thing the filmmaker is trying to do, the one value around which everything else is assembled, often with just passable competence. Pixar is different. They have several lists, several things that need to be as perfect as possible.So its an odd thing, reading reviews of Pixar projects. The movie press is set up to address one value per film, and we as readers of this material have come to limit the way we actually see. And not just in the theater, but in elements of life as well. So thanks, Steve, for adding some dimension to the mix.I don't write reviews, only comments, so I don't feel obliged to run down each of the Pixar lists. Do it yourself, recognizing the obvious: story and character of course, nesting in values, rhythm, dialog and how it settles in the music and all that. Ordinary stuff.I focus on space and what I call folding. ""Folding"" is the engineering of how the viewer is placed in the narrative and often it is a matter of careful engineering. The folding here is how two movie genres are mixed: one is the spectator sport where the spectators (with us included) are explicit. What the ""people"" in the stands value is what we do, the excitement, the sportsmanship. The other movie is the one about city visitor to hick town and each changes the other. Its a rewarding enough formula, which I like best in the Swayze/Newmar ""Wong Foo"" version.So the folding, while expert and lucid is a bit obvious.Its the use of space that blows me away in these things. How the dimensions are exploited. I've heard Lasseter talk about this. The thing that modern animation gives us is not that we can have talking cars, that's about 85 years old now. It is that once you design a scene, the camera can be anywhere and move in any manner.Pixar has a group that concerns itself with the visual excitement of such things. Its both a matter of excellence and novelty but the novelty cannot be too extreme or we reject the thing. Look at the shorts Pixar presents, in particular the one coupled with ""Cars,"" ""One Man Band,"" to see experiments in spatial adventure.Prior projects have been designed in some ways to exploit this dimensionality, especially ""Nemo"" which doesn't have a surface, a horizon or much gravity. When you do these things, you can exploit space in only a few ways. You can use architecture, a technique that is challenging, rare and uniquely rewarding. You can have the action be the center of the dance. Or you can center the dance on the camera. Its the latter that is done here.You should watch it just for that, just for the way your mind's eye can be stretched. The group responsible for this list, these values did well, better than anyone else in animation for sure. Steve, we're gonna miss you.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Continues the visionary dominance, though falters slightly with pace","Needless to say, all the visionary spectacle that has guided Pixar's hand from day one remains brilliantly on display, articulated in new ways now that vehicles have become the human element. While not the masterpiece in tone and plotting that had distinguished this computer animation company's nearly flawless track record from countless imitators, Cars is nonetheless another heartfelt, beautiful triumph worthy of the Pixar label. As with all things animated, Cars works best when the action speaks for itself, when the animation suspends character interaction in favor of broad and breathtaking observational sweeps, via the American highway, poignantly harking back to days of old in completely new family-friendly gestures. While the humbling of hot-rod hot-shot Lightning Mcqueen (Wilson in one of his most convincing roles) and subsequent homage to mid west America may not have been pieced together in the most convincing of manners, Cars will still sweep excited children into it's blazing introduction, mellow out with it's sweet and funny character interaction and race past the finish line in a blaze of feel good family entertainment from the highest, visually animated order.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wonderfully entertaining,"A delightful animated romp made by Pixar and Disney. It is filled with talented voice performances by Owen Wilson and Paul Newman.

There are more than a few laughs sprinkled throughout the film. Fart jokes are in overdrive during an expedition to tip tractors but young children will be in the aisles. Larry the Cable Guy as the tow-truck Mater is endearing for most of the movie as the slow sidekick.The animation is beautiful and memorizing.

"After this, Disney & Pixar are one.","It should be no surprise to those who know me(including some on the internet who've never met me) that I'd see this movie. 1)I'm a certifiable car freak. 2)I've had a long-standing interest in animation. 3)This is officially the last Disney/Pixar collaboration. Disney now OWNS Pixar. 4)This may be the last Paul Newman movie, and even if you're not a big Paul Newman fan, any film buff should understand the merit of that.Lightning McQueen(Owen Wilson), who surprisingly was not named after Steve McQueen, is a cocky as hell hotshot rookie NASCAR racer who thinks he's so good, he doesn't even listen to his pit crew when they insist he should get his tires replaced. He has a huge ego, some loyal groupies, a sponsor he doesn't believe in, an agent who talks to him on a videophone from his trailer, and an eye on the finish line. Luckily he gets that along with his two rivals, the aging King(voiced by real life NASCAR racer Richard Petty), a 1970 Plymouth Roadrunner Superbird, and Chick Hicks(Michael Keaton) a Mid-1980's Buick GNX, who loves to push other cars around on the track. This means a tie-breaker race has to take place, and so it's on to California. His only friend at this point is his transporter Mack(John Ratzenberger), a Super Liner who hauls him to every race in the Piston Cup Series(They're obviously not going to use a real-life tobacco company for a kids' movie), but even Lightning won't let him rest when he needs it. When Mack falls asleep on the way to L.A., and is startled by a gang of street rods in the middle of the night, Lightning falls out of the trailer and gets lost. Lacking real headlights, he tries to get back on the interstate, and gets tangled in some telephone wires in a town called Radiator Springs, and wrecks their main road -- the famous U.S. Route 66. Radiator Springs was founded by a Stanley Steamer, and the statue erected in his honor is among the casualties. The town sentences him to community service, forcing him to repair the road by towing some old paving equipment. While there, McQueen is arrested by the Sheriff(author and cultural guru Michael Wallis), a 1949 Mercury, impounded by Mater(Larry the Cable Guy), a Chevy 3800 Tow Truck, prosecuted by Sally Carerra(Bonnie Hunt) a cute Porsche 911 who also owns the Cozy Cone Motel, and judged by Doc(Paul Newman), a 1951 Hudson Hornet. While there he starts to fall for the very girl who prosecuted him. During this time she takes the opportunity to show him the world around the town. She also gives him an education about the history of Radiator Springs, and he finds out something very interesting about Judge Doc Hudson. What happened to the fictional town of ""Radiator Springs"" is what happened to many of the towns that ran along the former US 66 in real life. The Interstate Highway System passed them by, specifically I-40, I-44, and I-55, and the towns went bust. Although, truth be told, an interest in the former Mother Road by nostalgia buffs and roadgeeks such as myself, has lead to an increase in tourism to these areas. To be fair, I think the federal government wanted the Interstates to benefit these towns too. So even after this movie, you still won't catch me shouting ""Damn the Interstate."" In fact, I'd love to see a couple of them built across Long Island Sound(I-287 & I-495), along with some other highways.What makes this so good isn't the fact that it has motor vehicles as characters. Those kinds of cartoons were around before they ran cartoons on television. It's that the movie actually has good background scenes, especially the road scenes, whether it's on Route 66 or the Interstate on the way to California. Even the ""natural"" scenes are cool, some of which are rock formations shaped like cars of the 1930's and others are modeled after the famous Cadillac Ranch. I also like how the Los Angeles Memorial Colesium was converted into the ""Los Angeles International Speedway."" To be honest, I was looking for a different ending with similar results. But ""Doc Hollywood"" rip-off or not, it's still an enjoyable movie, even if ""The Incredibles"" was better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The greatest film of all time,"Only a true genius could conjure up such a tale of heartbreak, humor, and heroism. I am not an emotional man, nor do I ever display them, even in front of my wife, but the unspeakable things I felt during this cinematic experience can't be put into words. Truly the only words that can sum up a feeling better than my son's birth or even my 5th divorce would be, as Three-time Piston Cup Champion Chick Hicks would say... KACHIGAAAAAAA.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
the pixar machine finally stalled,"Pumping himself up before the final race, Lighting McQueen is a rookie car sensation, only starting at the beginning of the season and already one of the top cars. Lighting is cocky and egotistical, but the crowd loves him and he's happy for the attention. The race ends, but on a three way tie between Lighting, Chick Hicks and defending champion The King. For the decider, another race is held in California between the three cars for the championship. On the way to California, Lighting gets lost on the old highway Route 66. While trying to find the interstate, Lighting is impounded in the small town of Radiator Springs. The town is inhabited by an old mix of cars; leader Doc Hudson, a porch Sally Carrera, a rusted tow truck Mater, a low rider Ramone, stoned out VW Filmore, plus an assortment of others.Pixar have always been ahead of the game they started of computer animation, back in 1995 with Toy Story. They changed the world of children films, with deeper and layered stories that tailor to the young and the older audiences. Each film they have gone in boundless leaps, bringing the best in artistry of computer animation, and Cars is no different. The animation is flawless and at times mesmerising, the world these cars live in is wonderfully detailed.Amazing animation aside, the driving force of Cars isn't that strong. The story is one road that has been very well travelled. Self centered McQueen learns life lessons about friendship and loyalty, with his ways changed by unlikely strangers. So Cars becomes a little to predictable as it moves through the numbers. The jokes are also too sparing. The jokes are to far apart, and many fall flat; even the opening short film One Man Band isn't that entertaining as other previous Pixar Shorts.The Pixar team have always been excellent at suspending ones disbelief. One wondered if our toys were secretly alive, humanizing insects and sea creatures, or our closet was a doorway to a monster world. While writer/director John Lasseter has attempted to humanize cars, it doesn't feel that believable. The cars come off as caricatures of what type they are; one look and its not hard to click onto what personality they will have.The voice talent like always is the defining part. Owen Wilson is great as the cocky Lighting McQueen. Paul Newman husky voice brings that pain to Doc Hundson and his past. Bonnie Hunt is good as the protective Sally. At first, Larry The Cable Guy's exaggerated southern voice started off irritating, but it not hard to fall for Mattor and his antics. Other voices include Cheech Marin, George Carlin, Tony Shalhoub and Michael Keaton.Cars is not as strong as the other Pixar films, but it's still one journey your happy to go along with.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
An Adult Kids Movie,"I can't believe the negative comments about this movie. I agree that the story is a little familiar, but the humor for adults in this is so wonderful--it's a pleasure to watch and try and catch all of the sly references (and not just pop culture things) and wonderful visual images. **POSSIBLE SPOILERS**I was amazed with the desert scenes and all of the buttes and mountains shown as car hoods and fenders, the old hotel entrance in a wheel. I loved how Ramone had a new paint job every time he came on scene. I loved Luigi's Ferrari mania and when Michael Schumacher came in at the end...perfect humor.

Cars is for everyone,"I went for the gala preview screening two days back. Every patron receives a sticker pad, and a stack of colourful 4 artcards (postcards) featuring individuals of Mater, Sally, Doc Hudson and Lightning McQueen.A simple storyline, with just an ""unpredicatable"", heartwarming ending. Expect enchanting cgi from Pixar. The sound effects of roaring car engines and flying planes is impressive. Don't miss the exciting racing scenes, and the skillful backward precision driving of Mini Coopers! The story about Radiator Springs and Route 66 is touching. Best characters of the movie is Lightning McQueen, Doc Hudson, Sally and Mater.

Enjoyable Right Up To The Finish Line,"this is a very enjoyable movie from start to the finish line(pun intended)Pixar have done it again...This time with cars ,the imagination and ideas behind this movie are incredibly funny...Without the use of humans in this movie it makes all that bit more exciting and enjoyable ..to see a Volkswagen camper van as a hippy and a hummer as Arnold Schwarzenegger is just pure genius.Lightning McQueen(Owen Wilson)is a hot shot race car who cares about no one except himself.When lightning finds himself stuck in the run down town of radiator springs whilst on the way to a big race, he meets new friends who teach him that friendship is much more important than winning.I left the theatre with a gleeful smile on my face like that of a child who had just seen a his very first animated movie.Stay for the credits and you wont regret it! 8/10- a worthy contender for best animation at next years Oscars",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Couldn't even finish it.,"Maybe I'm biased. Fans of films will tell me that in order to produce a well-rounded review, I need to at least finish the film I'm reviewing.That's the problem. ""Cars"" couldn't hold me longer than twenty minutes.With every other Pixar movie (and I've seen and loved them all), I was hooked within the first ten minutes. I was swept away by the story's concept, its characters, the amazing visuals, the fantastic music. I'm a huge fan of Pixar, Andrew Stanton in particular (You remember him, don't you? He's the screenwriter/director responsible for such films as ""Toy Story,"" ""Monsters, Inc.,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" and ""Wall-E.""). Past experience has taught me that in the realm of film-making, there's little they can't do. So when I first saw the trailer for ""Cars,"" I thought something along these lines:""Well, it's Pixar, so maybe it'll be okay...""But when I sat down to watch this little ""gem,"" as I've seen it called, I suddenly wondered if all the clocks in the house were broken. I felt no connection with any of the characters; the story's premise was lost on me. I could barely make it to Larry The Cable Guy's entrance before I got off the couch and went elsewhere to stop the agony.Maybe I'm missing the point. Maybe I don't get this movie because I'm not part of the NASCAR revolution. Maybe it's because Andrew Stanton didn't have any part in this movie other than providing a voice. Maybe I have a problem connecting with automobiles, or maybe it bugged me that there are all these cars, and no drivers behind the wheel. Or maybe I just don't like Larry the Cable Guy. My point is, this movie clearly is not for everyone.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fun Film with Cute Colourful Cars,"'Cars' blew me away with it's fun-feel. I've always liked Pizar's animation and 'Cars' doesn't disappoint one bit. The animation is stunning and the colourful characters are very cute, vivacious and extremely lovable. Even the setting is spectacular. The story, though not exactly 'new' (but has a slightly expected ending), is very heartwarming and makes me smile. 'Got to give Lasseter credit for telling the story and adding the subtle humour. The voice actor features talents like Bonnie Hunt (great to see, I mean hear her after a long time), Paul Newman, Owen Wilson among many others and have been suitably 'cast'.There are so many funny moments and I don't want to give any spoilers but I bet that one would at least laugh-out-loud at a few of them (after all, I don't think anyone lacks that much of a sense of humour). Kids will love it for sure and many adults will enjoy it too. One of the cutest and funniest films of the year. ' Loved it!.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Good, but that isn't the usual reaction to Pixar/Disney","While this film gets a decent enough score from me, a 6, this film suffers from two things; a lack of distinct style and believability. In all the previous Disney/Pixar creations, each had its own animation style that set it apart. Here, this looks like a hodge podge of Toy Story and Monsters Inc. The believability of the characters is a huge hurdle here. I think the choice of cars as characters hinders the believability of the characters and we the viewer being able to relate to them.There is very little in the way of adult entertainment in the film and with a run time of right at 2hrs, it feels that long, especially for kids. My daughter was bored with the film after an hour, something she hasn't ever been with the previous Disney/Pixar films. I have to say I agree with her. The ending is nice enough and the film does have its moments. But overall, this is a pedestrian effort from all involved.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney/Pixar's Cars Is Awesome,"This movie is truly another hit from PIXAR. It's wonderful story, charming characters, and great animation for it's time brings this movie to be just as creative as PIXAR's First Movie Toy Story. Who knew in 11 years from then, we would get this remarkable computer-animated classic. Thank you PIXAR for giving us the true action-adventure thrilling feel of Cars. Still awesome to this day.

"""I'm a precision instrument of speed and aerodynamics.""","Pixar Animation Studios has long maintained a history of excellence, always delivering enjoyable family entertainment. 'Cars' from their only film that I had yet to see, and so I greeted it with a lot of anticipation. Having finished it, I find myself considering a step-down from Pixar's other classics, such as 'Toy Story' or 'Monsters Inc.,' but that doesn't stop it from being an above-average two hours. In a world dominated by automobiles, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is a super-successful rookie in competitive racing; all that remains for him is to win the prestigious Piston Cup, if only he can surpass retiring champion The King (Richard Petty) and cocky Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton). After getting lost on his way to the all-important final race, McQueen ends up in the sleepy, dilapidated town of Radiator Springs, which had once been busy but had since slunk into obscurity when the new highway bypassed it.After accidentally destroying the town's main road, the citizens condemn McQueen to repave it, despite his insistence that he is a famous car and must get to his race within the week. Tired town doctor, Doc Hudson  a 1951 Hudson Hornet (voiced by Paul Newman)  is the most respected vehicle in town, and yet he harbours an unusual reservation towards McQueen that we can't quite explain. Running the local motel is Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), a relatively new resident to Radiator Springs, who found comfort and happiness away from the hustle-and-bustle of the city. Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) is the town's rusty tow-truck, and he's such an adorable creature that he probably steals the entire film. As he slowly gets the know the friendly residents of Radiator Springs, McQueen uncovers some meaning in his life: after all, it's not all about winning. It's about being happy and having some good friends.The thing I've always loved about Pixar's films is that, despite the state-of-the-art computer animation, they've always told their stories in a very traditional way. The films don't try to be cool and high-tech (though I suppose this was a necessary prerequisite for 'The Incredibles'), but simply tell their stories in a simple way, as an older, traditionally-animated film might. Particularly during the opening sequence, the buzzing sound effects, flashing advertisements and pop music soundtrack just didn't seem to fit within a Pixar film: it, frankly, seemed like something you might expect to find in one of the inferior CGI-animated off-shoots from a different studio. Needless to say, I was relieved when McQueen drifted into the quiet country town, since it was then that I started to detect the filmmaker's skills for telling a good story. The outcome of the narrative  as in all Pixar films  was never in doubt, but it's such a nice story, and directors John Lasseter and Joe Ranft tell it pretty well. It's also interesting to note that the studio's next feature-length film, 'Ratatouille (2007),' truly recaptures the traditional spirit of Pixar's earlier works.Once again, I'd like to reinforce that, despite my slight disappointment, 'Cars' is not a poor film by any means. It remains highly entertaining, and healthy fun for children of all ages, even if they have absolutely no knowledge of 1950s automobiles (I most certainly don't!). If I had to choose a funniest scene, it would probably be the ""tractor-tipping"" sequence, when Mater demonstrates the intricate art of startling cow-like farm machinery as they sleep. The ending also carries an excellent message of good-sportsmanship, and I can't have been the only person to let out an audible ""awwwwww!"" in the final seconds of the tie-breaking Piston Cup championship race.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Another ""must see"" movie from Pixar","I was able to attend a premiere showing of this movie in North Carolina and was amazed again at how much more a movie can be than just ""animation."" This film focuses on a changed reality, a world where cars are the only life form and so we must suspend our own reality to enjoy this film. In the same flavor as the first Pixar films, we quickly accept a world where everything is a motorized vehicle that lives and acts like we do in our own world. The cars have experiences in life, desires that drive (sorry for that) them, and misunderstandings that are taken advantage of.My wife and I loved this movie and plan to see it again when it is in public release. I cherished all the nuances of the film and the attention to detail not seen in animations from other companies.For fans of all ages, this film is for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar's Weakest Film to date,"I have seen all but one Pixar film, and that's Cars 2. What I love about Pixar is that they don't make kids movies, they make movies that both kids and adults can enjoy. The Toy Story trilogy is my favorite trilogy, the Incredibles is my favorite Super hero movie, and Wall-e ranks up with some science fiction classics in my opinion. However their 2006 film Cars, doesn't match up well with their other films. The second weakest Pixar film in my opinion is A Bug's Life, which is still a really good film. Overall, Cars isn't really a bad film, it's just OK.The film does have really great animation, as all Pixar films do, the acting's good, there are some really good characters, and I like how the final race didn't go for a cliché route. However the story is completely trite, we all know how this story is going to unfold. Also I'm not a big fan of Mater, I have nothing against Larry the Cable Guy, but Mater brings the film down a bit for me. That's why I'm scared to see Cars 2. Some of the jokes are good, but then you have some toilet humor that just doesn't work well.Cars is OK, but for a Pixar film, and one directed by John Lassater, it defiantly won't be on my DVD shelf any time soon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
well done,"Caught the world premiere at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte-- we're not race fans ourselves by any means, but you really don't have to be to get on the road with this one. We were privvy to a couple inside jokes, living amongst the racing atmosphere that IS Charlotte, but even if we hadn't gotten that extra little chuckle, there's definitely plenty to find. Not just for kids. Kids will like the cute characters, and bright colors, adults will like it simply because it's just plain entertaining without having to dumb down to appeal to kids. You'll find yourself wanting to find the next twisty backroad to get to your next destination. Watch for all kids of cameo's, and it's too bad IMDb doesn't include a picture of the animated character as well-- it's not always easy to remember what the names are once you get home. Owen's good, Newman is classic, if a little flat (I applaud him for just plain staying active and leaving his house!), but it's really Larry the Cable Guy's movie-- newfound appreciation for that one-- and ""tow-mater"" is a multi-layered pun.

Flat Tires,"Mildly amusing tale of brash rookie race car who learns lessons in humility after being stranded in a small town. The animation is pretty good but the story is not up to the standard of Finding Nemo or Monsters, Inc. The script is predictable and the characters are all clichés. The cop car and the deputy are like Andy Taylor and Barney Fife. The jokes are rather stale. Just the concept of talking cars becomes tiresome after a while.

Heartfelt and sincere - my favorite Pixar film,"It's odd to think my favorite Pixar film is the one everyone hates or finds inferior to every other film by them. Many people will not understand why I love this film so much, but I'm sure every person has my same love for a film not many people enjoy either. It is a very personal thing, but I loved Cars. It is as good as the first Toy Story movie.Pixar pumps so much life into their films, and they seem to come out so quickly. Cars came out about a year after The Incredibles, and at that time I assume people expected saw Cars has an awkwardly made film. They're cars. They talk and they have heartfelt conversations. I think maybe talking toys, monsters, bugs, and a superhero family were a bit more understandable.The plot is that Lightning McQueen (Voiced by Owen Wilson), a race car, just tied with Chick Hicks (Keaton) in their latest race. McQueen's pit crew is now traveling to Los Angeles for the tie-breaker race, as well as McQueen, until the truck carrying McQueen falls asleep and McQueen falls out the back.McQueen lands in a near desolate town called Radiator Springs. It's an old fashioned town where all the cars know each other, they all knew their customers, and they were all active workers at one point. Ramone (Marin) runs the body shop, Flo (Lewis) runs a diner, Mater (Cable Guy) runs the tow-truck business, Sally (Hunt) runs a motel, Luigi (Shalhoub) and Guido (Quaroni) run an auto repair shop, and Fillmore (Carlin) runs an oil shop. The town is run by a grumpy old race car named Doc Hudson (Newman) who is hiding a secret himself.The tow-truck Mater tries to become friends with a reluctant McQueen who just sees everybody as losers and himself as a winner. The film teaches a lesson in friendship and staying close to the people you love. The big moral; winning isn't everything.Cars comes equipped with a ""back in the day"" style that works in its favor. In the fifties and sixties, like Sally said ""Cars didn't drive on it (the old highway) to make good time. They drove on it to have a good time."" Now that a highway has been constructed so that it runs right past Radiator Springs, it doesn't get very many, if any, customers and is almost running to the end of its lifespan.The soundtrack for the film spits two memorable tracks that flow perfectly with the film. Rascal Flats covers Life is a Highway, once sung by Tom Cochrane, and adds a very zesty and fast paced quality to the song. It's exciting and very fitting to a film like this. Cars also features the tear-jerker by James Taylor, Our Town. While playing it, it shows flashbacks when Radiator Springs' business was better than ever and very profitable.I have a certain love-affair with this movie I can't explain too well. It's a campy and fun movie with a lot of positive, and sad, qualities. The characters, while cars, manage to enter your heart and never leave. And as always, Pixar does exceptionally well when it comes to animation and scenery. It can almost bring back such memories when you were seven years old, and your cars had a mind of their own. You'd race them around using your hands in your bedroom using your own personal sound effect system - your mouth. I'm not accusing you of doing it, I did it too. Cars revives those memories.Voiced by: Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Tony Shalhoub, John Ratzenberger, George Carlin, Jenifer Lewis, Cheech Marin, Richard Petty, Joe Ranft, and Michael Keaton.

First Pixar... failure?,"Pixar finally made a not-so-good movie. OK, it was good.. sometimes it was actually pretty good.. but most of the time it was just OK... and there were moments where it was, mmmh, how to put it, mmmh, well, almost bad. If there is 1 sin that I cannot forgive in movies, is Boredom. For me, a movie can have bad acting, bad effects, bad music, bad direction... but if it has a bad screenplay, it better NOT be because it's BORING. And Cars, unfortunately, it has a small dose of that. The movie runs for about 2 hours, and there were many times when I caught myself thinking things that had nothing to do with the movie (did I left my PC turned on when I left home?)... the story was simply NOT engrossing enough. You may say that maybe I wasn't in the mood for an animated film, but you would be wrong. I was in the mood. Besides, the best judges in the theatre could corroborate my words: All around me, kids were starting to lose any interest in the movie by the second half of it. Even my kids where apparently more excited to play with their Cars action figures than watching the ""real thing"" on the screen. But enough with the bad... wait, I'm not done. The movie seems to be directed to... I don't know who, but not to the people who liked the other Pixar films. I mean, now I know what my girlfriend felt when I made here watch with me films like ""Any Given Sunday"". I felt lost as to why those Cars were making such a big deal of a race. Things like having a ""cameo"" of this driver guy Schumacher (totally sic) flew over me until after like 10 seconds when my brain woke up and look for his name in the file cabinet for ""unnecessary general culture/pseudo-sports"" (btw, he's this big-shot driver, kinda like the Michael Jordan of racing, I guess). Then, if you'd know me, you would know that I'm a guy with a very, VERY good sense of suspension of disbelief. Throw me all the wizards, unicorns, aliens, ghosts, superheroes, valiant reporters, gooey masses, talking animals, living toys, God, the Devil, whatever! I will hold my brain ""on hold"" and believe it all for the duration of the movie, so I can enjoy it, you know. But here, I just couldn't do it. I've heard the expression ""leave your brain at the entrance"" many times, but this is the first time that I've actually wish I could do it. How in the HELL can we believe in a world where EVERYTHING is cars-related! As hard as I tried, I couldn't stop from thinking that the damn machines do NOT have hands! There's no way they can ""create"" anything, let alone something as sophisticated as, well, human-like lifestyles! I now realized that in every movie there's always something/someone with hands. This idea, a world populated with cars, may work in shows like Thomas The Tank, or maybe Bob The Builder (but there Bob has hands), BUT these shows are segments of 20 minutes tops, and they are idea-based on some moral argument directed at 2, 3 or 4 years old kids! They're like a naptime story that you usually don't have to explain because the point of the story is the idea of ""sharing"", or ""be nice to your siblings"", or some other brainwashing message to have better kids. Here, in a movie that's supposed to be fun for little kids, as well as for adults, or just kids that are potty-trained, well, it just didn't worked. The good things are what make Pixar probably the best animation company out there. The graphics were excellent as expected. The highlight would be the short animation ""One Man Band"". Totally hilarious with a lot of emotions mixed in its scarce 5 or so minutes. Probably my second favourite next to ""Yak-Yak Attack"". I would say that the short film made it worth going to watch Cars, but I still wondered why didn't I left my wife with the kids and went to watch ""Nacho Libre"" instead. OK, I gotta stop myself. I started writing this saying that the movie is OK, but the more I write about it, the more I'm actually hating it. That wasn't supposed to happen. I know that you will see for yourself if this movie sucks or not, I just hope that you have a better control of your brain that I do, and that your day is REALLY relaxed, so you can stand the boredom of s stroll thru Route 66.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Over rated,"Yeah the graphics are great, but that is all because of the computer animation techniques today (consider how much money they keep putting into these CG's). The story line is old style and dragging, one can easily predict what will happen. I think this movie is overrated, maybe because of all the car-lovers in the U.S. The plot is just OK, the effort to portrait characters (both the main and supporting ones) is weak. Anyway, worth to go with kids to see all the colors and spend some family time.

Life Is a Highway.,"Absolutely wonderful animated feature that is arguably the finest of its type. In a world of human-like automobiles, one is at the threshold of super-stardom via his amazing racing skills. However he is brash, selfish and ignorant of others around him. It takes a crazed twist of fate to forever change him as he gets stuck in a small town just off the interstate and is forced to repair a street after unwittingly tearing it up. There he learns that sometimes the best thing to do is to slow down and enjoy the show that is life as he meets others who have been demoralized due to technologies and innovations that have all but killed their sleepy little community. ""Cars"" is a deep-thinking analytical glimpse into the losses that many have experienced due to gains by the world. Small-town values of love, friendship, sacrifice, caring for others and putting the well-being of a group above the well-being of one's self are the major elements found within. There are life lessons here aplenty that are not only valid for the youngest of age groups, but also for the most bitter and disenchanted of adults. Amazingly dominant due to its animation, its great voice characterizations (led most notably by Owen Wilson and Paul Newman) and most importantly its second-to-none script. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Mildly interesting,"Normal films about racing cars are generally bad. In fact, I have yet to meet the first good one. Good thing this is an animation film.

A town that once stood proud as a part of the great route 66 trail, but that has fallen apart after a highway is installed, taking away all the need to pass the city at all.In many respects this children's film is about making new friends, standing your ground, putting your priorities right. In many other respects it is a colorful animation film that amuses the kids. In completeness, it does fairly well, if not good.Can't say I was overly impressed with it myself, but my 7.5 year old nephew loved it.

Pixar's First Disappointment,"From the makers of ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bugs Life,"" ""Toy Story 2,"" ""Monsters Inc,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" and ""The Incredibles"" comes the newest addition to the Pixar family, ""Cars."" When you watch something by the animators of those movies, you expect something better then the average animated movie. From the looks of the trailers, it did not look good, but because of the high reputation Pixar has, I decided to see it. Unfortunately, ""Cars"" does not perform quite well enough to the standards and it has become my first Pixar disappointment.Lightning McQueen is the next big thing in Racing. Unfortunately, while he was speeding on his way to a huge race, he crashes into Radiator Springs, destroying many things in this path. Lighting is forced to do community service in order to make up for all of the damages done. Even though McQueen will do anything to get out of the work, he must learn to accept and bond with the inhabitants of Radiator Springs, in order for him to leave and get back to the raceway.As always, the animation is beautiful. Ever sense ""Toy Story"" hit theaters, revolutionized the way we view animated movies, I have been impressed with Pixar and am always left speechless with every movie they make. The animation is so well done, in some scenes, it is actually hard to tell that it is animated. The animation was the best part, but that does not make a movie.I thought the length was too long. At two hours, this is the longest movie Pixar has ever made. A normal animated film is between 1 hour and 20 minutes and 1 hour and 45 minutes. If ""Cars"" were fifteen to thirty minutes shorter, it would be a lot better. It really dragged, in the middle, to the point where it was somewhat boring. I checked my watch twice during this. The movie I saw before that, ""Superman Returns,"" which was 2 hours 37 minutes long, I did not check my watch once. I even felt antsy for something to happen and I could only imagine how a younger child would feel. I never felt that way about the other Pixar movies; I always thought they were the perfect length.Another thing that makes Pixar movies so great is because all their stories have either triggered or been triggered by a childhood imagination. I have felt my imagination come to life when I see a normal Pixar film. In this world of ""Cars,"" there are no people or animals, just cars. As a child, I have imagined stories about monsters living in my closet, the life of a toy once a child leaves the room, and even a world where superheroes and people live together. I have also imagined being a fish or a bug and having conversation with the same species. As a child, I had never pictured a world full of cars. Yes, I have played with Matchbox cars, but the only noises they made were the typical ""Vroom Vroom"" that all children make when playing with toy cars.What makes Pixar animated movies better then the average animated movie was the humor added. Usually you would get a movie with lots of funny moments that not only kids can laugh at but adults can too. I did chuckle at four or five scenes but only tiny chuckles. Majority of the Pixar movies, if not all of them, had many memorable scenes but was not the case for ""Cars."" The only real memorable scene is the tractor-tipping scene, ""Tractor Tippin's fun!"" In ""Finding Nemo"" or ""The Incredibles,"" I would be laughing aloud at many scenes.Overall ""Cars"" was very disappointing. Sure, it had great animation but that does not make an entire movie. As I mentioned earlier, I believe the best thing would be to cut about 15 to 30 minutes. There was an animated short, before the movie started, that was excellent called ""One Man Band."" Do you remember when I said that the other Pixar movies were all above average quality? That rule did not apply because this was an average animated movie. I recommend only seeing this for the amazing animation!",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

great,"Cars is a great animation, if it wasn't for toy story Shrek or Over the hedge this could be the greatest animation movie in the history of film. I watched the trailer it looked quite strange that the plot was about talking cars but I saw it and the animation it's self is the best I have ever seen. As the light reflects of the cars it seems so real and an hour through the film I forgot it was it was an animation. Mater (fanastically voiced by Larry the cable guy) really lightens up the film because all films need a comedian. The only problems about cars is that it does drag on a bit I have never seen such a long animation film before, and in a movie there should be a bad guy or someone evil dude they didn't have any of them. I think the story is very similar to over the hedge if you replace cute animals with motor veichles, because Lightnin and Rj both discover that they can have a better life with the other cars or the other animals. I had a little seeking tear in my eye when I watched it because the village didn't get any customers or any business. On the hold it is a great film watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Pixar knows how to do formula just right- a lot of fun in an ""old-fashioned"" story","Cars is the kind of animated film that, considering how computer dominated the realm is now and might be for a while, knows what it is and is successful almost in spite of what it could've been. It could've been, for example, a clunker of a formulaic animated movie where not only do you know what will happen every step of the way after a while the imbalance of comedy and the rest of the more grounded parts of the story detract from any pleasure from seeing the movie work on its own. Pixar, and particularly its co-founder John Lasseter, are particularly based on the importance of the story- however much it might lend itself to others- and having the best cast to go alongside the most believable visual schemes. Cars worked for me as being something that is akin to those ""old-fashioned"" picture of its kind (which I mean here as a compliment and not as some kind of put-down like others might), where after a little bit in the story you'll know what will happen, but it's fun seeing what's done within the scenes and how unexpected bits of delight come from the characters.Cast-wise, it's actually rather remarkable; this might be the only time, for example, I won't mind a Larry the Cable Guy performance in a film (playing a dim-witted towing truck). Practically every part, in this case, gets the right choices *along-with* having the star power. Owen Wilson is Lightning McQueen, who has a big ego as an up-and-coming race car driver. He gets sidetracked, however, when getting into a big accident ruining a road of a small, near-deserted town full of quirky oakies and long-forgotten types. The amount of supporting talent is commendable- Bonnie Hunt, Cheeck Marin, Tony Shalhoub, George Carlin (was happily surprised at that one), and Paul Newman delivering a good show as a car with a shattered past. Through the story then comes the usual thing- Will Lightnign McQueen suddenly break past his young self-contriteness and find who his friends really are? The answer shouldn't have to be too mysterious to find, but that's not the point that Lasseter and co-director (late) Joe Ranft are getting at.If the film does have a couple of liabilities- most of the songs are my least favorite of any of the Pixar films with the end-credits one the exception; a couple of scenes don't work as well even within the conventions- it's got plenty to admire. As usual the animation team at Pixar gives the audience what they pay to see with this kind of picture- plenty of fantastic sights, with impeccable details with little things like the road itself and the cars and buildings as well as the vast, cool vistas delivered. Thers's also a sturdy, good-natured message behind the story and scenes, with the nostalgia of a period evoked alongside that of the usual 'don't forget what's important' ideal for kids. And as someone who doesn't really watch Nascar or much of that at all (even for the crashes that remind painfully why less than 1% of the country does this), the racing sequences are tremendously well done, especially when sitting close to the screen. At the end of it, I knew I had seen a very good movie, even if in some little ways it doesn't completely POP like the best of Pixar's work. It's also the first really good take-the-entire-family movie of the summer, at least on a level of spectacle and all-around entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great entertainment with a good message,"A friend told me he saw ""Cars"" and the references to NASCAR escaped him since he's not a fan.Still,he said he enjoyed it due to the great animation and story.I'm happy to say so did we. Even though the theater was uncomfortable, soon the movie grew on me and when Mater made his appearance,I was ""hooked"". The voice talents really made this a stand-out,in my opinion.Larry the Cable Guy (Mater)and Paul Newman (Doc Hudson) were my favorites.I don't know if it was intentional when Doc Hudson asked Lightning McQueen: ""When is the last time you cared about anything other than yourself?"" In case you don't know about Paul Newman, he is a caring and supremely generous man, and the founder of ""Newman's Own"" a successful line of food products that has earned in excess of $100 million, every penny of which he has donated to charity. Finally,the message about taking the scenic route made this a memorable experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Good, but not great; strangely unfulfilling","To mix my metaphors, Pixar has been something like the engine on a '57 Chevy: Big, good, and reliable. As many in Hollywood will tell you, the cost of entry in the game is the story, not the money any more. ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" is a good example (though ultimately a wretched green-screen joke, unfortunately) that anyone can muscle their way in with a Mac and a dream. Given this, Pixar's storytelling prowess has consistently rated second to none: Toy Story, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and, in my opinion, their best, The Incredibles, Pixar seemingly couldn't miss a mark in the 20+ years now of leading the vanguard of computer animation. And, with John Lasseter helming again in ""Cars"", such achievement seemed a natch.But something in ""Cars"" is missing and I see a real chink in Pixar's armor being exposed. Certainly it's not for lack of love of the subject matter. Certainly it's not for lack of brilliant animation: Yet again the competition with its me-too Madagascar clones (how many CGI movies do we need of animals escaping from... whatever?) is left wildly in the dust. And certainly it's not for lack of voice acting quality, which Wilson, Hunt, Newman, Shalhoub, et. al handle amiably.It's for lack of story, that ever-impossible cost of entry in the Hollywood game. For Pixar, the master of the story, to miss is a scary proposition.The story, like Owen Wilson's Southern drawl, feels thin and weightless. Revolving around a town of broken dreams, Radiator Springs, Wilson's Lightning McQueen finds a kind of redemption around the motley crew and Doc, its ""doctor of internal combustion,"" gruffly voiced by a joyless Paul Newman, who seems to be constipated--or does his carburetor just need tuning?--throughout.It feels like a kind of harp on zen philosophy--life's the journey and all that--that in the end feels rather dreary. Maybe Pixar's style has come to settling in like a comfy chair where one muses on life over a glass of brandy, but it doesn't work for a G-rated family flick. Maybe this is their ""Godfather III.""If you watch the DVD extras for ""The Incredibles"" you'll see that Brad Bird was brought in to shake things up at Pixar, to consciously get them out of their comfort zone. He did so and did it brilliantly. ""The Incredibles"" didn't fail to key in on the meaning of life, personal identity, and conformity, yet it all worked together so brilliantly in the story that you barely even see it. That, dare I say, is great art.And, dare I say it, Pixar needs to be shook up again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Too long, fell asleep","I usually enjoy what are supposed to be children's movies. Story line was too long in the middle of movie. Character development was good, but often a cliché with regards to stereotyping. If it was 30-45 minutes less, I may not have fallen asleep. 3 yr old nephew wanted to go home before ending. Too much adult DRAMA for cars to possibly talk about. Not enough action between beginning and end of movie. I think Pixar has great movies both children and adults find entertaining.

Great movie!!!,I had the privilege of watching this movie AT the drive-in about 20 minutes from my home.

As with most Disney/Pixar productions we forgot almost instantly that cars don't really talk. There were even some adult level jokes sprinkled in as is typical with Pixar. I was truly moved by the serious message that the movie sends about the need in our society to get where we are going in a hurry and thereby missing the truly great things in life.

"Despite the generic story, it's a good Pixar movie.","Cars isn't one of Pixar's movies which became instant classics. It has its ups and downs, I'll start with the good. The plot is simple, but it has a morale. Our main hero is Lightning McQueen, a selfish egotistic rookie car which made it to the final of the Piston Cup, a Nascar tournament. He soon finds himself in a difficult situation, getting out of it proves to be challenging because of his hot-shot character.The voice acting is very good, we have famous actors voicing the cars, like Owen Wilson, Michael Keaton, Paul Newman and so on. They all do a terrific job, so no complaints here.Now, the bad. First of all, we have no back story for McQueen, how he got to be so good, why, when and so on. At least 3 minutes of back story would have been nice. On the bright side, we see some character development. The plot, while creative in ways, is actually a very common story, with a different approach. Another bad thing, all cars are stereotypes: there's a hippy car which always says something about ""organic fuel"" and hippy stuff, there's an army jeep which always uses army terms. That's not a major flaw, more like a minor one.Overall, the story isn't very original. Cars has great production values, great voice acting, doesn't have an original plot, but still has a morale and a good script.Final Score: 3.5/5 or 7./10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar delivers another classic package.,"Pixar has the difficult obligation of bettering itself with each subsequent movie in order to please their fans. With instant classics in Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, the Pixar standards are set high. I wondered how Pixar could take the concept of talking cars into an entertaining film and original story and characters, especially considering the studio's standards.Though the new Pixar film is not ""better"" than its other features, Cars is definitely up to par with the rest of the classics, delivering yet again a complete package of stunning visuals, a great story, and memorable characters.Lightning McQueen, voiced by Owen Wilson, is a hot shot racecar that needs to make it to California to make it to a big race and fulfill his childhood dreams of winning the Piston Cup. However, a series of unfortunate events lead him to the beat up town of Radiator Springs. Though the town doesn't look like much, it is actually full of an assortment of charming citizens that take great pride in the place they lived in all their lives, its people (cars rather) and its history.In Radiator Springs, the hotshot McQueen learns lessons about the different aspects of life he has taken for granted, among other things: like how to have a good time at a night out with Mater, a rusty tow truck voiced by Larry ""the Cable Guy"" (Git R Done!).Pixar pulled it off. A movie about talking cars actually turned out to be a heartwarming story, with hilarious sequences and dialog. Pixar does a great job of personifying the world of inanimate objects. A lowrider that specializes in Body Art. An Italian tire salesman (salescar rather) obsessed with and only with Ferraris.The movie was entertaining from beginning to end (even before and after the movie). Make sure to get there early to check out the awesome short ""One Man Band"" a worthy addition to Pixar's collection of animated shorts. And after the film, Pixar replaces their blooper gag reel for a new treat that may be the funniest closer yet.How does Pixar do it? Create such great stories with such memorable characters? Besides Oscar the Shark Slayer I can't remember anyone else from Shark's Tale, and I am hopeless in remembering a single character's name from Robots, nor the Wild, but I can name Pixar characters in a heartbeat. Those movies can eat Pixar's dust Lightning McQueen style.No photo finish is necessary to determine that Cars is a definite winner. We can all breathe a sigh of relief that John Lasseter and Pixar yet again prevailed in bringing us another gem to join our growing collection of Pixar classics.

"Lather, Rinse, Repeat","I must admit, I wasn't expecting to enjoy seeing this film. I took my five-year-old nephew to see it today (he liked it...but he's five!) hoping to be pleasantly surprised like I was with ""The Incredibles"". No such luck. Whereas Brad Bird (The Incredibles writer/director) created and edgy, suspenseful, entertaining, and meaningful film, Pixar went back to its insipid Disney formula of mindless ""friendship and love is all you need for everything"" drivel with this one. Yes, the animation was stunning (do you expect anything less than the best from a Disney/Pixar film?) but as is usually the case with Disney films, they find a formula that people love and run it to the ground until it gets stale and people stop buying tickets. The whole movie centers around a civilization of cars with eyes, mouths and personalities. When I saw the previews while watching ""The Incredibles"" last year, I thought ""Wow, now even Pixar has run out of interesting ideas,"" and after watching this uninteresting film, I have to say I was dead-on. I wish Disney would start to look for more original films that aren't so saccharine sweet and incessantly family-pleasing. After force-feeding this junk to our children for so long, its no wonder obesity is plaguing American youth at record numbers. Maybe they should try something new, like telling stories about more diverse characters. Have a real Asian or Latin or African-American person write a screenplay and give Disney some long-needed variety. They can't possibly be content with peddling style over substance forever.

We can always foresee the next scene from the beginning to the end, there are no real relationships developed, no real characters (cars) we can come to care for, hardly any real emotions involved, all of which is very strange for a Disney motion picture which usually thrives on emotions.

The constant shots of racing cars, the frenzied editing, the apparent belief that the phrase ""dadgum"" was funny in and of itself...it just looked like Pixar had come up with their first stinker. I am so glad, no...ecstatic, to say my first instincts were wrong. ""Cars"" has every bit of the Pixar spirit at its core.I'm also happy to report that Mater the Tow Truck, who I thought might end up being the most loathed character since Jar-Jar, ended up being one of the funniest, most heartfelt characters in ANY Pixar film.Every frame of this movie is wonderful to look at, containing all of the vibrant color and rich texture that we expect from Pixar. The voice work is uniformly excellent and, contrary to what I've read in some reviews, the story and script are just as engrossing and imaginative as their other films. Yes, the movie does have a lot of car puns, just like Monsters Inc had monster-ish puns (the ""grossery"", the ""stalk/not stalk"" crosswalk sign) and A Bug's Life had a lot of bug puns (the mosquito ordering the ""bloody mary, o-positive"", but these type of jokes are never the main type of humor. The biggest laughs come from the characters. They stem from knowing their personalities and their foibles.

It's a touching story about the importance of family and friends over everything else and, at the end of the day, always striving to do the right thing.

PIXAR's weakest effort.,"Without a doubt, PIXAR creates truly memorable films, not only for children, but for adults as well: Toy Story (1 and 2), A Bug's Life, Monster's Inc., Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles. (and more since than, but for the sake of fairness, I'm reviewing from a THEN standpoint.) But when I saw Cars for the first time in theaters, I remember walking out feeling two things: disappointment and somewhat confusion.I was confused by the storyline of the film: a rude, arrogant, conceited car is thrust into a town of humble, down to earth cars. He's rude and obnoxious to them, and than changes very, very suddenly. And than we're supposed to care for him? Sure, he does admirable things towards the end of the film, but with a character so grounded in stereotype to change in an instant to another stereotype is something that PIXAR has never done before, and shocks me. I felt no sympathy at any point for Lightning McQueen, or any of the other characters except Mater, who though comedic, is a character with originality and appeal.My disappointment ran so deep because I was expecting, for the first time EVER, TOO much of PIXAR. I expected something heartfelt, meaningful, deep, and ultimately fantastic, and instead I was given something that was shallow, cliché, somewhat boring, and ultimately just a DECENT film from a company that usually creates NEAR-PERFECT film.PIXAR has since redeemed themselves: The fantastic Ratatouille, and three pitch-perfect MASTERPIECES: WALL-E, Up, and Toy Story 3.But now that the next film in PIXAR's canon coming down the line is a sequel to the film that was so dismally decent in my opinion, I find myself somewhat worried for a spotless reputation the company have given themselves.Please PIXAR...prove me wrong.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

I don't see any way you could not be visually stunned.But what's really nice about this film is how director John Lasseter and the writers effectively tell the story and how they pump up the visual feast with humor and sincere emotions.The cars have a definite realistic look, especially with the rendering. The film is also vibrantly colored, making use of a whole variety of shades of dark colors during the race, and warm ones whenever the scenes shift to Radiator Springs. Every single character in the movie is just amazingly made.The story is really nice and it serves much lessons about the value of friends and family.All in all, ""Cars"" is a visual feast outside and an effective storytelling inside.This is movie is worth all of your time and money.It is extremely recommended movie.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"It is OK, but is lacking in Pixar flavor","I saw this movie over two years ago when it first came out, and I must admit, I was slightly disappointed. The Incredibles had just came out the year before and that movie blew me away. Pixar was at the top of their game when they made that one, but Cars doesn't come close to the Incredibles. The movie is about a red car who becomes lost in a small town along Route 66. While he is there he meets new friends and falls in love. The cars themselves aren't very creative. Imagine the Chevron cars with eyes on their windshields instead of their headlights. The movie also lacks in its soundtrack. Instead of original, classy songs like ""You've Got a Friend In Me"" by Randy Newman and ""If I Didn't Have You"" by Billy Crystal and John Goodman the main theme is a terrible country song by the band ""Rascal Flatts"". The song is commercial and very unoriginal. Usually Pixar doesn't put music by popular, well-known bands into their movies but puts something different. That song pretty much knocked 2 stars off of the movie. The movie isn't terrible, but it isn't one of my favorites. If you aren't familiar with Pixar but are interested in seeing some of their movies, check out better flicks, like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and of course.... The Incredibles. If you have kids that are into motorized vehicles, rent this. If you don't, there is no talking to you. I would expect this from a company like Dreamworks or 20th Century Fox, but not Pixar.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Joyride From The Past,"There is no way to be totally unbiased going into this. This movie, in many ways shaped a lot of ours' childhood. The appeal certainly wasn't for everybody but for those who were, it definetley remains among the highlights. I think it's also important to get the message if nothing else. It's classic strong Pixar writing. The amount of effort and passion put into this movie I feel like isn't recognised enough. Don't overthink the plot, charecters etc. Try to get along with the ride and enjoy it and if you do so, I believe there is something for everybody in this movie. It is just a very ""comfy"" movie in a way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Pixar at its not so best, but still better than the rest.","Pixar studios has become such a leader in the animated film department, they have to challenge themselves because no one else seems to want to set the bar higher. Well, they do a wonderful job meeting their own challenge of creating a film completely filled with inanimate objects. Despite the fact that cars do not move of their own free will, Pixar populates this film's world with characters, personalities, and relationships that are tantamount to what car lovers do to their own vehicles.Cars is no ""Finding Nemo"", ""Toy Story"", or ""Monsters, Inc."" Still, it is a solid, enjoyable film with superb animation and enough wit for both kids and adults alike. In the certain to be released (in the not so distant future), Pixar Box Set, ""Cars"" will not be the crappy movie that you have to take thrown in with the hits, because it deserves its own recognition.Making talking cars look and feel like they have real issues and life problems is a massive undertaking. Yet Pixar's smart casting and keen eye for detail in their animation of lead characters really brings this story to life. Though the plot line is telegraphed from the beginning (there's absolutely no question what each car's story arc will be) it is an enjoyable ride getting there.It helps that we, as a culture, anthropomorphisize our vehicles already. So it isn't such a stretch when a car comes on screen, that it already has a perceived personality in our minds. We have personified certain car makes and models with human characteristics and tendencies, and the people at Pixar play into these preconceived notions to situate the cars as characters. It's an auto lover's dream come true.If it weren't for a longer than average running time (for an animated 'kids' film) and a plot that leaves no room for doubt, Cars would be talked about with the likes of animated cinematic greats. Though the backdrops aren't as lavish as ""Finding Nemo"" and the world of make believe not as spellbinding as ""Toy Story"", it remains a steady pace car and keeps Pixar batting 1000.00. i can't wait to see what they come up with next.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
an animated feast for the eyes!!!,"Let me just start by saying that CARS to me was wonderful but I did enjoy FINDING NEMO better. I have yet to watch THE INCREDIBLES (I'm slow sometimes) so I can't really compare this one to that one. Lightning McQueen is a racing car. During one of these races there is a three way tie. The officials decide that Lightning and the other two cars involved (Chick Hicks and The King) will battle it out in a race in California. Los Angeles to be precise. Mack, the truck who is bringing him to Cali, dozes off while moving along while Lightning is asleep in the trailer. That's when four street cars (think THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS) sneak up and have some fun with Mack. This fun causes him to go over in the lane with all the grates in the road to wake you up and let you know what's going on. The bumps cause something to fall off a shelf in the trailer and hit a lever that makes the door open. Lightning rolls out (still asleep) into the middle of the highway. From there on, he rolls his way (or should I say ""Speeds""?) into RADIATOR SPRINGS, a town on the outskirts of a major interstate that everyone seems to have forgotten. Everyone except the few cars that still live there and call it home. Anyway, I will stop right there before I give away the whole movie. This movie boasts awe aspiring, lush animation that can only be done by Pixar. But, like I said, I liked FINDING NEMO better. That's not to say don't watch this movie because it sure is a delight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Could have been better.,"First off, I love animated films. I love what those people can do with animation these days. And I also think that Pixar is an amazing company and they make awesome films every year. But, this year I think they could have done better with the film, Cars. Don't get me wrong, it looked beautiful, but the story just wasn't that great. You could predict what was going to happen at the end. The voice acting was good, but Matthew might not have been the best choice for Lightning McQueen. Everyone else was right on. So, it had an okay storyline, some sweet voice acting, and AWESOME animation, but it was just kind of a let-down after The Incredibles and Finding Nemo. It was an overall good film, but, I think Pixar could have done more with the film. It doesn't deserve the Oscar this year.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
CARS is an Incredible Addition to Pixar's Library,"A hotshot stud of a car, Lightening McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), is off to the Piston Cup Championship in Los Angeles. He literally dreams about fame, fortune and sponsorship. Unexpectedly, he's detoured to the sleepy town of Radiator Springs, somewhere off of the legendary Route 66. There, he discovers that life isn't all about trophies and living life in the fast lane. Some off-beat characters in the new Disney/Pixar computer animated film are Sally, a pristine 2002 baby blue Porsche (Bonnie Hunt), Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet (Paul Newman), Ramone, a 1959 Chevy Impala with as an East LA talking' low-rider (Cheech Marin) and Mater as in ""Tom Mater"" (get it?), a rusty hillbilly tow-truck (Larry the Cable Guy). The all-star cast also includes the voices of racing legends, Richard Petty and Mario Andretti, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. A casting coupe would've been adding Chong (hey, Cheech is already a voice in the movie) as Filmore, the peace-loving hippie Volkswagen bus. But George Carlin fills in those shoes.Cars is a fantastic addition to the incredible library that is Pixar. And just when you think that the geniuses at Pixar can't raise the bar any higher, Cars is absolute proof that computer animation succeeds any previous expectations. Admire the shimmering metallic paint of the cars, the NASCAR-like race at the opening of the film is as exciting as in any recent action flick, and the great palette of colors throughout the movie, mostly visualized through the landscapes and little town of Radiator Springs. Pixar films have always been about the story first, and Cars is no exception. All of the cars have personalities and are characterized to perfection. What's left of the real Route 66 was the inspiration for the computer artists. There is so much amazing detail to admire, it's almost impossible to see it all during a first viewing. Cars is a great looking film, with lots of comedy and some sentimental scenes about fame and fortune; that it isn't what it's meant out to be. Stay for the credits. You'll still be laughing on that drive all the way home.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It's good... but not great...,"I have seen this film a couple of times now and, I have to admit, I didn't like it much at first, but after a second viewing, it's starting to grow on me a little. Made by Pixar, who have made some brilliant animated features, I expected something of a higher standard, but having said that, it's not all that bad. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please re-surface Main Street while I write the next paragraph).Lightning McQueen is a race car; he is an up-and-coming star and has qualified for a race-off in California for the Piston Cup. Loaded onto his transporter, Mack, he sets off for the long trip dreaming of victory. An accident leaves him lost in the desert and he finds himself in the little town of Radiator Springs. Sentenced to re-surface Main Street, which he inadvertently destroyed, McQueen is not happy and, at first, tries to escape. When this fails, he begins to accept his fate and, with the help of his new friends, Doc Hudson, Sally Carrera, Mater, and many others, he discovers that friends are more important than ambition. I won't tell you how it ends, but they are making a sequel.Technically, of course, I can't fault this one, the animation is spot-on. The story telling, well, it does get a bit baggy in the middle, but there is a rather good ending which I found, after a second viewing, partly makes up for it. The performances were OK too, but nothing particularly special. Honourable mentions go to; Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen, Paul Newman as Doc Hudson, Bonnie Hunt as Sally Carrera and not forgetting Larry The Cable Guy as Mater.I guess this is one of those 'almost, but not quite' movies that you'll come back to several times hoping it will be better. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but not quite up to the high standard I'd expect from Pixar. I guess they set the bar very high with the Toy Story trilogy. So, over all, although it's not as good as the other Pixar films (IMO), it's still perfectly watchable and so Recommended.My score: 7.1/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Another winner for Pixar,"Not many movies these days earn applause from a theater audience, but Pixar has done it again. When I saw the previews last year, I wondered how they would manage to create cars with hearts and souls, but they did it. I'm not a big fan of auto racing, so some of the celebrity cameos went a little over my head, but the race scenes were still very exciting. The film is definitely family friendly - though at 2+ hours it may run long for the youngest viewers. The - um - personalities of the characters and the Route 66 background make this a movie that grandparents and grandchildren can both share and enjoy. The artwork - both on cars and the background scenery is stunning.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A surprisingly good film which was well designed, well planned and well executed.","The narrative is a typical storyline of Disney's (- who brought out Pixar a while ago): Lighting McQueen (- voiced by Owen Wilson) is racing in the Piston cup competing against 42 other cars. It is possible to draw a comparison between the Piston cup in 'Cars' to the F1 Grand Prix in reality. Lightning is a novice with bourgeois capitalist ideals. He wishes to win the cup and gain a better sponsorship deal than he has with his current sponsor Rust-eze. Because Lightning is obsessed about winning he (possibly inadvertently) pushes his team's tolerance to the limit. He has no loyalty, no respect for others and is focused on nothing but winning the races. In the 'final' race, Lightning ties with three other cars  ""The King"" (Richard Petty), who is due to end his career after the race and ""Chick Hicks"" (Michael Keaton). As a result of the draw, all three are forced to race again (- this time only as a three -) in a final decisive race in California for the prestigious trophy.The van that transports Lightning to California (Mack) is made to drive all night long so that Lightning can beat Chick to the race track. Mack falls asleep whilst driving and Lightning drifts out of the back of the van eventually ending up in Radiator Springs in police custody. Lightning is sentenced to rebuild the road he has 'inadvertently' damaged (when trying to get away from the police) before his final championship winning race in California. This story then becomes a comic tale of Lightning constantly trying to run away and, at the same time, his relationship with other town residents including Sally a 2002 Porsche, Doc Hudson a 1951 Hudson Hornet and a rusty old truck. Eventually Lightning learns loads of different skills for racing the biggest race of his life and builds up new friends from this redundant town.The film is a gem for Disney even if a little too childish in my opinion. The narratives are well worked and executed to perfection and the scenery is very aesthetically pleasing. There are good interweaving story lines which all have hidden messages behind them and all of which are coherent and make sense.However this film can be criticised. This genre has been exploited recently by other pictures such as Toy Story and Ice Age. In my opinion it becomes a little tedious to see the same thing developed in the same way with a slightly different setting over and over again. The fact it centered around cars also meant it neglected a large range of its perspective target audience. This is to say, in my view, the older generation who enjoy motor racing (- a major section of its target audience,) do not want to be moralised into choosing between benevolence and 'competitive racing' and thus would prefer a film like 'too fast too furious'.Despite the above criticism it is actually very good film and thoroughly worth seeing. However, I'm sure ultimately it won't linger too long in the memory.n.b. don't miss the end-credit outtakes which have loads of jokes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Truly One of the best animated films ever,"Pixar has outdone themselves with this one. I was a little skeptical on how they could pull off another masterpiece with Cars as a theme, and was pleasantly surprised to see that they not only pulled it off, they far exceeded my expectations. They managed to combine the nostalgia of Toy Story with a great story such as Finding Nemo, and made it appeal to all ages from my 4 year old son up through the older generations, who will be pleased with the inclusion of many references to an era gone by. It was also by far the funniest Pixar release to date.I will go on record as saying this movie will easily blow away all previous animated box office and DVD records, and could push for the all time record. I would also suggest that it will also get several academy award nominations, and should win at least best cinematography. Some of the scenes are just breathtaking!

Bypass this wreck of a movie.,"It had to happen. Nobody's perfect (or near perfect), but Pixar has been very close. Until now. This movie reeks of a poor Dreamworks production. Weak humor, too many topical (and dated) references, and a lead that is as weak as the acceleration on a Ford Pinto. Where have you gone Woody and Buzz, Marlon and Nemo, The Parr family, Sully and Stanley, and Flick and his band of lovable losers? You felt for these guys; you laughed at and with them. Not in Cars. I saw this movie with the ideal audience: A drive-in in rural Arkansas, full of kids and NASCAR fans on a (relatively) cool summer night. No laughs. The trucks (and a few cars) started immediately following the end of the movie. Pixar fans know that this can be a great chance to continue the movie, but know body cared. They just wanted to get out of there and pretend the last two hours hadn't happened. I should have trusted my gut about Cars, the feeling of dread that followed seeing the initial trailers and not been suckered in by undeservedly positive reviews. Would they have been this glowing for the same movie if it had been but out by someone other than Pixar: I don't think so. Bypass this wreck.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"OK, I'm starting to miss the good old hand drawn animation","I just watched Cars yesterday and like I said in a previous comment, I am getting more into the animation flicks this year, especially since a lot of those movies are very good and very funny. Cars is the same exception with every animated movie that was made this year, it had some very funny moments, great animation, but it just felt like once again, there was nothing special.Cars is about this one car, McQueen, a very famous race car who is about to win the ""Piston Cup"". But when he is traveling on the road on his employee's truck, he accidentally falls off landing in a cruddy town where he ends up destroying the road. As a punishment, he must stay there until he perfects the road once again, but in the mean time, he makes some excellent friends and a lovely porche acquaintance, Sally.The story is very sweet and the animation was great, not to mention an all star cast really brought the film together, but like I said, just nothing is surprising me any more.

Cars,"But WHY is it great?1. Visually. From the very first moments of the film, my mouth was hanging open. I mean, what the hell? Nothing looks this good. I have no idea how they made the cars look so much like real cars, and STILL make them look so much like characters. And the settings? Having grown up and traveled all over the South West United States (including more than one pilgrimage down Route 66) They captured, not only the visuals, but the atmosphere and character America's Main Street Perfectly. Frankly, if you put real actors in many of the scenes, you wouldn't realize it was computer generated you know, if the landscape wasn't made up of old car parts.2. Creativity. Talking animals. Every cartoon HAS to have talking animals. Only so many cartoons can be about talking animals trying to bamboozle around with humans. Thank goodness for Cars. They create an entirely believable world populated by machines, with tractor cows, and somehow they still have George Jones and Hendrix. The story IS quite predictable, but it's still quite creative. With this level of creative juice flowing in one of John's babies, I can't wait to see what he has in store for further feature animation and theme parks.3. Characters. I have a beef with Hollywood. They have no idea what life in a small town is like. They either try and stuff their ideals and attitude into a western shirt, or else fill America's heartland with dolts, ""we don't like outsiders"" sheriffs, or crazed murderers. Thankfully, Pixar did their homework and featured small town folk as they really are: eclectic, eccentric, loyal, creative with their fun, friendly with visitors, and really worth while. The subtle touches, such as the lovable rivalry between the Hippie van and the Army truck, or the crazy old Model T talking to the memorial of her dead husband (very touching), gives a complex and wonderfully, realistically diverse view off small town life. The same is true with the racing world. Wilson and Newman are, of course, fantastic. It's funny how the gravel in Newman's voice fits perfectly with the rumble of his engine, likewise Wilson's distinct voice sounds just like the high-tuned growl of a race car. Every voice is so paired. Bottom line, you leave loving virtually every character in the movie.4. Story. A little bit A Christmas Carol, a little bit The Sting. The story starts out fast and exciting, like the race it portrayed. The big second act meanders lazily from one fantastic story point to the next, just like Route 66 drives from one landmark to another. I can see why some may say it can get slow, but, as is one of the points of the story, the joy is in the ride. And again, the third act flows quickly and furiously like, well, another race.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Valiant effort,"As soon as I saw the teaser trailer for Pixar's next installment ""Cars"", I just knew they wouldn't be able to pull off the magic again. After actually seeing the film I found out they did, well, kinda-sorta. What I love most about John Lasseter's ""Toy Story"" was it's engaging premise, characters, and situations, wholly unbelievable yet you willingly went along with it. The result? It was immensely entertaining, even moving. With it's on point humor and 'realism', the film succeeded with leaps and bounds, not necessarily requiring an amazing story to launch it into brilliance. I immediately realized that making automobiles with windshield eyes and mouths truly exist in their own world would be a challenge. Many children have a natural fascination with cars, but not really in such the way it is done here. Pixar's usual amazing imagery does ""Cars"" a big service, but in the end, Lasseter manages to keep audiences engaged by humanizing the likes of Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy. You really get the feeling that this film was nurtured with the same TLC as some of Pixar's finest, but the subject matter, and certainly the clichéd story, force the film to to run out of gas. Some of the characterizations are more matching to much of the non-Pixar releases; human ethnicity based and that being the reason for the laughs. Also missing is the correct amount of wit, inventiveness, and hilarious dialogue such as in ""Toy Story"", although it comes in sporadic amounts with hits and misses. ""Toy Story"" of course had nostalgia on it's side and cleverly transformed that into a play representation that both adults and kids could really enjoy. I'm afraid much of our emotional connection to cars are limited. And so, I respect ""Cars"", even though I really think it isn't that good, at least as compared to Pixar's other films. With Nascar boring unfortunates dragged to it's confines by interested fans around America, it is truly a miracle that ""Cars"" succeeds in the way that it does. It's good for one ride, but it's impact is lacking for another spin.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Try turning right to go left!,"With as many phenomenal films on their resume as Pixar has, it is hard to believe that they can keep up the level of quality one film after another, and if you are waiting to see what will be the film that will be the first stumble from them, keep waiting because Cars is not it. Just when you think they must be running out of ideas by now, they come out with something like this and it blows me away every time. I watched Cars having never heard anything about it beyond the not very informative billboards that are plastered all over Los Angeles.The thing that I kept thinking to myself as I watched this movie is that if you took someone from, say, 1985, and showed them this movie, they would be absolutely astounded at how far animation has come. If you took someone from 1950 and showed them this movie I don't think there is any way you could convince them that the movie is animated at all. The animation is so real that there were times when I wondered if they mixed in live action shots.I love the way the movie mixes the super-fast culture of stock car racing with the culture of a sleepy town which has become forgotten because a freeway was built nearby, taking all of the traffic away from the town and letting entropy take its course. Kind of like what happened to the Bates Motel, right?Owen Wilson is the perfect person to voice the cocky Lightning McQueen, an up and coming stock car that is well on its way to winning a much sought after sponsorship. An unfortunate series of events, however, leaves him stuck in the charmingly named Radiator Springs, repaving their road after losing control of his throttle, so to speak, and thoroughly destroying it. He begins by thinking of them not as the little people, but as the microscopic people, not worth his time, energy, or even a thought. The process by which his views of these simple people form the plot of the film, and it is a highly entertaining ride.Larry the Cable Guy voices Mater, the town's rusty tow truck, and he steals the show from beginning to end. I got into listening to Jeff Foxworthy tapes and CDs when I was a kid living up in Diamond Springs (near Placerville, CA), and from there got into the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, of which the only two that I found really funny were Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy. The guy with the mustache and goatee and the guy that was always smoking and drinking got real old real quick. My question at this point is, what else is there for Larry the Cable Guy to do in the movies? I would love to see (or at least hear) more of him, but he doesn't seem to have a lot of range at this point.I think that the most important thing that makes this movie good, besides the animation and wonderful performances, is that there is depth to just about all of the characters. The amount of backstories that are smoothly provided is astonishing, and it gets you that much more into the movie. Also, in keeping with Pixar's image of not being able to curb their own overflowing creativity, the movie opens with another charming short film and, possibly my favorite part of the entire movie, ends with the characters from the movie watching excerpts from past Pixar movies, in which all of the characters are now vehicles of some sort.And one more thing, I would like to nominate the scene with the Italian-speaking Ferrari's as one of the single best scenes in any Pixar movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Movie That Touches Heart and Funny Bone,"As far as pure devil may care humor goes, Over The Hedge is probably funnier, but Cars has good humor, but also touches the heart without being manipulative. The humor is obviously generated mostly by Tow Mater the Tow Truck whose voice is provided by Larry The Cable Guy. And the moral of the story is provided by the relationship of Speed Mcqueen the racer whose voice is Owen Wilson, and Doc Hudson whose voice is provided by Paul Newman. The moral can be summed up by the poet that wrote, ""No man is an island unto himself"". Rarely are our accomplishments the result of what we do alone - most successful people on sports, arts or business have people in the background doing a lot of support work.So this movie works on the level of a humorous story, good moral point, great art work, and last but not least a very good sound track. The remake of Route 66 is very good. Based on these qualities I give the movie a ""9"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not the best Pix(c)ar,"But even so, it's not a bad movie. Yes it is flawed in the sense that this movie might appeal more to the kids and not so much to adults (maybe the car ""maniacs"", but even they might not like this entirely)! But still it is nice to watch this somewhat clichéd story, with a moral that everyone understands.Of course you have to suspend your disbelieve more than in other Pixar movies. Talking toys? Talking animals? You can see that sort of, but humanizing cars, was a difficult task to start with. But they did a really good job with that. Not everyone might agree with me on that, but I thought there were nuances and differences between the cars.

The worst Pixar Movie of all time!!,"I can't believe John Lassiter fell flat on his face with this story. We loved Nemo and Incredibles so we couldn't wait to see it. My kids age 10 & 12 said they saw the previews and it looked stupid. I forced them to go because I was sure it would be great. What a disappointment. All the children in the theater were board out of their minds. The animation was great, but the story stunk. Pixar is also a little preachy in their movies but this was the worst. My kids wanted to go to Over the Hedge but I couldn't bear another movie with talking animals. Now I don't think I will ever be able to bear another movie with talking cars.

Bad bad choice to waste two hours,"Disney had to generate a new line of plastic things. From toilet paper to bed sheets. Probably the Princess thing was too far behind and Hello Kitty was in the future. So you bring three (!) people to cook up a story with every cliché in the book. Well, who cares about the story anyway. So race cars don't have lights. But they get arrested for messing up the asphalt and no word about speeding at night with the lights off in the wrong lane. Talk about a good children story. And if we have to be true to the race car story, why not make it a tractor and a bulldozer in the same story? And for a script that bad you need some seven guys to make it work.Than, you have everything people identify with big Hollywood production: slap over some stars to get somebody who's a somebody on the red carpet and put half the production money in the publicity.And if you think that is a bad movie, just wait for Planes. A reboot in 7 years. Same story to the detail. Same clichés, only the second time you don't have a gold hearted rookie you have the underdog. Oh! Everybody loves an underdog.

Fantastic,"An utterly charming film from the folks at Pixar. I was lucky enough to see a pre-release show at their studio.Wonderful voice performances, a lively plot (highly reminiscent of Doc Hollywood), and brilliant animation combine to make this a great film. One would not imagine you could conjure up pathos or a love interest when all the players are cars, but there you go, they did it.Lightning McQueen's role as the aging car with a past is very well played. Michael Keaton does a fine job with the brash race car who is the lead character.If you don't love this film, you have no soul.Don't want to spoil it, so just be there when it opens!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A nostalgic glimpse of past dreams mixed with the hope for one's future,"With the rash of animated movies coming out (5 of the 6 previews shown at our theater were for upcoming animated features) I'm hesitant to see them. Having seen only one CGI feature previously (Shrek) one might tell that I'm not a real big fan of animated films. But I do think these movies are well done, and Pixar scores yet again, 7 out of 7 based on the story, content and imagery.However, being a certified car nut, the subject matter immediately got my attention. Reading the synopsis of the story and seeing a behind-the-scenes program on the making of Cars, I was really looking forward to it.The act of restoring old cars is a way for many of us to connect with earlier, and more simple times, before progress became regressive as it seems to be now, as we spend more times with our computers than we do with our kids, etc...This movie captures the imagination in ways that also tug the heart. Kids and adults alike, will catch a glimpse of what true friendship, loyalty and love is all about. Everyone will see something in these ""people/cars"" that they will recognize and hope for in themselves and those around them. Don't get hung up about seeing talking cars. I have heard people complain about this, yet they have no arguments about talking rodents... Go figure.As one who has traveled along Route 66 and seen some of the real places the movie used as inspiration, you may also recognize the Cadillac tail fins sticking up out of the desert, and the old rusty hoods of old cars (as desert buttes) lying in the canyon. A real visual feast. There were numerous times that I could not believe what I was seeing was not actual photography. Note the aerial views, especially. The cameo appearances were a real treat as well, knowing the backgrounds of the characters used made it even more enjoyable, such aRichard Petty and his wife Lynda. She's portrayed as the stationwagon they used to haul their kids arounf to the races in the early days. The music was also great. James Taylor's Our Town truly captured the melancholy reality of what once was, and what is reality now for the hundreds of little dots on the old folded paper road maps, that no longer show up on the GPS navigation system in your SUV.Take the kids and see this show a couple of times. Then, take them on vacation along the Mother Road and show them the living history of America's automotive, cultural and expansionist heritage. Or at least pack the kids in the car, pack a picnic lunch and leave the game boys and DVD players at home and drive around your own community and rediscover the heritage of your town. Take your own road trip. You might just rediscover yourselves, too! If you are at all nostalgic for the way things used to be, or long for what could have been, you must see this movie and get a good understanding of what America's love affair with the automotive culture--and America itself, is all about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The True Winner,"While traveling to California for the dispute of the final race of the Piston Cup against The King and Chick Hicks, the famous Lightning McQueen accidentally damages the road of the small town Radiator Springs and is sentenced to repair it. Lightning McQueen has to work hard and finds friendship and love in the simple locals, changing its values during his stay in the small town and becoming a true winner.In the cute ""Cars"" the world is inhabited by automobiles and there is a great message about the meaning of friendship in the wild contemporary competitive world. The hero learns the important lesson that sometimes the true winner is not the one who simply wins the race but uses the heart and does the best. Owen Wilson is amazingly funny giving the voice to the rookie Lightning Queen and it is amazing how some intellectuals do not like this adorable animation. Or maybe they do not have understood the message of the story. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Carros"" (""Cars"")",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Fun for Everyone,"Rewatching Cars last night brought back so much nostalgia, for the characters, the endearing story, and the memes of course. Although that feeling is the primary reason I like this movie so much, I believe Cars stands up on its own merit just fine. The animation is world-class. What else could you expect from Pixar during their Golden Age? There are much more pop culture references and adult jokes than I remember as a kid. The voice acting fits well with the characters and feels fun. The story is sweet and has a good lesson, especially for kids -- don't go so fast that you forget to smell the flowers. The only part of the movie I fail to wrap my head around is why exactly the cars had to be sentient. As SchafrillasProductions on YT points out, there is no justification for their existence over using human drivers that have matching personalities to the cars they drive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
fantastic animaton but too often stuck in neutral,"So who needs an opposable thumb when you can have a technologically advanced civilization built and inhabited by nothing but cars, trucks, vans and a whole host of other automotive vehicles? ""Cars,"" the latest hit from Pixar Animation, presents a world entirely devoid of people but still replete with all the architecture, history and pop culture references we associate with human beings. It's an intriguing concept, and one which the skilled animators bring to remarkable life on screen. The vehicles that make up the cast of characters have been beautifully anthropomorphized without betraying their basic nature as transportation devices. It's certainly a great deal easier for animators to imbue living creatures with human qualities than it is to do the same with automobiles, so the filmmakers are definitely to be commended for their stunning work in this movie (the breakthrough here is in putting the ""eyes"" in the dashboard rather than in the headlights, which gives the cars a friendlier, more expressive countenance than we are used to in animated-car tales).Owen Wilson voices the main character, Lightning McQueen, a self-absorbed, cherry-red racecar whose sole concern in life is to win the Piston Cup so he can bask in the glow of fame and fortune and rustle himself up a higher class of products to endorse. While he's on his way to California for the Big Race, Lightning finds himself stranded in a small desert community named Radiator Springs - situated on old Route 66 - that lost all its business when the big interstate highway opened up a few miles outside of town. The film is a sweet lament for a bygone era when crossing the country was a more laid-back affair and travelers were able to experience the joys of small town life on the way to their destinations. It is in Radiator Springs that the cocky Lightning learns a thing or two from the townsfolk about what is really important in life (and it isn't winning the big race).The town is filled with more quirky eccentrics than one would find in any low budget, independent feature shown at the Sundance Film Festival. There's Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), the town's medic and judge, who seems to be harboring a deep, dark secret about his past from the rest of the world; Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a bucktoothed tow truck who's none too gifted in the brains department but who is sweet-tempered and good-natured and who becomes Lightning's most devoted follower in the town; Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), the sexy young Porsche who fled the rat race of civilization to make her home in Radiator Springs and who becomes the inevitable love interest for our hard-charging, drag racing Romeo. A large number of well-known voices populate the film, including Cheech Marin, George Carlin, Michael Keaton, Jeremy Piven, Jay Leno, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Billy Crystal, John Goodman. You name it - just about anyone who's anyone in Hollywood shows up in this movie. Heck, even racing legends Richard Petty, Mario Andretti and Dale Earnhardt Jr. make an appearance here.It goes without saying that the color and animation are truly top drawer and state-of-the-art (this IS a Pixar product, after all), but, for all its richness of image and humor, ""Cars"" seems to be missing that extra added something that would secure it a place in the pantheon of great animated features. Perhaps, there is a certain sameness built into the concept of having only animated vehicles as characters that makes the movie wear a bit thin after awhile. Perhaps, too, the narrative needs a trifle more energy and ""drive"" (pardon the pun), a higher octane fuel that would make it speed along at a faster clip. Lighting is stuck in this town for so long a spell that we begin to feel a little bit stuck there ourselves. For a movie built entirely on driving, ""Cars"" is surprisingly sedentary for long stretches of time. The one advantage animated movies have over live action films is that they are completely unbound by the laws of gravity, so there's really no excuse for any such film to ""drag"" (again, pardon the pun) in the way this one does. There's a lyrical scene where Sally and Lightning envision what the town must have looked like in its pre-highway heyday, but so much of the middle section of the film is taken up with liquid dialogues and less-than-inspired slapstick routines that the movie often feels like it is caught in cruise control or stalling out altogether when what we really want is for it to race along at a breakneck speed worthy of its subject matter. In short, the film probably would have been better had it used such anarchic chase movies as ""The Great Race,"" ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" or ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"" as its source of inspiration. Then, perhaps, more of the film would have been on a par, in terms of dynamism and excitement, with the astonishing racing sequence that closes the film.The movie pokes affectionate fun at the commercialization of racing, and there is no end to the clever punning that has gone into the naming of the characters and places that populate the film. These, along with the stunning visuals, are enough to recommend the film for any viewer. But, in the long run, I have to say that, for all its good qualities, ""Cars"" is too often stuck in neutral.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Life is a highway,"So I had a fever and just needed a movie that I could just kind of let play in the background without something that I had to follow too much. I have watched Cars a couple of times and it´s just one of those Pixar movies that I enjoy but will never love. It´s decently the one where you could feel the Disney/DreamWorks influence with a bit more focus on marketing and toy sails instead of telling an incredible story. Although I must say it´s still a fun and entertaining movie with a few Pixar feelings sprinkled in that got to me this time around.The up and coming race car Lightning McQueen ties in the Piston Cup tournament with the champion The King and rival Chick Hicks. On his way to a re-race, he destroys a road at a small town called Radiator Springs, and is tasked to fix the road before he can leave.I think the animation quality is turbulent in this movie. Sometimes it looks gorgeous and timeless and really showcase great 3D animation, other times it looks like some temp scenes that just never really got done. It´s weird to see the swinging quality here and it just makes me scratch my head as to why it´s like that.While the story is fine overall I feel like the message is a bit weird. Lighting definitely need to learn some lessons, his a cocky race car that knows nothing about what life is really about and that´s where the movie shine, but the final race is a bit weird and the message about change is also a bit fine, not really explored well. But the idea of being part of something bigger and trust in others is a good message, but the idea of enjoy life there is more than racing is a bit weird of a message for a race car. It also hit me with the Pixar emotions during the Sally and Lighting drive, it was a great little part of the movie to really set things into perspective. The route 66 part I don´t really know about the idea of them saying ""these cars are going somewhere and therefor they are not enjoying life"" is valid and I see the point, but at the same time it is also a part of life to go somewhere and have responsibilities. Mixed message here, but I see what they were going for.There is a lot of plot for plot sakes moments in this movie. The evil cars in the beginning (also racial stereotyping), the way Lightning destroys the road, the way Lighting gets found and the motivation of that character. It´s a lot of convenient moments that makes the movie go, but it´s a bit too movie needs to go moments and it gets a bit too obvious.I really love the characters here. Everyone is voiced well and every character has a lot of character to them. The characters with least characters might actually be the King and Lightning, but I remember everyone else just because of the idea of having a small town of misfits that support each other. Sally, Doc, the Sheriff, Mater, the soldier and hippie, the low rider, the Italians. All memorable and well executed. I love the design of Radiator Springs and I love the little misfit community that they created. The voice performances are also pretty good.The movie is pretty funny and has some great jokes and ideas in it. There is a lot of adult jokes, more than I remember and that took me by surprise and I found it very funny. There is also a bit too much of it sometimes and it can become a bit too much at times, but overall the comedy parts are pretty good.I think the cars world is one of the least coherent made by Pixar. Compared to many of their other universes that seems well thought out and makes sense, the Cars universe just seems a bit unexplained on a lot of levels as to how things work in universe. There is of course always something undefined in the Pixar universe for example the you rules in the Toy Story universe, but this is a bit more elements. This is not really a complaint but it created too many questions for me.Cars is an enjoyable and fun movie that is always being able to be watched. It works and is easy to follow. There is a few elements I´m still not a fan of and I find the movie just okay, but it´s decently fun and well-made overall.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Worth the hype....,"The trailers have not even done this film justice.Cars has a great, multi-faceted, storyline with lots of ""laugh out loud"" moments for everyone in the family. And the animation is glorious. I don't know how these guys do it. There were a couple of moments when it was truly hard to discern that this was an animated flick.My kids (ages 5 and almost 3) enjoyed it immensely and haven't been able to stop playing ""cars"" since we got home from the theater. The storyline is also very entertaining for all ages which Pixar is so gifted at.The characters are terrific and the casting couldn't have been better.

Finally ... a joyride!,"It is almost impossible to tower out ""The Incredibles"", but Pixar writers have managed to come up with a nicely character-driven story for ""Cars"".

Sounds crazy - yes it is but in the end of the movie you'll see your car in a different way. Maybe the masterpiece in this film was to make you feel for a lifeless thing - maybe it's just the superb animation (watch the reflections, lightning effects, dust clouds) - maybe it's the voice over or the music....I think this film is great and it has won my heart.

Cars 2006 Review,"Cars used to be one of my favorites as a kid, this whole thing was pretty nostalgic.
But it definitely doesn't hold up in my opinion, as a whole it feels lackluster especially when compared to the previous Pixar films. The animation is of course great because it's Pixar, but feels nowhere near as innovative as the past films.
The story feels like a huge standstill because of the road McQueen has to fix and doesn't really go anywhere until the last 30 minutes of the film, the racing portions are fun though.
Personally I don't think Owen Wilson is that great when it comes to voice acting, he's definitely not bad but it's pretty average in my opinion. The people I think are great in this are Michael Keatons ""Chick Hick"" and even Paul Newman's ""Doc Hudson"", Keatons performance just seems like he's having tons of fun and Newman's performance feels more serious but full of life at the same time.
And of course, Cars has a pretty iconic soundtrack. You cant think of Cars without thinking of Life is a Highway.

A Solid Effort and Worth Seeing on the Big Screen.,"I saw Cars this afternoon with a group of animators I work with.Plainly and simply stated, I liked it. It was a fully pleasant way to spend a few hours on a summer afternoon.This films is notThe Incredibles, but I found it better than Monsters Inc. and a far sight better than A Bugs Life. The animators did an admirable job articulating sheet metal into being appealing characters, the digital sets were expansive and gorgeous and the lighting was beautiful. It is certainly worth seeing on the big screen. Voice casting worked very well in conjunction with the character design; I believed those voices would come out of those characters -- not something that always works out.John Lasseter has made a play on the heartstrings of the audience and some people will find the film a tad sentimental. Fair enough, but just remember, Cars is officially a Disney film which is the official territory of the family tear jerker. I think its actually good to see that Disney has found their audience again after having lost their way for a while with such films as Treasure Planet and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, that were so scatter shot you couldn't figure out who they were made for. If your memories of Disney films are ones of beautiful animation that make you inwardly admit that cartoon character not only made you smile but perhaps caused a tear to well up, this film will fit the bill.Critics who are already dismissing this movie might have their heads up their tailpipes. Ignore them and judge for yourself.There are lots of great gags, funny writing at a level both kids and adults will enjoy. Too many in jokes to mention, and be absolutely sure you stay right through the tail credits.p.s.

7-0 another winner by pixar,"You know never in my wildest dreams would I see a company or a specific group of people shell such high quality entertainment in all my life. I have thought about long and hard and couldn't come up with a single reason not to love these movies. I think with each movie Pixar creates the greater the story tellers they become.In this next winner the people at Pixar create the story of Lightining Mcqueen a race car with a I'm the greatest thing since sliced bread complex. Well when Lightning Mcqueen blows his two back tires, and the two competiors tie with Lightning a tie breaking game is set to take place in one week in California. Lightning who believes he's the greatest imagines himself in the spotlights and working for the greatest company in the world. He's that much of a prick.We'll on his journey to California Lightning, the moving truck named Mack that transports him is ganged up by tricked out sports cars and causes the back end door to open pushing Lightning on to on coming traffic. Lightning by mistake end up fowling the wrong truck and ends be chased by a police car to Radiator Springs where most of the movie takes place.Due to Lightning's arrogance he is forced to re fix the road that he destroyed. In radiator springs Lightning is introduced to a cast of characters that almost rival that of Toy story but not quite. I won't spoil to much more for the fact you must see the movie for yourself.What makes the movie so great is that it takes a machine a car, and put's so much life into it that you feel for them. YOu feel bad for the town of Radiator springs because this kind of stuff happens all the time in real life. There is also so much great emotion in this movie, You actually feel sorry for Lightning because he is not a mean person he actually has a good side in him that wonders why he doesn't have friends. He actually goes on a life altering journey that proves itself once he returns to California. The ending of the film proves this.I actually will admit that I get emotional in these movies that Pixar creates because John lasseter and gang take story's that pretty much occur in real life, and incorporate them into the genius story telling. THink about you have been that outcast like in Bugs life, You have been forgotten like in Toy story 2, you have had friends who you depend on through thick and thin like in Toy story and Monsters inc, You have the sense of Danger like in the Incredibles, and In Cars you have had the sense of loneliness and have had your world flipped upside down. One thing that you have in all these films though is Forgiveness and Togetherness. That's why I love these movies and feel emotional towards them.Kind of Straying of the point. Cars is an exceptional film with exceptional casting, Everyone from Luke Wilson to Bonnie Hunt to Paul Newman to even the Pixar Regular John Ratzenberger are perfect to a t in the roles. Go see this just to see the amazing visuals and breath taking landscapes and exceptional casting and story telling and think about how fantastic storytelling can take even the most silly premises and end up moving you.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pretty Great But Nowhere Near The Best Of Pixar,"Not the best Pixar movie but still pretty great. Firstly, the animation as usual is gorgeous and incredible with a lot of details in the characters and setting. This movie also tells a pretty great story with great characters with clear personalities and I love the character development Lightning McQueen goes through. Not only does he learn to be a better racer but a better person as he learns to slow down and enjoy life otherwise he will miss the little things and that the destination is just as important as the journey. It's a great message with a great story and a great way of delivering it. I also love McQueen's dynamic between the other characters and this movie has a very exciting opening and climax, showing clearly the growth McQueen went through and it's very satisfying.But I do think McQueen is really unbearable in the first 30 minutes. He's just not likeable and I almost wanted to stop the movie because of him and I think this movie is a bit long. It's one of the longest Pixar movies at almost 2 hours and definitely could've been shortened as this movie is pretty slow. Furthermore, the whole story and concept just isn't as compelling or exciting or interesting compared to other Pixar movies so it doesn't provide the most enjoyable experience.But this movie is still pretty great. While overhated, I'd definitely in no way call it a masterpiece or amazing in any way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A surprising disappointment,"How could you go into a movie directed by John Lasseter without the highest hopes for it? He isn't great just because he is one of the best computer animators around, but because his plots, characterisation and structure are simply sublime.Well, in Cars the animation, CGI work and characterisation is top notch as you would expect (although it has to be said that cars don't give you much to work with in expressing character, and sometimes the strain shows). Oh dear, though, what has happened to the plot? If you want to tread down a staggeringly familiar path of big city fish out of water, cast of ""kooky characters"" proving how worthwhile they all are, and bucketloads of schmaltzy Hollywood redemption, then Cars is your movie. As for me, the final hour at least of the movie unwound with painful inevitability, with very little to keep me diverted along the way. I almost found it embarrassing to watch such prodigious talent being squandered on such a vehicle (sorry). It was noteworthy that a few of the adults in the movie theatre were laughing sporadically at some of the adult in jokes, while the kids were fidgeting and getting restless.If you do go to see it, stay for the credits. You don't get the usual outtakes, but the neat cameos of other Pixar movies (if that is what you call them) definitely did raise a smile.The short before the feature was a Pixar gem called One Man Band. Absolutely razor sharp in every department: animation, characterisation, and wit, with not a single word spoken. Worth the price of a ticket on its own, but it only pointed up how weak Cars is by comparison.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney steals another one,"Looks like Disney's habit of ""borrowing"" from other, original sources has infected Pixar. The anthropomorphic vehicles are cute--until you remember animator Tex Avery's delightful ""One Cab's Family"" and ""Little Johnny Jet"" for MGM 54 years ago. Unfortunately, anyone in a position to fully appreciate this movie (who remembers the American highway between the end of World War II and the start of the Interstates) is probably going to remember them. My family DID have a Hudson. And I have to agree with Roger Ebert: Whereinhell is the Studebaker (they were made less that forty miles away)? Definitely several cuts below ""The Incredibles,"" and can we please lose the self-reflexive humor (the Pixar self-parodies at the end)? All of P's previous efforts were able to stand on their own without showcasing pop-culture references, especially obsolete ones from the fifties. I doubt anyone will get the Cozy Cone joke unless they've visited the Teich Postcard Museum in Wauconda, Illinois.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
I'd give my left two lug nuts for more animated movies like Cars,"*** out of **** starsEgomaniac Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is a rookie race car with, sadly, no friends. He doesn't want a crew chief, and he talks to his re-fuelers and his tire changers as if they are very replaceable dishwashers. McQueen's dream is to win the coveted Piston Cup; the highest honor of the American race circuit. After a creatively juxtaposed tie with two top-notch competitors, a three-car race-off is scheduled in one week in Los Angeles. On the way to the event, Lightning impulsively detours from the interstate and - via historic Route 66 - ends up in the bygone town of Radiator Springs, where he is impounded for hot-rodding and is consequently delegated to perform community service by repairing a road he damaged. He also meets new friends who, over time, humble him. The most influential are a sexy Porsche named Sally (Bonnie Hunt), a rusty, redneck tow-truck named Mater (Larry The Cable Guy) and a mentor Hudson named Doc (Paul Newman).Last year, I wrote a review for Over the Hedge. It wasn't favorable. In fact, it was downright sarcastic, mostly (in my opinion of course) because of its failure to deliver nuggets of humor that all ages could profit from, and for lacking a sense of adventure. After watching Cars, my confirmation of the downward spiral of animated films has been reversed. This is a magnetizing movie that has set a new bar in computerized craftsmanship, right down to the tiny flickers on the burnished cars. It is also charming and simple in character development and in teaching lessons in narcissism, friendship and humility. It plays as if shot with a camera. There are aerials, dissolves, fades, cutaways, pans and reverse angles. The characters are humorous and warm. Cars is not a movie that is occasionally ominous. There are no antagonists that exude doom (The Lion King, The Shrek films). The conflict is McQueen's journey to morally become a better car, which is good enough to take us along for the ride...under clear blue skies and crystal clear starry nights.Bravo to Pixar for bringing me back to the light! I just pray there won't be a Cars II. Like Finding Nemo, Cars is just fine as a solo entity. I'd hate to see it descend into a botched trilogy as the Shrek story has. What I embraced most about the movie is it takes time to breathe, which, I suspect, won't sit as well with the kids. We see spectacular portraitures of grand desert landscapes, dreamy visions of ""The Mother Road"" Route 66, and best of all, we become intimate with the dusty hamlet of Radiator Springs. At times, we are slowly and comfortably urged to caress a town that once embodied a free nation that no longer exists. Cars should make us wonder, as Americans, why we left behind what once was, to have what we have today. Yes...I believe even an animated tale has the competence and backbone to do just that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
great pixar animation and heart warming story,"Cars, is the high speed story of racing rookie Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his dream of winning the Piston Cup. En route to the championship McQueen gets lost and finds himself in the run down town of Radiator Springs. He thinks he's in hillbilly hell when meets the offbeat characters but soon begins to learn the values of friendship, trust, loyalty and teamwork that hold this town together. McQueen grows warm to these characters and realises that there's more to life than fame, fortune and the fast lane. For the motoring maniacs out there cameo roles include Mario Andretti, Richard Petty and the Formula One champion Michael Schumacher as well as Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson.

"Get Your Kicks ""Off"" Route 66","An allegorical homage to early 1960's televisionDon't be put off by the previews for ""Cars"" (and the cast and crew interviews on the Disney channel) which make the story look rather lame. This is a movie to see the day that it opens, experience it in the company of an enthusiastic audience of first time viewers.No surprise that it is slickly written and well executed, it is a Pixar Films' production, almost a seal of approval for those who want to be sure they get something for their admissions dollar.The animation is great, definitely the best they've done. Giving distinct personality and character to a normally inanimate object is nothing new but it has never been more effective. Not only do the cars communicate emotion, but the star (Lightning McQueen-a hotshot rookie race car with the voice of Owen Wilson) illustrates moments of character revelation and change better than most contemporary flesh and blood actors. They load the movie with just enough automotive insider jokes to let race fans feel privileged but not so many that other viewers feel left out.Speeding cross-country to race in the big Piston Cup Championship in California Lightning McQueen gets hung up in the sleepy Route 66 town of Radiator Springs.Much like Tod and Buz in an episode of television's ""Route 66"", the layover allows time for him to interact with the town's offbeat characters including Doc Hudson (a 1951 Hudson Hornet with a mysterious past and Paul Newman's voice) and Mater (for Towmater-a rusty but trusty tow truck). Although it would have been nice to have included the voices of the original ""Route 66"" stars Martin Milner and George Maharis, there is enough here to suggest that the baby boomer demographic was one of the film's target audiences.Making it the perfect film for kids to drag their grandparents to, even if it is the first movie the boomers have seen in years. Lightning eventually learns that life is about the journey, not a destination or the finish line.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Lasseter and Pixar hit another one out of the park!,"Once again Pixar has come up with a gem, a non conventional take on a coming of age story that needs more exposure.Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is a self-centered, up and coming race car poised to become the first rookie winner of the coveted Piston Cup, but gets side-tracked in Radiator Springs and learns a life lesson. Along the way Lightning MxQueen is befriended, sometime begrudgingly, by the habitants of Radiator Spring.The individuality and uniqueness of all the characters and the extras is stunning. In it's own unique way Pixar tells the story in a world populated and made for cars. Several cameos (voice) (Mario Andretti, Darrel Waltrip, Micheal Scumacher, etc.) will get a chuckle out of the adults.The animation produced by Pixar is beyond anything we have seen. Some scenes appear virtually ""real"". Keep an eye out for some of the desert scenery and you will spot portions and sections of vehicles in the unlikeliest of places. It is this level of detail that lets Pixar's creative team's love for the art shine through. I cannot wait to get this one on DVD and get a closer look at the detailing in the scenery.As an added treat at the beginning of the movie a Pixar short (One man Band ) was shown.Great for kids from 5 to 95.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Crashed in the middle,"This is a movie which had great potential and could be a great family flick. However, i found it to be a satisfactory film with great room for improvement.There is no denying that Pixar studios have surpassed themselves again in the ability to create such breathtaking animations. In this movie they mastered the shine on the cars, and the reflection on them. It cannot be faulted, and i give Pixar credit for the animation alone.The story is based around a race car (Owen Wilson), who thinks he has it all. Until one day he finds himself in a sparsely populated town in the middle of nowhere. He realises what has been missing in his life, as this close community who work together and care for each other show him. Inevitably he falls for the town attorney (Bonnie Hunt), who once had a similar lifestyle as he did, but gave it up for a simple life.What is meant to be taken away from this film is that having every material aspect in your life fulfilled doesn't make you happy. In the end it's the simple values which make one truly happy. It may be seen as an attack on consumerism and materialism in our modern day world, but then the Disney corporation promote the opposite of what the film's message is trying to say.I took it for what it was though, and went into the cinema with an open mind. It was spectacular at the beginning, and looked promising.

this one gets an excellent rev-view,"the theatre was filled mostly with small boys, jumping up and down trying to claim the 'best' seat until the film started. when it did, the small boys sat quite still eyes glued to the screen and jaws probably gaping. i'm guessing at that - my jaw was gaping anyway. the animation is 'right there' - you might not get the smell of the 'greasepit' but you do get the roar of the crowd. i had heard a reviewer say it had been a stretch to believe the cars as characters - not if you buy into it. it is entertainment, car culture, scenery reminiscent of Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner, action of all sorts, visual and verbal puns, and if you're not a race car fanatic, it is still really clever yet it has a loving touch. the small Pixar movie at the beginning is a treat as always. pay attention to the whole movie then sit through the end credits - the very end is worth it. there is a long-ish bit in the middle, perfect for a bathroom break, but boring to sit through and could have been shortened - otherwise, an excellent story and up to the Pixar standard (vroom-vroom!).",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Another form of 'existential road movie'...,"There's something very nostalgic in and about ""Cars"", starting with its very concept: cars living and behaving like humans, it's a fun idea but not revolutionary. To those who might not be familiar with it, it had already been efficiently used in a Disney cartoon about road rage and a Tex Avery's cartoon about a father whose son dreamed of being race car (ironically, Avery would do a similar cartoon about planes). Now it's one thing to make short cartoons out of such gimmicks but how does that stand for a ninety-minute feature? Well, I guess not so bad when your name is John Lasseter.Still, watching ""Cars"", I couldn't tell whether it was the most ludicrous or greatest idea ever, I mean, the universe where the film is set is like a human world as we know it, it has roads (obviously) but also buildings, which leads to the question, who built these buildings? But don't you dare start asking question, if you ask yourself how they make cars, you'll never know if it's on a technical level or if you're a baby car asking your parents. Which leads to the question, yes another, these cars have feelings but how do they express them? Granted Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) falls in love with Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) but how will that show? I guess we'll have to accept them as asexual characters like Buzz and Jessie are lovers or Buzz and Woody friends, but at least the toys evolved in the real world.Well, I'll stop here, the whole movie wouldn't make sense once you'd put some thought of it, because it's hard to make lives out of mechanical things and the logic of the film is limited by the story itself, but it makes the emotional achievement even more admirable, it's not meant to be ""Finding Nemo"" or ""The Incredibles"", yet it creates a unique world built on something we love as kids and love even more as adult; cars, so I guess this is why the film was successful enough at the box-office, it hit a sensitive chord. And let's not kid ourselves, from ""Christine"" to De Lorean, there's always been a special spot for cars in our heart, we love them and take care of them as if they are 'persons' and if anything ""Cars"" exploits this privileged relationship we have with cars, from the toys they were to the big engines they turned into.And as a kid, I had plenty of toys and all from different types, if they were all like Lightning McQueen, it would have been boring but to make up my 'stories', I needed every possible model, I had the fire truck, the old car, the police car, the diversity made the pleasure and accentuate the fun of playing with them, and that's what exudes from John Lasseter's film, it's like big men using cars as props to their stories. In fact, it's like a Toy Story played by grown-ups and it works, You have the introducing and climactic racing, the chases and the adventure in a small town in the desert, that used to be one of the most visited places during the glorious days of Radiator Spings, and this is where McQueen is forced to stay until he destroys the road after being chased by the police car.There, the cocky Flash McQueen meets a gallery of colorful characters, nothing new, the goofy tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy), the Fiat Topolino with the Italian accent, voiced by Tony Shalhoub and the old judge, voiced by Paul Newman and who has enough in common with Lightning to play the role he knows best: the mentor. When you have a former race car champion in a town, it's obvious there will be a few lessons to learn for McQueen before he can 'win' the race. When your hero says that he doesn't need anyone, you know it's a matter of time before he changes his mind, but even when we're fully aware of what's going on, the film manages to drive over these clichés in a fun and enjoyable way. It's a rather character-driven story and it takes its time to unfold its nostalgic power. I particularly liked the words of Sally about the way the subway ruined everything, and I could relate to it.Many of my dearest childhood memories involves these long travels, and I didn't ask ""are we there yet?"" because I knew the places we were going to cross, but we hardly come cross these towns because of the subways. Here's another aspect that will appeal to adults while kids will enjoy the visuals and maybe the story, too. After all, ""Cars"", while not a masterpiece, shows you that there are more things to enjoy in cars than moving from a point A to a point B, and that's enough a point to make.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

However, halfway through the movie I realized that this is ""DOC Hollywood"" (starring Michael J. Fox) in animated form. The characters, the situation, the characters Lightning McQueen meets (with the exception of the pig) are so similar. Of course, there is no race in Doc Hollywood, but then, some of the situations like the way the race ends (that comes from the Great Race) and the sacrifice Lightning makes for the King (from Stallone's Driven)made for a pretty predictable ending.

Personally, I thought this Pixar release was not up to the standard of previous titles turned loose by Disney's powerhouse, with exception to the character portrayed by Larry the Cable guy, ""Mater"". It had it's moments, but was lacking overall. I think a major part of Pixar and Dreamworks 3D animated success has been their ability to cater to a dual audience. Adults and children enjoy these films because there is enough clever humor to please adults with liberal amounts of slapstick to garner the kids attention and all wrapped in a 3D package that is a feast for the eyes.

About those mixed reviews...,"...DON'T believe them. CARS is as good as anything Pixar has produced. It's a big, bright, fun, very American movie.It isn't perfect, and I'll quickly point out the two real flaws I saw in it. First, despite some great action sequences in the first half-hour or so, the story doesn't really get going, and I found it a little harder to get into this little universe than I did for, say, Monsters Inc. Have patience, though, because the story has a lot of heart to it, and the characters really do ""come to life"" as the story goes on.The only other ""flaw"" is that the rendering of Pixar's movies is getting so good that they hardly look animated anymore. This film may not hold the attention of small children, believe it or not.Now for the good stuff... Pixar's strength has always been in presenting great stories. They might use the best technology to do it, but story has always been king at Pixar, and CARS doesn't disappoint here (though as I said, it takes a little time to get rolling). In this case, the story is really an utter cliché, on many levels , and it's presented with a complete lack of irony. This is an old-fashioned Hollywood comedy in a lot of ways. Elvis could have starred in this movie in 1959 if there had been some way to magically morph him into a car. There are some lovely messages in the movie, like the value of slowing down, and taking the road less travelled. The climactic race actually manages to turn a race-movie cliché or two on its head, to great effect.The characters are terrific, with Paul Newman's Doc Hudson rating special mention. Of course Paul Newman would do a movie like this, he's been in racing for decades. Not so obvious is that the car his character is based on, the Hudson Hornet, really WAS a great race car in its day. ""The King"" is based on the legendary Dodge Charger Daytona. And while I wouldn't have cast a Porsche 911 as the female lead (I thought the Boxter was Porsche's ""chick"" car), Pixar veteran Bonnie Hunt's Sally makes a great foil for Owen Wilson's Lightning McQueen.As usual, the art direction is fantastic. I loved the car-forms in the buttes surrounding Radiator Springs (I even recognized a Cord 810 in one scene), and there's a plethora of detail in virtually every frame. I can't wait for the DVD to re-watch and freeze-frame. The cars have very realistic physics for the most part, and like the fish in Finding Nemo, maintain a remarkable verisimilitude.The in-jokes fly fast and furious here (in fact, there's a cute dig at THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, come to think of it). Jokes about cars, jokes about NASCAR (and even a little F1), and--of course--jokes about Pixar. Don't leave when the credits start to roll.""They don't build 'em like they used to..."" goes the old expression, but CARS has a lot of old-fashioned, traditional qualities. It works as a family comedy, as a beautifully-rendered piece of animated art, and as a great tribute to Route 66 and the American automobile. You won't go wrong with this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Cars,"The latest offering from Pixar is at two different ends of the scale, as it is both a disappointment and a success. Firstly, the disappointment: Pixar has taken a well worn genre (the old dog and rookie upstart routine) and instead of breaking through the barriers that constrict the genre, they have merely allowed themselves to follow its guidelines to a tee. It has thoroughly predictable characters and plot line and, at least to start with, the character of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is annoying and cocky as hell. It's not a good start.Yet the film still ends up being a success. Why? Well, mainly because it is Pixar  since when have they given us a bad film?  and they know how to make films that last. Cars succeeds because although it stays within its genre constrictions, it plays with them enough to stay entertained. Add in some genuinely funny jokes and the best animation and graphics yet made and it's clear why Pixar still lead the pack in the animated film stakes.But whilst Cars is a good film, it's not quite up to Pixar's highest standards. Naturally, the animation is staggering and once again resets the bar (how many times has that phrase appeared in reviews this year?!). Yet the story telling is not as refined as you might like. For a start, at two hours long, there is some unnecessary padding that could easily be removed. Also, as mentioned, the storyline is predictable enough so that there are few surprises. This makes the film seem a little more like style over content, which is not what Pixar is about.The voice cast are all suited to their roles  Owen Wilson does cocky young thing in his sleep, and the use of Paul Newman as grumpy ex-race car Doc Hudson is excellent. Bonnie Hunt is McQueen's love interest Sally, and does her job well, but the problem is none of them seem inspiring or inspired. They're good, and they create a comfortable atmosphere, but not a vocally thrilling one. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) makes most of the jokes, and this adds a great deal to the otherwise straight laced story. The thrills come mostly from the visuals  the races are excellently done  and some neat touches are provided but sly alterations to real life (there are no humans in this world), such as a scene where McQueen and Mater go ""tractor tipping"".The character of McQueen starts off as annoying, yet we know this is only because the more cocky he is, the greater his inevitable redemption will be. The story pans out as predicted but because of the magic of Pixar it remains thrilling throughout. So, by Pixar's standard, Cars is (hopefully) a minor glitch in their otherwise outstanding record. By the standards of the rest of the CGI films we have been given recently, it still stands at the top of the pile.Rated: 7.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar's 'Cars' is certainly no lemon,"They's taken us - happily - into the realm of toys, bugs, monsters, fish, and superheroes, those masterful storytellers and technical wizards at Pixar Animation Studios (""The Incredibles,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Monsters, Inc.""), and Academy Award-winning director John Lasseter (""Toy Story,"" ""Toy Story 2,"" ""A Bug's Life"").In their latest endeavor, the team hits the road with a fast-paced comedy adventure set inside the world of automobiles, the aptly-titled, ""Cars."" Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson), a hotshot rookie Mustang driven to succeed, discovers that life is about the journey, not the finish line, when he finds himself unexpectedly detoured in the sleepy Route 66 town of Radiator Springs.During the film's opening scene, an exciting NASCAR race that is as thrilling to watch as it is to wonder at its creative technology, McQueen battles beloved veteran, The King (Richard Petty) and obnoxious cheater, Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton). The surprise outcome results in a special winner-take-all contest in California.On route across the country to the big Piston Cup Championship in Los Angeles to compete against the two seasoned pros, McQueen gets accidentally stranded (by his idiot driver, Mac, Pixar voice-over veteran John Ratzenberger), but gets to know the town's offbeat characters - including prosecuting attorney, Sally (a snazzy 2002 Porsche voiced by Bonnie Hunt), the town judge, Doc Hudson (a 1951 Hudson Hornet with a mysterious past, voiced by Paul Newman), and the goofy, drawling Mater (a rusty but trusty tow truck voiced by Larry The Cable Guy) - who help him realize that there are more important things than trophies, fame and sponsorship.But before he learns this lesson, McQueen, who has wrecked the town's only street, is sentenced to repave the thoroughfare - and he is not happy about it. He hates the backwater berg and all of the supposed yokels who reside there. He even tries to escape several times, but the authorities have drained his fuel. Slowly, however, he understands how much pride the locals have in this quaint community that was once a beautiful haven along that famous American road, even Sally, who has just recently moved there. Of course, McQueen begins to see her in a new light, as well.The most interesting relationship, however, is between the brash young McQueen and the dark mysterious Doc. There is a very good reason the elderly gentleman does not like race cars, but it takes a while before the kid finds out why.The all-star vocal cast also includes free-wheeling performances by racing legends Darrell Waltrip (as Darrell Cartrip) and Mario Andretti, as well as Bob Costas, Tony Shalhoub, George Carlin, Katherine Helmond, Paul Dooley and Cheech Marin, among others. As funny as the situations might be, and as big of a heart as this story has, I was continually amazed at the animation technology. The bright shiny vehicles, the beautiful sunsets, the painted desert scenes and, especially Radiator Springs spruced up in art deco neon. All of this makes ""Cars"" easily one of the best films of the year, not just the summer.It may not be Pixar's greatest creation, but it's good enough for this humble scribbler.P.S. Don't leave before the credits finish, though, as the conclusion is drop-dead hilarious.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A commercial, critical and merchandising success... but with a cliché story.","When it came out, this movie was publicized and sold like hotcakes. It was a fever. A mania. I was already quite grown up, I didn't feel particularly within the target audience that the film wanted to reach, and I was really exhausted from seeing and hearing about the film everywhere, and on any object that could be sold. So, I sacramentally ignored it and all sequels until today.What most surprises and delights in this film are the extraordinary visuals and animations, so natural and authentic that it could be said to be real. The production used all the technology that money can buy, and make no mistake about it, there are indeed millions of dollars invested in the film! The racing scenes, on the car track, are particularly magnificent because all the speed and emotion are really conveyed to the scene, and to the audience. The colors and scenery are amazing too, and the soundtrack, while not being anything relatively notable or striking, sounds good and matches the movie. The film features several big names who lent their voices to the characters in the film. Owen Wilson does it flawlessly and Paul Newman and Tony Shalhoub also do a very good job.Where I really had doubts is in the script. Honestly, it has its quality moments, it's interesting enough that we don't think it's being too childish or being boring. However, it is really a giant cliché: the arrogant and ambitious young man who has to go through a lesson in humility and altruism in order to value others, find love and win the victory he wants. We see this in almost every morally sympathetic movie, with its nuances and differences. This is a problem? Honestly, I think so, that it is not something that favors the film, but it is also not something that should lead us not to see it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wow!,"I have seen this movie twice. The following standout in the movie (1) Animation. Just brilliant. First, the cars themselves. Especially the old models. You even see the reflections and dust raised from the ground. Second, the landscape. Just unbelievable. (2) Very good script. Though predictable at times, but it is nicely paced. (3) Excellent voices. Each of the voices exactly match the characteristic of the car. (4) Good music. Movie starts with catchy music from Sheryl Crow and has very good numbers. (5) Excellent short movie. You have to see to believe these.Two thumbs up for the Pixar team. It is an outstanding production.

So sometimes its the world of ants, sometimes its the world of bees, sometimes monsters, sometimes toys, sometimes robots, sometimes fish, sometimes even panda and in this case, its the world of cars.I think next time they'll be making a film about a bacteria, who also happens to be an underdog.

Good film,"Good film. While not the masterpiece in tone and plotting that had distinguished this computer animation company's nearly flawless track record from countless imitators, Cars is nonetheless another heartfelt, beautiful triumph worthy of the Pixar label. As with all things animated, Cars works best when the action speaks for itself, when the animation suspends character interaction in favor of broad and breathtaking observational sweeps, via the American highway, poignantly harking back to days of old in completely new family-friendly gestures. While the humbling of hot-rod hot-shot Lightning Mcqueen (Wilson in one of his most convincing roles) and subsequent homage to mid west America may not have been pieced together in the most convincing of manners, Cars will still sweep excited children into it's blazing introduction, mellow out with it's sweet and funny character interaction and race past the finish line in a blaze of feel good family entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Amazing.,"I know how they do this, and I still can't believe they did it.Stunning, just stunning. See it on a DLP digital projector if possible.Great characters, story, visuals, and pacing.

I'll definitely see it again, just to see what I must have missed - there's so much going on here, you can't possibly take it all in at once - but you'll get the story and let the scenery and sound just wash over you.As usual, stay through ALL the credits.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Simply a ''good' Pixar film,"Cars appears to be the odd one out in Pixar's initial run, in that it wasn't meet with as much acclaim as its previous efforts. It was still well received by most people, but many agreed that it didn't push the boundaries or really try something inventive like the other films. I kind of have the same reaction, in that I think it's a good film but it's certainly missing somethings that could push to greatness. The premise of a world populated only by cars is a creative one, but it's something that has been done before and even the idea of a big fish trapped in a small pond has been done numerous times by other films. Maybe that's the issue with the film, it does these ideas well yet never does anything special with them.The film features Lightning McQueen, a headstrong race car, who on his way to a final wrecks the road of a town on Route 66 named Radiator Springs. The town sentence him to fix the road, which he tries to do before his big race and he of course learns a lot about small town life. On the surface this is a very simple story about knowing when to slow down, yet that leads to one of the films weaknesses in that it's very predictable. We know that McQueen is going to realise that he's too impulsive and that he'll end up falling in love with the town as well as the cars within it. So there are no real surprises here and you know the turns that this story is going to take which can make things boring. With that said, the methods they use to tell the story are very effective. I think one of the films strengths is its laid-back tone and part of that comes from the story of this small town. It's not often you see Pixar tackle this kind of story and I actually think it's a nice change of pace, while the calmer tone gives the film a lot of charm.Lightning McQueen is a different kind of protagonist for Pixar and again it's nice to see them do something different. He's reckless and arrogant yet it's clear that most of that comes from the racing environment, while he is willing to learn and change which still makes him a solid lead. His romantic interest Sally is okay, she doesn't have much beyond being smart and bubbly, but she serves her purpose fine. Doc is the grouch with a haunted past and it is nice to have Paul Newman voice him, but he is a bit dull and when don't get enough insight into his character. Mater can be annoying, but he makes a good companion and actually gets a lot of funny lines. The rest of the towns inhabitants are underdeveloped but still fun, such as a hippie van voiced by George Carlin and a Ferrari loving mechanic. The score by Randy Newman is good, but the soundtrack is excellent. It uses a lot of songs that obviously revolve around driving but nearly all of them fit the film perfectly when they show up and give some scenes more of an emotional kick.The animation is once again excellent. It impresses me how well balanced it is. The race tracks are very fast paced and stylised with a real feeling of adrenaline to them. While the beautiful and dusty landscapes of Radiator Springs are simply wonderful to look at, and the town itself is such an attractive looking place that it's difficult not to enjoy being there. It's always nice to see Pixar animate more modern things and they do a great job here as usual. The film doesn't really have a man villain, but Chick Hicks is the closest thing and he is boring. Michael Keaton's tries his best voice wise, but Hicks is just a typical mean rival and is only here for the morale to be hammered home some more. The whole concept itself is also an issue in that nothing about it is ever explained. We don't know where these cars came from or how they even do simple things like go to the toilet. Though I guess that's more of a problem with the idea not the film.All in all Cars is another fun and easy to enjoy Pixar effort. I certainly agree with most that it isn't up to Pixar's usual high standards and I do feel that is because it doesn't try to really push itself in new directions. It sets up its story, as well as its morale, and just follows it by the books without challenging our expectations. Saying I do think it has more than enough going for it. Its lead is different to the norm, the many side characters are distinct, the animation is superb and it is enjoyably laid-back. Sometimes it is nice to have a film to concentrates more on life in a small place and seeing Pixar tackle such a subject means it is never boring. So while certainly not one of its best, Cars is definitely a very enjoyable piece from Pixar.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Surprisingly deep, and wonderfully entertaining...","I'll admit it: I was frightened to see this movie. The trailer was ridiculous and cringe worthy. Thankfully, this movie has almost no relation to it's trailer. It's dazzling, fun, and quite frankly, the best movie I've seen this year.We open with our hero, Lightning McQueen (what was his mother thinking?), racing for the Piston Cup. Conveniently, the race is a three way tie so, a tie-breaker is held in California. On his way there, however, McQueen gets arrested in the small town of Radiator Springs. What happens from here is typical Pixar fare: Hero learns to be a better person and make friends. What is more interesting here, is the story, within the story. It's what's implied throughout the movie; the surprisingly deep story about how society has become too fast paced. It's about taking things slow and stopping to smell the roses. That is the great triumph of Cars' screenplay; the surface story serves only as a Trojan horse.This entire movie meshes perfectly. Everything, the music, story, acting, direction is all wonderful. More amazing than anything, however, is the animation. It's jaw dropping on more than one occasion. Everything from the dirt flying off McQueen's tires, to the car models themselves (besides Pixar, who else could make a car replica of Jay Leno look so much like him?) is fantastic. It's simply dazzling.There are so many scenestealers in this film, it's hard to tell who's the best. The most noticeable is Mater. Larry the Cable Guy, who I despise with my every breath, gives an honest and hilarious performance. It's an amazing feat that he won me over. While Mater is the most noticeable character, he's certainly not the best. Owen Wilson (another one I hate) was excellent as McQueen as well. He's just enough of a jerk starting out, so at the end of the film, you're really glad to see his character progression. My favorite character was Luigi, Radiator Springs' body shop owner. Tony Shalhoub gives a wacky, over-the-top performance that I fell in love with. Bonnie Hunt is nice, but her brilliant comedic talent is woefully underused. I'm a little upset that she had to play the straight person. Another one to mention is Paul Newman. He's very nice, and very subtle here. Excellent job, Mr. Newman.Movie like this don't come around often. When something this good comes around that appeals to both kids, and adults, jump on it. While I love Finding Nemo to death, the rest of Pixar's films are kids movies. Cars, however, is not. In fact, it leans more to side of being a G rated movie for adults, that kids happen to like. Even if you don't have children, Cars is a dazzling ride that's not to be missed by anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Highly Underrated,"When going to watch Cars for the first time, I did not have the highest expectations for it. People say that this is one of Pixar's most disappointing movies, but after watching it I could not understand why this movie was getting a lot of criticism.The story focuses on a race car named Lightning Mcqueen whose dream is to race and win the Piston Cup. He's rather arrogant and does not have friends because of his unlikeable personality. The film starts with Mcqueen in the big race going for the Cup but after a three way tie, the race is set to be raced again in a few weeks. During his trip to the race, he gets lost and ends up in Radiator Springs, a small town which has lost its business due to a highway which bypasses the town. Mcqueen meets a whole lot of interesting characters here that teach him the true meaning of friendship.Most of the reason why I think this film is so criticised is because of its long running time of almost 2 hours. Although the film is a little slow during the middle, I feel it is necessary for the development of all the characters and to show the story of Radiator Springs.Pixar's Cars is a very enjoyable film with plenty of laughs and an emotional scene in which I couldn't help but shed a tear.

"Well short of Pixar's greatest, but worth it all the same","Widely held as Pixar's weakest, Cars (John Lasseter and John Ranft, 2006) is unexceptional but easy-to-take, with a well-worn plot given bright treatment. As has been said before, it's Doc-Hollywood-but-with-cars, as a speedy, superficial young buck - race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) - gets stranded in a small hick town where the residents' goodheartedness and easy-going nature start to work their magic. As in the Michael J. Fox-starrer, our conceited hero is asked to repair the damage he caused during his noisy arrival, and ends up dating a female lawyer who wound up in the area after an unhappy stint in the big city. (Having said that, Doc Hollywood itself is a hybrid of Local Hero, The Secret of My Success, a Dr Kildare, and a complete mess, so it's hardly the essence of originality.) Cars is well-short of the studio's best: Up, WALL-E, Ratatouille and Monsters, Inc., but the usual spark is periodically apparent, particularly in the treatment of tractors and a hysterical epilogue in which Toy Story, Monsters, Inc. and A Bug's Life are given a new spin (pun intended). Elsewhere, colourful characters and cut-to-the-chase races compensate for the sometimes slack narrative and muddled motor-y message. Nice James Taylor song, too.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A classic ""sports movie"" framework with some Pixar charm.","In terms of early Pixar films, I always felt Cars (2006) was a bit of a step backward for the animation company. I've never been much of a ""car guy"" and I find NASCAR racing a bit silly. Still, Pixar's focus on the story helped make this a solid sports movie. After all, the timeless ""mentor teaching a cocky up-and-comer"" narrative works for a reason. And while I'd love to see other Pixar franchises get as much love as this one, I can see why it's done so well for its target demographic.Cars is an excellent movie for freeze-frame analysis for the number of puns and visual gags alone. Granted, there are also a lot of disturbing extrapolations if you spend a significant amount of time thinking about this universe of sentient vehicles. Still, the growth of these characters helps make this movie into something more than just a vehicle (har har) for selling toys to kids. Unfortunately, these characters can also be quite annoying. The bravado of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is only slightly bearable when compared to the unabashed stereotypes of the other vehicles who live in Radiator Springs.Perhaps the best compliment I can give a movie like Cars is that it made me care about the outcome of a NASCAR race. While McQueen might have been a victim of his own hubris, the villain characters were definitely worse. For an early Pixar film, the personification of vehicles still feels a little weird to me, but the advancements in CGI lighting and reflections were definitely on full display in this animated movie. In the end, regardless of my feelings about this movie, my toddler likes watching the ""car movie,"" and who am I to say no to her?A classic ""sports movie"" framework with some Pixar charm, I give Cars 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A unique concept translation!,"This animation movie is by far the best I've seen in my life. The very concept of using cars with human emotions was fantastic. The rapid pace at which the movie progresses and the end with a sting in the tail was just too good to resist! Lightning McQueen, has demonstrated almost every human passion and emotion during the short duration of 1:35 hrs. ""Turn right to turn left"" was not just a technique proposed by the doc but also a straight hint to the audience. When things don't seem to work as they should, the exactly opposite method to do it can work wonders. I think this very statement was the catch-phrase in the movie. The animation and computer graphics are taken care of with immense detail. At times it felt as if the close-up shots of the revolving wheels were actually close-up shots of a real car wheel. With a nice storyline the movie deserves to top the chart. In short, a movie that truly deserves to be seen by one and all!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Much closer to the fast-lane than it is the hard shoulder, Cars is a neat and pleasurable animated excursion with an ability to sneak up on us.","Cars is a 2006 animated feature from that of the Pixar stable, they of that wondrous ability to seemingly breath life, indeed fresh air, into worlds given radically creative overhauls; in doing so, providing specific dynamics to a functioning and working universe featuring oft-inanimate objects now come alive and living with their own patriarchies and politics. When the process works, it can be enchanting; when it doesn't, the films can often grind one down – Cars is an instance in which the proverbial rabbit is pulled from the hat, and whilst not on a level with their best work, is easily one of the better films the studio has produced. Owen Wilson, lending his ""talents"" behind a microphone but instead off screen, voices Lightning McQueen; a sports car in an eye-catching shade of red operating within a world devoid of humans in which cars may speak; act and, excusing the pun, drive proceedings. McQueen is young and cocksure, a rookie within the career field of motor racing somewhat closely resembling that of NASCAR; plugging away at race after race in the long season and coming to find himself on the brink of winning the elusive Piston Cup, the prize for heading these standings at the end of the year.When we join him, he is at the venue for the final race – the points level between he, the serial champion of the sport and a competitor often stuck with the runner's up spot on account of him. At the track, the stands are beset by an audience solely made up of cars and other vehicles; heaven only knows what might constitute as a Diamond League meeting in this universe. Whilst there, numerous company brands and labels are slapped all over cars; barriers and buildings, but they are fictional and what might have been easy product placement is pleasantly avoided. McQueen races and races well, but rejects the idea of teamwork and guns for all the glory all by himself when turning down a pit-in chance and the allowing of his crew to get involved: it's all about him and his glory.The race ends in a remarkable three way tie between the front runners and a one-off playoff is announced between the three. We build an image of McQueen being somewhat of a vain, limelight loving showoff - a celebrity figure very much enjoying the verbal jousting with rivals and the gluts of attention which fly his way as the new hotshot following this remarkable first season. There is a quieter moment reflecting how far he's come when a certain sponsorship company is revealed to have once helped get McQueen off the ground; his moving onto larger plains and bigger companies whilst leaving the old one somewhat in the dark reiterating this inability to be anything other than self-centred and malevolent. Enter one or two good gags about cars operating within this world both falling asleep at the wheel and attempting to jump a level crossing, at which the trains are as anthropomorphistic as the cars are, and a road trip to the playoff race which goes horribly wrong when McQueen tumbles out of his pit team's truck and is left stranded in the wilds of America.Where he ends up is a small town sweetly named Radiator Springs; his chaotic arrival born out of panic near-enough destroying it. Bossed by that of Paul Newman, lending his voice to a 1950's gag-guzzler, Doc Hudson, and populated by a mixture of stereotypical Italians, Mexicans, louder than life African American women and VW van's whom are hippies, McQueen is caught and kept to fit the bill of the damage. We spot what might happen whilst he's there, although crucially, enjoy those eventual places it takes us. Life away from the glitz; glamour and gaudiness of the track-side, track-set existence sees McQueen come to recognise the simpler, more down to Earth ways of certain others. He comes to make friends with a tow truck named Mater, whose friendship is one of an honest and grounded nature away from the strictly businified racing world ties. Through an equally young-as-McQueen-is Porsche named Sally (Hunt), we observe a strong and empowered female presence in the town whom achieved a fair amount in a specific career field herself; McQueen's interaction with her is a joyous observing of him manoeuvring away from fatuous pit-lane girls and Hollywood socialites and towards more grounded people.Where one might say the Tom Tom navigation device is set firmly to where it's going to head from an early stage, we are surprised by the effect Cars comes to have on us. We foresee specific frameworks, anticipate character shifts and yet it comes to engage us to the level it does, often even coming across as quite moving. One could criticise the narrative frameworks for these things all day long – it is a churlish, fruitless exercise. Is 2009's ""Up"" much more than a film about a man coming into contact with the young boy he never had in life running in parallel with a father-figure that aforementioned boy struggles to find? Likewise, narratively speaking, is Toy Story much more than two binary oppositional components in character form thrust together and forced into recognising both one other as well as their own natures? Is Finding Nemo much more than a buddy-pic road movie that happened to be set underwater? In their barest forms, most of what overlies these films are sound and routine – when unfolded around great adventure and exuberance, they exude degree of charm difficult not to get caught up in. It happens again here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The Best Movie So Far This Year,"The first half of 2006 has been a very lackluster year at the movies. There hasn't been too many big hits this year. So far, ""The DaVinci Code,"" although it broke the $100 million mark, was a confusing mess, and I found that when I read the book to prepare for the movie, the book moved even faster than the movie itself.But we can always rely on Disney/Pixar for a solid midyear hit. This year, it's ""Cars,"" and like many other Pixar movies in recent years (""Monsters Inc.,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" and ""The Incredibles,"" to name a few), it has every Pixar element to offer - a great big-name voice cast of stars from varied backgrounds and the cast voice characters that best match their personas, colorful, cheery animation, and a story that evokes emotions. Pixar just never disappoints. We hope that Pixar, whether sided with Disney or not, just gets more hits flying.In ""Cars,"" the main character is Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), a self-absorbed red racing car that after departing a big NASCAR race, travels the legendary Route 66 and gets stuck in a small, forgotten town called Radiator Springs. He makes friends and learns various lessons about life, love, and the meaning of being a car. This sounds all-too familiar in the ""Toy Story"" movies, which deal with the philosophical meanings of toys' lives, but now the story is transferred to cars. He makes friends with the hillbilly tow truck Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, a comic hoot), the pert blue Porsche Sally (voiced by Bonnie Hunt), and in a strong performance, a has-been race car Doc Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman, a race car driver in his own right as well as a legendary actor.) Mater delivers the laughs with that southern accent, Sally delivers common sense, and Doc Hudson tells Lightning McQueen, that he once crashed, and there is more to life than just being a race car. Once lessons are learned, Lightning McQueen must go back for one more big race.Other actors voicing colorful characters in small but pivotal roles are Cheech Marin as the Hispanic car Ramon, Tony Shalhoub as the hilarious yellow car Luigi, and Michael Keaton as Lightning McQueen's rival Chick Hicks, who ties with Lightning McQueen in the race in the beginning of the film.I thought it was amusing to see that at the race track, everyone is a car.

"Great ""Adult-writing"" Animated Feature","Kids will love this but adults even more. Written much in the vein of the old '60s Rocky & Bullwinkle TV shows. Great fun for all but excellent inside jokes and comments normally only understood by adults.Voice characterizations could not have been better. Background animation was gorgeous.

Good Movie,"This is my favorite movie. I often watch it with my little brother. there is not human being in this movie but there are many characters of marked, so I'm not bored watching it all the time because they are like human. McQueen is a genius. He takes no account of advice for him by his teammate and don't thanks for them at first. So he is so bad. Therefore, he seems to be lonely. However, he changes himself by the gentleness of cars little by little at the place where he gets lost and reaches by chance. I like such movie because I can watch the figure which the hero grows up.

"Hey, cars are a lot like people, maybe we could learn from them","The people at Pixar are geniuses, plain and simple. Part of what makes them so wonderful is their attention to detail. From gravel bouncing along the side of the racetrack as the cars zip by, to the way dust moves when driving on dirt, to the flecks of grime on the car and rust on the fence, each detail is meticulous. They also have an eye for the ironic, tongue-in-cheek and self-deprecating humor. It is obvious they enjoy making these films, as only a labor of love can succeed on so many levels.That said, this isn't my favorite Pixar film as the story, stripped of its humor and auto setting, was less inventive than some. Lightning Mcqueen (Owen Wilson) is a rookie racer and pretty full of himself. He ends up lost in the dying town of Radiator Springs where he finds what he is really made of and falls in love with a hot Porsche. Also, he learns a little something from a former racer, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) who has become bitter with the outside world. Doc softens, Lightning reforms and becomes a kind, compassionate car and succeeds at everything he's ever wanted, queue the happy music. Despite the predictability of the story, the way it was told makes it well worth it. As always, make sure you watch through the end credits.This movie is like a vanilla éclair. It looks beautiful sitting there on the shelf at the patisserie. The frosting has been applied with care and the éclair arranged just right in the little paper holder.

The filling has the right consistency, but it is vanilla flavored, and the vanilla flavoring is just a bit weaker than you like, and you do prefer chocolate to vanilla, but it's still a good pastry. 7/10http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Disney and Pixar - take a bow,"I am incredibly reluctant to score a film perfectly as there is always something, big or small, that bugs me in any cinematic experience. However, this was NOT the case in ""Cars"".Prior to viewing, I expected a below-standard Pixar production that was good but not great, however I could not have been more wrong.I'll begin with the visual and audio utilisation - the animation is (as you'd expect from Pixar), tremendous on every level - wonderful scenery and character models ensure this is an aesthetic treat. In terms of audio, sound effects are great and the soundtrack is beyond fantastic.Characters (an important aspect of any family film), are found in positive abundance here. Stereotypes are present but not overused, every character is easy to relate to (despite the fact that they are cars), and the emotions of every character are truly emphasised; nobody in ""Cars"" is anything short of vivid.The plot itself is perfectly paced; the story-telling is easy to follow, yet allows room for twists, turns and speculation to a perfectly adequate degree. In addition to this, the script is brilliant; there is plenty of humour to accompany some equally emotional outbursts. The way in which Disney and Pixar make us feel empathy for animated vehicles is intelligent and a fine achievement.Overall, this is one of my favourite films of all time, and it is, in my view, able to compete with any other piece of cinema, from ""Casablanca"" to ""Shrek""; the magic of Disney, alongside the high production values of Pixar, in accordance with the sheer brilliance of this movie, ensures that it is a must-see for anybody.

Pixar makes sure something called Lightning McQueen is on the Chrissy list of every pre-teen.,"A hotshot rookie racing car is sidetracked to a backwater town and must find a way to get back to the big city in time for the final race in the seriesEven though Cars is by far the weakest entry in the Pixar line-up it is by no means a bad film. It has some funny jokes, likable characters and some genuinely exciting racing sequences that are both breathtaking to look at and well paced.The problems that it does have are the fact that many of the peripheral characters are there to provide humour for the adults and not the kids, which would be less of a problem if they were simply funnier, that the overriding theme through the entire film is buried under a win at all costs motif that most single digit aged kids will take away, and it is just too damn long for kids and adults.Tell your story, sell your toys (I swear Cars sells more spin-off toys to young boys than Toy Story and every other Pixar movie combined) and finish up.Oh and leave the unnecessary ""name"" songs and supposedly clever guest voices (Bob Costas, Jay Leno, Jeremy Piven) to the Madagascars and Shreks.What you hope kids will learn: Winning isn't everything, fairness is.

Life in the Fast Lane,"This is an amusing film about cars. That cars are the subject and main ingredient is to say that icing on a cake is mere frosting. This is Disney's tribute to racing legends, enthusiasts, pit crews and aficionados animated to instill human viewers with worthy traits about living, learning and competing in and out of the fast lane. Within the speedy story is a moral obligation about achievements, success, honor and respect in general. How one is treated and vice versa, how we treat others, even if we are made of metal. Each of the autos in the film ""CARS"" has a unique identity and is brought to life by a plethora of legendary voices. Consider for example names like Paul Newman as 'Doc Hudson', Michael Keaton as 'Chick Hicks', Cheech Marin as 'Ramone' and Jay Leno as 'Jay Limo' lines the star studded film with superb talent. Added to them are legendary racing names like, Dale Earnhardt Jr, and Richard Petty and of course Owen Wilson as the voice of Lightening McQueen.

A delightful throwback,"Cars is an exciting coming of age story about Lighting McQueen, a cocky race car who learns the essence of life when he mistakenly runs into the small town of Radiator Springs.
As a Pixar film, a lot of people argue that this doesn't hit the same level as their previous films, and while I do believe that to a small extent, I think it's a great movie! The characters are deep and the story is intriguing. As a kid this was probably my favorite film ever, so maybe some childhood nostalgia is mixed in with this review.
At its core, this movie isn't about racing, which is what I adore about this movie. It's a typical coming of age story except it's told with race cars.
However, this film isn't super spectacular like other Pixar films, because it fails to obtain the magic and joy within them, and instead focuses on appealing to Children ie: a bunch of potty humor.

A Must See if you are a Car Nut,"I am not usually attracted to animation features (the last one I saw was Toy Story) but Cars had so much pre-publicity in my car magazines - Road & Track, Automobile - one article even dealt with getting Porsche's approval for Bonny Hunt's ""character"", well, I had to see it.What impressed me most was the attention to detail. While I am not a rabid NASCAR fan even I know Richard Petty's Plymouth number 43 (voiced by the King himself) , and while watching this animation can easily see why NASCAR is so popular. The engine sounds were so realistic & matched to the vehicles.CAUTION: If you miss even 15 seconds of dialogue you'll miss a clever pun. Even the motel in the movie is a clever take off on Rt 66's famous Wigwam Motel.There are no people in the movie - only cars and other vehicles. It is a world of talking vehicles.And they cleverly made the cars movement believable using a lot of suspension travel.The car's voices were so well matched to the car models! Cheech Marin is the voice of a low rider 59 Chevy Impala, a cameo by Arnold Schwartzenegger with an H1 Hummer, Michael Schumacher in what else but a Ferrari, and George Carlin in a 60s VW Van complete with peace symbols.

"A bit disappointed, but then I've been spoiled by Pixar's Success","Not the best Pixar film (but then again any film following in the wake of The Incredibles would have a hard time) I found Cars to be pleasant but rather uninspired at times, a bit long in the middle, and overall recycled as far as ideas are concerned.It seems that Hollywood has an obsession with following in the footsteps of the Golden Age directors such as Frank Capra whose works have become formulas for generations of stories that seem to fixate on the goodness of the common man, pitting the virtues of one group against the corruptive influences of fame and the prospects of fortune. Anyone who has seen Mister Deed Goes to Town, Mister Smith Goes to Washington, etc. (even The Majestic if you want to throw that in for good measure), has probably seen these age old themes used over and over again. These are good themes, and have very simply messages about the importance of having one's priorities straight, but seeing it one more time in an animated film seems rather wasted.Perhaps it is nostalgia that drove this piece -- an easy temptation for any writer to succumb to (look at Akira Kurosawa's last few films for future reference) but somehow seeing this film it made me feel a bit cheated.Granted, like I said before anything that came after The Incredibles would have to be stupendous to match the amount of anticipation that probably developed in the last year and a half so it is fair to say that this is a very entertaining film.But let's face it: if you are spoiled with the amazing quality of the previous Pixar films it will be easy to see this film as a bit of a letdown.

More Disney than Pixar,"I saw Cars with my seven-year-old daughter - we are both huge fans of all the Pixar classics and perhaps for that reason our expectations for Cars were too high. As it was, we found this effort a total let-down. The plot is tired and loaded with hackneyed sentimentality. You could see where it was going almost before it got under way. The characters were little more than one-dimensional clichés and the dialogue was so lazy, it seemed to have been written by robots. There was just one redeeming gag that made me laugh out loud, a Shakespearean allusion that would have been over the heads of all the kids in the audience, and probably would have been wasted on most of the adults! What on earth has happened to the all-round brilliant Pixar of Bug's Life, Toy Story and Finding Nemo?

See this movie on Disney+,"Cars ominously evokes some of the characteristics that made A Bug's Life the most mundane and uninspired production in Pixar's filmography, directed by Pixar head John Lasseter, who supervised Pixar's first three films (the amazing Toy Story trilogy and the disappointing A Bug's Life) but hasn't directed since. One thing is the complete lack of human people and a cliched tale of a besieged community banding together to conquer adversity.""Cars"" has a unique creative groove and emotional core that distinguishes it from Pixar's previous works. The film's sense of time and place, its nostalgia for 1950s little towns, and its breathtaking visual splendor raise it to the level of art and entertainment.The greatest danger posed by film is the creation of an automotive parallel universe devoid of drivers. Squinting at light fixtures in this universe reveals them to be little VW Bugs. Even the surrounding buttes and cloud formations reflect the film's autocentric setting.Why is it important that humans aren't present? The non-human worlds of the Toy Story films and Monsters, Inc. Provided an emotional access point for viewers by picturing how toys and monsters would feel about us, therefore reflecting our feelings about them. Cars could have been an exciting way to tap into the great American love affair with the automobile if the filmmakers had focused on the automotive aspect of the relationship, but they didn't. What motivates a vehicle if there are no drivers to care about? The same things - or rather, the same set of things - motivate their human counterparts, as you might think.Take, for example, Lightning McQueen, who has appeared out of nowhere to be a Piston Cup spoiler. McQueen, like any arrogant, callow up-and-coming young athlete feeling his oats, is eager to dethrone the big dogs at the top - and to reap the benefits of stardom, including a hefty new endorsement agreement with Dinoco Oil. (One of many Pixar inside jokes is the name of the petrol station where Woody and Buzz tumbled out of Andy's mother's car in Toy Story.) McQueen is arrogant and self-centered, and he shows no allegiance to his pit crew or his stodgy current sponsor, Rust-eze, which caters to a less-than-glamorous clientele.Film is a moving elegy to a bygone era. The plot features themes that are both familiar and corny, with the most overt resemblance to Michael J. Fox's 1991 comedy Doc Hollywood. Cars, on the other hand, has a uniqueness that goes beyond the usual lip regard to small-town virtues. Cars is full of nonsense, but it's also quite endearing. The story has been fine-tuned to perfection, and the directors have a few surprises up their sleeves.

"Better than ever, good as always","Man, I cannot believe Pixar. I felt they were going to start to slip when they released The Incredibles and I thought it was just another superhero movie, when it turned out to be an exploration of discovering your identity and knowing who you are and what you can do. Then I thought Cars looked kind of uninteresting and reviews that called it derivative didn't help. However, though this movie may be a bit derivative, it still is a huge helping of Pixar heart.Everything about this movie exceeded my expectations. I thought I'd hate the characters, especially Lightning and Mader because Lightning is selfish and Mader is voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, but I ended up really liking both (and all of the other characters too). I didn't believe Pixar could have made their animation even more stunning, but they did, both with high technological neon lighting animation and gorgeous natural vistas. Heck, I thought the movie would feel preachy, but it still feels very caring.It's also a slight return to form after the Incredibles in that it returns to homages of cinema past and tie-ins to other Pixar works, something that is both fun to look for and shows how much the crew working at Pixar really love their job.

Very well directed and with charismatic and engaging characters and that has become one of the great animations of the decade,"Cars is undoubtedly the most troubled production at the Pixar studio since it began its partnership with Disney. Scheduled to be the last film before the contract was closed, it suffered postponements and ended up going through the transition in which Disney acquired the studio and its director, John Lasseter (Toy Story 1 and 2), became creative director of the division that creates attractions for the company's parks.The development of Cars started at the time of Insect Life, in 1998, conceived at first by Jorgen Klubien and with the name The Yellow Car. The idea is that this would be the next movie to Insect Life, but things started to tilt towards Toy Story 2 and the Cars project was only resumed after the initiative of John Lasseter, who was impressed by a trip he made crossing part of the country on Route 66, hired historian Michael Wallis, a specialist in the history of Rota, and began research for the script. Another obstacle, at the time of its release, was the trailer, which left the impression of a film very much directed to American culture and taste, with Nascar, Grand Canyon racing, country music and Route 66; it is not a wrong impression, but fortunately the film offers more than that.Perhaps here we have the nucleus of the narrative impasse in the script for Cars - which would become shameful in Cars 2 - which is the diversion of the story to a reflective pit stop in the life of dear Lightning McQueen. Although there is a constant attempt to integrate the first and the last part of the feature with model learning in Radiator Springs, the fusion between the trendy and futile world of racing and the world that is quiet and full of automobile ties (I meant ""human ties""), but I can't) it was embedded, a little forced in the relations between the characters and the destiny they will have in the final stretch.Superficially, it is an unoriginal and quite predictable film, which starts out agile and intense in the opening race, but gets slow and almost monotonous when it arrives in the small town where it will spend most of the plot. The problem is that exactly what the film wants to evoke, an escape from the mind-boggling rhythm that the modern world demands, a more contemplative and simple look at life. In the midst of all this naive aura, it is impossible to dissociate the sincerity and affection with which Lasseter and Pixar dedicate to each element of the final quality of the film; noteworthy is his attempt to bring some of his childhood experiences to Cars, carrying him with nostalgia.This lesser organicist of the text did not render the values of the work useless, the result of a large team of writers, but they work much better seen separately. Take the first and the last part of the film as an example, with McQueen in the world who pampers and adores him. It is evident that we are talking about two different phases in the life of the character (generic mixture of NASCAR models), but these two parts, despite the intention of contrasting between worlds, do not connect with the almost idyllic ""paradise"" of the animation core, and I'm not talking about geographic composition and other scenarios, because that's obvious. I'm talking about continuity, about narrative. It seems that we are talking about two films spliced by a causality, the first and the last part together and the middle part alone.Looking closely, however, the story changes a little. Because the viewer cannot remain indifferent to the countless details that Pixar's animation team inserted in Cars, from the movement of vehicles, depending on the age and model, to the many simulations of wear (rust) and accidents that a specific car can have. The sympathy of anthropomorphization of automobiles has become even greater due to the less strange location of the eyes, which are on the front glass and not on the headlights, as is normally used in animations; the pleasant use of the wheels, each with a type of mobility perfectly suited to the models; and, mainly, the remarkable use of reflection, refraction, brightness and opacity of light and colors in the drawings.At various times, we noticed numerous references ranging from the types of cars featured in the film (Doc Hudson is the car known as Hudson Hornet, a Nascar icon in the 1950s) to famous real-life names that are parodied. Among the examples, famous names such as Rock Hudson in the character Doc Hudson, Jay Leno in Jay Limo, the pilot Mario Andretti, among others. The soundtrack was very well chosen, containing essential classics of music. And we also have scenes that pay homage to Transverse Youth, Fast and Furious, E. T., the Extra-Terrestrial and even a sentence by Sharon Stone in Wild Instinct: ""I provoke 'primitive' instincts in 'cars'. Overall, the film manages to portray American society well, criticizing progress at any price. Unfortunately, Cars is an animation somewhat underestimated by Pixar fans, with some claiming that it only serves to ""sell toys"". However, at least this first film in the series brings many good messages for children and adults, containing countless references that only the elderly will capture.Out of production since 1999, with Toy Story 2, Cars marks the return of Pixar star John Lasseter, and this is his greatest love letter for the splendor that is the automobile. Of course, his demand for perfection had an impact. The animators had to present a new technique called ""ray tracing"", which allows the visuals of the cars to be metallic and strongly contoured, credibly reflecting their environments. Even with a sophisticated network of 3,000 modern computers and processors that operate up to four times faster than in The Incredibles, the average time to render a single frame of film was 17 hours. Still, all the time spent was worth it. Cars is a true visual treatment with another firm understanding in the storytelling. The animation is top notch, particularly in the racing scenes, with a lot of attention on how real racing vehicles actually move around the track, with emphasis on the characterization of the main characters. Automobiles tend to be very easy to anthropomorphize, but it is still surprising to see the unique characteristics they have managed to squeeze into each of the secondary characters, although they often make the archetype easy.At the top of the story, they added a dissertation on the loss of America's small town and the corresponding loss of humanity (particularly in the big city) as people became so intent on getting to where they are going so quickly, without having no time to breathe calmly, losing sight of the important things in life. Which is true, but the answer to that problem is probably not to try and go back to ""a simpler time in life"" when things were clearer. The reality is that the good old days are usually really good in hindsight and, inevitably, someone within 50 years will look at us and wish that things could be more as they are today. It is always a good idea to remember the past, today is built out of it, but returning to it as the source of answers to modern life seems more like a retreat than anything else.Along with a well-chosen soundtrack, like an American anthem in arrangement and version by Jimi Hendrix; Our Town, by James Taylor; Route 66, by Chuck Berry and Songbird, by Kenny G, there is no one who can resist the lesson of simplicity learned by Lightning McQueen and the moral lesson he teaches us. In addition, most of the route is very well accompanied by characters such as the 1955 Chevrolet tow truck (Mater), who is a kind of silly, affectionate and somewhat clumsy friend; the Porsche 911 version 2002 (Sally), which has gone through a phase of life changes and is trying to escape the hectic environment that imprisoned and saddened it: the big city; the legendary Hudson Hornet 1951 (Doc Hudson), the abandoned victor who decided to ostracize himself, becoming grumpy but never forgetting that he has a good heart. If the plotting were more organic and sequences like flashback to Radiator Springs' past, McQueen's ""integration"" in the new city and the way he returns to the Piston Cup were better composed or partially cut, the situation would be different.In general, the film addresses countless life values, because through Lightning who was someone with great arrogance, individualistic and who only cared for himself, through great friendships managed to become someone better, to care more about others and give value to what really matters in life. He got there in that small town a great naive, funny and loyal friend (Mate), a great love (Sally), in addition to winning the sympathy and friendship of everyone in the city. The film follows the formula of having its protagonist who will undergo profound transformations, a friend responsible for leveraging most of the laughter in the film, and a true passion, always showing the value of friendship, the lessons given to children and the whole family.With this formula Lasseter is able to please everyone in an exquisite way. In addition, the film also manages to criticize, such as the unrestrained modern progress of large cities. It also makes numerous references to the classics of cinema through various quotations and, of course, to the automobile environment with strategically well-referenced jokes. Also noteworthy is the wonderful ending, which synthesizes all the learning of Lightning over the course of living with his new friends. Very well directed and with charismatic and engaging characters and that has become one of the great animations of the decade, with extreme technical quality, a light, fun and right measure, managing to thrill at the right times. Above all, it conveys the importance of friendship, recognition, humility and love in everyone's life.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"*yawn*  predictable, stereotyped, and limited","The film's characters go through almost no character development, except for two very obvious, predictable changes. Every part of the plot can be guessed from the outset. The ethnic stereotyping, too, is both predictable ...and slightly offensive as well.And let's face it... a car presents very little opportunity for animation and anthropomorphism. It doesn't have arms and legs to gesture with, nor much flex in its body. Aside from eyes and mouth, there's very little in the way of animation going on here....and the movie suffers for it.I'm hoping that this, the last movie Pixer is contracted to do for Disney, was just a half-hearted gesture to complete the contractual obligations. Pixar has done some wonderful stuff in the past, but this is a definite four or five levels below previous work in storyline, characterization, and animation. In scenery, however, it is impressive and above Pixar's previous work-- the ground, particularly when Mater's hood falls off a cliff, is very real-looking.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
We just love our cars.,"Although America's love affair with the auto is currently threatening the country's economic and environmental stability, the creators of Toy Story take us to an imaginative world in which there are no humans to upset balances, just cars grooving to the sounds of competition, love, and family values.John Lasseter and Pixar's Cars is an enthusiastic animation about cars that act like humans on a highway, Route 66, that once embodied the American dream of the open road and limitless opportunities as we wended west in search of adventure and sunnier homesteads. The photorealistic cinematography alone is worth seeing, especially the buttes and plains that compete with the real Monument Valley and Grand Canyon for majesty.But the heart of the film rests on heart, the need to find and nurture someone special, the need to love competitors and maybe sacrifice even for them, the need to respect the elderly, and the need to preserve the past embodied in the solid values of small town and big heart. This is all red-state red meat, and Hollywood may be pandering to its own neocon critics, yet the tone and themes seem just right for any of us who have had the luxury of small town community love. This film's Radiator Springs, long forgotten with the construction of interstate route 40, contains the enduring seeds of friendship and caring that the hipper LA, where Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is bound to compete for the Piston Cup Championship, has long forsaken.Not forgotten but just hibernating is old Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), who has a few races under his hood and much to say about life to Lightning. So effective is Newman's voice, with its evocation of all the hot-shot characters Newman has played, that Hudson becomes a sage, elderly Butch Cassidy, car no more. As well does the film become much more than a brilliant animation: It delivers sentiment closer to us lovers of autos than toys or bugs or closet bugaboos could ever. We just love our cars.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fast cars in long movie!,"This is a Disney/Pixar movie about a hot-shot race car named Lightening McQueen, who was traveling to California to win a final race against The King and Chick Hicks. McQueen ends up accidentally damaging the road of the small town Radiator Springs and is sentenced to repair it. At the town, while working hard to repair the road so he could leave for the race, he finds friendship and love within the town's local cars.John Lasseter and Joe Ranft did a a nice job in directing this movie, grasping the audience's attention from the start with a roaring racing intro. The story does take several minutes to gain any steam after the race, but the plot does identify the issue when McQueen gets lost by the roadside and ending up in the town of Radiator Springs. The plot then takes a little intriguing turn when McQueen will have to repair the town street he accidentally wrecked and then wonders how he is going to get to the California race in time.The entire voice cast did a nice job in their respective roles, making the characters memorable. Owen Wilson did a convincing hot-shot personality of McQueen, Paul Newman did a mysterious personality of Doc Hudson and Bonnie Hunt did a warming job in voicing Sally Carrera. I especially enjoyed seeing the various American accents spoken by the Cars characters and some of the human traits they exhibit, and also especially enjoyed the all-star voice cast in the movie, even including sportscaster Bob Costa in a role.In addition, the music score from Randy Newman is quite spirited and the animation team did a splendid job in capturing the racetrack, town and beautiful countryside.This is known to be one of the longest, if not the longest, Pixar movie. It gives enough time for the characters to grow on you and generate your sympathy. The only downside is that I thought it lacked the excitement, suspense and fun of other Pixar films like Finding Nemo and the Toy Story trilogy. But overall, it's still a pretty nice, heartwarming Disney tale that is fine for the entire family to enjoy!Grade B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Cars: One For the Winner's Circle,"The latest Disney/Pixar epic, ""Cars"" is yet another brilliant work. The story takes place in a world populated completely by living motorized vehicles. The main character is Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), a rookie race car with dreams of winning the Piston Cup. When he is on his way to the big race in California, he gets sidetracked in a little town called Radiator Springs, along Route 66. The story is filled with colorful characters, from Mater, a rusty good ol' boy tow truck voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, to Doc Hudson, the town judge/mechanic, and former Piston Cup champion, voiced by Paul Newman. Pixar once again makes clever casting choices, including several personalities from the world of stock car racing: Darrell Waltrip, Mario Andretti and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Racing legend Richard Petty voices ""The King,"" Strip Weathers. Even Paul Newman is a racing enthusiast! The imagery is as breathtaking as always, from the shapes in the desert around Radiator Springs, to the dizzying, exciting action shots at the race sequences.

Pixar Gets Better With Each Movie,"I'm from an Arts College, so i tend to examine and criticize animation. After watching Cars, i must say that it has one of the best animations ever. All the cars in the movie looked so real and alive, it's unbelievable. Pixar's animation is truly top-notch.The storyline was very warm and sweet... showing how humility affects everyone.I've seen all 7 Pixar movies, from Toy Story to Finding Nemo to Cars, and Cars is definitely one of the best. I would place Cars alongside The Incredibles, just above Finding Nemo. It's amazing how Pixar can handle any challenge thrown at them. I mean, in Toy Story, they made toys look so real, then they did insects in A Bug's Life, followed by monsters (Monster's Inc), fish in Finding Nemo, humans in The Incredibles... and now cars. Amazing. Pixar is really versatile.I give Cars a 9/10 because it shows the amount of effort put into it, and how awesome everything is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Writing this review pains me,"So I have been working my way through all the Pixar movies and ranking them, removing the nostalgia as best as I can. Look if it were about nostalgia, Cars would be the landslide victor. I got to see the movie while in the USA on holiday and it is my earliest memory of the cinema.For anyone who hasn't worked it out, Cars works on the premise that Cars are animated and sentient beings, that compete in races and have millions of fans. Enter Lightening McQueen, who is a cocky prick that everyone loves because he impresses everyone by being a rookie who competes and ties with two other cars. The have to travel across the USA to race again and break the tie.The actual story of Cars is stellar. We see a real character arc develop for Lightening McQueen. It is the exact stuff a children's movie should be made out from. The message is wholesome and as the story develops, we see interesting side characters, tragic backstories and perfectly-timed comedy.However, here's the catch. Pixar movies are great because of all the details that are thrown in. But in this movie, the added details do not make sense. I have a massive list of these that I'm not going to write out for your own sanity. It is frustrating because so much of the story is great. And the soundtrack is next level top notch.Overall, I love this movie. But the small details that created plot holes, or loose ends made me deduct a couple stars from my rating. Don't avoid watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
It is worth the drive!,"Masterfully created, and as others have already stated, it truly captures both the spirit of Route 66 and the beauty of the country long bypassed by the Interstate. Lessons for the kids are ever-present, subtle, yet firmly implanted within each character that they watch on the screen.My favorite part of the movie is the ""race"" between McQueen and Doc. It shows the younger generation of today just what they can miss by speeding through life, without taking time to look around and enjoy the trip.Though he only gave his voice, Larry The Cable Guy deserves recognition for giving Mater the breath-of-life. His delivery was 100% on target with each line.This is one that Disney/Pixar will have difficulty topping. The public should park this movie in their ""WE SAW IT"" spot - more than one time!

Good Family Nostalgic Fun,"Pros:
1. Some of the animation is absolutely beautiful, especially in regards to the Grand Canyon imagery.
2. Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has a great character arc from beginning as an egoistic narcissist, to a selfless humbled individual who is eager to learn from those around them.
3. The humour mostly lands and produces some genuinely funny and heartwarming moments.
4. The race scenes are really fun to watch and are well made and built-up to.
5. There is fantastic voice-acting from Larry the Cable Guy (Mater), Tony Shalhoub (Luigi), and Guido Quaroni (Guido).
6. The ending is suitably heartwarming and concludes the plot succinctly.Cons:
1. Some of the animation is a little dated.
2. A couple of the feel-good moments are a little too cheesy and unnecessary.
3. There is a running gag about cow-tractors that falls flat after its introduction.
4. Owen Wilson fares poorly as a leading man, even when he's a disembodied voice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Cars,"So the shiny, red, ""Lightning McQueen"" is determined to make it to distant California to compete in the ""Piston Cup"". Along the way he stops off in the small town of ""Radiator Springs"" where he manages to tear up their road. His punishment? Well they have a giant tarmac laying machine, so he has to get it to resurface the road before he can be on his merry way. This isn't an easy task, and in order to finish that job he's going to have to find some allies. That's not so easy for this cocky and tunnel-visioned character, but as he gradually starts to listen, learns and make friends, he realises that there is much more to life than this one race! There's a gently bubbling moral to the story - learning to value the more important things in life like friendship, teamwork and self-reliance, and the characterisations of ""Sally"" - a lithe and stylish Porsche and ""Mater"" - a tow truck that looks like it's held together by Wrigley's and good will, help drum this message into ""Lightning' and the watching audience. There's plenty of colourful and vibrant action alongside quite a bit of humour (and puns!) from the writing to keep it going and although I found this a bit wordy - and perhaps just a little too focussed for internal (US) consumption, it's still an enjoyable start to what I assume will become quite a flexible franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
By far the worst Pixar film,"I'm sorry, I just didn't like it at all. First of all there's the opening race : boring, it's way too long, it's just to show off clean special effects. Then there's the story, one of the most simplistic ans sentimentalist ever. Okay ! it's a film for children, great, but when it just has some crappy predictable and moralistic end (they're teaching our children that friendship is a good thing). I mean, compare that with Toy Story, or even Snow White, and you see that films for children can be superb without having to give a pompous lesson, some of the scenes really made me feel sick (the hero and his gal riding in the forest with silly music, pathetic). AND it's not even that funny, the scripwriterS (yes, more than one) only managed to crack about five jokes in two long hours of SFX and cheesy romance. The only good thing about it was the thing about small towns being cut off from the world because of a big motorway that had been recently built.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One of the best,"Cars is a movie that I used to watch 2 times a day for 3 years straight. I didn't even like the movie but somehow I was obsessed with it until I got older and actually realized it was a masterpiece. Cars is one of the best movies for 3 reasons: it has good animation, memorable characters, and lightning McQueen has a well executed character arc.Firstly, it has good animation. I recently watched this film in 4K and it was beautiful. The movement of everything on screen is very natural and smooth looking and the lighting is a very pretty aesthetic that makes this movie impossible to look away from.Secondly, it has memorable characters. Whether you like these guys or not, each one of them has a different style of dialogue, a unique personality, and a unique perspective on life.Thirdly, Lightning McQueen has a good character arc. The opening scene masterfully establishes who he is and what his motivation are (why we should care about him), and then the entire rest of the movie brings him through a journey that is emotionally powerful.In conclusion, I will always see Cars as one of the best movies. This matters to the critics who might be treating this movie to harshly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

All the characters are great and work really well together. Owen Wilson as the stuck up McQueen is perfect for this role.The story is pretty good and it's funny to see the cars world vs the human world.

Should have been a 30-minute short,"If you're going to see this movie just for the animation, you likely won't be disappointed. But if you want to see something funny akin to Monsters Inc., you'll have to sit through an hour and half of ho-hum dialogue before anything really gets going. The last 30 minutes are pretty funny and the story finally comes together, but it doesn't save the movie. The end credits are funnier than most of the main feature. Two hours is just too long to sit and watch (albeit amazing) animation. The main contradiction in the movie is that the dialogue is aimed at little kids (too bad Disney bought out Pixar) but the running time of the movie is way too long for little kids.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Zoomah Zoomah Zoom and a Boom Boom,"I'm just gonna keep this nice and short. The story is about a rookie race car named Lightning McQueen. He's on the verge of becoming the first rookie car to win the Piston Cup, which is the ""holy grail"" of races. Unfortunately for Lightning he gets held up in a small, down on it's luck town called Radiator Springs. Lightning needs to get to California in time to make it for the biggest race in racing history. But will he? Will he end up loving Radiator Springs? Will he find a love? Will he learn life lessons? Will Radiator Springs become the thriving community it once was? Well watch Cars to find out.Cars isn't as bad as everyone says. It has fantastic animation (obviously) has some neat ideas, and a bunch of characters. But unfortunately the movie doesn't do a damn thing new. For every question I asked above, it doesn't take a genius to figure out the answer. The movie also goes on for a little too long. At almost 2 hours, it definitely wears on you. Even though it doesn't bring anything new to the table, it still has a very vibrant feel, has some good voice-acting (though Owen Wilson needs some getting used to), and it's pretty entertaining. It's possibly the worst of the Pixar films, but that's really not saying much, since all Pixar movies are fantastic, and this just misses the mark. For example, pretend all the Pixar movies are in a Car race...The Piston Cup. The Incredibles finishes first, and Cars finishes last. But hey, only the big boys are invited to compete in this race, and it's obvious Cars is capable of competing, but it seems the Cars pit crew just didn't work hard enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A childhood classic,"I recently decided to watch Cars (2006) again, my favourite film, when I was a child and the nostalgia kicked me. I have to admit, that this review is hardly subjective, because it reflects my own emotions, while watching the film, because in this case I don't pay attention to the minor details or faults the film may have, because I experience something else.The film just portrays perfectly, how you have to get used to a new environment, when you were treated very differently during an other time. Throughout the whole film you see how Lighting goes from a likeable racing star to an even more perfect down to earth racing star, who develops in many ways by facing new challenges and being treated like a normal car (human lol). In the end cars perfectly portrays the positive development once you accept criticism and try to work on yourself and not blame others for your faults. He gets his mentor in Doc Hudson, who had the same problems, when he was a racing star and slowly lets Lighting to his heart and helps him develop and has a brilliant payoff at the end of the movie. I only can say, that if you haven't watched the movie in a long time you will get that nostalgia feelings, that you search in your old childhood movies. Every character is likeable and has its own little story, which is very heartwarming to me, so please go watch it again, you won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Nowhere near Pixar's best but still a solid and fun time,"I'm not the biggest fan of the original Cars like some people but I still think this is a good movie. It might even be great. Pixar as usual produces some stunning animation in this movie with lovely grass, polished metal surfaces and a movie filled with beautiful colors and detailed backgrounds. Well done animators.I also quite like the characters a lot. Lightning McQueen, despite being insuferable for the first 30 minutes, goes for a believable character arc that slowly progresses through the relationships he make and gives us a great life lesson along tue way. Mater is also a really funny side character with hilarious jokes and is just really likeable and fun. I also like Sally and Doc and the relationship they developed with McQueen, especially with Doc and his history with racing.It's also a well-told story about McQueen learning to slow down or you'll miss the little things in life and I think we can all learn from that and it's well executed with all the fun laughs and activities McQueen goes through and it leads to an exciting intense climax that concludes McQueen's arc remarkably well (although he could have just crossed the finish line and then helped the King but whatever)What holds it back is there's really no reason for the characters to be cars. They're just kind of cars to appeal to 8 year old boys and being one of Pixar's longest films at 115 minutes, it can drag on and on and on at times and the genre and concept of the film just isn't for me and I really couldn't handle McQueen in the first 30 minutes but regardless it's a charming, funny and well-made animated movie that's fun for families but there are many other better Pixar movies like Coco, Monsters Inc and Inside Out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Maybe small children would like this one for the toy-like cars, but for adults, it's a very poor story and an o so simple plot. Next please... The simple plot goes like this: Big star thinks he's the one. On his way to his biggest race he gets lost. He meets ""normal"" people in a redneck town. He learns to be normal again and meets a girl and falls in love. Thanks to his friends (friends are so important in life...) he wins the race.

A step back for Pixar.,"Pixar had been riding on a wave of highly acclaimed animated feature films almost non-stop since its beginning with the mega hit of Toy Story, and sure a couple of movies shared a similar story structure like 2006's Cars, but they had something thoughtprovoking about them, but while I watched cars I had so many questions.First of all, why did it have to be a world of cars? With this unoriginal story you could put anything in the car's place and you would still get the same outcome, so why cars out of all possible things. We at least got a glimpse of a plausible miniature world in A Bug's Life, but this world makes no sense. How do they mate? How do they use the rear-view mirrors when their eyes are the wind shield? And why are even the flies a car?But it all comes back to the story, because how many times have you heard this: a self-absorbed city boy lives his life in the fast lane without thinking about other, some day he gets out of his comfort zone and must learn about appreciating the small things in life and care about others, then he gets his chance to be the greatest person in the world but has learned his lesson.Yeah, it was predictable from start to finish, but I wouldn't say it's all bad, because even though he meets some colourful characters whereas most of them are one-note I did like McQueen's romance with Sally and how he played out with the race car veteran Doc Hudson which leads to a foreseen but heart-warming ending.It may be Pixar's weakest original movie, but it's not all bad, we'll leave that to its sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar on cruise control,"CARS Written and Directed by John Lasseter and Joe RanftThe crowd is uproarious. The stadium is practically shaking. Two checkered flags are waved and they're off  to a sad and unfortunately slow start. I say ""unfortunate"" because I am speaking of Pixar Animation Studio's seventh feature, CARS, and the Pixar name usually ensures sophistication, wit and insight in addition to awe-inspiring, revolutionary animation. Further to that, it usually means a darn good time but CARS drags its wheels, leading me to think Pixar might be due for a good tune-up. The problem is not with the quality of the animation, which bursts out straight away in the opening sequence. We are introduced to Lightning McQueen (voiced by the ever laid back, Owen Wilson), a spunky red sports car with a lot of scattered energy to burn and not enough experience or patience to see things through to the finish. He cruises past the rest of his competitors as he races for the Piston Cup, the highest achievement in race-car driving. The arena lights blare down on to the track and into our eyes as the cheers from the stands erupt to deafening new heights. Everything is as it should be but for one jarring detail. The patrons that fill the stands are other cars. Yes, people go to watch other people race against each other but this is a world inhabited by nothing but cars. It's like ""Planet of the Cars"" and directors John Lasseter and the late Joe Ranft do very little to ground this reality. And yes, it's an animated film but I couldn't get past wondering how the cars managed to build the stadium and all the roads leading up to in the first place.While on his way to another race in another town, Lightning gets lost and ends up arrested, or in this case impounded, in a middle-of-nowhere town after accidentally tearing up their road. He is sentenced to repairing the road before he can leave. Here he meets an expectedly colourful group of cars that run through a gamut of stereotypes, from the hippie minibus to the military standard hard-ass to the pimp-my-ride 59 Chevy. I have never seen the folks at Pixar deliver such one-dimensional three-dimensional characters. There is no good reason that these cars would inhabit the same town and so why would we even be there? The only resident that seems like he belongs there is a tow-truck by the name of Mater (as in to-mater). Voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, Mater is the dimwitted naïf who unknowingly bestows wisdom upon others. He is hilarious without realizing and is the most believable element of this film.The clichés don't stop at the characters either. The moral foundation of CARS focuses on being in too much of a hurry to get nowhere in particular. Upon being forced to slow down, Lightning learns that there is more to life than winning races and scoring cool sponsorships. When you aren't speeding down the highway, you can see the cars around you and maybe even become their friend or fall in love. Lightning brings some much needed life to this dreary waste of a town and the inhabitants show him a thing or two about loyalty and the simpler pleasures that come from standing still. A good chunk of this lesson comes from Lightning's love interest, Sally (a coy Bonnie Hunt), a car who studied law and climbed the corporate ladder before she realized she had no idea who she was. Ordinarily, I would find these themes engaging but cars are built for speed, not for taking the time to smell the motor oil.The beauty of a Pixar film is best exhibited in their 1998 offering, A BUG'S LIFE. The ants and circus bugs that make up the majority of the characters have personality that more than makes up for the lack of time to develop them all. More importantly, the bug world is believable because it co-exists with a human world, bringing light to a universe that we ignorant humans don't even know is right beneath our feet. Even the entirely unreal monsters of MONSTERS INC have doorways that lead to an earthly plain. CARS had an inherently huge obstacle to get past from the start line but instead of pushing harder, Lasseter and Ranft left CARS on cruise control. The result is more a casual Sunday drive then a high speed race  enjoyable and pleasant but lacking purpose and drive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
What the hate??,"""Cars"" is the black sheep of Pixar's 2000s classics. It is often forgotten due to bigger and better pictures like ""Ratatouille"" and ""Up"", but oh man, how underrated this movie is just reaches the limit of it.As we all know, Cars tells us about the story of Lightning McQueen. From being a selfish, egoistic and just awful car, that cares only about winning the piston cup, we see how he changes throughout the movie. The people of Radiator Springs really affected him in a good way. This movie talks about just taking a pause sometimes. You sometimes just need to chill and understand the situation, where you are located in.Doc Hudson voiced by late Paul Newman just steals the movie. He is a perfectly written character and he's really interesting to watch. We also see him change with McQueen coming to town. Doc understands, that McQueen was always the thing why he still enjoyed it all, he reminded Doc his young ages, when he was a racecar himself, but due to the horrible crash Doc needed to stop his career.There were many moments in the movie, that always make me shed a tear.For example the scene, where Sally realizes, that Doc was the one to call the journalists for them to pick up McQueen, making him to leave Radiator Springs. The small 3 phrase dialogue between them transmits the point perfectly, and we can see, that Doc really regrets his actions. And there are many of these little scenes, that you understand aren't the best dialogue written scenes in all cinema history, but they are so emotional and they make you feel. Feel the joy, the sadness, the emotions of these characters, and the emotional side makes this movie so perfect.I also want to mention the score by Randy Newman. He absolutely nailed it. Everybody says, that ""Toy Story's"" score by him was perfect, but this one just hits different. Almost every track is made with love and care for the movie, Newman really understood, what he was creating.I think people's minds are brainwashed due to Cars 2. After Cars 2, people started considering this franchise as a quick Pixar's money grab, but the first one just can't be put in this category.I could talk about my love for this movie for a long time, but I just think it's not necessary here. There are 2 options. You either love this movie, or you don't, that's up to you. But this movie isn't definitely a quick cash grab. This movie is a love letter to racing, route 66, the little American towns, that are often forgotten due to the new highways being built. I just don't understand the hate here, how can you watch this movie and not feel emotional at least once? It just really doesn't work up for me. This is one of my Pixar's childhood classics, and I love every minute of it. I like that with every rewatch I happen to forget some scenes, so the emotion in the doubles up for me. It's sad, that Cars 2 couldn't keep up with this movie, creating something completely different. And as you all know, the experiment didn't work out. But there isn't any Pixar movie, that can be compared with Cars, it's just so different from the other ones and in a very good and unique way. This movie definitely made my childhood and I can be rewatching it whenever I want to. A really underrated, but a truly emotional and a beautiful story. Bravo Pixar.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Lucas does Pixar, unfortunately - It has no heart.","It isn't only one thing wrong, I'm afraid.The good? The animation is superb - no question. But they've spent so long on making the cars shine nicely and getting shadows right they ignored how bad the story was.Much of the recent great animation has worked - particularly as adult cross-over - because of the ability to be anthropomorphic. And there is the basic problem with the concept - you can't do that with a car. They don't even make you try.The script is trite, off-the-shelf and basic - immature moralising with no fun, no comedy zingers and absolutely no laughs. The voices are fine - but they have nothing to work with.FAR too many songs! And sub-standard Gilbert knock-offs they are too.It is clear that all that was thought of was shiny fast cars - like Lucas the effects are the thing. Stuff script. And you are left with a bad film that can't even be described as half-decent.And that's just for adults. For the first time this year at the cinema, my 6yo nephew got bored and asked to leave.

Cars,"Cars, is the newest addition to the Pixar family, following Brad Bird's, The Incredibles. John Lasseter originated, directed & wrote this story, while having early success with Toy Story 1 & 2, and A Bug's Life. Lasseter had some help on the directors side, being co-directed by Joe Ranft, who wrote Beauty & the Beast, The Lion King, Toy Story & A Bug's Life.Out of all the great Pixar stories we've had so far, Cars comes up a little thin. Jorgen Klubien, John Lasseter, Dan Fogelman, Kiel Murray & Phil Lorin created the average revenge story, with some soul searching in the mix. The first act, John Lasseter foreshadows way too much, making the whole story kind of predictable from the start. We get a very clear-cut message on Lightning McQueen's character, giving us that ""I'm better than everyone"" persona. As the second act starts, the tone offsets completely, but for good measures.You have to give a lot of credit to the character design team, that created all of these enjoyable, and unique cars, giving them great personalities, and emotions. Lighting McQueen, voiced over by Owen Wilson, wasn't my favorite of characters, until the end of the second act. I never cared for the condescending main character in general, because I can never feel for them, and their hardships. His late character development was charming, and somewhat saved his character from being a whole miss step. Owen Wilson does a decent job voicing the character, filling the personality well. Chick Hicks, voiced by Richard Petty, is just a big useless villain, that I dont even think that people that root for the villain, would root for him. He was really underdeveloped, and was soley used as a plot device. Sally, voiced by Bonnie Hunt, had a pretty traditional romance role, although she was one of the most witty & grounded characters, while still being quirky and silly. She was one of McQueen's main reasons for his character development. Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, was the comic relief of the film, while easily being the most give or take characters in the film. Mater was another, if not the biggest influence to McQueen. Doc Hudson, voiced by Paul Newman, in which was one of his last performances, was arrogant & stubborn like McQueen at first, but once we found out his back story, you realize the wit, and maturity he brings to the film. Mack, Sheriff, Filmore, Sarge, Flo, Lizzie, Ramone & Red were all fun & hilarious additions, that didnt overstep their roles. Luigi & Guido had a little bit more of an impact than the other side characters, just because of the racing aspect of the film.The screenplay had a fantastic family-fun vibe to it, that didn't coward away from the adult jokes, that landed perfectly almost everytime.The cinematography and animation was visually pleasing, being very vibrant, and bold with their colors. The production design was beautifully detailed, with these great rural highways. The production design was loosely based off of John Lasseter's experiences on his family vacation trip. The animations were very good, to the rocks, the paint shmmer, the tire treds, everything. Though there was a couple of hard nitpicks I had with the animations, Pixar showed a big step in improvement from Toy Story & The Incredibles.The score and music by Randy Newman, who composed for Toy Story 1 & 2, and Monsters Inc, had a great country feel, with catchy songs that still hold up ten - plus years later.Overall, the story wasn't the most original, but it was still a great family-film, that shows the importance in bondage, and the sport of racing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fast flowing family fun,"In one of Pixar's most under-appreciated film, a race car gets lost on the way to the biggest race of his life, and winds up in a town where he learns the meaning of life.With the opening montage of a race car getting himself geared up for a race, audiences are invited into a fast and flowing animation which doesn't match the peak of Toy Story or Wall-E, but is entertaining throughout.Pixar have been there or thereabouts with every film they have released in the past decade, with hit after hit, and this family adventure is up there with the others, but falls slightly due to an annoying central protagonist and a fair amount of predictability.Lightning McQueen is stubborn, unfunny, egotistical and negative; everything that can be annoying about in a character is justified by the race car. McQueen is partly the reason why this film doesn't match the class of other Pixar films. Toy Story had the funny and courageous central character Buzz, Wall-E had a lovable lonely robot, and even without a great central character, others have fallen on support characters, such as Dory in Finding Nemo. Other cars which include Sally, Mater and Luigi save the film with funny physical moments, especially the tractor sequences.The ideology of friendship is heart-warming and beautiful to watch all the way through as we watch McQueen face new challenges in his personal life.The visual effects are stunning as you would expect from the best animation team in the world. The direction does the graphics justice with a fast and flowing style from Lasseter.The plot does follow many conventions, but has a laugh along the way and the likability of the support characters and the general ideology of the plot with twists and turns, quite literally at the end, are enough to cement it as a good animation, which is fun and likable for the entire family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Speeding into Hearts,"Wow, where do I even begin with Cars (2006)? This movie exceeded my expectations in every way possible and left me feeling so incredibly entertained and satisfied. Pixar has once again proven that they are masters of storytelling and animation.When I first heard about Cars, I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical. How could a movie featuring only vehicles, with no human characters, keep me engaged for a full two hours? But Pixar managed to do just that, and more.Director John Lasseter's attention to detail is truly remarkable. Every car and truck in the movie becomes a unique character with its own personality. The way they bend and gesture in ways that are true to their construction is just incredible. It's these small details that make the world of Cars so immersive and believable.And speaking of the world, the story itself is filled with charm and heart. Yes, it may contain a well-traveled theme, but it's delivered in such a way that it feels fresh and meaningful. I found myself genuinely caring about Lightning McQueen's journey and rooting for him every step of the way.Now, I'm not a racing fan by any means, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this movie. You don't need to be a racing enthusiast to appreciate the story and the characters. The film goes beyond the world of racing and delves into themes of self-discovery, friendship, and the importance of slowing down and enjoying life. It's a message that resonated with me, and I'm sure it will resonate with many others as well.Visually, Cars is a feast for the eyes. The animation is stunning, and the attention to detail is mind-blowing. The scenery is so beautifully rendered that it's hard to believe it's not real. From the reflections on the cars to the weeds growing out of cracks in the sidewalk, every little detail has been meticulously crafted. It's a visual spectacle that left me in awe.But impressive visuals alone are not enough to make a great movie. Thankfully, Cars delivers on all fronts. The characters are well-developed, and the story is engaging. Pixar took the time to give us a movie that is not just visually stunning, but also emotionally resonant. They didn't succumb to the pressure of making a shorter film to cater to shorter attention spans. Instead, they stayed true to their vision and created a movie that is both entertaining and meaningful.Cars started off with a disadvantage in my eyes, but it quickly won me over. It made me care about its characters and their journey. It made me reflect on my own life and the importance of slowing down and enjoying the journey. It made me want to take a road trip and explore the unknown. It made me appreciate the scenic route.In the end, Cars is a testament to Pixar's ability to create movies that go beyond entertainment. It's a movie that makes you care about something other than yourself, even if just for a little while. It's a movie that reminds us of the power of storytelling and the magic of animation.Pixar has once again made it look simple, but we all know that creating a movie as wonderful as Cars takes a tremendous amount of talent and hard work. I can confidently give Cars a rating of 8 out of 10, and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a well-crafted story and breathtaking animation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"It's a long road trip, but the destination is worth the ride","I've never been too big of a Pixar fan. They studio has always had novel ideas, but the action sequences seem to fall flat in CG fare and the kid friendly comedy never really connects with me. Their movies have always been solid, but never great, until the incredibles came. The Incredibles was a fantastic movie and made me thing the studio had turned a new leaf. I was very excited about the idea, especially since it seems to be somewhat based on an old Disney animated film that I loved as a child. Well, it seems Pixar is back to their old tricks, it's not really a bad thing, just nothing new. The movie sports the best CG work I've seen, Pixar tops themselves again, and the film features great voice work. I read a review likening this to Doc Hollywood and thats appropriate. I really enjoyed the beginning of the film, although the laughs seem to be few and far between in the beginning. The middle is where things crawl to a snails pace, i realize character development is essential, but I could have been done in a smarter less time consuming approach. Luckily, the last 30 minutes or so are a blast, fun, fast, and heartfelt. I really enjoyed ""mater"" voiced by Larry the cable guy, although I felt the ""fart"" joke was lame and WAYYYYY over used. As always a solid message is delivered in a family-friendly way with some fast action and laugh added along the way. The only thing that really hinders this movie is that the beginning and middle should have had more laughs and the movie should have been shortened at least 20 to 25 minutes. I think 2 hour kids films is a little too long for most kiddies, even the child I sat too was losing interest near the middle. Still I recommend it, a solid film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Give Cars another chance,"Ever since Pixar first wowed cinema-going audiences across the globe with their feature-length debut Toy Story, the company has become the standard for cinematic excellence. Not only for their constantly groundbreaking animation and ability to entertain both children and adults alike, but for the quality of their scripts and the amount of genuine heart that pours out of them. Yet for every WALL-E, The Incredibles or Inside Out there's always a Monsters University, A Bug's Life or Brave. These films still get a pass because, after all, ""it's only a kid's movie,"" but the disappointment is all the more crushing with the knowledge of Pixar's capabilities. Cars is firmly in the latter category, falling into the traps of a familiar plot and a script that isn't quite up to scratch.Cars' reputation has been damaged ever further in the decade since its release, and this is no doubt thanks to the lazy and bitter- tasting sequels and spin-offs, something the company has churned out at an increasing rate ever since Disney took over. I must admit that I didn't think much of Cars back in 2005. It lacked excitement and a character to really root for, and the story of a cocky upstart learning learning a valuable lesson to change their outlook on the world can be seen in countless other children's movies. However, on my second viewing I found moments of tenderness between the cracks, an old-fashioned romanticism to really warm the heart. The movie is about more than a young race car named Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) and his quest to escape the forgotten town of Radiator Spings to reach the Piston Cup. It's also about the changing face of America and the way its capitalist nature is leaving the little guys behind.One aspect of Cars that was never criticised was its cutting-edge animation, and the way it brought the loud, dangerous world of racing and the country's glorious landscapes to beautiful life. It is still utterly glorious to look at, whether it be a wide shot of a darkening horizon or a close-up of buck-toothed tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). The small town off Route 66 is full of other colourful archetypes, voiced by the likes of Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Tony Shalhoub, Cheech Marin and George Carlin. The problems I had with the film the first time around are still present - the climax should be a lump-in-the-throat moment but is oddly devoid of emotion, and the film offers no surprises at all - but they just didn't seem to bother me as much. The hefty running-time (just shy of 2 hours) also whizzed by, despite the lack of genuine laugh-out- loud moments. So forget Cars 2, Planes and those awful-looking straight-to-DVD spin-offs you ignore in Tesco, and give Cars another chance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Hand another one to the Gods of Publicity,"I've been a fan of Pixar for most of their releases. From the charming ""Finding Nemo"", a film that proved that it is possible to have a heart in the middle of the newest technology, to the well-orchestrated action in ""The Incredibles"", and the pathos in both ""Toy Story I"" and ""Toy Story II"". It was possible to believe that screen writing still mattered in this institution, and then we have a major crash in ""Cars"", a film that stands out because it is derivative, unimaginative, and possibly one of the most boring of its generation.There is still plenty of talent around the film, with both Owen Wilson and Paul Newman doing good work. Yet the color scheme is pretty dull, and the dialogue never sparkles. In fact, it feels contrived and annoying most of the time. It is an insult to those of us who are paying good money to be ""entertained"". During the screening I attended many children kept asking to go to the bathroom or were asking too many questions. This being a sure sign that the screen did less than hold their interest.There is another big fault with the film, and it is the design of its characters. They all have the same blank look, wit none of the emotions one did find in the previous Pixar animated films, plus it was very hard to believe that those cars in the movie really had the ability to be anything else but boring cars. They looked and behaved like cars.It is time that Pixar looks back at itself and keeps itself from falling into the same trap that most studios are finding themselves in: Let's concentrate on doing intelligent work and develop those ideas beyond the board room and the sales pitch. Audiences are bound to wake up, and it is not a good time to make these expensive faulty guesses.",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Cars: Proof that Pixar is not a perfect company,"Cars is not bad at all, but it's not great either. It starts off on a pretty high not but it definitely falls and rises up from grace a few times.

Radiator Springs and it's residents was the high point of this film, the races really weren't great. Then at the final quarter things kind of settle, things were still alright but it definitely wasn't as good as it's 3rd quarter. Cars was an OK movie but it had some pretty big flaws. 1st quarter 7.5/10 2nd quarter 5/10 3rd quarter 8.5/10 4th quarter 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A daily comment from Midget Emma: Cars (2006),Another great kids movie from the geniuses at Pixar but there is a few problems.All the other Pixar movies seemed to be great movies for all but this one seems to be aimed at the young boys. Now i am not saying that people other than young boys won't like this but it feels like it was made for the guys.The animation is superb which is what you expect from the people at Pixar. The movie has detailed environments and the cars look awesome. At one point in the movie you forget that they are just cars and look at them like they are living things.There are some great tunes in there that are about cars. Like that 'Life is a highway' song. The songs match the movie very nicely.Again we fall in love with the characters like we do in every Pixar movie. Owen Wilson done a great job as lightning McQueen and all the other voices did great jobs.The story was good. A race car called Lightning McQueen gets accidentally lost in a town in the middle of nowhere which is called radiator springs. There he meets all different types of cars. Lightning McQueen must get to California before the big race starts so he can be signed on to be the new face of a car company and be a even more famous race car.Although this doesn't have the warm fuzziness that the other Pixar movies do this still is a good kids movie. There are some laughs in there but not as many as there could have been. Overall it is a good kids flick. Even though it is my least favourite Pixar movie(Although i haven't seen A Bugs Life yet).I recommend it if you want to see a good kids movie. I highly recommend it if you have a young boy and want to have a Father-son movie night. It is a nice gift to a young son they should enjoy it.

Life is a highway!,"For some reason, I decided to dive in my childhood nostalgia this year. I already reviewed all Ice age movies this year, so I have decided to rewatch another one simply called Cars. It was a passion project of one of the Pixar's founders John Lasseter, since he liked cars as a kid. And although his movie didn't reach the same stakes as previous works like ""The Incredibles"" and ""Finding Nemo"", it still had a loyal fanbase, which let the movie to be successful. But why people seem to enjoy Cars?One of the main reasons I think that it's good it's because of a great message of putting your loved ones over fame and wealth. In this case, Lightning McQueen gets lost in an abandoned lost town called Radiator Springs and learns to respect others. I mean, the plot itself isn't the most original, since that kind of a story happened before in ""Emperor's new groove"" and ""Surf's up"". Still, this is the kind of movie that prefers to focus on the world building of talking cars.It mostly spends time in this small town, where all citizens had to deal with isolation from society. And how just one character could change, both the town and himself. And also, each character may seem like a stereotype, but still manage to be likeable due to it's plot.As for it's protagonist Lightning McQueen, he really reminds me of Kuzco. At the beginning, he only cares about himself and winning. But once he gets lost in the interstate 66 and later damaging the road, he learns his lesson and treats everyone with respect. His new friend Mater seems to be the typical silly comic relief that is similar to Dory from ""Finding Nemo"", that despite being a dim witted character, he still has a heart of gold. My favourite scene with him has to be the one where he wakes up the trucks with his loud motor. I must say, it's hilarious! Another important character that I would like to talk about is Doc, the mayor of the town. He seems to be the serious leader, who tries his best to keep an eye on the criminal, but at the same time, has a sad past. He was a great character, that was also relatable, but I can't mention why due to spoilers. Chick Hicks was Lightning's number 1 rival that actually won with him, or as I should say, threeway tied along with King. He's your typical bully kind of character, that can sometimes be funny. Also, Sally is the emotional supporter that motivates our protagonist and teaches the lesson. As for voice acting, it's actually great. I can tell that everyone tried their best to sound invested in this film. The only exception I have to make is Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen. He sorta sounds tired, like he's only doing this for a quick check and later move on to something much more fun. Sadly, he doesn't sound as great as his friend Ben Stiller in Madagascar as Alex, the latter sounded like he had a time of his life in comparison. So, it sucks for Owen, maybe he needed more rest before moving to Cars.Moving to the animation, it looks as great as other Pixar films. It has it's own unique feeling with talking cars and a more stylized world, while still maintaining the nature aspects like landscapes. Of course, since it's a movie about racing, there should be a lot of racing scenes. It does have some well executed ones, especially in the beginning and the ending. But it's not it's sailing point, so some fans of sports may be disappointed by not having too much of them. Lastly, the soundtrack has it's mix of pop-rock and country songs, that make this feature feel immersive. My favourite song has to be ""Life is a highway"" by Rascal Flatts. It gives you this fun roadtrip feeling, like you and your friends are going on a fun adventure. It's also very positive, so it does cheer the audience up.What can I say about this good film? It ain't perfect, it still needs some polishing due to a weak plot and not so good performance by the lead. Yet it still grabs the attention of kids and adults with it's world building and great moral. This is a movie that isn't a must watch, but can easily be enjoyed by both boys and girls. Sure, I would recommend the film to a slightly older audience, like let's say 7-13 year olds, since youngsters may get bored of it. Besides, the movie is 2 hours long, so I don't think they'll handle the length. As for adults, then they'll enjoy this film if they are fans of animated films or racing. Not a masterpiece, but I liked this film enough to recommend it.Kachow!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Great cartoon,"CARS is Disney/Pixar's latest animated feature, about a race car that learns a hard lesson about life and love from a bunch of automobiles living in a forgotten desert town. Five minutes into the film, and you forget you're watching a bunch of motor vehicles; each has its own very distinct personality. The film is gorgeously drawn and animated, wonderfully voiced by Owen Wilson as the race car, Paul Newman as an old-timer with a secret, and several others, and the antics of the characters are hysterical. CARS provides one laugh after another, with a series of nonstop gags and one-liners leading up to a thrilling finish. Make sure you hang around for and after the credits for some terrific throwaway gags and ""outtakes,"" the funniest one involving John Ratzenberger's character reacting to a rather peculiar situation at the local drive-in.

A vehicle for that sweet merchandise money.,"This is a good film. It looks great, the acting is well done and it's directed competently. But when you compare it to other Pixar films (at the time) it just doesn't come close. I liked it well enough as a kid, though it was always my least favourite of the 2000s Pixar catalogue.The animation is spectacular, the worldbuilding is incredibly confusing (Why are the flies cars too? How do the cars reproduce?) and the actors give good performances. Unfortunately the writing isn't as geared towards adults as much, which is something I appreciate about their previous work. Regardless, I didn't regret watching this as much as I expected, and the ending was actually pretty good, with a great message.

How do they do it every time?,"If anybody had told me I would have tears in my eyes over a film about cartoon talking cars then I'd have called them mad - but of course, if anyone can, Pixar can - and they have. I can't fault it. As you'd expect, the animation is sensational. Not only is it technically good, it's stunningly beautiful too. The characters are great - there's a moral curve but it's not rammed down your throat and the movie never slips into saccharine. The music is great and well picked. The race scenes are genuinely exciting - better than watching the real thing. And there's even a hippy acid casualty VW camper van - who tickled me pink...The film may be a bit complicated for very small children - but that would be the only negative thing I could say - and of course that's what makes it tolerable for adults. Tolerable - what am I saying - it's terrific for adults.Childless folk, steal someone's children for the day if you're embarrassed about going alone.Fantastic stuff - Pixar have done it again.

Paul Newman steals the show,"I know that Cars is a kids' franchise, and the Disneyland bumper cars ride was revamped so the little ones could hear their favorite voices and see the funky faces, but most of it is geared to the adults - from start to finish, really. How many little kids really love car races anyway? The name of Owen Wilson's character is Lightening McQueen, a very sweet tribute to Steve McQueen, and Steve's pal and fellow racecar driver Paul Newman contributes one of the other voices. How many children know anything about Paul Newman other than his salad dressing and lemonade?Pretty much all of the humor is aimed high above the kids' heads, which is fine as long as you know that going in. The movie pokes fun at infomercials, focuses on the benefits of taking a step back from ""living life in the fast lane"", includes flirtatious banter, and attaches stereotypes to different car models that today's audiences would undoubtedly find offensive. However, those who still love the Tiki Room might just look at this franchise as the Tiki Room of cars.What I love about this movie is Paul Newman. With the shoe on the other foot, he gets to play the stern judge who sentences a cocky rebel to community service and road repair. We don't get to see him, but his car does have blue eyes, and it's a Hudson - isn't that adorable? I know this sounds silly, but if he weren't in it, I might not have made it through this movie. While I was appreciating him, I also liked trying to guess the voices of the supporting cars, like Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, John Ratzenberger, Tony Shalhoub, Michael Keaton, George Carlin, Cheech Marin, Paul Dooley, and some real racecar drivers, too! Plus there are very cute cameos from Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Billy Crystal, John Goodman, and Dave Foley (just make sure you don't leave before the end credits are done).DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. The first 15 minutes of the movie feature a car race with spinning cameras, flashy lights, and sudden zooms, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Another fine Pixar film that practices what it preaches,"For the three people remaining on the continent who have avoided all prior buzz regarding this movie, Cars is the computer-animated tale of Lightning McQueen, a cocky hotshot NASCAR race car who dreams of making it to the top in record time. En route to an important race, Lightning gets lost in the forgotten town of Radiator Springs, where he meets an eclectic group of residents and eventually learns that the journey is the reward.Despite how it may appear, there's nothing spoiler-oriented in the summary above. That's because Cars is not a plot-driven movie; there are no unexpected developments or surprise twists here. Just as you know Luke Skywalker will defeat the Empire, just as you know George Bailey will realize how meaningful his existence is, so you also know that Lightning McQueen will ultimately learn how to stop being a dipstick and slow down. Cars is, instead, all about how you get to the end and the experiences along the way.And, true to the movie's message, it takes a leisurely drive to get there; the characters have subtleties that aren't evident until you actually spend time with them, and the movie gives us ample time to do so. In many ways, it's the opposite of X-Men 3, which zipped past its story so fast that the characters are merely blurry clichés -- in Cars, the characters that seem like clichés in the commercials and trailers become fully-formed people (okay, cars ) after you've invested the time to know them. This investment pays off at the film's climax, where you care about them as individuals and end up sharing their joys as a result.If there's a weakness to Cars, it's that the second act is entirely wrong for the summer movie market. In a season filled with ear-shattering explosive effects, Cars' quiet serenity stands out to trip the unwary (the trailers, filled with high-speed NASCAR races, don't help any). Instead, the movie shows itself off with understated grace; the desert plains of Cars ranks up there with the undersea reefs of Finding Nemo for breathtaking visuals. And because it's such a character-driven vehicle (sorry), the deep introspection of Cars' second act will leave impatient viewers -- and younger kids -- fidgeting in their seats. But I can't fault the film for this; I'd rather keep Cars' second act as-is than break it up with audience-pleasing slapstick or -- even worse -- cut it short in the name of expediency.Cars is not Pixar's best movie ever -- that title goes with The Incredibles, which deftly blends audience-pleasing action and humor with adult-oriented themes and messages. But Cars is a worthy addition to the Pixar filmography, a leisurely byway far from the frantic summer box office superhighway. This is a movie that doesn't just talk about slowing down to appreciate the quiet things in life, but also slows itself down -- and rewards viewers with some quiet beauty of its own.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The worst Pixar flick so far...,"This will be short and sweet: Cars is an awful awful movie, there's nothing in it, except the animations - as per usual, that holds anyone's interest. The story is boooooring, I mean seriously ""If you aren't nice you aren't anything""...?? OK, that's not from the movie, but it's the whole statement the way I see it. Not to mention the internal logic that is non-existent. To put it bluntly: had this movie been made about humans, not a single person would have liked it. (By the way, I loved all of Pixar's other movies, except A Bug's Life, which is, in its ways, similar to Cars.)

A lot of fine salutes and nods in Cars,"I'll bet some of the older folk caught some of the references and nods in the movie.. If not, here goes:Lightning McQueen = Steve McQueen who was a top notch actor and an excellent race car driver. Cocky and crazy as hell to boot.Hudson Hornet = Ole Blue Eyes himself, Paul Newman. He himself ran Le Mans class cars. He co-owns a racing team and does pretty well on the recreational circuits. I'll bet a month's salary that this was like a homecoming for him when he did this movie. His expressions, his attitude, almost his soul was ingrained into the Hornet's chassis.The town quite nearly mirrors the communities that sprung up along 66 during it's heyday, save for some stereotyping, but the overall look, save for the scenery, plucked some of my heart strings for I grew up in a small town not too dissimilar to it.Overall the movie has done a fine job of showing the price of progress.

"Sweet, fun movie","It is the Piston Cup, the most prestigious event on the racing calendar. After a close-fought race, rookie Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is within sight of victory when a flat tyre enables two competitors to catch him, resulting in a three-way tie for first place. To decide the winner, the three will race off in California in a week's time. En route to the event, a series of unfortunate events sees McQueen end up in a small town in the middle of nowhere, Radiator Springs. Convicted of driving offenses he has to fix the town's main road, and this could cause him to miss the race. Initially he hates the town and its inhabitants but over time his view changes...Sweet, fun movie. Quite innovative, with animated cars taking the place of humans in the story, with matching other replacements too (eg tractors for cows, flying mini-cars for flies). The car universe is reasonably well thought-out.Plot is fine. At one stage, when McQueen first ends up in the town, the movie looked like it was going down a rather cheesy, dull path. However, over time it finds its direction and ends up being quite emotional, and reasonably profound.Will certainly appeal to kids but there is more than enough to keep adults interested too. Some of the jokes only adults will get (not that they're dirty, you just need to be an adult to know what they're talking about).Great animation, but this is Pixar, so that is a given.Good casting too with host of stars providing the voices, and all being spot-on for the roles: Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub, Michael Keaton and the ubiquitous John Ratzenberger. Look out during the end credits for a rather humorous skit that satirizes how Ratzenberger seems to be in every Pixar movie.Good soundtrack too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Solidly assembled, amazingly animated.","I saw a sneak preview of this film last night, which played to a packed auditorium in an area theatre, comprised of an audience who won tickets from various media outlets. I must say that I was completely impressed with this latest Pixar outing and I almost dare say it was among the best animated features I have ever seen. It is almost hard to say ""animated"", because it looks like the bar for computer animation has been risen yet again by Pixar. There was the well-animated details of the cars, with great expression and fluidity, and the backgrounds and scenery was just jaw-dropping and nearly seemed photo-realistic.The movie is incredible on so many levels. It is easy to forget that the cars are just cars, and you begin to relate to them on a people-like level. They are made to have easily identifiable facial expressions, which are animated well.Going into the movie, I thought that it would focus too much on racing, since NASCAR related stuff seems to be all the rage now. But, the back story of learning to do things like not taking bad shortcuts with life and not being so selfish and inconsiderate, really takes the fore in this film. We could all learn from these ""car-acters"".I definitely recommend this film, no matter if you're into racing or wouldn't even know what a ""bump draft"" is.And, of course... remember to stay until the very very end of the movie, otherwise, you'll miss some cool stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""Keep it wheel""","A hot-shot race-car named Lightning McQueen gets waylaid in Radiator Springs, where he finds the true meaning of friendship and family.Pixar's movies have never became a disappointment. It easily draws into childhood imagination and memories, making us enjoy the little things. And in 2006, when everybody thought their streak would end, Cars proves that it has not. While not being the best Pixar movie (most possibly the worst one) I'm still saying Cars is a great movie. And that is pretty darn cool. From the everything, you can talking cars isn't the most imaginative idea, but still holds up very well. The voice acting, directing, messages, and overall everything still has that magic Pixar touch. So nothing missing there... Only complain is, the movie cannot compare to the magical expression that Finding Nemo or Toy Story has. Again, this is still calling Cars a great movie. Nothing else really to say to this film. Although possibly Pixar's worst, Cars is still considered a great animation. Everything was expected and everything was enjoyable. Kids will probably love it and the rest will cherish it's message and carry on. I enjoyed myself as well. Great movie, lots of fun, and another great Pixar film.

Disappointing compared to Incredibles or Nemo,"I'm a big fan of Pixar: I've loved all their movies up until Cars. But I find it a huge disappointment.After watching Cars, I watched Finding Nemo and The Incredibles to confirm that it was markedly inferior, and I was astonished at the lack of inventiveness or creativity in Cars.Cars reminds me most of the mediocre animated movie Robots: Simple animation (no hair, no muscles, no clothing), simple settings, simple story.What is new in Cars? What is unique? The settings were ho-hum, the characters stereotyped and boring.Granted, my view might be tainted by the whole NASCAR milieu: it reeks of rednecks and racism, but ignoring that, the animation and story are still mediocre.Compare with the Incredibles: Several individual _scenes_ in the Incredibles are superior to the entire Cars movie. Consider the scenes in E's house; or the ""getting in shape"" montage; or the glaring-fluorescent workplace of Insuricare. These scenes from The Incredibles are unique, inspiring, humorous, jaw-dropping. The same could be said for several scenes from Finding Nemo.But Cars? Hmmm ... what scene is special? Maybe the neon-lighting ceremony at nightfall? But that is it.I get the feeling that J. Lasseter had a personal affection for the subject matter, and hoped his enthusiasm would carry the story. But I think many of us did not grow up with his love of cars (perhaps we are younger?).Lasseter, of course, deserves tremendous credit for Pixar's success: he had a hand in every prior Pixar movie. But was that the problem? Did no one at Pixar have the courage to tell him ""look, this story is lame, and the animation is ho-hum""?",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Definitely in First Place,"This was definitely a good movie. Kept me smiling and laughing all the way through. Not only was the acting (voices) good, there was actually a moral of the story: don't lose yourself in all the fame and glory, and don't forget your friends, or how you got there. And it had a happy ending, which is always good. Especially for a comedy, it's got to have a good ending otherwise what was the point in watching the movie? Out of all the characters, Mater was my favorite. They picked the perfect person to do the voice for him, Larry the Cable Guy. He didn't have to create an accent or anything, that's how he really is. This movie is good on so many levels, for adults or kids alike. But what I really like is that all the characters in the movie were vehicles. The audience at the races, the pit crews, the lost couple and even the bugs. And when it came to the Tractor Tipping, I couldn't stop laughing. At first I thought the scene was out of place but it wasn't. Then the small movie with Mater and the Blue Light and the Screaming Banshee, was definitely something to watch. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh and likes movies that make you feel good afterwards. I've heard rumors about them making a sequel, I say no. Leave a good thing alone.

Doc Hollywheels,"Well, what can we say? It's Doc Hollywood on wheels.Only not quite. The Michael J. Fox original was the story of a lone man with no soul, who was kindly provided one by the inhabitants of small-town America. It's about the development of an individual.Pixars' Cars, on the other hand, is the story of a small town in need of re-energizing, which is kindly provided an infusion of energy by a lone man..er, car. It's about the development of a community.This difference affects not only the individual characterizations, but the overall thrust of the narrative, the humor, even the artwork. The foreground characters sometimes disappear into vast landscapes, particularly during an extended middle digression of some ten or so minutes in which Sally Porsche, our heroine, introduces Lightning McQueen to the virtues of small town life, meandering along Route 66, quaint hotels, and the painted desert.For all its occasional preachiness about the glories of small-town life, and the need for inspiring heroes are good by virtue of their character rather than their athleticism, at no time is your heart in danger here: there's nothing like the poignancy of Buzz Lightyear's fall in Toy Story, much less Jesse's reminiscence scene in Toy Story 2. There's not even the real tension and family feeling of Finding Nemo. Cars don't have families, and struggle though they have to personalize these mechanisms, the Pixar animators simply can't add the rough physicality necessary to convey broad emotion to something which has to keep 4 wheels on the ground. It's fine popcorn fare, sometimes amusing, and harmless fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Runs well on all cylinders,"A road racing good time for adults and kids alike. Well-defined and appealing characters, a number of sight gags and one-liner jokes, an easy plot to follow, several well integrated back-stories, and more are coordinated for a fast and fun ride. When the characters reach the finish line, the story has emphasized the importance of friendship, trust, loyalty, responsibility, and kindness.Wild, brash, reckless, and self-focused race car Lightning McQueen is en route to a three-way racing duel to determine a racing champion. Along the way, however, fate steps in to divert him to a bypassed and forgotten town along the old route 66. McQueen's new friends in this town bring him revelations about what kinds of things are really important and valuable; and his resulting metamorphosis serves as the impetus for a very upbeat finale.Since the Pixar folks have created a universe populated only by cars (humans do not exist at all in this universe--unlike other Pixar films), most of the jokes will follow an automobile-reference theme. These and other cultural in-jokes are numerous in the movie and will go way over a kid's head. Still, families should be able to enjoy this movie together, as there's enough silly slapstick and goofy humor at a kid's level to keep them involved; mostly provided by the cleverly written supporting ""comic relief"" characters. Look closely at the flies buzzing around for one of the movie's best sight gags.Good natured entertainment with heart that conveys a nice message. Highly recommended for adults and children alike. Be sure to hang around as the credits roll, as an epilogue provides a few additional gags, and ties up loose ends from various sub-plots.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The ""starring"" cars themselves are as anthropomorphic as Pixar could make them, a vast improvement over Disney's old cartoon,""Suzie, The Little Blue Coupe."" Each car has a distinct personality. The best are Tow Mater, the tow truck, and Fillmore, the 1960s Volkswagen bus who, if he were human, would be referred to as an ""old hippie."" Lots of clever car-related gags too.

Many of the jokes were geared more for adults, especially many of the jokes about between the main character and the Porsche. I also found the movie to be quite predictable after the main character got stuck in the small town. It was cute but nowhere near the top quality of other Disney/Pixar movies such as Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and the Incredibles.

Another Pixar Classic!,"Over the past decade or so, Pixar and Disney has combined for many hit movies with Pixar being at least seven. This movie is one of them. It has the same feel as a Pixar film even though talking animals are out of the picture. This movie is creative with the use of talking cars. It does not mean Hollywood is running out of ideas even though that might be the case.This film is about a rookie racecar named Lightning McQueen.

Now he has to follow the demands of a small town and get back to the race in time.Well, there is plenty of voice talent.

Another great one from Pixar,I just saw this movie at a free preview screening and thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. The movie had plenty of really good laughs and some good warmhearted moments. Pixar has show that they would rather put out a couple really good movies over a few years then 10 half-decent movies a year.One of the things you'll notice first about this movie is there are no humans whatsoever. You have to suspend your belief for a bit as you enter a world where everything from cars to blimps and helicopters are alive. But the filmmakers do such a good job enveloping you in that world that you don't even notice.Another great thing about the movie is the little touches. Like the fact that the little bugs flying around are actually tiny little Volkswagen Beetles. The detail on the cars themselves isn't up to the standards of something like The Incredibles but the scenery is just gorgeous. You see these beautiful landscapes that just seem so real and seem to go on for miles. But thankfully the cars blend in well with everything else and don't look out of place.All of the voice acting in the movie was superb. Owen Wilson does a great job in his first voice acting job. I think this really says something because he has a huge amount of dialog in the movie. When it comes to the voices there wasn't one that stole the show like Ellen in Finding Nemo but Larry the Cable Guy did a fantastic job as Mater. He has some of the funniest lines in the movie and they also managed to work in all of his catchphrases. I would also like to add that the casting of Cheech Marin as a low rider and George Carlin as a hippie Volkswagen Microbus are perfect.I would recommend this movie to anyone that has children and anyone who has enjoyed any of the previous Pixar movies. Also if you are a bit of a car nut like me you'll enjoy it just to see the personalities of each of the cars. I give this movie a 9 out of 10 and it ranks up there with the best Pixar has done to date.,9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Good But Not Super Unleaded,"23 June 2006. Cars sputters its engines out of the starting block, overly long, and not as funny as previously animated blockbusters, provides a continuing look at the progress of animation technique that threatens to become indistinguishable from live action. While the trend of this form of animation towards realism will likely pose serious dilemmas for future movie makers, currently as provided in Cars, the animation is at times superb and at other times flat and artificial. The inconsistency of presentation is a major distraction. Car does possess good substance, a decent storyline, with some cute one-liners for car racing fans. Yet the flow of the movie is oddly flat for the first third of the movie. The rapid fire funny scenes are missing that the audience has come to expect with no constant sidekick.

I would recommend this to all parents, you'll love it as much as the kids. Owen Wilson and Paul Newman are great in their respective roles.

Cars had no bad guys and the only tension was provided by trying to keep my kids quiet.It is inconceivable to me what people see in this movie. Is it not obvious that besides having name actors and a nice look, this movie was booooooring? Bah.I have grown to appreciate kids movies in recent years. It is clear what they need: some action, some tension, music/singing is good, but mostly  bad guys. They need clear delineation of who is good and who is bad. Just having the nearly wooden Owen Wilson search for himself in the guise of a sports car does not cut it. (There was a small scene with the bad guy/car gang on the highway, but it seemed forced and had no further impact in the movie.)

If you keep talking to yourself people will think you're crazy.

He gets community service. This also has more empathy for immigrants than A Bug's Life, from the same studio.By now, you know what Pixar brings to the table: emotionally resonant story, talented voice actors, memorable characters, detailed and highly effective animation that uses color and lighting really well, jokes for adults and ones for kids, very exciting action, and a fun world - here, all people and various other living creatures, including bugs and farm animals, are cars and other vehicles.I recommend this to everyone. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
About as much fun as blowing a tyre in the fast lane of a motorway.,"Cars screeches off the starting grid with an action packed race sequence but loses control pretty quickly afterwards, ending up as a saccharine-sweet wreck of a film. I found Pixar's latest movie to be a charmless and rather dull effort, lacking the sharp humour evident in much of their earlier output.Lightning McQueen is a cocky little race car looking to win his first major event, The Piston Cup, and, subsequently, receive a massive sponsorship deal. But en route to the finals, he becomes stranded in the small town of Radiator Springs, where he accidentally damages the main road. Sentenced to repair the damage he caused, Lightning spends the next few days fixing the road but, as he gets to know the lovable inhabitants of the sleepy town, he learns that there is much more to life than winning races.Far too long, with a painfully slow second act, Cars needed a lot more laughs and a bit more action in order to succeed. With perhaps only a couple of decent jokes during its excruciatingly long 121 minute running time, this movie would have benefited from a major script overhaul, or alternatively, perhaps it would have been better off being scrapped entirely.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Nostalgic/Nostalgia.,"Wow, I Found So Many Bad Reviews On The 2nd Movie. I Thought These Movies, Including Cars 2 Were Amazing. I Used To Watch This & Cars 2 When I Was Little, I Loved Them A-LOT, & I Still Do. But Cars 3 Was The Best Trilogy Of This Franchise. Lightning McQueen Is A Brave Race-Car. Tow Mater The Tow-Truck Is The Best Character. Sally Carrera Is Nice. Flo Is Not The Best, Just Decent. Ramone Is Amazing, Especially When He Changes His Paint Every 1nce In Awhile. Luigi & Guido Are Good Characters. Fillmore Awesome. Sarge Is Not The Best, But Great. Sheriff Is Amazing. Doc Is A Good Character (R. I. P). Red The Firetruck Is Relatable, When He's Shy. Lizzie Is Funny. Frank Is Hilarious, Especially When He Chases Down Lightning McQueen & Mater At My Favorite Part. Chick Hicks Makes A Good Villain. The King Is While Not The Best, But Amazing. The Tuner Cars Boost, DJ, Wingo, & Snot-Rod Are Badass.This Movie, & Cars 2 Were Nostalgic/Nostalgia. I Think Cars 3 Was The Best Cars Movie.

A so-so movie,"**Disclaimer** I'm not a NASCAR fan, never have been and never will be. However I do know much of the history of NASCAR and its drivers as I was ""force fed"" as a child with the rest of my family being huge fans. I am a ""car"" lover though.Now that I've ""disclaimered"" everyone let me say that I did ""get"" all of the references to: the drivers ( young and old ), cars ( new and old ), pedigree ( Ferrari, Hudson ) and living in Route 66 Americana ( I worked in Holbrook, AZ for 8 years ).I still left this movie feeling empty. There simply wasn't enough ""fun stuff"" to entertain me. The jokes were few and far between and it seems like there was about an hour of the movie in the middle where they only thing ""funny"" was hearing how stupid ""Mater"" sounded ( More about that later ). Having said all of that the animation was excellent; the voice talents were also spot-on.Now for a few things that really bugged me. Was it really necessary to make fun of Mater just for the way he talked and that he had buck teeth?",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Very good,"Gentlemen and gentlemen ... start your engines!
With an exciting opening led by a well-played 'rock', the adventure begins in the traditional molds of films starring humans, quickly introducing the protagonist (Lightning McQueen) and antagonists of the story.Interesting to note that in the trailer it seemed to be a film about racing like Days of Thunder, which is the passion of the Americans. Fortunately, Carros is more than that and engages one gear after another, addressing a legitimate and human history, but full of games with the automobile world. And all very well thought out. From the symbol of the film with the 'V' of classic V8 engines to LightYear tires, a clear allusion to the traditional American tire brand GoodYear and also to the priceless Buzz LightYear, created by John Lasseter in the successful Toy Story.As in recent animations, the family is the target audience. Therefore, there are many quotes for adults, which are meaningless for children, but make no difference to them. Examples include famous names such as Rock Hudson in the character Doc Hudson, Jay Leno in Jay Limo, pilot Mario Andretti, among others. And there are also scenes from classics like Youth Transviated, E.T., Extra-terrestrial., Immediate Third Degree Contacts and a sentence by Sharon Stone in Wild Instinct: ""I provoke the most primitive instincts in 'cars'"".Even Fast and Furious gets a quote, in the approach of Mack (partner truck of the hero of the story) in the middle of the road and in the scene of the train line. The sequence that the tunados play Kenny G (a successful saxophonist, who has become synonymous with brega) is very good for doping Mack. The engine speed is already high and then you ask: but what does the film have to tell? Cars overlooks two very current issues that are (pun intended) the speeding promoted by technology and the advance of the signal with the lack of solidarity. And so, the paths are covered very safely in the curves and straights of a well-tied script. Anyone who has a minimum of knowledge and / or connection with the automobile world will be able to enjoy the author's trip more. It's fact.After all, the richness of details contributes a lot to bring the work closer to perfection. There are, for example, an Italian owner of a tire shop played by a Fiat Topolino and whose assistant is a Romiseta. The duo, of course, is in love with Ferrari! And there is also Ramon. A genuine Impala representing the low-rider crowd. Even the van (immortalized by Hanna-Barbera in Scooby-Doo) has its hippie version in this work. His passages yield a good laugh, like the mania to listen in the morning to the American national anthem in the classic rock version of Hendrix as a counterpoint to the Sarge, a military Jeep that has not yet forgotten its barracks past.Everything connected to the American vehicle industry gets a ride in the movie. The character Rei, for example, is a Corvette. If you want to have quality on the tracks of life you have to ""float"" like a Cadillac, says idol Doc Hudson to McQueen. The traditional Route 66, immortalized in the minds of millions of people around the world (even if not from the beat generation), is also there in the form of the unforgettable road sign or in music. And so on. That s America! Rest assured. The program is guaranteed. And the kids have everything to really enjoy this adventure. And as one of the songs in the film says: 'life is a highway' and making real friends is the best of prizes. Have a good trip!I liked this criticism of AdoroCinemaFilm seen on June 6, 2020.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great animated comedy starring Owen Wilson,"It was great to see Owen Wilson in the lead role as hotshot car Lightning McQueen and real racing driver and seasoned actor Paul Newman who plays Doc (Newman was in his eighties when filming).It has some good music and the animation is very sleek, story is also above average and has some good morals about winning and losing; as well as not doing everything as quickly as you can, take it slow.8/10: One of Pixar's better films",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Everything we've already seen from Pixar a billion times before...,"Toy Story - Great! Fresh, and new nice touch. Toy Story 2 - Still great but how about a change in scenery from the toy thing Bugs Life - Alright, not perfect but alright Monsters Inc. - Great movie but a little samey... Finding Nemo - Mmm... OK Incredibles - At last! A different approach! Cars - Holy crap! this is just terrible!Why is Cars terrible? Number one: Same old Pixar thing. Now this is the worst problem of all... there is not a hint of originality in this waste of money, it's just a money grabbing scheme by some money grabbing executives who are taking what 'Toy Story' started several miles too far!Number two: Owen Wilson. Oh my god, was he just terrible. He acts the same way in all of his movies, when he gets frustrated he gets that thing in his voice, and he sounds like scratched record. So imagine having to listen to a scratched record for 2 hours. Its about as much fun as carefully inserting jagged, infected needles into your ears while listening to the same crappy Andrew Lloyd Webber musical on full blast. (for those who enjoy creative insults, write that one down)Number three: Dislikeable characters. Yep.. thats right, I'll be scalded by many, but I don't care! All of the characters were downright horrible. First there's Lightning McQueen (great name idiots) this... jerk who turns into a dumb pansy at the end. And that brown towing truck guy just looked, sounded and acted like a retard. If that was a real person I doubt any living creature could stand more than 32 second of him without gutting themselves. i could go on but I think Im in enough trouble by the Pixar fanatics. Thats right, watch Cars over and over until the next one comes out. Then you'll be saying ""Cars... who"". Does anyone even remember Toy Story?Number four: CARS!!!!! Am I the only one who knows how completely stupid this is. Toy's are okay, so are fish and superheroes. But CARS!!!!! Thats the stupidest thing since MacGuyver! Im getting angry now.But why the hell did I give it a 2 then?The race scenes are pretty cool actually. But its not enough to mask this stench. If you saw Cars and liked it, its only because its the only thing your mommy will let you see. Right, now take it easy, eat a bowl of Cheetos and drink your orange juice like a gooood boy. Make sure its in the plastic cup though, so there isn't any 'oopsies'.Cars. 1/5 Expectation. 3/5",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Surprisingly relevant today,"This film has its flaws but it's still a very solid film and a childhood classic for most people.The part I most appreciate about this film after watching it at an older age is the theme of old ideas, places and even people being replaced with more modern alternatives.A main plot point of the film is that route 66 was once a place full of life and offered the cars a place socialise and enjoy driving through, until it was eventually replaced by an interstate that just made the journey a bit quicker, but simultaneously lost all of the social enjoyment the drive would once have. This plot point in a way mirrors the world we live in today. It reminded me about blockbusters, which was a tangible place to search for films and socialise, and how it was gradually taken over by streaming services and eventually shut down. The same thing is happening with shops and restaurants, where most people want to have things ordered online and to their doorstep instead of going to the place itself. While these modern alternatives might be easier and more ideal, are we losing what made these activities so enjoyable in the first place?""Cars didn't drive on it to make good time, they drove on it to have a great time""I feel like cars has surprisingly aged very well, and each time I watch it, I find the route 66 aspect of the film more relatable and very relevant, even if that wasn't the pure intention of the film.

"This movie wasn't so much ""awful"", as...","Just plain /mediocre/, apart from the animation, which I choose not to rate on this site. I found it to be typically inane Disney fare, and if I'd actually contributed anything more than an evening to watching it -- it was part of dinner and a movie with my parents, who walked out fairly early after paying for it (which was the buzz we heard on The Omen remake, BTW (a vastly superior movie to this one, IMHO), a guard outside the SilverCity mentioning that people had walked out of the latter movie before it ended looking very put out, advice my parents regretted giving any attention) -- I would have been royally ticked off. As it was, I felt the loss of the evening quite painfully, since I had been hoping to see tO for weeks, but lacked either the time or the money until this month.

Scrap,"Admitedly I wasn't compelled to see this at the movies, But my friend had it on DVD and i watched it and to be honest, I just didn't like it.The characters were there but they felt like just a sting of stereotypes - The mentor with a secret, the cocky rookie who makes good, the sweet girl, the hippi, the deliveranceman. It all rang with false sentimentality. Real false.With these movies you always know pretty much how it's going to end, but it's the journey getting there that is entertaining (like the much superior Finding Nemo - Of course he is going to find him, but the journey, characters and all that were fantastic)Reading the last paragraph made a thought came into my mind which could really sum up what was lacking, A character you want to see win.You loose the main character at the start due to him being such a SOB You loose most of the town folk because they essentially take a man (car) prisoner and depriving him (it) of his freedom. You loose the nice chick cause she is just so freakin nice i wanted to dent her fender. and you loose the mentor with a secret because you just don't give a crap.I mean, the cartoon shown before it (with the little girl and the steet buskers) was about 200% better than the (dare i say it) dreck that went after.This movie IS the empty cup.

A Pixar masterpiece 8/10,"""Cars"" is among the best movies to have ever come from Pixar animation studios. Along with movies like ""Toy Story"", ""Finding Nemo"", ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Up"" and etc. What Cars and the rest of the movies mentioned have in common are both the original ideas for the movies and the fact that they all have deep meanings about family and friendship. Those features appear in Cars and have a lot of impact on the movie's plot: a young champion wishes to have all the glory and fame in the world until he gets caught in a town nowhere and learns the true meaning of friendship and family. A wonderful story that impacts it's viewers till this day. A movie that everyone will enjoy and love, I've watched it a million times and it's one of my favorite movies of Pixar. The characters are hilarious and awesome: Lightning Macween is an amazing character that I'm sure everyone loves, Doc Hodson is the mentor and father figure. Mater is the funny guy and jokester. All the other characters are unique and perfect. I still don't see how this didn't win an academy award for best animated picture.

This is a slow grower,"It took me a few times of watching Cars before it became a delight to see it. In fact, I started off feeling a shade disappointed by the movie, feeling that the humor in some places flopped because they tried too hard to be funny and feeling that the message was clichéd.But make no mistake: Pixar's Cars is a first class movie that embodies something wonderful. Where it lacks in originality of content, it makes up for in resonance. All of us look back on the past with a shiny glow in our minds, because we grow older feeling that we've lost something of the innocence of our youth. And to have that more than effectively communicated by cars for characters is icing on the cake. The resolution to the last race is a stroke of brilliance that delivers a strong message, a happy ending, and with a twist that I didn't see coming. It is truly a movie for all ages and will delight them all. As I said, the movie was a slow grower, but oh so worth it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The Best Part of My Childhood,"Disney Pixar Cars was released in 2006, the first time I saw this movie I think I was around 3 or 4 years old. I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it, this is my favorite and the best Disney Pixar film of all time, the emotions and the feelings when I watch this movie, I feel so excited, thrilled, and sad, I got goosebumps, it's an emotional rollercoaster with ups and downs throughout the journey of ""Lightning McQueen"" that I enjoy from the start to finish. It is really the best part of my childhood.This shiny red young racecar named ""Lightning McQueen"" with an Iconic opening scene motivating himself saying his iconic line ""Speed. I am speed. One winner, forty-two losers. I eat losers for breakfast. Focus. Speed. Faster than fast, quicker than quick. I am Lightning."" Then coming out of his trailer revving his engine and then doing his signature ""Ka-Chow"" pose the first time I saw this it got me so excited and still gives me goosebumps to this day.McQueen is a hot-shot rookie Piston Cup racer, he is super selfish, arrogant, self-centered, and overconfident at the beginning because the first time he came in this competition he almost won but ended with a three-way tie. But when he gets stranded alone in the sleepy desert town of Radiator Springs changes everything,In Radiator Springs, he forms friendships with Tow Mater the rusty loveable tow truck who is now Lightning McQueen's best friend, Mater is so good with his best friend and this made me want to treat my friends right, Sally, a charming Porche 911 whom Lightning McQueen loves at first sight and are now in love with each other and last but not least Doc Hudson who dislike Lightning for being a racecar. But Lightning then discovered that Doc Hudson was the legendary ""Fabulous Hudson Hornet""What I love most is how these characters teach valuable life lessons. Mater's importance of friendship through his simple actions. Sally's taking things slow and appreciates every moment. And Doc Hudson's overcoming challenges and finding redemption.Visually the animation is so good, the animations of the cars look just like real cars, the racing scene when the animations of the cars race and when Lightning McQueen passes through all the cars is so exciting to watch and makes me want to see it more. The colors of red shiny Lightning McQueen make him look so cool and the gradient colors of the sunset scene look just like real life. The soundtrack when cars are racing gives me an adrenaline rush, it makes the scene much more exciting. The soundtrack of this movie like ""Life is a Highway"", ""Real Gone"" and ""Sh-Boom"" are so iconic. The idea of making this movie, they make cars act like a human they can talk and like fist bump cars do tire bumps, it is so creative some of the things cars do in this movie make me immediately get it in human terms. Each of the characters has their own style and behaves differently. The movie teaches all about friendship, nostalgia for the open road, slowing down and appreciating life, moving forward despite your past, finding yourself, and learning that life isn't always about winning.I can't say enough about this film, it is the best animated film there is and it will always be my favorite, it holds a special place in my heart and after all these years I still find myself coming back and watching Cars every few months and I have been a big fan since then and I will be forever.

Infantilism for baby boomers,"Leave it to Pixar Animation to do away with people and replace them with talking cars. The idea itself is impersonal, and the results (heavy with both talk and auto-slapstick) are distinctly disengaged--unless you're a 10-year-old boy or his auto-enthusiast father. Lightning McQueen, a hot-shot race-car and the rookie sensation of the year, lands in a three-way tie for the Piston Cup and must drive cross-country to California to compete in the championship. Along the way, he falls out of his transport truck (whose back door apparently goes down and back up without being noticed) and gets himself cited for recklessness in a dirt town named Radiator Springs. Having the hero of this story forced into doing community service may serve as an unsubtle lesson for kids to take it easy on the roads, but for an animated comedy it isn't very funny. Lightning's detour amongst the hicks--who keep him there against his will--proves to be the centerpiece of the plot! While the viewer waits for somebody to let out the emergency brake, the filmmakers go crazy with the buck-teeth satire. It's ""Hee Haw"" on wheels. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Don't come to this movie expecting an Oscar worthy storyline or vast originality in terms of plot, because if you do, you will watch this movie in disgust and write a review slandering it as something not to be seen by anybody, anytime, anywhere. I'm tired of reading those reviews by film snobs who aren't looking at this film with a balanced mind.Lightning McQueen is trying to win the Piston Cup and learns a few life lessons along the way. Great material to teach the children who watch this film how to become more sportsmanlike. Other than that, this movie satisfies the most detail oriented car buffs to heavenly bliss.

"That's ""Mater"" Without the Tow","This is just a load of animated fun. Our dearest possessions, our cars, are made anthropomorphic, and take on the personalities of their functions. The old tow truck, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, is my favorite character, and he functions as the voice of the drawling hick. The sports car is reckless and unpredictable. Of course, vehicles of law enforcement have their own way of acting as well. So the creators have put together an entire subculture where these vehicles are the stars. It sounds silly until we begin to be engaged in their roles. There are protagonists, antagonists, characters of comic relief, just like any movie, animated or not. Pixar has masterfully connected what would have been flat animated images and brought them to life. I'm not much of a car fancier, but this one still got me. There's adventure, romance, and a race.

Indycar racing is dull and almost unknown to Europeans- which does not help. Many of the other clichés are again almost unknown outside the US of A, and even as a Brit who has lived in the midwest they rankle.

Every time when the scene when Lighting McQueen pulls out his tongue comes on, I pull out mine too!

Doc Hudson is also a great character, I like how he starts as an old grouchy regular car, But then lighting McQueen discovery's that he'd used to be an old famous racing legend. The ending race was amazing and great, and it was great when lighting McQueen helped The King push him to the finish line. I don't understand why people say this is an ok movie!

Definitely Not Pixar's Best,"I am actually a bit of Pixar myself. Some of their movies, like ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredibles"", are my all time favorites. However, Cars really just didn't grab me when I first watched it. It's a rather sweet film (I guess), with good animation, but there's something lacking in this one.The story follows Lightening Mcqueen, a hotshot race car, whose dream is to win the major, important grand race (I forgot what it was called). However, after qualifying, on the way there, his ride falls asleep and Mcqueen falls out. In his frantic search back he gets lost and stumbles upon a little has been town known as Radiator Springs. Here, he begins to find himself, and see what's really important in life (or something).I know I probably sound very uncaring about this movie, but that's its problem; it is a dull movie. I remember this first time I watched it, I saw it with my nephew. He seemed really entertained (maybe because he actually likes playing with cars), but I was bored.What's really missing from this movie are the creative, engaging characters found in a lot of other Pixar films. Most of the characters are just flat, and boring. I never really empathized with Mcqueen or any of his back road friends. Another thing that brought the movie down were the titular characters, the cars. Maybe it's just me, but the usage of cars in a movie is just not that entertaining. I don't mind cars a side characters (""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", for example), but when they're the main focus there's nothing that attention grabbing. Though there are a few funny car-related jokers here and there (i.e. falling asleep at the wheel), over all, it doesn't work.The plot line is rather drab and seems to be recycled from other Pixar works. And in the end the morals that are presented are either so over used or not well presented that they really don't seem to matter that much. Also, another thing that drags ""Cars"" down, is, though the animation is well done, the overall color schemes is not that appealing. The whole cast and background are really dull colors that don't didn't catch my eye at all.Unless you find the idea of a movie about automatic vehicles the greatest thing ever, ""Cars"" is really not worth the time.

"Saw it, loved it","I went to see this with a friend and her young son and was pleasantly surprised. I'm a big 'whose voice is that' person and loved hearing Tony Shaloub, Larry the Cable Guy, Paul Newman, etc... as the cars. I thought the animation was breathtaking cause at times I couldn't figure out if some of the desert scenery was animated or not. I thought the original songs were great and the non-original songs well used. I've not seen the other films put out by Pixar since I'm not an 'animated' film person but the quality of this film makes me wonder if I shouldn't consider watching the others.

Excellent movie for the whole family...,"This movie opened here in Sydney, Australia today and my son was eager to see it so I took him as soon as I picked him up from daycare.I knew he was going to love it but I also found myself enjoying it very much. At times I couldn't control myself and burst out laughing aloud. I think it loosened up some of the other adults in the cinema and they started laughing as well.The graphics were awesome. The amount of details such as reflections in each scene, etc was amazing. I need to own this movie. If only they were taking advanced orders for the DVD already.In a nutshell, the movie is about Lightning McQueen's awakening from being a selfish, arrogant person/ car to one who realises the value of friendship. A truly feel-good movie for the whole family.The only thing that bothered me in regards to my son was the one part where there was name calling - the part where someone referred to McQueen as a moron/ retard (can't remember). I just didn't want my son picking that up and referring to other kids in that way. But that was very slight. One word, two seconds. The rest of the movie was amazing. For the first time my son sat still for a whole two hours!! Well done, Pixar. An amazing movie that I want to own already. I hope they make a sequel and put as much effort into the story and character development as they did in this one.Do yourselves a favour and see this for yourselves and if you have kids, take them along.

Ka-chow!,"Pixar had been celebrating 20 years after founding their company in 1986. In they have been making stories on toys, bugs, monsters, fish, and superheroes. The folks who made Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Monsters, Incorporated, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, take us to win the big race in Cars. In the story, a hotshot red rookie race car named Lightning McQueen is living life in the fast line, and is excited to win his first Piston Cup trophy. At the final race of the season, he has tied for first place with his rivals, Strip Weathers professionally known as the King of Dinoco who has been winning the trophy seven times and is looking forward to retire, and Chick Hicks, The King's longtime rival, bent on winning by cheating his way to the top. A rematch is scheduled a week later in Los Angeles, California. Lightning wants to become the first car to reach the stadium and win the trophy. But on the way, he gets detoured on Route 66 and accidentally ruins the main road of a small run-down town on Route 66 called Radiator Springs. He gets sentenced to community service and repave the road. But while he does so, he begins to warm up to the town and makes friends with the folks of Radiator Springs: the local judge and medical doctor Doc Hudson, who holds a secret related to Lightning's racing, Sally Carrera, the town lawyer who becomes his new girlfriend, Tow Mater, a rusty, but trusty tow truck who becomes his best friend, Luigi and Guido, a duo of car from Italy, Flo, a 1960's show car and her detailed husband Ramone, Lizzie, the widow of the town's founder Stanley, a chill Volkswagen van named Fillmore, the town sheriff, a dutiful Army Jeep named Sarge, and Red, the town's local fire truck. They help Lightning realize there is more to life than racing and winning. Cars is not about racing, it's about the journey and the long road ahead on Route 66, and shows the heart and charm of the American road.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Very Disappointing,"I took my four year old to see Cars and we were so disappointed. My daughter has loved Pixar movies since she was about two and a half. We have watched Toy Story 1 and 2, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., A Bug's Life and The Incredibles over and over. Those movies are so engaging. We were about five minutes into Cars and my daughter turned to me and said ""Mom, when is the movie going to start?"" It went right over her head. I think the plot and action were not accessible to young kids. What do they know about cars and the history of Route 66? The theater was relatively crowded and no one was laughing. The plot seemed very tired and predictable. Also, I thought the cars seemed oddly lifeless even though they were moving with great energy around the screen. Pixar was able to make fish seem warm and cuddly, but,in my opinion, they were unable to create that kind of magic with Cars. After my daughter finished her M&M's, she became too bored to stay, so we left before it was over.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Another Animation Success,"Pixar has proved its animation metal a few times. FINDING NEMO and THE INCREDIBLES are their most notable achievements, pulling off excellent scripts mixed with fun animation and great star-power voices.But the one thing that animation studios (including Pixar) have trouble with is displaying human beings within their animation. Many times they look plastic or stilted. The Incredibles avoided this by hearkening back to animations-of-ol' but applying new styles. Finding Nemo didn't have many human faces so it wasn't such a hurdle. With CARS, Pixar did something very wise: they didn't show a single human face. Personalities were under the hood (so to speak) of the automobiles which juxtaposed nicely with their humanity.The story follows a cocky up-and-coming race car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson, WEDDING CRASHERS) who's triple tie win forces a showdown in California where the three would-be winners will face off. Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton, FIRST DAUGHTER) and The King (racing icon Richard Petty) are the other two contestants and they make it to California without any problems. They are ready to win ""The Piston Cup."" But Lightning's driver Mack (John Ratzenberger, CHEERS TV series) falls asleep on the road and Lightning slides out the back (also while asleep) while on ""the highway."" Lightning soon wakes up and tries to find Mack, but stumbles upon a one-cylinder town along abandoned Route 66 called Radiator Springs. Unfortunately, Lightning also tears up the town's road and must do his civic duty by pulling the paving machine for the length of the city. Stuck without any resources, Lightning grudgingly does the job, but not before learning to slow his rpm's and smell the proverbial roses. He meets up with Radiator Spring's city attorney Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt, MONSTERS, INC.), a sexy little Porsche model whom he finds himself oddly attracted to. There's also Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, THE STING) the town's physician/judge who harbors a big secret; Ramone (Cheech Marin, TIN CUP), a low-riding, paint-shop owner; Luigi (Tony Shalhoub, GALAXY QUEST), a tire store proprietor with a love of Italian cars; and, of course, Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), the rusted out but trustworthy tow truck who adds the most hilarity to the film.Cars gushes with family friendly messages but no one should hold that against it. Animation features, by their very nature, are directed toward younger audiences and allowing that innocence to come out in Cars is pulled off well without becoming achingly super-sweet. But we've also learned that adults enjoy these movies and Cars does an admirable job of entertaining them, too. Most kids probably won't know what cow-tipping is, so might not understand the slow natured tractors that double as cattle and are tipped over by Mater and Lightning. But adults with experience in this area will probably laugh themselves silly.That there are no human faces in Cars also aided it immensely. Suspending disbelief was easy and will allow kids and parents alike a great ride throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A neat new theme and an inspiring story,"Cars brings the good heart of caring for one another and also that fame doesn't always mean everything will always be super, both with a theme of vehicles as people. The country theme as most of the whole was a nice pick for a film that had race car driving. Wilson makes a good voice act for the selfish-but-then-caring lead character, and Larry the cable guy portrays one hilarious hillbilly-like country folk. For the whole vehicle theme alone, there was some pretty clever parts for each of the cars themselves, including eyes on the windshield and the front wheels for the arms/hands. It was also interesting to see some references, including Dinaco being referred from Toy Story. Overall, like mentioned before, a very nice and inspiring story and a clever vehicle theme, while it may look a bit childish at first, that happens to be one of my favorites.

"""The Film That Made Me Who I Am""","Ok so just hear me out. Disney Pixar Cars is my all time favorite Disney Movie, yes it's not the best but it's still a great film and a fun one at best. It has a great story with Lighting McQueen who is a hot shot rookie racer who comes across an abandoned town and has to get used to the scenery around it which makes him miss his race, but in the end he learns a lot and it makes him realize that there is more to racing than just winning. The animation is beautiful and the characters are extremely likable and relatable. But the reason why I love this movie so much is because it made me who I am, and that's a race car driver. When I was young, this movie was a huge part of my childhood, watching it a lot with my family, playing with the toys, video games, and going to Disneyland to ride the Cars ride. This movie means so much to me as it taught me many things about not just racing, but good human qualities like being a good friend, learning from the best and accepting change. This movie also got me into my biggest hobby and that's racing. I became a huge NASCAR fan after the movie when I learned more about it and I instantly became hooked. But the biggest this movie has done is that it made me an actual race car driver. Racing has been a huge part of my life and it's been a dream of mine to become a race driver, and this movie did just that. It inspired me to become a driver, learn more about cars and try to follow your dreams of becoming a champion. Overall, I'm so grateful that this movie has done for me in the long run, as it made me who I am today. Cars is indeed a great film to watch especially for kids and families alike and this movie crosses the finish line and is a winner to everyone who watches it! And always remember, there is more to racing than just winning, and without your friends, your trophy is just an empty cup. Ka Chow!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Thought it was pretty predictable, and I have the same problem with cars as with fish (read: Nemo): I just don't care about them the same way I care about people/superheroes (my favorite movie from Pixar is the Incredibles), monsters or even bugs. In any case, Cars had little chance with me: I had a strong bad feeling about this one ever since I found out about it. I was hoping they could prove me wrong, but for me it just did not work.

Pixar strikes again!,"As far as CGI animation is concerned, the folks at Pixar remain king. While not quite as enchanting as their previous film ""The Incredibles"", ""Cars"" still delivers on all cylinders. It's a visual stunning and extremely funny adventure through the heart of Route 66.Pixar films are unrivaled when it comes to creating realities that are alternate to our own world. Like the toys in ""Toy Story"" and the monsters in ""Monsters Inc."" the cars of ""Cars"" seem so human that you forget that they are... well.... just cars.The premise of the film is simple. A cocky rookie race car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) get's caught up in a quest for the racing world's coveted ""Piston Cup."" While traveling to the cup's championship race McQueen get's detoured to a small Route 66 town called Radiator Springs. Once at Radiator Springs McQueen has to do a small service to the community before he can leave and participate in the ""Piston Cup's"" finale.Along the way McQueen meets up with a lovable cast of a unique characters. Most notably are Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) the rusty redneck truck, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) the 1950's hornet, Filmore (George Carlin) the stoner van, and Guido (who will no doubt be a fan favorite) the fork lift.For some the movie may drag a little in the mid-section. However, its the little touches that Pixar throws in that keep the film engaging and funny. The cars eat at gas station diners and sleep in garage motels. In probably the films most memorable scene Mater and McQueen do a small town right of passage with a hilarious twist. And it's this ability to create alternate universes while giving these ""objects"" human characteristics that make Pixar films so memorable.Fan's of CGI films may rejoice. Car's is an intriguing story with excellent animation and humor for both adults and kids alike. Definitely worthy of a nice family trip to the movie theater.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Another Pixar winner,"It has become a family tradition in our household to watch each new Pixar film on opening day... and often that means pulling the kids out of school for a ""family excursion"". Pixar never lets us down. A good reason for this is probably the length of time that they spend on a masterpiece making sure it is just right. Cars is no exception. I especially liked some of the big scenes that need to be seen in a theatre to do them justice. And it goes without saying that the animation is superb. Watch out for the history of Pixar films that weave their way in here and there... very cool. All-in-all a worthy feature with a feature length (2 hours) - Got my money's worth on this one.

Pixar makes history,"An intergenerational cultural phenomenon, while not the first feature film of its kind, Cars is undoubtedly the most beloved and remembered.A simple, trite and already seen story is reinterpreted by placing race cars at the center of the project. The selfish young protagonist faces the race of his life, to win the much-hyped Piston Cup: however, a series of unfortunate (or fortunate) events lead him to a remote town on Route 66, in which his view of the world will be completely overturned.Made in a prosperous period for racing, it does not innovate much, taking all the typical choices of a standard animated children's film. However, it has the merit of having rightfully entered the history of cinema, having made its mark on millions of kids who, even today, more than 15 years after its theatrical release, still remember with emotion the air of speed they breathed as children when watching Cars. The best and most exciting scenes are, in fact, those of pure competition on the track.Surely then, those who follow racing (Formula 1, Nascar or any other category) and those who adore cars in all their glory will love Cars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
a face-plant into a hot puddle of carburetor fluid,"Carsrating: 1.5 out of 4It was bound to happen. After one-upping itself over and again with pioneers and masterworks like Finding Nemo and The Incredibles, there had to be a stumble. Pixar's track record couldn't be that good. We just didn't expect Pixar to take a face-plant into a hot puddle of carburetor fluid.If an infant's picture book was the idea Pixar had in mind when they birthed this project, then maybe John Lasseter and his team deserve applause. Their film works on this level, refusing to smarten up or hunker down on any ounce of maturity. The fundamental error, perhaps, is that it asks us to relate to automobiles. Not just a world where automobiles keep their speech skills secret a la Toy Story, but a world made up entirely of cars. Even the flies swarming the light bulbs are VW Beetles. I can relate to superheroes, I can relate to fish, I can relate to monsters, I can even relate to bugs, but a machine that looks like my childhood Hot Wheels? Sorry. Giving a car googly-eyes and bumper lips does not make it human. And for that matter, the cars don't act human. The personalities of these characters mirror most of the characters I remember from a babysitting experience years ago, when I watched ""Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends"". They're broad and smeared with stereotype; kind, easy traits that reflect Cars' story.It's the tale of Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson) and his time spent in Radiator Springs, a backwater town that rests on the grave of Route 66. Stranded there a week before his big showdown with Chick Hicks (voice of Michael Keaton) and The King (voice of Richard Petty), Lightning gets himself mixed up with the locals and thrown into jail. The mayor of the town, Doc Hudson (voice of Paul Newman) and the prosecutor, Sally the Porsche (voice of Bonnie Hunt), sentence him to a road pavement job that will requires five days of work. Lightning's arrogant and huffy, steamed that he's stuck in a ghost town with the likes of Mater (voice of Larry the Cable Guy) the rusty tow-truck, and Ramone (voice of Cheech Marin) the custom paint-job fanatic. But his stay turns therapeutic once he softens up to Sally and finds there's more to a car's life than endorsements.Cars is, well, just very silly. Its story surrounds a life lesson, which is a formula that, when put to Pixar, stands a chance. Not a great chance, as central lessons tend to dilute otherwise human stories, but a Pixar-sized chance nonetheless. But the lesson turns infantile and the film moot, sullied probably by our enormous expectations. This stuff will work fine for your toddler, and maybe distract a wide-eyed nine year-old, but trying to compare it to The Incredibles is the only tear-jerking moment you'll have in the theatre. The art can be pretty, sure; but these days digital beauty is standard. And paired with the plastic-esquire car animations, the lovely backgrounds mean even less.Luckily for Pixar, their films aren't known for being Thomas the Tank Engine look-a-likes. Cars, let's decide, can be Pixar's single use of the Get Out of Jail Free card. Now they're back to square one. Their revenues probably won't be dented by this hiccup, since everyone's still giddy from The Incredibles. But when Ratatouille (Pixar's next project) is released next Summer, the film will have its share of skeptics. Ratatouille is headed up by Brad Bird, director of The Incredibles--and hardly anyone from this Cars hack-job is on the projectso we can at least expect a move to square two. For now, however, Pixar can go sit in the corner, hiding beneath its dunce cap.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Now that the two have more than adequately made amends, it is reassuring to know that Pixar (never having compromised, not even to the mouse that roared) has once again rolled another fine edition off the assembly line.The film's opening is not as easy to surrender to. Race cars have limited appeal to people but at some point you become hooked. Days later you might find yourself dumbfounded when, after telling a friend about the film, you marvel at how you cried in a movie that has talking cars! The one thing that's consistently great about Pixar movies is that they're always filled with a lot of joy and love and not in an embarrassing or overwrought way either.Make sure you get to the theatre on time. ""One Man Band,"" last years Oscar nominated short comes just before ""Cars,"" and will prime you for the atmosphere of next summer's Pixar film, ""Ratatouille,"" to which you get to see the trailer as well!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
More perfection from Pixar!,"It goes without saying that Pixar has perfected the art of giving human like qualities to both inanimate objects and animate creatures that we are not accustomed to having those qualities.They have once again combined their excellently detailed animation with a great story that you will be captivated by,and excellently voiced characters that you will come to care about.There is even a legendary Oscar winning actor in the voice cast in Paul Newman,as well as many other heavyweights that you will easily recognize.Stealing the show,however is none other than Larry the Cable Guy as Mater,the rusty old tow truck,but I am biased,as I am from the south.Pixar continues to get better with every passing year.My only concern for them is that they will one day run out of inanimate objects to give life to.Another thing I like about the film is it's combination of two of my young son's loves:animated movies and motorized vehicles.Well done Pixar,keep up the good work!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Lackluster Pixar Film That Fails to Hit Top Gear,"Cars is a 2006 animated film directed by John Lasseter. The movie takes place in a world where cars are the primary form of transportation and follows the story of Lightning McQueen, a hotshot race car who finds himself stranded in the small town of Radiator Springs. As he learns the importance of friendship and teamwork, Lightning must decide between his love of racing and the community he has grown to love.While the concept of a world populated entirely by cars is unique and imaginative, Cars fails to hit top gear in terms of storytelling and characters. The movie's pacing is slow, with the first half of the film feeling particularly sluggish.The characters are also somewhat forgettable, with Lightning McQueen coming across as a generic protagonist without much depth or personality. The supporting cast, including the love interest Sally and the mentor figure Doc Hudson, are similarly underdeveloped.While the animation is top-notch, with beautiful landscapes and meticulously rendered cars, it feels like a missed opportunity to showcase more of the world and its inhabitants. Additionally, some of the humor feels forced and falls flat, with jokes that may appeal more to younger viewers.However, the film does have some redeeming qualities. The soundtrack, featuring classic rock and country music, is enjoyable and helps to create a sense of atmosphere. The themes of friendship and teamwork are also important messages for children, and the movie's heartwarming ending is satisfying.Overall, Cars is a lackluster Pixar film that fails to hit top gear. While it has some enjoyable moments and important messages, it falls short in terms of pacing, character development, and humor. I would give Cars a 6/10 rating and recommend it mainly to die-hard Pixar fans or young children who may enjoy the colorful world and entertaining action sequences.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

For historical relevance, car accuracy, car culture accuracy oh and great story.Even if you don't like cars it must be a good movie, as I can't imagine what its like not to like cars, its wonderful.The roles are just right, brilliant cameos (not Cameros) trucks have solid axles, Porches sound like Porsches (911 not Boxster), Bugs are bugs and the voice of Steve McQueen.

And all the kids sat through it with out boredom, some laughed more than others but I cannot remember that last time a bunch this size stayed interested through 90 minutes let alone nearly 2 hours!

Typical Pixar quality and detail.As a vote of confidence nearly 20 of us are going to see it again this week. Again not even the Incredibles or Nemo got more than half of us to go a second time!And positive is the word, everyone came out feeling they enjoyed something from this movie and all found the experience positive, unlike too many recent flicks like say,... Pirates of the Carrib. II which most of us saw as well and most came out feeling a bit had even though no one actually disliked it, we just expected more.Again it is hard to see how Pixar will top this, but then I said that after Nemo as well, so I am ready to be stunned by the next Pixar masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The drive of your life,"I went to this film with mixed expectations. On one hand PIXAR have not failed me yet and on the other, it about Cars, why would I care? Would it be like watching Budgie the Helicopter or Thomas the Tank Engine?The answer is plain and simple...............NO!They've done it with Toys, Bugs, Monsters, Fish, Superheroes and now they've done it with Cars. By the phrase ""done it"" I mean created a believable world that you can have some form of connection with, to have an emotional attachment with the characters. Fantastic film for every reason possible, a great voice cast including Paul Newman and Owen Wilson and that old favourite from Toy Story and Monsters Inc and Cheers: John Ratzenberger!The film is clever, simple but effective plot, inventive, playful, great for adults as well as kids and above all one of the funniest films I have seen in ages!!I'm not a huge fan of NASCAR racing but the two main films I have seen covering this subject have both done it more than justice ""Days of Thunder"" and ""CARS"", the latter being markedly better than the former.Go watch it, don't let it pass you by.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar scores another victory,"It seems like when, every time, that small Disney-owned company in Emeryville, California comes out with an animated movie, it seems to captivate us and warm our hearts.

I'm not the hugest fan of Owen Wilson but I thought he did really well supplying the voice and adapting to the facial expressions of the main character, Lightning McQueen. And, of course, the CG graphics were superb. Larry The Cable Guy's timing is perfect in this movie, he comes out swinging in his role as Mater.This movie is a bona fide classic, which makes you want to say ""that NASCAR movie from the early 90s called Days of Something-or-another.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
disappointing,"I love Pixar movies and was still looking forward to Cars even though the clips I'd seen didn't exactly grab me. Sadly although visually it looked great I was so bored I actually considered leaving the theater which is rare for me. I think the problem was it lacked the compelling story, great characters and witty script I've come to expect from Pixar. They've always had the knack of appealing to all ages but this felt liked it was squarely aimed at little boys and Nascar fans. Before you say well I guess you just don't like Nascar, well I don't but neither do I like French Restaurants but I still enjoyed Ratatouille. Fortunately Pixar has been back on track since and I can't wait to see Toy Story 3.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
High octane entertainment!,"I must start by saying my expectations for this film were set very high due to the reviews I have been reading.In a word. Extraordinary! The film starts out with the fast pace world of racing, very good graphics, Pixar/Disney keep improving on an art that seems at it's height of performance, and the realism really draws you into the whole story, the textures are tremendous. Absolutely first rate editing.The story has a great deal of heart and nostalgia, while some parts are a tad bit predictable, on the whole it's got a lot of surprised. The characters are warm and enduring throughout the entire film.This film is a bit longer than many animations at just under 2 hours, and it keeps it pace well. My biggest thrill was the nostalgia and the warmth of the story, like I said it has a lot of heart and soul. This is a film meant to appeal only to children either, adults will find it just as entertaining, maybe even more so.I don't want to give it away, go see this film today, if you thought Finding Nemo was warm and wonderful, you going to be overly joyed to see Cars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Story of a high-and-mighty talking race car who accidentally ends up in a small town furthest from his lofty aspirations.,"What a delightful story! The plot of this Disney/Pixar animated film is about a race car who, while seeking fame and fortune, finds along the way that meaningful friendship is more important than anything material.This film is totally devoid of people! It is completely cast in automotive and aeronautical devices. However, it is not long before these cars, who have human traits and emotions, have captured your hearts and feelings making you forget that they aren't human. The race car, Lightning McQueen, on his way to California for a big race ends up in the small town of Radiator Springs, Arizona on Route 66 which lost its former glory after an interstate highway (I-40) was constructed, bypassing the town.The townsfolk are a charming bunch of cars, each with a distinct personality who win the hearts of both McQueen and the viewer. Mater, the rusty tow truck with two buck teeth, is absolutely hilarious. He befriends McQueen who formerly couldn't stand rusty automobiles since he was sponsored by a rust penetrating ointment and had to do a commercial with those ""awful rusty cars"". There are many arch-typical personalities in the town that will warm the heart or make one laugh uproariously. There is also a love interest with Sally Carrera, a Porsche who settled in this town due to its charm.The story develops masterfully. The animation is beautifully done and as previously stated, gives life and soul to the characters. After two viewings, I feel that there are still elements of the movie that I've missed due to the fact that there is so much happening at once, especially during the race scenes. I highly recommend this movie to people of all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Lasseter's pet project doesn't rev on all cylinders,"First off, I am a huge Pixar fan. Loved every feature they've done.Unfortunately that ends with CARS.Is is a good movie? Yeah, well, nope. Is it an OK movie? Sure, I'll give you that one.After such a string of hits it's bound to catch up with you. And CARS catches up with it. With a multiple team of writers (always a bad sign) and the supposed pet project of John Lasseter, CARS just never gets passed first gear. Outside of DANCES WITH WOLVES, the Costner pet project that was just amazing, can you name 1 pet project from any Hollywood director, actor, etc. that was good? That's the problem with pet projects. Those involved have blinders on, and the end result is usually not pretty.I'm not going to give you a movie summary - I'll let other people do that.I will say that the movie will appeal, hugely, to boys 6-14. How can you beat race cars to that crowd. You can't. However, for the adults in the audience that has been able to enjoy every Pixar flick, up to know, right along with their kids will be squirming in their seats. It gets L O N G and S L O W in parts.Will it make $150Mil? Probably. Too much marketing and blitzing to stop that train. Is it DVD - able? Not really.

A++++. Must see for all ages. Heartwarming,"My 3 yr old son watches this movie at least once per day. I also have to admit I watch it with him. I really have to commend Pixar for their movie ideas. When they think of a theme they really run with it. Granted it may be a cartoon movie, but it really has something for everyone. I grew up in a small town. Everybody knew everyone. We all hung out at the local cafe. We took care of each other. Radiator Springs has that same feel. It is also heartwarming to watch the main character go from a self-centered jerk to someone you could actually call a friend.

It is definitely a movie kids will enjoy and adults can appreciate (and enjoy with the kids because it does bring out the kid in you).",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fun movie,"I took my two grand daughters to see the movie ""Cars"" We had seen the previews and thought it would great family fun.

Older kids were there also and it concerned me that the kids there may actually think they might be able to ""beat the train"" too. There were quite a few teenagers there also. I think a message of safety (stopping at the tracks rather than speeding across them) would have been much better and it wouldn't have changed the story line.

Boring,"Possibly the worst film by Pixar to date. It started off OK but drug so bad in the middle that even the most immature prepubescent member of the audience couldn't find anything to laugh at. Thank God they finally threw in a fart so someone in the audience got a chuckle. It seemed to attempt at tugging on your feelings rather than just making you laugh which is what a cartoon comedy is supposed to do. Or so I thought. Larry the Cable Guy carried the entire film and his character wasn't all that funny. I really wanted to like this movie and so did my kids but we walked out disappointed.

It also busts out of the well worn 'redemption' formula in a few refreshing places. I'm sure Pixar and Disney will make a load of money on this movie, which is great, but they deserve amazing reviews too. This is what movie making should be today, visually stunning, heart-felt, and need I say, original.

"Pixar's ""Cars"" stalls mid-race...","Pixar's ""Cars"" stalls mid-race...By Andrez Bergen @ de-VICE / Daily Yomiuri (Japan).Ever since Steve Jobs rather presciently snapped up the former computer graphics division of Lucasfilm, Ltd., for a measly $10 million back in '86, Pixar has accelerated its winning streak in Hollywood animation stakes, against inconsistent competitors like DreamWorks.Last year was the studio's most profitable to date, raking in 15 times Jobs' original investment - mostly on the back of The Incredibles (2004) and Finding Nemo (2003). This January, Pixar also scored the keys to the Magic Kingdom, via its merger with Disney.It's been a mesmerizing ride.Throughout its 20-year jaunt, through earlier hits like Toy Story (1995) and Monsters, Inc. (2001), Pixar's strength has been not just its uber-progressive eye for CG detailing, but the team's sense of humor and flexibility with its intended target-audiences - an animated sortie by Pixar can appeal equally to preschool whipper-snappers and grouchy retirees' laugh quotas.The versatility of the studio's subject-matter over the years has also been enviable, Pixar proving itself as adept at lampooning cultural icons as it has been at unfurling cool characters for kids' lunchboxes.On first impressions, with Pixar's founding father, John Lasseter, back in the driver's seat after a seven-year directorial hiatus, Cars has all the essential ingredients to create another sure-fire winner - checkered flag, lunchbox and all.But scrape beneath its waxed and polished exterior, and you may walk away a tad disappointed.Let's start with the plot premise: Churlish, high-octane motor-racing rookie Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) sets the track afire and is all set to take the national championship before an accidental detour off Route 66 sets him in the slow-lane in a sleepy little hick town called Radiator Springs.There he realizes the error of his ways and becomes best buddies with a multicultural cross-section of motor vehicles bearing engines of gold; he also gets the chance to fall in love with someone aside from himself, and saves said town from obscurity.All in all, it's a bit like Toy Story on wheels, filtered through a homogenized host of celluloid predecessors including City Slickers, U-Turn and Petticoat Junction.While at times quirky, mostly this yarn borders on pedestrian. Chances are it's all the backseat drivers involved - Lasseter may have written and directed with Joe Ranft (who was tragically, if ironically, killed last year in an automobile accident), but there was scripting input from at least nine other people.The cast also struggles to turn over. Cars plunks 81-year-old veteran actor Paul Newman alongside the more comic-inclined Wilson, Michael Keaton, Cheech Marin, and Pixar regular John Ratzenberger (Hamm the Piggy Bank in Toy Story).Ratzenberger is side-tracked (as Mack, the transport truck) until the final credits, Marin fills out a tired Latino stereotype, Keaton isn't allowed driving time to develop his surly take on McQueen's chief racing rival, and Wilson is unusually flat as the stockcar infant terrible.It's left to Newman to save the (spoken-word) day, but even his gravely intonations - as Doc Hudson, the 1951 Hudson Hornet M.D. with a mysterious, racy past - aren't quite up to the Herculean task here.Lasseter has confirmed that the character name of Lightning McQueen is in part a homage to the late, great Steve McQueen, the actor who pushed the driving envelope in movies like Bullitt and Le Mans; Newman himself has been a renowned car racing nut for years on end. Classic Pixar would've tweaked this angle for more than it was worth, yet all we get here is Lightning McQueen's racing number - 95 - which is a mundane reference to the year Toy Story was released.There are some genuinely funny sequences here, like the tractor-tipping, the closing-credits Ratzenberger rant, and the flying bugs which are, yes, VW Beetles. But these moments are fleeting and spaced far apart.Most surprising is the lack of depth in the personas - particularly since Pixar usually renders insightful character designs and personalities. This may be just animation, but coloring between the lines is essential.Luigi, the 1959 Fiat 500, and Fillmore, the 1960 Volkswagen Kombi van, offer cute asides, but visualizing central character Sally (voiced by Bonnie Hunt) as a 2002 Porsche 911 is a bland choice for the love interest. Wouldn't a 1969 VW Karmann Ghia or a 1960 Volvo P1800S Sports qualify as far more sexy options, if we're going to get all auto-erotic? For a studio following up on its two most internationally successful films, in its 20th anniversary year, Cars is Pixar's least satisfying outing.Unless you reside in the heartland of the American Midwest, twiddle with V8 engines, listen to country music, smash the odd mailbox, vote for George W., have secret hankerings for reruns of The Beverley Hillbillies, or adore NASCAR racing - as Lasseter does - your attention span may start sputtering before you've completed the first lap.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

We had fun guessing who some of the voices were and recommend that everyone stay for the credits to see if your guesses were correct.You can expect laughs to come based on the age level of the viewers.

"Not only has Pixar done it again, but they've conquered it!","Pixar has done it again in a movie that rockets off at the starting line and flies by the checkered flag with lightning speed. Cars is, without a doubt, the best movie I've seen all year so far, including X-Men 3.Cars follows the misadventures of hotshot race car rookie Lightning McQueen during his unfortunate captivity in the small town of Radiator Springs. There he meets up with a wide array of colorful characters, including a rusty pickup named Mater, a cute little baby-blue Porche named Sally, and the grumpy old Doc Hudson. Together, the whole town strives to turn McQueen's selfish and obnoxious attitude into one of caring and love.Upon seeing the opening trailer for this movie in the Incredibles DVD, I thought that the concept of cars with personalities was kinda ridiculous, even for Pixar. But the entire movie had me from the opening sequence all the way to after the end credits. Like all Pixard movies, the kids will laugh at the slap-stick of Mater, while the adults will chuckle at the little one-liners McQueen throws in.Also, as always, Pixar has a short little animated before the movie entitled One Man Band, which made me nearly fall out of me seat laughing.In a world of cookie-cutter 3D animations about talking animals, Pixar and Cars stands out above the rest, and an Oscar for Best Animated Movie is almost a guarantee.

well done Pixar,"A hot-shot race-car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) gets waylaid in Radiator Springs on his way to California. He's a brash self-obsessed car mired in a dispute in the racing world. But when he damages the road and is sentenced to repair it, he must slow down, work hard, and find what's truly important in life.Pixar creates another fun franchise. This time the cars are humanized. Like Toy Story, it's always about the characters. It's a great family movie. It has fun but it's also a message movie. The breakout character of this movie must be Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), an old rusty tow truck. He's definitely the comic relief.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Cars - An animation made for adults.,"Went with the family to go and watch Cars, and was expecting to be noshing on popcorn while the kids had a blast. How wrong I was! This movie, without a doubt was not made for them, it was made for me!I have lived in the United States for the last five years, and whats more in the South, and the NASCAR references ... and the way fun is poked at it, was fantastic! I found it intelligent, witty and a plot, though predictable, had some good meat to it.Pixar has produced another winner, though I will state that my kids enjoyed it less then I did, but overall... if you like Nascar, cars, sweet romance... you'll enjoy this movie. If you like bang bang action, or someone being hit over the head... alas this one is not for you! However, when it comes out on DVD ... I know I'll be buying it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
This movie is really bad,"There is absolutely nothing to like about this movie. The story is standard and has too many filler scenes. The screenplay was clearly very thin. Cars 2 is a hundred times better than this film. Owen Wilson is good as lightning, other than that I didn't like anything. They really should have worked on the script. The concept is fine and so is the premise. The film loses you completely after the first 40 minutes or so. I watched it with my family and nobody really cared for what will happen once we reached the 40 minute mark. On the contrary, we all enjoyed Cars 2. On a positive note, this is still better than Cars 3 which is the worst film ever made.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wonderful,"A friend of mine told me about the movie. We watched it and he said maybe you want to take it home with you so you can watch it the kids. I live with my brother and he has two kids, a 5 and a half year old daughter and an almost 4 year old son. I love them a lot and I enjoy watching movies with them. Not that we loved the movie a lot but we all got names. So everybody in the family is also playing in the movie, we even included friends in the movie.

Cars is a great movie,"finally getting the time to see a movie with my children, we chose to see cars last night at the cheap movie theater, and we loved the movie. .the animation, the scenes, the layout, all of it is great. during the one scene where sally is talking about after the interstate came in radiator springs lost business, and this made reality hit, when these little towns in America or wherever you might be, depend on revenue from travelers, and they move the interstate in, what it does. in other parts of the show, i loved the tractor tipping, made me laugh so hard, and my boys too. great movie.

Cars,"this movie is not bad. I like it! I've had a good time when I saw Cars: it's funny, quite original and the story is good (even if it's too Disney!). I don't like Owen Wilson, but Lightning McQueen is nice. every character has got its special moment. I liked very much a little detail: the flies were cars too. In the end, when all the cars are at the cinema, I laugh a lot! Every movie by Pixar performed by cars, fantastic. I didn't understand how McQueen could refuse his dream...he's crazy! I understood he wants to stay with his friends and with Sally, but in my opinion he stopped his hopes. anyway, I think Cars is a good movie for children.

An action story with a moral-and a little romance,"This was a great movie, worth the long wait in line in the sunshine on a warm afternoon. The animation was fantastic I couldn't tell if the background was real or simulated. I was struck by the similarity of the cars in the movie to the Chevron cars, which I collect. The only complaint I have is the voice credits, which rolled by too fast for me to read. Now I have IMBb to thank for the information I missed. The story had plenty of action, and a little romance-and a moral: Be loyal to your friends. I am recommending this movie, which is certainly family friendly, to all the people I know who have been complaining about no decent movies to spend money on.

What a class act of unbelievable attention to detail.....MINOR SPOILER,"Wowsers.... THE LANDSCAPES AND REFLECTIONS OF THE PAINTJOBS ON THE CARS........what an amazing example of great artists at their task. The renderings of the cars themselves....amazing. the Plot,Ahhhh kinda the same,dude discovers himself stuff...and a inadvertent love story,with two diametrically opposed personality types. that aside....the characters and their usages...TOO funny. Larry the cable guy was a major hoot. the Army jeep and the hippie VW bus..were also a hoot if you know the history involved. all told....kids MIGHT get bored,it does have more then a bit of introspective moments..and the the plot kinda drags a bit. the racing action is kinda carton,but they had the correct physics at least,and for me being a car guy,that says A lot!!! the mountain drives they take and the racing on backwood mountain roads was entirely totally KICK BUTT. they absolutely nailed the ""joy of driving"" thing and it's feeling and spiritual sense of the open road, and mountainous cliff edge road ways,to driving enthusiasts isn't that much of a stretch to almost WISH you were riding along with them. IF YOUR A CAR GUY..or GAL...WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!! or just enjoyed the previous PIXAR movies,this isn't another MONSTERS INC.....that one was kinda flat. however this isn't the case on this movie,this is another ball out of the park in my opinion,and might be BETTER then the original Toy Story.

Much too shallow for what i expect of Pixar.,"Don't judge this by the standards of a Toy Story or Monsters. It barely reaches out for that. But even by normal movie standards it's a standard animation movie at best.This time Pixar borrowed a lot from various sources and didn't pack it with enough own ideas. Did you see ""Doc Hollywood""? Yes? Then you already know the story.On the other side i had the feeling i was never meant to be the target audience of this flick. Too cute, too lovely, barely any mature ideas in there. Even the romance plot looks like written for twelve-year-old's. In contrast all the previous Pixars felt much more up for entertaining adults as well.On the base of that the whole moral aspect of the movie looks much more unnecessary. I'm used to Disney shoving their morals into my face, Pixar usually delivered them in a more classy way. This time subtlety went overboard from start.All in all, worst Pixar ever, but then again, it's up against great competition, so no big deal.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Pixar Gold, a real Classic","Ever since I was little, I loved cars. I loved playing with little Matchbox cars to watching them cruise along the road. This Pixar movie took me by surprise as I didn't really go into the movie expecting much more than what the title and basic plot suggested, all I wanted to hear was Paul Newman's voice behind the Hudson Hornet and maybe catch some of those delicious CGI sceneries.Everything; from the voice-overs to the CGI to the story to the colorful characters had something special for everyone. The jokes were genuinely funny as well as the lines some of the characters made and even the cameo roles.While your average 2-4 year old might not understand most of it, you certainly will. The movie is chock-full of little surprises that'll make any car enthusiast chuckle heartily.Owen Wilson who played Lightning McQueen, the racing car with a cocky attitude and adrenaline for gas, was actually very good in his role in my opinion. Owen played the act well right down to the end of the movie, which is sure to surprise anyone. All I can say is: ""Ka-Chow!""Paul Newman, the legend voicing a legend, played his role of Doc Hudson to perfection. I'm not sure what it is; the tough gravel voice, the baby blues in the windshield, or the certain air of mystery surrounding his character, but Doc Hudson was my favorite Cars character throughout the movie.All in all, this was a very enjoyable movie. I can barely wait for the DVD but nowadays the DVD comes out just a month after so thats good. I can almost see myself shelling out another 10 bucks for this gem. Another thing I really liked about this movie was its length, its like reading a good book. I just don't want it to end.I rate this *****/***** 5 out 5 stars.Watch out for the four street racers, you can't miss em!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A very  nice story ......,"This Story to me, is about racing from a car's side of the story, you have rivals, all eager to win that trophy, But Lighting Mccqueen shows us that the Trophy is nice, but not important! he helps that blue car who got knocked out of the race over the winning post. In this film, I enjoyed all the characters, this is typical Pixar, all the characters have big eyes and clear voices. I also do not know what a Hudson Hornet car is, I only got the DVD this morning, 29.11.06 I throughly enjoyed the whole film! I also liked the Italian cars, the yellow one is modelled on the Fiat 126. I also liked Sally, the Porsche 911 This is a good film, for the racing car fan, I think that Lighting Mccqueen is modelled on an American V8 Corvet! I also liked it when he saw a red truck, and said to him, ""Mack?"" and the truck said ""No I am a Peterbillt!"" I did not think that A Race car can repair a road ! I have the Playstation game and I highly recommend it, this game does closely follow the film. I also liked Matey the breakdown truck. As you can see, I have given this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not Just a Good Story,"We've all come to expect humane, heartwarming (how to say that without sounding smarmy?), positive story lines out of Lasseter & Co. No exception here. But the real star of ""Cars"" for me was a vanished America of two-lane blacktop, small towns, similar but unique roadside businesses, and the sense that something REALLY exotic lay out there in the blue haze just before the horizon. As a city kid growing up on the southern edge of the Great Plains in the '50s, trips to visit relatives in towns 100 or 200 miles away were odysseys. And each small town in between was as real (and as different from all the others) as Rome or Xanadu. So, ""Cars"" exhibits another of my favorite Pixar traits: obsessive attention to and faithful respect for details that are almost subliminal (shop signs, can labels, etc.) but validate each frame and inevitably add a layer of pure enjoyment to the film. And the landscape just outside Radiator Springs: the ""Chrysler Airflow"" buttes, the ""Buried Cadillac"" outcroppings, the Radiator Cap mesa ... Well, that just confirms my childhood conviction that some really wonderful sights were to be seen out there in the blue haze.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A mediocre plot about numb characters,"I just don't get it. Maybe I missed something, in both times I went to watch this weak animation, but I still don't see why ""Cars"" is so celebrated. I have to admit I couldn't hear the original voice cast, and the Brazilian one is not very good, but I don't see anything, but the animation, working in this movie. The predictable plot just made me yawn, since every little detail is easy to notice right in the beginning of the narrative, from the mysteries of Doc Hudson for the obvious final decision of McQueen. Even if the moral teachings are a law in Disney's movies, in this case, they are too silly and exaggerated, and are included just to redeem characters that could be more interesting and ""credible"" without that quick personality changes. Talking about credibility, the visual of the cars is somewhat ugly. Not that the animation is bad, for it certainly isn't. But it is difficult to feel a human touch in the cars. Because of their different, inanimate shape, they don't look like characters. I didn't feel moved by any character, in the whole movie. The lack of empathy and mediocre plot call me to one serious question: what did the Golden Globe see in this crap? I hope that justice will be done in the Oscar (I doubt), and the prize will be handed over to ""Happy Feet"".",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"It's the type of movie that you want to move into and ""live in"".","I'm 56 years old and this movie touched me. Graphics were awesome. The plot was superb and had a message. I didn't want it to end. It's the type of movie that you want to move into and ""live in"". This movie has something for everyone, not just kids. The only issue I had was with the attendees. Everyone knows that Pixar does great things with the credits. This time was no exception. Credits were as great as the movie but I couldn't see them because everyone started to get up and leave. People, sit down and stay down until the screen goes blank. The majority of the people missed several minutes of ""more movie"" because they were in a hurry to get out before everyone else.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Perfect Blend of Technology and Story Telling,"Pixar pulled out all the stops when creating Cars. If you couldn't already tell from watching the trailers the computer animation graphics in this movie are absolutely beautiful. There are certain scenes like the drive through the forest where you forget your watching an animation because the environments are stunningly realistic. Of course most of us have learned over the years it takes much more than special effects to create a worthwhile movie.As usual Pixar also succeeds in creating a compelling story driven by a wide ensemble of lovable characters. The story focuses on the journey of a red sports car named Lightning McQueen who has a great catch phrase ""Ka-Chow""! I must admit though as great a character that Lightning is the true star of the show is the rusty old tow truck Mater, voiced by Larry The Cable Guy. During some of the slow moments towards the middle of the movie Maters comic relief keeps pushing things along with lots of laughter. Especially his interaction with the tractors. I won't say any more than that to avoid spoiling things.This movie seems to have less humor directed specifically at the adult audience members but that doesn't cut back any on the amount of fun you will have watching this movie. Of course there is a moral to the whole movie teaching you not to focus on a specific destination in life and wishing your life away. Instead take your time and enjoy the journey itself. Each and every day. A lesson that can be taken to heart by both children and adults alike. I recommend this movie to everyone looking to have some fun. If you liked any of the other blockbusters from Pixar you will surely not be disappointed by their latest adventure.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Hudson Hornet,"Great movie! Terrific humor for children AND adults! Here's an addition to the trivia page. It's not by chance that Doc is a Hudson Hornet. Hudson Hornet's won the NASCAR championship in '51, '52 and '53.The animation is unbelievable! The cars throw up bits of rubber off the tires as they circle the track, just like NASCAR! There are so many car images embedded in the film, and the cars are so realistic--sounds strange for an animated movie, but I'm a car guy and it was incredible! Also, the sound is fantastic, notice when Mack is dozing while driving down the road....that's the sound a diesel truck makes with it's Jake Brake--a device used for slowing big trucks down with the engine exhaust. Sally sounds just like a Porsche....the gravel crunching under the wheels, all of it is just flat incredible! And good Ol' Darrell.....Boogity, boogity, boogity!Great movie for race fans and their children (grandchildren, nieces and nephews!)Hal",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fantastic! A seventh Pixar gem!,"Who cares about negative hype? Who cares about presumption? Who cares about others ridiculing the concept?None of that matters once you've actually seen Cars!Cars is very well done, in its spectacular (and well researched) details of Mid-Western and South-Western scenery, the cars themselves, the lighting and reflection/refraction that will make you say ""wow"" times over throughout, the opening sequence, etc., but also in its excellent Lasseter-style characterizations, story arcs, and interactions. This movie really has it all, despite the fact that humans do not exist in its universe. You really stop caring (if you even did going into it) that they are all cars after only a few minutes...And seeing the movie twice is a very high recommendation. Kids may not enjoy this movie as much as say, the original Toy Story audience that I am a part of (16-19 or so), to see it twice in a row, but it takes two or three viewings to get all of what Lasseter is doing and to truly marvel at how well done the animation is. Plus, it's enjoyable each time through!On a personal note, I have to say that I am sick of people trying to constantly rank each new Pixar film based upon those before it. It's great that Pixar has a ""bar"", and I think that each movie they have released meets it, but arguing over the newest features as 'inferior' is a fool's argument. We pretty much know that Pixar productions are the best, and they are the undisputed masters of animation...(and please remember that, despite the movie being released now, the final rendering was down over a year ago, with many of the designs, animations, and effects being done in separate groups over four years of rendering production. They are already able to, and usually rendering another movie, at a graphical level above that of their films in current release...)Anyways, I recommend this movie for about 7 or 8 year olds and up....Smaller children have a problem with this movie (I've seen it four times, and each time, younger children don't follow it too well) but it is still very family friendly. The storyline is great, the effects are fantastic, and the direction of John Lasseter makes this an extremely enjoyable ride!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Well done feel good movie,"This movie reminded me of ""Doc Hollywood"" a lot. The cartoon version was well done in the graphics department, especially when seen on the big screen. It reminded me a lot of the old time Westerns in CinemaScope, but was more elegant in artwork, it was stunning. Paying close attention to detail in the backgrounds shows the film makers' sense of humor mixed with their sense of awe at the natural scenery of the American West. Having spent a lot of time in that part of the world, it brought home some very fond emotional memories of time spent in very little towns. (Along with some of the cheap thrills we learned to enjoy in helping to pass the time.)Definitely could be interpreted as a commentary on the differences between our modern instant gratification GameBoy society, and the part of our culture which takes things on a different pace and with a different attitude.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A different kind of road movie,"This is a beautifully animated and exciting movie, combining two of my favorite topics--Nascar and Route 66. The scenery will take your breath away. It's hard to believe that the backgrounds are not photographs. The Pixar animators outdid themselves on this one. Oh, yeah, the characters are great, too. I admit to being a ""cryer"" at movies, and this one had my eyes wet several times. It's not a movie just for the little kids---like Disneyland, this is for the big kids. They are the ones who will get all the ""in-jokes."" Go see it. You'll like it. I'll probably go see this again and I will definitely be buying the DVD when it comes out.

Very witty,"This movie is great and before I saw this I had my doubts.The thought of Cars with big eyes and faces with long hanging tongues just did'nt appeal to me-How wrong was I.

Along with were the Italian mechanics who work in Casa Della Tire.Owen Wilson did a good job as Lighting along with Bonnie Hunt as the sexy Porche.This movie also included a host of cameos including Jay Leno very cleaver described as Jay Limo and a one which stood out for me was an appearance by the Mighty Michael Schumacher!!!!Before the movie I were treated to another Pixar short ""One Man Band"" which was very funny indeed.Pixar has once again done a stroke of genius and I am eagerly waiting for the next one Ratatoue.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Another Enjoyable Film From Pixar,"The animated family film Cars is directed by John Lasseter and stars Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, and Bonnie Hunt. The film takes place in modern day world that is ruled by cars instead of humans.The film starts off with Lightning McQueen (Wilson) preparing for a big race. McQueen is a car that is very self absorbed, hard to get along with, and all he wants to do is win. He is in a race with a total of forty three cars to win the acclaimed Piston Cup. After refusing to get his tires changed at a pit stop they fly off right on the last lap of the race and McQueen's two biggest competitors Chick Hicks and The King end up in a tie with him for the win. Because of the tie there has to be a race between the three of them to gain the Piston Cup and if McQueen wins he would be sponsored by the great Dynaco. But as his truck is taking him to the race in California McQueen falls out of the truck and is stuck in a small town, Radiator Springs, as a prisoner because he damaged the road while driving. McQueen must fix the road to be able to make it back to the race, but while in the town he meets some memorable cars like Doc Hudson (Newman), Sally Carrera (Hunt), and Mater (Larry the Cable Guy).The writing for this film was very original and was a light enjoyable film. Unlike many of the other Pixar films this one does not have a great sense of depth or an underlying message. Yet it is easy to watch and will keep you entertained which is not an easy feat. It was somewhat corny but not so much that it was ridiculous to watch and it is a kid's film so you can't really expect for something drastically different. Now while watching this film I thought to myself that they made Toy Story again but instead of Toys or even bugs from A Bug's Life they used cars instead. I wonder how many films Lasseter can create that are about different sorts of inanimate objects or creatures other than humans.The direction of this film I thought was quite good. Lasseter truly made a pleasant film with some nice performances from the whole cast. I really liked the shots he had at the beginning and towards the end of when the cars are speeding by in the race. Also I enjoyed all the shots of Lightning McQueen getting his photo taken. Lasseter makes many pleasurable films and this one is not an exception.I know I have been using the word pleasurable a lot during this review so I will switch it up and say that the acting was as well delightful. Owen Wilson played McQueen and he did a fine job, it was nothing special but nothing special was really required. Paul Newman played the part of Doc Hudson and he was as well fine in his last feature film. I don't know if that is how he really sounds in real life but if not then he did a good job with his voice for the part. Bonnie Hunt was average as the love interest Sally Carrera, her part was no different really than any generic love interest. Larry the Cable Guy really brought a nice warm feeling to the film as the rusty pickup truck Mater with his comedic lines. Mater was definitely my favorite character of the film.Overall I give this film a weak 7/10. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Pixar and enjoys family films.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Best Pixar Movie - Why So Underrated?,"I strongly believe this is the best of the Pixar films made, along with Finding Nemo.Unlike some of the others, this movie was genuinely laugh out loud funny especially with the character of Mater:Mater: What's your name? Lightning McQueen: You... you don't know my name? Mater: No, uh... no, I know your name. Is your name Mater too?Great storyline, great characters, great humour....just a great film.If you haven't seen this movie, please do.. In my opinion, this film should surely by in the IMDb top 250, I struggle to understand why Ratatouille is and this is not.I would absolutely love a sequel.10/10, 5 stars .. highly recommended on my half.Well done Pixar!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Once again Pixar Exceeds Expectations,"With Pixar's long relationship with Disney I've been expecting the inevitable decline of things associated with the big corporation which takes fewer risks than it once did, aside from shutting their old animation studios and banking on half-baked in-house computer animation. Simply put, Disney is tired and only rehashes stereotypical characters to bank on old successes. Pixar has delighted us with new characters every time (including in the sequel to Toy Story, BTW there is a Toy Story 3 on the way) by mostly abandoning everything it already knew and starting with a totally new story and totally new characters. There was no letdown in this film. Wise of someone at Disney to keep Pixar in the fold. I dearly hope that same wise influence keeps Disney's script writers out of Pixar.Regarding the film, it's a fairly predictable story, as becomes apparent as time goes on, which is the only reason it I didn't give it a 10. As for their telling of the story, well, as was said of James Bond, nobody does it better. Eye candy galore, stunning vistas, utterly charming, magnificently hilarious and wonderful nods to the legacy of the automobile.Take a close look at those bugs flying around and be sure to stick around for the early credits. I'll have to get this one on DVD just to catch all the background and quick one-off in-jokes.

There were references to the whole car theme, but they were craftily done and interspersed throughout. The ""characters"" are nicely done and lovable. The animation was probably the best I've seen yet from Pixar. Of course, the movie turned out like I thought it would, but that is not the point. The story of Route 66 is really interesting in itself. And there is also, the main character change from selfish to giving, which is a good lesson for kids.

Only So So,"Having raised the bar so high in the past, it would be unrealistic to expect Pixar to constantly match past successes and sadly Cars is at best only on a par with most of competition.The problem is not the animation techniques, but telling yet again the same story of the lost toy/ant/little girl/fish and now car. Worse, the ending of the story was sign posted from the moment the hero was trapped in the little town. Compared to Toy Story this was scripting by numbers and it showed. The huge number of credited writers (and lord knows how many script doctors) does lend credence to a good idea (let's do a film about cars) which went wrong.My kids didn't want to go to the cinema to see this ( I did) as they are bored with computer animated films.

Finding values,"The authors say that the important thing is not the destination but the journey to him. It is because the way we find all the things that are worth living.An important part of the magic of this film comes from something we always want to find in others: the ability to recognize and get back on their mistakes.In this journey, we find two opposing characters, a young and determined competitor and a veteran winner, forgotten in time. The confrontation between them, aided by its very opposite, they managed to change their own ways of seeing things, redirecting it then.In this film, we find in nice language and also understood by children, values that nourish the hope of a world always better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Another Pixar masterpiece.,"My favorite movies from Pixar are 'Up' and 'Wall-e',but 'Cars' did what those two movies did: entertain an audience with spectacular animation and family friendly humor.The cast is also great: Owen Wilson,Larry the Cable Guy,Michael Keaton,George Carlin,and so on.The movie is basically about talking cars,but in this movie,it's more than just talking cars.This movie runs 116 minutes,probably too long for some kids who have short attention spans,but soon,they'll follow into the rhythm of this purely delightful animated feast that should be viewed by every eye on the entire planet.'Cars' is a fast paced,colorful,and speedy animated film with great potential.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
this is alright,"Caught the world premiere at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte-- we're not race fans ourselves by any means, but you really don't have to be to get on the road with this one. We were privy to a couple inside jokes, living amongst the racing atmosphere that IS Charlotte, but even if we hadn't gotten that extra little chuckle, there's definitely plenty to find. Not just for kids. Kids will like the cute characters, and bright colors, adults will like it simply because it's just plain entertaining without having to dumb down to appeal to kids. You'll find yourself wanting to find the next twisty backboard to get to your next destination. Watch for all kids of cameo's, and it's too bad IMDb doesn't include a picture of the animated character as well-- it's not always easy to remember what the names are once you get home. Owen's good, Newman is classic, if a little flat (I applaud him for just plain staying active and leaving his house!), but it's really Larry the Cable Guy's movie-- newfound appreciation for that one-- and ""tow-mater"" is a multi-layered pun. Not only on the fact that he's a tow truck, but also his ""they call me tater salad"" bit-- Overall, highly entertaining, just try not to speed too much on the way home....",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Amazing movie,"Best animated movie produced by Pixar yet. It's a shame to see Pixar and Disney split up. This movie was full of cross references to real life events, for example, Dale Earnhardt Jr. appears as a fellow race car with the main character. Attention was paid to every detail, and every moment kept you interested. Keep an ear open for 'Mater's' (Larry the cable guy) lines which are sometimes identical to his stand-up routine. Working at the local theaters, I've seen my fair share of animated classics but this is by far the best. Be sure to stay after the credits for some extra laughs. Nine thumbs up! A++. A true cinematic masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Something wrong....,"I liked this movie and I think it's a masterpiece as far as animation movies are concerned. The problem is that I have observed about 20 children of varying ages in random circumstances watching it.. There is something wrong with this movie. kids lose interest in it after the first 15 minutes and they never seem to follow anything. The same children didn't blink or go to the bathroom during ""polar Express"", ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Ice age"". My humble interpretation is that this movie is OK for adults, but it failed to capture the eluding magic that catches children's attention. Perhaps cars are not interesting like people, animals or fish. That's why I give it 5 on a score of 10. If it was intended for adult audience only it could have scored 8 or 9.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

I had lowered my expectations...,"...just like for Finding Nemo--how are they going to tell a story with fish? Well, let me tell you, I cried as much, if not more, in this movie than in Nemo. The critics were looking for the ""wow"" in the story. It is kind of hard to top ""The Incredibles."" Yes, there are plot pieces we've seen before (the main review on the page today does compare Cars to ""Doc Hollywood"") but each Pixar movie finds human truths that the other studio's computer animation films lack. I like and laughed harder at some scenes in ""Over the Hedge"" than I did in Cars, but which one will I remember more? Car's end credits had just as much belly laughs as did all of ""Hedge"" BTW.Pixar has created a tribute to our driving history: Route 66, the tee-pee shaped motels of the west, the little one stoplight town, and the old school NASCAR before it became what it is today, all of those simple things that we speed by on the interstate. I cursed AAA for putting me on a side rode a few years ago when I found later that I could have driven a less direct, but faster route on an expressway. I was on a timetable, but I would have missed the unique character of the landscape.They made all the cars believable living creatures, something I doubted they could have sustained, but they did. They even captured Owen Wilson's smarmy charm and facial expressions. They also made me forget Ardman's Chevron Cars, something I was afraid they would begin to resemble.The basic story, though maybe not all that original, mines the truths in life from what is there. Honor, love and friendship are more important than anything. Themes that run through out the Pixar films--and some critics complained about that!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
delightful family entertainment,"Wow, Disney really out did itself! My son begged me to see this production; Although, the previews appeared to be somewhat childish, I gave in. My hesitation quickly turned into delight. The graphics are beautiful and very realistic. My son and I had traveled on part of the old Route 66 just last summer. What a thrill it gave me to have my 10-year-old recognize some of the scenery! The movie had me right there making each turn of the highway; taking in the awesome details of the mountains. The character voices were wonderfully casted with actors that match the personalities of each car. By the end of the movie, I was ready to hop into the car and hit the road again. Thank you, Disney, for remaining true to your company's foundering fathers. You have crafted a marvelous work of nostalgia and friendship, sprinkled with clean,adult humor.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Didn't met my expectations,I had great expectations but I was disappointed and so was my wife because the story is not very original and special. Therefore I have great respect for the special effects and the beautiful cinematography. After Ice Age 1 and 2 CARS shows very clear the power of high perfection in technical possibilities creating such animation movies. Okay there were some good and lovely sequences but there wasn't so much to laugh as in the Ice Ages. For all these reasons I gave 5/10 and even my 4year old son forgot quick this one and loves much more Finding Nemo or Ice Age. I think the votes here are too overrated. For all fans of this genre and for all kids I recommend THE POLAR EXPRESS that is no doubt a great movie for Christmas time.,5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""CARS"" Movie of the Year","Cars is a must see for everyone. Take a person who says that they are an adult and don't watch cartoons. This movie will change their minds.The characters are done so well that by the end of the movie you forget they are cars. It is great to see good old entertainment, the world is filled with reality, it is time to let yourself get entertained. Along with being a wonderful movie it has a great sound track that will have you tapping your feet and wanting to buy the sound track afterwards. Here is one thing that people miss, don't be in a hurry to leave and please sit through the credits until the end to see the final scene, you don't want to miss it.This movie also has a wonderful theme of how important friends and family are.Take the family, friends, anyone they will thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Solid entertainment through and through,"There is much to say against Hollywood these days, but this one reminded me of the old Disney when they were trend setters and everyone jumped to their beat. Pixar did Disney proud with an amazing cgi job that completely sets you at easy forgetting these are only animations. Some times they would let this illusion slip and you were reminded this is only an animation, but then the story was so strong and well done that that didn't bother me at all.Before the movie started I thought this was going to be a typical ""here's a mature cartoon - watch as everyone learns a lesson and has fun doing it"" animation. But I was wrong. Then once it started I thought that it was going to be ""fast car learns a lesson"". But I was wrong. After a while the movie made me drop my predispositions and I realized that this one is not just good, not just a cut above the rest... it was great!This is rock solid entertainment for everyone. 10+/10... way to go Disney and Pixar!-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Pixar = The kings of animation,"They made Toy Story, A bug's life, Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc, The incredibles........ No need to say much more. Pixar don't loose the grip in this one, another fabulous animation flick with insane humor.I really wish i had their fantasy. These guys have so many hilarious ideas you keep on laughing veeery often through the whole movie. But OK, we have all seen this story before, trust me. But sometimes, what matters is how the story is told.And the animations is really something, it's eye candy. These guys know how to work their computers. And WOW how it was nice to hear Paul Newman's voice again, it really fits. Well, Owen Wilson also do a great job there. Actually every actor does a hilarious performance in this movie.I have to give this a 8. Well you know, the story. Seen it like 50 times, in 50 different movies that is. But hey. I loved the movie. GO SEE IT!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A visual feast with a storyline to boot,"The concept of talking cartoon cars having an adventure doesn't sound like a thrilling premise for a movie does it? Sounds a bit Thomas the Tank Engine without a railway line right? Well you can cast all doubts aside because Pixar have triumphed yet again, proving once and for all why they are the undisputed leaders when it comes to computer generated family entertainment. And by family entertainment I don't just mean to label it as the sort of film little kids enjoy, parents endure and everyone between the ages of twelve and twenty two avoids, because this is a richly rewarding two hours that anyone, regardless of age can enjoy.As always with Pixar movies, much of the appeal comes from the visuals and here, they excel. From the jam packed stadiums at the opening to the gorgeous depiction of the American desert, we are given a lush world that is pure visual candy and it doesn't end with the wide angle landscapes either, for the character design is top notch too. Cars by their very nature may be metallic and featureless, but these are not cars, these are characters and there is a world of emotion etched on their faces which puts most real life actors to shame.However, the reason why Cars triumphs isn't because of the visuals, it's because of the storyline. Sure, the tale of a big headed race car getting stuck in a small town and learning to slow down once in a while is somewhat clichéd, but is imbued with so much depth and characterisation it doesn't matter. You come to care about all these offbeat automobiles and they'll make you laugh and cry in equal amount. Of particular note here is Larry the Cable Guy's work as Mater, the dim witted redneck tow-truck. It is testament to the script writers abilities that Mater is such a lovable fellow and he effectively steals the entire film when he could very easily have been the most irritating character to appear since George Lucas rolled out a certain Rastafarian Amphibian.Of course, you could put the reasons for it being so enjoyable down to the fact that expectations were not as high for this one as they were for the likes of Toy Story 2 or Monsters Inc, but that would do a disservice to the beautifully crafted film on offer. It's not perfect and is let down by a rather contrived romance subplot which relies on the usual tactics of the two leads chatting and laughing nervously together at the same time, but that minor gripe aside, it's second only to The Incredibles. Pixar's track record is still intact and while some of you may be a little put off by the somewhat childish subject matter consider this; at least they're not talking animals.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"The ""Hook"" to kids of the 2000s in a way!","People seem to regard Cars as one of the weaker Pixar movies, but it's a childhood favorite. When I was a kid this movie was huge! All the kids (myself included) loved it, Rascal Flatts' cover of Life Is a Highway was extremely popular, everybody loved Tow Mater (which is most likely the reason he was the center of attention in the sequel), the tractor tipping scene was everyone's favorite scene, and everyone owned the toys. Now that I'm older I realize that the story is definitely weak compared to the other Pixar movies, but what makes up for it are the characters, animation, voice acting, humor, the music especially Our Town by James Taylor, an emotional scene, and the movie's tone. It's no Toy Story or Finding Nemo but I still love Cars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Great Fun with Lovable Characters,","Cars is a terrific movie with a well developed plot and a fantastic voice cast. Pixar took a huge risk with this movie, setting it in a universe with no humans, every character being a talking car, and also having the majority of it set in one location. It did not seem like an easy project to pull off, but they did so using great character development as well as great casting choices that perfectly convey the personalities of these characters.Admittedly, it can get a bit boring at times. Running for nearly two hours, the majority of the movie takes place in Radiator Springs, a very small town, and we almost start to feel the same isolation that the main character feels, wanting to be taken out of this area and see something that's a lot more visually exciting.Like any Pixar film, Cars never forgets its heart. There are many heartwarming moments, and particularly the last twenty minutes brought a smile to my face. The overall message of the film is basically stating that all that glitters is not gold, joy does not come from fame and fortune, the real happiness is being around people that you love, who also love you. It's a true message and it is very surprising that a film about talking cars manages to convey this so well.Sweet and entertaining. Funny, beautifully animated and heartwarming, Cars is great entertainment for all ages and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film.Lightning McQuenn is on his way to winning The Piston Cup, however, after accidentally ending up in a town called Radiator Springs, he must stay there and fix their road. While there, he begins to form an attachment to the residents.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Good, very good!","Didn't have any high hopes when I took the kids to see this movie. After some of the previous Disney outings I was however prepared for the worst.So I found myself pleasantly pleased to find myself engaged with this movie within the first 5mins.The choice of vocal talent impressed, I half expected another selection of over the top Eddie Murphy/Chris Rock screeching, but the soft tones of the stars made the whole experience a pleasure.The one ""nails down the chalk board"" moment is the use of Jeremy Clarkson as the agent ""Harv"" in the UK version. Disney please note, Mr Clarkson is an excellent Car Revier, but he cannot be called ""vocal talent"" by any stretch of the imagination.Normal, superb cartoon quality and style.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Better than I'd been led to believe,"The critical knives were unsheathed for this one (""Has Pixar Lost Its Touch?"" being a common plaint), but on a clearer day ""Cars"" seems to be a very good film. True, the humor tends to generate quiet smiles rather than peals of laughter, and the overall pace and style tends to be extremely laid-back (with the obvious exception of the car racing).The animation reaches new heights of technical excellence. There are several sections where the line between computer-generated imagery and reality has been erased completely. Whether or not one agrees with the aesthetic goal of pursuing such photographic realism, it represents an enormous achievement - and sets the Pixar studio leagues ahead from the rubbery-looking ""3-D"" characters currently glutting multiplex screens (""Over the Hedge,"" ""Monster House,"" the upcoming ""Barnyard""...write in your own candidate).For me, Paul Newman's voice work was a minor revelation. He can still sound astonishingly young and vital, then turn around and deliver lines with the age-worn weariness of his octogenarian self. The man remains a terrific actor.""Cars"" doesn't achieve the near-perfect blend of story and style that marked ""The Incredibles,"" but its merits are far from negligible.(For what it's worth, this is the only summer '06 movie my 12-year old daughter asked to see twice.)",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One of the Best NASCAR Films,"Of all the films made about racing, or NASCAR in general, this is one of the best, if not the best. Even though it is animated, the story is incredibly moving and well paced. The actors who voice the cars, Paul Newman, Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt and Larry the Cable Guy do a spectacular job.The studio that created this film, PIXAR, has come long way. No one thought that films about Cars and Toys wold be this great, but they really are. In the eleven years since this films release, it is now a trilogy and one of the best franchises Disney has to offer.Paul Newman, having starred in this film, is a great parallel to his real life self being a racecar driver. And the film is a great parody/homage to Doc Hollywood, as it has been compared.Two major stars of this film have passed since its release, Paul Newman and George Carlin. However, they wrote Newman's character of Doc Hudson out of the sequels, but not Carlin's character of Fillmore.It is the start of a great trilogy!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

SpellBound,"Spellbound, I was amazed by the kind of attention given to each frame of this movie. It had a neat script, amazing animation, great dubbing and more. Its all in there, the ingredients aptly mixed… The intro goes well... Speed … I am Speed… and when the same line gets repeated at the end of the movie, you get up having the effect of watching a action movie, the story is all about a racing car ""Lighting McQueen"" who wants to win the piston cup, and he gets stuck in the middle of a town on his way to the racing field and what happens there is the rest of the story.The kind of attention given is interesting, even the bugs which come here is in car shape and the statues are too shaped in car symbols. It was great to watch this movie after a 2 week long of action /suspense. This one had some great romantic sequences matching to that of great romance movies.
