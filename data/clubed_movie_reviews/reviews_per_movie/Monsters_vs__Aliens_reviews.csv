A pleasant surprise,"Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.There isn't a whole lot in the way of story and character development, but suffice it to say, it serves its purpose. What makes Monsters vs. Aliens such an enjoyable film is how it works as a comedy. The pop culture references are still present, but I found them to be more clever and funny this time around, and in much smaller amounts. I was smiling through virtually the entire film, and had about 5 or 6 hard laugh-out-loud moments throughout. As expected, I was also very impressed by the voice cast in this movie. Hugh Laurie does a fantastic job as the voice of the sophisticated (though mildly insane) Dr. Cockroach, and most of the laughs are generated by Seth Rogen's performance as B.O.B.. Even Reese Witherspoon helps you feel some sympathy for her character near the beginning of the film, and Stephen Colbert does a surprisingly solid job as President Hathaway.The 3D, while not used as effectively as it was in Coraline, is still one of the more impressive showcasings that I've seen, and that's largely due to the film's incredible action sequences. Seriously, this is some of the best action that I've seen in an animated film; as far as I'm concerned, it's right up there with that of The Incredibles.Overall, I found Monsters vs. Aliens to be a surprisingly entertaining film, with clever and witty dialogue, as well as terrific action. I'm not usually in favor of sequels, but if they're able to keep it as balanced and charming, I would honestly like to see this become a successful, long-running franchise. Nice job, folks at DreamWorks Animation.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Entertaining and surprisingly, maybe more for grown ups than kids",It might not be the best but it's definitely one of the funniest Dreamworks animated films in my opinion as many jokes seem a bit more for grown ups rather than kids.

"A little underwhelming, but still good fun.","Okay, I'll admit I'm not big on CG movies as I always find 2D animation much more convincing and involving but I had a good time with this (along with a some relatives) and it's a pretty cool movie. However, I kinda felt a little underwhelmed; the story is good, but there's just wasn't enough substance along with the characters and action. I just felt it needed more. But it's a treat to see all the nods to '50s classic era of films that Monsters Vs Aliens pays homage to along with some good messages about being true to yourself and looking beyond one's appearance in order to know someone. Seeing the film with 3D glasses was a cool idea but in my view, 2D will suffice but still, it's good family entertainment for an afternoon. Hopefully the next film will have more ooomph, more ""Monstrosity"".",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nice team chemistry,"Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) is a woman who got upsized by a meteorite on her wedding day. B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) is a gelatinous, brainless creation after an experiment on a tomato went wrong. Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) is a scientist who turned himself into a hybrid. The Missing Link (Will Arnett) is a creature found frozen and revived. And giant mutant larva Insectosaurus is a product of nuclear testing. The government has secretly collected these monster and now they need them to fight alien Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson).DreamWorks has gathered all the iconic 50s sci-fi B-movie creations, and formed a pretty cohesive team. It's surprising that the limited backstory allowed the characters to gel so well right off the bat. It's probably due the fact that these characters seem so familiar to us. It also helps that the actors do some great voice work.The story itself has one major problem. The movie is basically split in two parts. The pacing slows down dramatically in the middle after a high intensity fight at the start. However the comedy works well especially the brainless BOB. I think this team has good potential.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Animated Film. Don't listen to the naysayers.,"I honestly don't know what some of these people who've reviewed this film were expecting.Sure, it's called ""Monsters Vs. Aliens."" No, that DOES NOT mean that it HAS to be about five thousand monsters fighting five thousand aliens. You people watch too much Predator vs. Aliens.What this was was a story about one girl, what happens to her and the challenges she faces.And it's funny. Very funny, in an adult, dry and quirky way. It's not trying to be generic, which seems to be what some reviewers want. It's not trying to be a spectacle, like other reviewers expected it to be.It's a well told comedy about this girl Susan.My three year old has seen this movie somewhere in the range of 40 times. I've had to sit through it at least half of that and, quite honestly, it doesn't grow old for me like A Bug's Life or something in that vein might.Too many people with too specific expectations - and no concept of what's good. Must be why Transformers made so much money.",,Anonymous,Animation
Doesn't live up to the promise.,"When I first heard of Monsters vs. Aliens I literally went giddy. A 50's B-movie revival! Stephen Colbert as the President! Hugh Laurie as a cockroach! I mean, it's called Monsters vs. Aliens!!!What I got was a mildly good movie. I mean, there were some nice gags in the Strangelove- lite War Room, and some great lines from BOB, but it really left me wanting more. As a whole, the film never got to the comical heights of Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, or even Shrek 2. There are times in the movie where you know that they are going completely random to try and get some laughs, but fail pretty badly.Besides comedy, the story itself is pretty predictable. From the moment you meet the monsters you know what the moral of the story, and you know pretty much how the whole film will play out.But it is not a bad film. Not at all. It's good, but not great. What IS great is the 3D. Me, I've never really warmed to 3D, but they use it here in a completely different sense. Monster's vs Alien's 3D is not about shouting ""OMG I CAN TOUCH HIS BEARD!!"", but more about perspective. And hair. I'm sorry but it's worth seeing just for Ginormica's (Susan's) hair alone.So basically, it's fun - but not as fun as it should have been. And take it from me: even if you're cynical about 3D; see it in 3D. It's worth the ticket price alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cute and often very funny,"After a rather slow beginning in which a girl gets proposed to, the movie picks up when she gets turned into a giant on her wedding day and from that on the film is frenetically comic. Like most Dreamworks cartoons, this one can feel like it's trying too hard (Dreamworks has a Looney-Tunes-on-speed approach that can be a little exhausting), but at its best the movie is wildly funny.The story and characters are admittedly generic, but pleasantly so. But there is a certain annoying laziness to the plotting. The death of one character is treated as sad even though the audience is given no reason to care, and the female empowerment angle is a bit on the silly side. The plot is at a kid's movie level, even though the humor is funniest enough for this adult.Not a great cartoon, but a very enjoyable one.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderful summertime treat  (even though it's still spring) ...,"If you're going to see this movie, make sure it's the 3D version - not all showings are in 3D. If you have the opportunity to see it in IMAX - it's definitely a 'bigger' treat ... but FWIW, know this: it was ""converted"" to IMAX from normal print - not created in the IMAX format.OK - that said, the movie IS worth seeing. I'd say it was somewhere between ""really good"" and great. It's a fun story with fast pacing, entertaining characters and nice 3D effects.It's basically about a group of 5 likable ""monsters"" that are pitted up against an alien attack. The main character is a new ""monster"" - Ginormica. She's a young lady that was recently hit by a meteorite with a special composition ... one that made her grow to gigantic size.It's a fun story told in an imaginative way. The visuals are very nicely done - the backgrounds, characters and scope of detail are great. The movie also moves along at brisk pace - something that grabs your attention is always happening (this makes it work well for kids in the audience). Add to that the fun and oddball personalities of the monster characters and you have a winning combination.The 3D effects were good, although like most other mainstream animated movies - they start out strong and then get recessed into background. Still - make sure you see it in 3D! You'll be missing part of the key experience offered by the movie if you don't.All in all, this is a fun movie for adults as well as kids. It's kind of a summer movie that you get to watch in the spring. Grab some popcorn and check out this flick!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Pretty Innocent, And Fun To Watch","This was a pleasant surprise: a nice, feel-good film that is pretty innocent and sports the usual beautiful Dreamworks art. The artwork and colors are magnificent. I say ""surprise"" because it did not get great reviews. Thus, I wasn't expecting the quality film I got.The good guys - the ""monsters"" are typically-likable as you see in other animated films of today. They are pretty funny, too, diverse ""monsters"" like ""Dr. Cockroach, B.O.B and The Missing Link. They, along with ""Ginormica,"" who does her impression of the 1950s sci-fi character, ""The F-Foot Woman,"" are appealing and fun to watch.I'm tempted to describe this movie as ""innocent,"" because it's such a nice story that doesn't have all the innuendos some other animated films have, yet still will make most adults laugh in many spots because there is some good humor that kids wouldn't get. ""Monsters Versus Aliens"" shows one doesn't need ""edginess"" in every movie to have adults enjoy the kids' film, too.Chances are you'll find this movie a lot better than you thought. Give it a shot.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, not great (unless you see it in 3D)","Monster versus Aliens is a sometimes funny and sometimes interesting, but mostly the story is dull and the plot is nearly a non-entity.However, this movie does take 3D to a new level at times. There's really only one obvious 3D ""gag"" very early in the movie, but other than that, you are just in awe of seeing these animated characters truly come to life like never before.The character that steals the show is of course BOB (voiced by Seth Rogen) He is incredibly dumb but also fantastically funny and the most interesting of all the monsters.The main character Susan (Reese Witherspoon) has this whole back story, but really we never care about it. Much of her story is just recycled from 100 movies that have come before and very predictable.Still, the action and the 3D are top notch and this is a movie definitely worth seeing if you can see it in the 3D form. In 2D, I only give it a very lukewarm recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Å Nutshell Review: Monsters vs Aliens,"I'm beginning to wonder whether the 3D novelty is wearing out already, especially if slapped on films that think the beauty of visual effects and animation take precedence over a solid story. Everything here worked to a perfect T, from the very key component of animation, to voice casting, and sound, but what the film ultimately lacked, was a compelling narrative, and soul.The premise for success is all there, and as seen in the trailer, there's a pretty good balance of comedy, action, and homage to the 50s and 60s horror and sci-fi genres. But as the adage goes, too many cooks, in this case, screenplay writers (5 of them no less) will spoil the broth, and as a result, the trailer contains the best bits from within the movie, and everything else just plain boring, which to me too is a surprise.Directed by Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon who brought us Shark Tale and Shrek 2 respectively, you would have thought that the combination of their strengths would result in one heck of an entertaining ride, not. It's about time animated films pull a stop to lampooning all that's pop culture. Sure it's funny for a while, but it gets on your nerves pretty much faster than you can roll your eyes at the next joke from the same joke book.While the film has plenty of monsters and well, just one alien and a giant robot which form the adversarial core, it's not about teamwork but the celebration of the strength of individuality. It's the story of a wistful bride Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) whose only goal in life is to go to Paris with her husband-to-be Derek (Paul Rudd), a news weatherman whom you know is actually the jerk that he is. Cue huge falling debris onto Susan on her wedding day, and she becomes Ginormica, captured by General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) who puts her in a top-secret pet ""zoo"" of sorts with his other trophies Insectosaurous, Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. (Hugh Laurie), a merman creature known as The Missing Link (Will Arnet) and the crowd favourite, the nonsensical B.O.B (Seth Rogen), a blob of jello goo with no brain who serves as the punching bag and the source of all things funny here.Speaking of funny, the laughs unfortunately don't come hard and fast. Attempts are made to be funny from the get go, but more often than not the effort fell flat on its face. It tried to emulate the Zucker brothers style of slapstick wit, and to a certain degree, when it worked it worked wonders, but you can sense an audience disconnect here when everyone fell silent most of the time. Even kids aren't tickled by the usual juvenile antics of the characters anymore, which now calls for a shift in sophistication.A whole host of stars join the lineup, such as Rainn Wilson as the villainous alien Gallaxhar, Stephen Colbert as the dim-witted President Hathaway, Amy Poehler as a computer voice and even Renee Zellweger, but despite the star power going all round in flesh out the carefully designed and crafted animated characters, ultimately everyone was one-dimensional and playing to their stereotypical tendencies. 3D-wise, there are only a handful (pardon the pun) of scenes that are specifically designed with that kind of interaction in mind, otherwise the visuals only provide that depth of view, and nothing much that will make you reach out or duck.Technically, you cannot fault Monsters vs Aliens. But essentially there's no heart in this film at all, and that proved to be its ultimate downfall that no novelty factor can redeem on its behalf.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
DreamWorks can be proud.,"The President of the United States (Stephen Colbert): ""Boys, set the terror level at code brown, 'cause I need to change my pants.""Monsters vs. Aliens is my first 3-D movienot really, but it is the first time I have felt the process worked within a film as an integral part of the artistic process. It supports the science fiction, titillates at times, but most of all gives the illusion of reality. DreamWorks can be proud of this addition to the pantheon of excellent contemporary animations (dominated by Pixar) that use its Shrek as a touchstone for memorable characters wedded to mature themes and superior techniques.Monsters vs. Aliens is also a family film in the truest sense: Elders to tots can enjoy the visual delights of 3-D outer space and observe a young bride-to-be Susan Murphy (voice of Reese Witherspoon) grow by a radiation accident into the heroic role of Ginormica, a woman literally too big for her britches. She must assert her independence from a self-centered fiancé and convince family, friends, and the world that an out-sized woman (read overachieving feminist) has a place in the male world, a superior place at that.A strength of this sweet film is its use of ironic, sometimes sardonic, language to satirize just about everyone, from the president (see the opening quotation, not great humor but entertaining) to the makers of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, whose feel good '70's glow is ripe for 21st-century cynicism, to memories of such chestnuts as The Blob and The Creature from the Black Lagoon.The hip,loving mood of the film is exemplified by the alien's proclamation at invasion time, ""Humans of Earth, my quest has led me to your planet. Give it to me now! You should, in no way, take any of this personally. It's just business.""",,Anonymous,Animation
"Not a classic, but should be Remembered","Monsters vs. Aliens isn't a certified classic of an animated film, but it's actually really fun and should be remembered for a number of reasons.While there are a bunch of jokes that fall flat, scenes that can come off as underwhelming, and can often be predictable and forgettable, it's still a movie that deserves to be remembered today.It doesn't quite hit the parody status they were hoping to achieve, it's still a good movie, with every character being memorable and fun in their own unique ways, from Susan Murphy/Ginormica as the main protagonist, to B. O. B. The Seth Rogen blob, and even to Gallaxhar the alien along with his giant army of Robot Probes. In fact I loved this film so much that I had even bought a toy of the Robot Probe that was $100, and it's actually pretty worth it if I'm being honest!So please, give Monsters vs Aliens at least one watch, you won't be disappointed! :)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fluff, but fun fluff","Monsters vs. Aliens is a family-friendly Dreamworks Animation feature which pits classic sci-fi monsters vs. space aliens, in a 1950's B-movie style showdown with modern humor and the visual flair available through today's computer effects. For a special treat, the film is also available in 3D.The story is simple. A meteor crashes on Earth, or more specifically, onto bride-to-be Susan Murphy. Some substance from the meteor causes her to grow to 50 feet in height. She is hidden by the government with other monsters (based loosely on The Creature From the Black Lagoon, The Blob, The Fly, and various Godzilla foes), until space aliens arrive, bent on world domination. Outmatched by the alien's technology, the U.S. government calls on the monsters to save humanity from annihilation.All of this is done with a light and fun air, with nothing taken too seriously. Like the best of recent animated features, Monsters vs. Aliens is as enjoyable for adults as for children, thanks in large part to a constant barrage of jokes and a stellar voice cast. Reese Witherspoon is wonderful as Susan Murphy, while 24's Kiefer Sutherland gets a rare chance to flex his comedic muscle as backwoods general W.R. Monger.The Office's Rain Wilson is fine as Galaxar (the evil alien), as is Arrested Development's Will Arnett as The Missing Link and House's Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach. Popular political comedian Stephen Colbert, in an inspired casting choice, plays the President of the United States. Hands down the best character, in my opinion, is Seth Rogen's B.O.B, a gelatinous creature who is blissfully stupid and eats anything in his path. The character design is fantastic, and the film is a visual treat. Monsters vs. Aliens comes recommended to people of all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but not quite as good as expected.","Monsters Vs. Aliens has some really funny moments, but by the time you get to see them on the big screen you've already seen them plenty of times on the small one. So there's not too much left to offer by buying a ticket. I thought the 3D was OK. They have a couple of moments specifically designed around flexing the 3d capabilities, but again nothing mind-blowing.The story revolves around the gigantic Susan (Reese Witherspoon) while pushing all the more interesting characters out of the spotlight. Susan is someone we've all seen in movies before. The victim of an unfortunate mishap leading her down a path she would rather not go down. So the plot follows the same course from there, feels pretty routine. Focusing more on the three other monsters would have made this a better movie. They're much more interesting and only get a small handful of moments to shine throughout the picture.That was probably the biggest letdown. Having some great comedic potential in the characters voiced by Hugh Laurie, and Will Arnett take a back seat ride. No complaints about Seth Rogen's B.O.B. though, he was great. Kiefer Sutherland was surprisingly good as the General. I underestimated his vocal range.Finally they made a big deal about Stephen Colbert playing the President, and there wasn't enough of him. All of his funny moments, except for the scene after some of the credits, saturated the coming attractions and commercials. I would have liked to see more of his character.Overall, its enjoyable. I like to see elements of classic old genres (like the classic monster movies of the 50's and 60's) brought to life in modern day CGI. I just thought this movie had more up its sleeve than it was showing me.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
This film works primarily because the female is the heroine which doesn't happen too often in films and in animation,"(2009) Monsters Vs. Aliens
COMPUTER ANIMATED/
FAMILYBasically it's a 'monsters taking on aliens' not 'humans vs aliens' slowed by a very long 30 minute introduction made almost similar to Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" except these characters are almost to the point of uninteresting. The plot has Susan (voice of Reese Witherspoon) whose just about to embark on marrying to a self absorbed duffous who conveniently gets struck by a flying meteor empowering her to become extremely large in size before being labelled as a ""monster"". She gets put away to some secret gov't facility with other uninteresting 'monsters' (voiced by Seth Rogen and Hugh Laurie of the popular show ""House"") but consist of super abilities and they eventually coincide against the attackers of earth. Mature viewers don't know if it could've happened to anybody else or does it just happen to Susan- we'll never know nor does it address Susan's bathroom/ hygiene issues since she's still a human but just a giant in size. Aforementioned, if viewers can get past the long introduction, this film may work as a female as the heroine which doesn't happen too often in films and in animation.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"The tagline of this movie should be ""Eh...""","Because that's exactly what you get. Monsters vs. Aliens isn't a TERRIBLE movie, but it's not very good either. The plot is predictable. That's something that you should expect from movies of this type. But a certain other animation studio (I think you know the one) makes the journey itself so enjoyable, and the scope of adventure so vast that it doesn't matter. Monsters vs. Aliens feels at times like a bunch of action scenes strung together by completely unfunny jokes. There's also a message of female independence here, one that gives the film a chick-flick flair. If that sounds bad, stick around. It gets worse.This movie is just not funny. It spouts pop culture references (a dirty habit of Dreamworks animation), one of which is embarrassing to watch even by oneself. The action scenes are... well, they're Incredibles-ish. At least they try to be. They attempt to be frantic and energetic, but it doesn't really turn out that way. The movie reaches its absolute lowpoint when we're supposed to mourn a character who's come off like one big joke the whole film. This eye-rolling moments leaves us wondering why we should care.But it's not all bad. In one particular scene, the main character Susan gets imprisoned. What happens next is surprising and exciting. You just don't expect that to happen. The celebrity presence in a Dreamworks film is always a certainty. They always put flash-in-the-pan idiots in lead roles. But in their defense, at least Hugh Laurie is subdued. You don't know that it's him, and that's something these big personalities should learn to make a convincing role. Still, Monsters vs. Aliens is quite mediocre. We know where it's going within ten minutes of the film and the rest is fleshed out by action scenes and dumbed-down comedy.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

3D IMAX version - Amazing!!!  One small point of contention!,"As far as the artistry and imagery, I was wowed let me tell you! And the plot was even great on the surface! As a mindless 'Overcoming the Monster' plot, it was superb. But...and this is a BIG but...if I see one more movie that portrays the woman as the selfless leading alpha-hero overcoming men and saving the day, and the men as (a) selfish egotists victimizing the poor hapless female, or (b) as a bunch of bumbling idiots following a woman's lead, I think I am seriously going to boycott this society. This seems to be an alarming trend in popular culture that I could really get on a soapbox about, but I'm not. At least not nearly as much as I'd like. The part that really bothers me is that men seem completely complacent in it. Completely unconscious! It would be against my conscience not to at least mention it. This is a pattern, not an anomaly. However, if you are not one to care about underlying ethical concerns such as the subtle systematic emasculation and/or vilification of men, this is a really great movie!

A bit stunted but undeniably fun,"If there is one movie this year that you would expect bar none to be  the most fun this year, then that movie would have to be Monsters Vs.  Aliens. Why? An irresistible premise, a massive ensemble comedic cast  and boasting three whole dimensions, the latest dreamworks animation  kid flick has everything going for it, and yet ultimately the whole  endeavor feels strangely stunted; the story seems stunted, the action  sequences seem stunted and many of the character arcs seem stunted.  Not that much of the above will matter to kids, nor to the adults who  go with them, nor did it matter much to me but there are simply so many  better films out there (*cough Pixar*) that the bar has been  permanently raised to such heights that even mammoth monsters or alien  technology cannot reach. Ultimatelty the success of the film lies with  the voice cast which includes Reese Witherspoon as Susan (later  forcefully renamed Ginormica) Seth Rogen as the blathering B.O.B.,  House's Hugh laurie as Dr. Coachroach, Will Arnett as The Missing Link,  Kiefer Sutherland as the steely General W.R. Monger, Rainn Wilson as  the evil alien Gallaxhar and finally Stephen Colbert as the dimwitted  President of the U.S.  While cute and likable Witherspoon doesn't have quite enough pizazz to  pull off voice work and the show is mostly stolen by Rogen, Arnett and  Laurie. There is scattered genius throughout Monsters vs Aliens, in the  satire of monster movies and alien invasion scenarios and simply with  some of the hilarious writing and impeccable delivery. Alas it  ultimately feels like the little brother of The Incredibles; lacking  the full punch, consistently snappy screenplay and pulse-pounding  action that will literally thrill young and old; here young an old will  only be amused. The plot is simple and the story progresses at a nice  pace, beginning with Susan being struck by a meteorite (that  coincidently is sought by Gallaxhar for devious purposes) that causes  her to grow to enormous size. Quarantined by the government she is  imprisoned with the other aforementioned misfits until general Monger  comes up with a proposal; prevent the alien invasion and earn their  freedom.  Unlike most animated films where a sequel almost always feels forced  and is always more disappointing then the first, I actually believe the  contrary here. Now that the set-up is complete and the lovable monster  team is assembled they can one-up themselves with a full-throttle  monster/alien brawl. The series has potential, that much is certain,  and the right balance of kid friendly and adult amusing antics are  present. All Dreamworks need to do is give the source material that  spark that made their other efforts like Shrek and Kung Fu Panda  irresistible and ultimately rewarding.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nothing new here,"Just because there are monsters and aliens in this film (which are CGI) doesn't give any assurance of a good film. What happened here was that they were too dependent on the concept of monsters and aliens that they gave little attention to the story. Development was limited to 4 not-so-interesting characters and the theme was very common (friendship, teamwork, etc.). A positive theme but they can always think of another, even better, one. Other animated movies seem to do it well.The characters I really liked only made an appearance in the first half of the movie, the other half focused on the friendship the ""monsters"" were starting to have. A waste of a good idea.Maybe kids will enjoy this generic CGI film, but even my siblings (ages 6, 10, and 13) didn't like this movie. It was forgettable.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very Over rated,"This film had the promise of being really funny with a great line up of talented actors such as Kiefer Sutherland, Seth Rogen, Reese Witherspoon and Hugh Laurie (all talented Actors) and produced by DreamWorks.Unfortunately the laughs were quite tame and even for mid aged kids they weren't very funny, being more for 4-9 age group. Whether the cause was the script writers strike or the need to push out as many films as possible I was left quite disappointed. This is definitely a wait for DVD film unless you are taking young children to a safe film. This was definitely run of the mill and if you paid for the 3d glasses you are probably now regretting this.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Survive the test of time,"The film entertains and survives the test of time. The premise honors old science fiction movies with characters appreciated by anyone who loves b-movie. The situation that triggers the film is well known, but what makes everything different is the presence of two or three very good jokes, references to many films (including and a very successful sequence in honor of Spielbeg ) and the good use of clichés that, when used wisely, result in it's enjoyable. Although the ending loses some rhythm, the film holds up and is enjoyed. They were right not to produce a sequel confirming that producers sometimes have some wisdom.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"basically, to enjoy this you have to know the old B movies","An oversized gal. A gelatinous life form. A half-human, half-fish. And on top of it, a gravelly-voiced general meeting the bespectacled president in the war room.No doubt any movie fan will recognize these characters from old movies, whether B movies or one of the greatest satires of all time. So now we have a combo in the form of ""Monsters vs. Aliens"", where a group of abnormal beings have to go up against a maniacal extraterrestrial bent on destroying everything.I suspect that the tykes who watched this simply thought everything looked cool, while the parents got all the references to other movies (assuming that they knew said movies).Nothing special, but enjoyable. I wonder how many people realized that the general's name looked like warmonger.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the Most Amazing and Underrated Films Out There!,"This is a great movie with a lot of action, humor, heart and it feels very relatable with excellent chemistry. I love this movie so much that I've lost count the numbers of times I've watched it again and again. I enjoyed all the characters. They were kind, funny, sweet and they all felt very relatable and you can really connect with them.I love the friendship between the monsters as Susan comes to learn they are just like any other regular person and sees them as real friends who accept her for who she is. I also liked the message this film was sending about how although life doesn't always turn out the way you wanted or planned, it can lead you to something greater instead.Monsters vs Aliens is one of my favourite movies and I feel like this is a very underrated film that deserved more recognition.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Generic stupid fun.,"Not that stupid fun is a bad thing, it can actually be quite hiliarious when it is done right. Well, Monsters vs Aliens wasn't. Not a terrible expirience for me, but it wasn't anything new or had anything really exciting to it.It's your basic story about one person being transformed into something different and learning things about being diiferent and ending up liking it . It was predictable and the humour could be funny at times but was rather hit or miss.The villain of the movie, Gallaxar, was the part that truely took it away from being all bland or stupid comedic characters. His self-important take-over-the-world attitude was what made me giggle most times. B.O.B. was also kind of innocently stupid granted he had no brain.It still looked good like most DreamWorks movies and it's a passable distraction for the kiddies, but lacks in many places.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
DreamWorks bold move,"This film in one of my guilty pleasures. Yes there are some story flaws if you take it too seriously, however don't forget, this is a comedy/action movie. In making this movie, DreamWorks made some bold moves. First they made this there first 3D animation. Second they blended a love of B monster movies with a ""Dirty Dozen"" idea of prisoners being let out of prison to defeat a greater threat. Third they gave Henry Jackman his first break in scoring the music, who did a fantastic job. Focusing on the character of Ginormica (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) they tell a story of a young woman letting go of her smallness and accepting herself and her true power. Besides being a flawless job of technical animation, the character of Ginormica may be one of the most beautiful girls ever to be computer animated. It is unfortunate that DreamWorks said there will not be a sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Falls flat if not for the 3D presentation,"Short on a compelling narrative and real characters, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is nonetheless an adequately entertaining endeavor for Dreamworks Animation greatly enhanced by its three-dimensional presentation in selected theaters. Which is to say seeing its resplendent visuals in 3D (particularly in IMAX) will at least partially offset the flatness of the hyper-zippy story littered with pop-culture jokes and action sequences that, though fun while they last, comes across like a bucket of popcorn that doesn't leave an impression after it's over.Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is about to marry Derek (Paul Rudd), a self-absorbed weatherman whose dreams of getting an anchor job comes at the cost of having to shatter her dreams of having a honeymoon in Paris. On the day of their wedding, an alien substance-filled meteorite slams on her that renders her the size of a small building, prompting a secret government agency to rename her as ""Ginormica"" and imprison her in a clandestine location along with other cryptozoological beings such as the Missing Link (Will Arnett), an anthrophomorphic cockroach (Hugh Laurie) and a dunderheaded yet well-meaninged gelatinous blob (Seth Rogen). But shortly, a nefarious tentacled alien (Rainn Wilson) arrives on Earth and the US government decides that the fate of the earth now lies in the hands of the monsters they have tried to hide from the general populace for the last 50 years.Obviously a throwback to the sci-fi horror movies from the '50s, directors Conrad Vernon and Rob Letterman affectionately lend a frolicsome cheekiness to the whole proceedings with arresting visuals and some humorous one-liners pumped up by the occasional rock-and-roll (and even an 80s funk) soundtrack. But inasmuch as the film is a visual stunner, it's unfortunately diluted by an overly familiar story and a moral that sounds less a genuine didactic than a target demography-pandering afterthought, compressing it into an altogether unmemorable affair that dissipates as soon as the novelty of 3D wears off.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bodily Presents,"This comment is on the Imax 3D version.I'm aware, when I watch movies, of what the scale of the narrative is that I am plugged into.Often these days, its the short for narrative. Eddie Murphy puts on a fat suit and hilarity ensues. Yokels discover oil and come to Beverly Hills. Girl has problems with mom. All the action on the screen is episodic around this simple core.Its what I call ""long form"" that interests me. You enter a world with cosmic machinery rich enough to match the one you live in. Things actually happen and change. There is overlap between the worlds themselves and this can matter in how you change and grow.But there is a layer above this, one that threads through movies and often is the only real narrative I can get. In the lowest form, this is anchored on celebrity, so for instance we can follow the story of Mel Gibson from energetic Australian-style actor, through discovering his intellectual limits, making a successful Weil copy and devolving into a caricature.More interesting is the journey of filmmakers, even film ideas. A variety along these lines is the metastory of animation studios. We have the ennobling story of Pixar with all sorts of interesting dimensions, and contrasted with that, the comparatively second rate Dreamworks Animation.Its actually a pretty interesting story to follow, because it has tragedy, desperation, huge risks. It has some scheming — for instance with the ""Ants"" movie designed to cripple ""Bugs Life."" Its particularly interesting when they try to leapfrog Pixar.They tried with ""Shreck"" and succeeded — at least so far as tickets — by engineering the humor and pathos because they just cannot seen to engineer story like Pixar can. Its an organizational thing I believe; committees cannot make real stories.Here they try something else and the results are pretty shocking to this observer. I think something important has happened. For this, you have to understand Pixar's two competitive advantages. One is the story engineering already mentioned. A second more cinematically interesting is the exploitation of their three-dimensional modeling to give us a new way of cinematically dealing with space, specifically in the way the camera is placed and moves.So what do Marshall-Kennedy do if they want to leapfrog Pixar? They surely cannot beat them on their own ground. Well, they try sex and three D and bury it. I am sure that what is going on here is all the usual stuff, that they had teams for story and gags and pacing and such. But the core experiment was in how to work with sex.By this, I mean not the ""in your face"" stuff of beer ads, but the soft familiarity of a sexual presence in the room. I can even tell you something about the age of the guy in charge of this team, knowing the effect that the ""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"" had on boys. Even the gay Almodova was affected; see the giantess scene in ""Talk to Her,"" and its foreshadowing in the first scene in the bathtub.What's going on here is that the third dimension allows a presence, a presentation of body that the flat screen simply cannot. Excepting the standard vocabulary of ""in your eye"" tricks, all the animation and modeling has gone into Susan's body. Not just her shape, which is expected, but subtle details of that shape. Particular attention is spent on how she moves, with a sensuous grace that is designed to be seductive. Yes, I know it is not obvious, but watch the beginning half again and note how surrounding women are presented, before we enter the action, second half.Look at how many computing cycles went into the way her clothing moves on her body. The cloth does not move as her skin does, but over her skin, emphasizing the womanly movement of the dancer that was used for the motion capture. Study how this compares to sexually-designed Japanese animation projects. See how clearly different and more human Susan's movements are from those of the other characters, especially the humans — except for the women that surround her in the first half.These things are highly, highly engineered. This studio is the most severe in this dimension. These releases are strategic probes into competitive progress on cinematic advantage. Its all about how to leverage the technology to capture eyeballs. Pixar cannot respond to this. Well played.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Animation
Formulaic  yet Fun!...An enjoyable family flick but  had the potential to be more,"""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is the latest (as well as, most aesthetically engaging & impressive;even sans 3-D) CGI animated film to date.It follows Susan; an amiable, relatable girl-next-door/bride-to-be, whose wedding day is horribly interpreted when a meteorite hits her & causes her to sprout to 50 feet, and captured by the U.S. government as their latest imprisoned top secret monster : ""Ginormica"".Away from her family, friends, fiancé & society for almost a month, she befriends the other captured govt't-contained monster.A scientist mutated into a cockroach, an amphibious monster, and a blue amorphous gelatinous blob.Susan/Ginormica & her monster co. are quite likable amusing & it would've been nice if they had more screen time & funnier dialouge to work with...But the aliens' motives & plot must be explained in the meantime.Like many animated family films these days, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" contains humor primarily aimed @ children & for the adults: silly random homages payed to adult genres.Example: Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" payed homage to the superhero genre Another Example: yet another Pixar favorite of mine, ""WALL*E"" payed homage to the sub-genre of post-apocalyptic dystopian sci-fi.The ""Shrek"" movies etc...' ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" obviously pays homage to monster movies, alien movies & disaster movies (the San Fransico bridge sequence was fantastic to watch) but I just feel that it had the potential to be something as excellent as ""The Incredibles"" but was stymied by Dreamworks' unwavering dependency on ""saturday morning cartoon"" dialog, formula, & delivery.Though I praised them earlier the interactions between the mad roach scientist, the blob & the sea monster do not seem fresh; like they were ripped straight out of a standard Saturday morning cartoon & I've seen them before....These 3 characters have an inspired backstories that are briefly explained in the movie, so I was expecting them to be a little more engaging.Now before you die-hard ""Dreamworks"" fans out there say this user comment isn't useful & submitted by a biased Pixar fangirl, I actually enjoy many Dreamworks movies; even the ones that are usually bashed like ""Bee Movie"".Although I laughed harder @ Bee Movie than I did ""Monsters vs. Aliens"", the latter movie is superior as a MOVIE but like the former Dreamworks flick, I think there was a lot of untapped potential.The visuals were excellent (the most beautifully animated Dreamworks film yet) but it wasn't as funny as it could've been even though there were many jokes & one-liners.However, I'm not a child nor do I have a family of my own, so maybe I'm being a tad bit harsh.Children (and most parents) will Definitely enjoy this movie, so I do recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"kids will find it to be like chocolate cotton candy in a silver platter.  everyone else, it's a coin toss","As a critic, or perhaps would-be one most days, when facing a movie like Monsters vs Aliens it's about context: I can recommend this movie about as highly as possible to anyone under the age of 12, because frankly, the producers and writers tried their hardest (and maybe succeeded) to create this movie in a lab so that it would reach that audience to the maximum. It's got bright and colorful monsters with singular personalities that keep kids entertained, including Insectosaurus who looks like a cross between Totoro and Godzilla and never utters a word, and some of those goofy gags and occasional physical bits of business that, from what I could hear seeing the movie with a nicely sized crowd, did the job well.As for everyone else- teens, young adults, kids' parents, the elderly, miscellaneous or other people I've forgotten to mention- it'll be hit or miss. This will depend on how many of these animated movies or sci-fi movie that the movie alludes to or just flagrantly rips off that tickle the funny bone. Sometimes, for me at least, they tried a little too hard. There's one joke in particular that is a perfect example, where the President (voiced by Stephen T. Colbert, who should be the best thing about the movie but isn't, a minor but significant disappointment) goes up to a keyboard to communicate with the aliens. This was funny if just for a moment because of the recognition of Close Encounters. It was a quick little gag that worked. But as though the filmmakers thought no one under the age of 20 would get it, they extended it, having the President go into playing a ""funky"" version of the Beverly Hills Cop theme by Herbie Hancock. It doesn't matter that kids probably wouldn't know it either. It just goes on too long and is too knowing of its goofiness to actually be funny after a while.Again, this is for those who may actually get the references. For kids, this is silliness on an epic scale that will keep their jaws drooling with the laughs. At the least there's a very good voice cast assembled- aside from fairly straightforward leads like Reese Witherspoon there's Seth Rogen and Hugh Laurie as monsters and Rainn Wilson as the evil alien set to make clones of him/itself to take over Earth- and it does have wonderful animation. Following soon after Dreamworks' success last year with Kung fu Panda they kick it up another notch in terms of the quality of its style, its detail (even a burger, yes a burger, shown early in the picture is fairly incredible), and in how it whips along from one cool sight to another. If eye candy is your thing, this is the thing for the, uh, month I guess (I actually bucked the trend and saw it in 2D, and it didn't seem to lose much of its ""umph"" in the regular format).Everything works on that surface level, but then when it comes to the characters and plot, whatever there is of it, it falls into some predictable things, or just ideas and motions that seem too familiar even as goofy homage. As comedy it doesn't come anywhere near Dreamworks' first big hits with Antz and Shrek, and as all-around entertainment it's a split decision. Parents wont be bored entirely, but they'll be the ones tugging their kids arms to see Pixar's Up! following the trailer more than the other way around.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
See it in 3D!,"Ifhere's one thing that's undeniable when it comes to DreamWorks Animation it's that its increasing in quality with every movie it makes, sure last month's Madagascar 2 wasn't quite up to snuff, but compare it to the original it may as well be Shakespeare. Kung Fu Panda couldn't hold a candle to last year's Wall-e but if you remember that this is the same studio that gave up Sharks Tale, the Panda doesn't look too shabby. So by making a film that riffs of everything I every loved about the 50's surely Monsters Vs Aliens should top them all, not quite. There are two ways to see monsters Vs Aliens, in 2D and in 3D. Which are so crucial they may as well be night and day. See it in 2D and it's a fun, forgettable animated movie that, while head and shoulders above Sharks Tale or Shrek the Third, its far from Pixar perfect. If you're lucky enough to see it in 3D, it might be one of the most entertaining experiences you'll have in the cinema all year. Calling the 3D visuals astounding is a huge understatement. Last month's Bolt looks petty in comparison, its stunning to watch and you'll get your money's worth even if it means paying full price and a little extra for the glasses.I'm afraid I might have to eat my worlds from an earlier post I did, while commenting on the new ""Up"" trailer. I might have mentioned my lack of enthusiasm for DreamWorks latest offering. Calling the trailer for it, dull uninteresting and unfunny. Two of which I'll be happy to retract. It certainly isn't dull. There isn't a second during the movie I slouched over in my seat. Your entertained 100% of the time, what doesn't quite work is the jokes. The movie feels split between two major audiences. There were jokes referencing moments from movies that kids below the age of 15 are likely not to have seen (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Mothra) with this looming to movie feels like its geared towards the audiences of film lovers who still revel in the wonders of 50's B-movies, however only seconds later were forced to sit through childish bodily functioned joke followed by a innocent giggle coming from the front row. In this sense then it pleases both audiences and deludes them at the same time, adults wont appreciate the childish fart jokes while the 50's references will escapee minors.When California girl Susan Murphy is unwittingly clobbered by a meteor full of outer space gunk on her wedding day, she mysteriously grows to 49-feet-11-inches tall. The military jumps into action and Susan is captured and secreted away to a covert government compound. There, she is renamed Ginormica and placed in confinement with a ragtag group of Monsters: the brilliant but insect-headed Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D.; the macho half-ape, half-fish The Missing Link; the gelatinous and indestructible B.O.B.; and the 350-foot grub called Insectosaurus. Their confinement is cut short, however, when a mysterious alien robot lands on Earth and begins storming the country. In a moment of desperation, the President is persuaded to enlist the motley crew of Monsters to combat the Alien Robot and save the world from imminent destruction.What's amiss is cleaver development, the films moves so fast and where rarely allowed to catch our breath to such an extent that some of the characters feel left out and excluded from what's going on. It's reassuring however that DreamWorks have made a film that both appeals to the avid movie lover in me as well as the young child. It works to an enormous extent and is a rarity that I can recommend both you and your child to go see this. You'll probably take your kids to see Monsters vs. Aliens, but you might have more fun seeing the movie without them.Verdict: Its rare i ever come across a split verdict for a movie, I'm usually set on how I feel. With this I was debating it and debating it and could come to only one conclusion.With a witty script and a collection of adorable characters, Monsters doesn't have a lot of emotional depth, but it's a well-designed crowd-pleaser. You can't go wrong if you're willing to fork out an extra couple of pounds for the 3D experience. For my overall rating I give Monsters Vs. Aliens 3D 4/5 while the 2D experience gets an enthusiastic 3/5.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Nice, clean, smart fun","As far as Dreamworks movies go, it is not as good as How to Train Your Dragon, Prince of Egypt and Shrek, but for me Monsters vs. Aliens is one of their better efforts. True, the story is predictable and there isn't much character development. That said, the animation is beautiful, with well modelled characters and bold bright colours and backgrounds. Not to mention the battle on the Golden Gate bridge, which was stunning. The writing is also very funny and smart, the references to Close Encounters, ET and Men in Black are clever, the music is fun and the characters while not having much development are likable and charming. The voice acting is also solid and fit their characters well, Reese Witherspoon is a nice surprise and Hugh Laurie especially is fun. All in all, very good fun, not a classic, but enjoyable family entertainment. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Must see in 3D,"Who do you root for when it’s aliens versus monsters, anyway? This isn’t like Aliens versus Predator, where no matter who won, we lost. OK, time’s up - it’s monsters. The monsters - the Missing Link, Dr. Cockroach, Ginormica, B.O.B., and Insectosaurus - are on our side, helping to defend Earth from the dastardly intentions of one Gallaxahar.Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) is searching for an element called quantonium, which he believes will make him superpowerful or something. Some quantonium has landed on Earth in the form of a meteorite. A meteorite that lands on Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) right before her wedding, causing her to grow to enormous proportions! Soon the military catches her and imprisons her with other caught monsters from over the past fifty years. And then when Gallaxhar sends a massive robot probe to Earth, a probe that is invulnerable to all attacks, only one group of mostly inhumanoids can save the day! In addition to Susan, now known as Ginormica, there’s B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), a gelatinous blob; Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) , a roach-human hybrid; The Missing Link (Will Arnett), a gill-man; and Insectosaurus, a giant - and I mean giant - grub. Bound together by a thirst for justice and fresh air, they “agree” to fight back against the robot probe.Couple of things to note here. First, although this is a PG-rated film, there’s a notable use of the word “boobies.” As a male adult, I think it’s awesome that such a word has finally made into kiddie fare, although the fact that I have no kids probably plays into that a little bit. Still, I don’t think it bothered the sold-out crowd in the theater; at least there were no audible gasps. Also, the violence, because it’s in 3D - yes!! - is a little more intense than for a 2D movie, since it’s all in your face and such. Again, I don’t think it affected the kidlets negatively.Another thing to note is that Seth Rogen is a comedic genius. Fans of his live-action stuff have known that for a while, of course, and now the kids will, too, if they know he’s the voice behind B.O.B., who falls for a plate of Jell-O at one point. Rogen’s comic timing is hilariously on key, and he always sounds as if he’s having the time of his life.Reese Witherspoon (like Rene Zellweger in Bee Movie), as Susan, is a sweet, engaging voice actress as well. Her bemusement as she struggles with her sudden height - she uses cars as roller skates - is entertaining. There are also some slight nods to other movies; the President (played memorably by Stephen Colbert) plays the famous five notes from Close Encounters of the Third Kind before showing the Vulcan hand sign. And when the military attacks the probe, one plane has “ET GO HOME” painted on its side.This is definitely a movie that makes good use of 3D technology, and it’s one that viewed in 2D would seem pedestrian. It’s not quite a classic, but there are plenty of good jokes - particularly from Rogen - and it’s well cast. The kids will enjoy it, and it’s another in a line of enjoyable DreamWorks animated features.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
boring and disappointing,"Went and saw Monsters vs Aliens on Friday. It was a cute movie, but very disappointing overall.We were very excited to go as (1) it's in 3D and (2) we were babysitting one of our friend's cool little brother who was pumped to go to the movies.About halfway through he got so bored that he started playing Mario Kart on a borrowed DS. I kid you not.That was the biggest issue. It was just a boring movie overall. The fight scenes don't last nearly as long and weren't as frequent as the previews suggest. In fact, there are only two main fight scenes and neither manages to make the movie worth while.The whole movie revolves around Susan (the woman who grows into a giant after getting hit by a meteor) and her issues rather than around the much more fun idea of monsters fighting aliens. Susan's tale is one that has been told a million times over with the exact same conclusions - yet they dragged it on and committed the movie to it.The positives: There are lots of fun old sci-fi references. When the President first tries to make contact with the aliens, I couldn't stop laughing. It was classic. Also, when other reviews say Seth Rogan is the highlight of the movie, they aren't kidding - well, his character, Bob, is anyway. His performance is brilliant and brings the most laughs, though the other voice acting is quite excellent as well just unfortunately falls flat on humor.It's really too bad Susan was even in the movie. Taking her out of it would have given the script much more alien vs monster goodness to play with rather than focusing on her boring dilemma that we all knew exact plot and ending for.The cool concepts of monsters and aliens couldn't liven this old story.Overall, I'd say don't go see it in theaters. Even the 3D is lack luster. I would have been much happier just renting it and watching it at home during a dull afternoon.I badly wanted to love this movie but I came away with a bored 12 year old boy and crappy giant black nerd 3D glasses rather than the cool paper red and blue ones.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, funny and heartfelt","When it comes to big-screen animation, it's pretty widely accepted that Pixar frequently mines critical and commercial gold whilst their biggest rival, Dreamworks Animation, provides the fluff. Pixar certainly possess the largest awards cabinet, but Dreamworks know how to attract an audience, with the likes of Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon all developing into successful franchises with memorable characters. With the market now aggressively over-saturated with animated efforts for the whole family, a few of their titles have flown under the radar, and sometimes unfairly. 2009's Monsters vs. Aliens is one such example: a fun, funny and heartfelt throwback to 50's B-movies that spawned some spin-off shorts, but wasn't successful enough to warrant a sequel.In California, Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) is waiting to marry her vain TV weatherman fiance Derek (Paul Rudd), who has just announced the news of a job offer in another state. Before the wedding ceremony kicks off however, a huge asteroid crashes down on top of Susan. and although she appears unaffected at first, the mysterious energy given off by the rock causes her to grow to enormous size. With her head now peaking through the roof and the guests running for their lives, the military are quick on the scene, capturing Susan and taker her to a secret government facility ran by General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland), who has been hoarding a collection of strange monsters for decades.There she meets fellow captives B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), a boneless blob of blue goo; Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. (Hugh Laurie), a genius half-man, half-insect; The Missing Link (Will Arnett), a hybrid of sea creature and ape, and Insectosaurus, a gargantuan mutated bug. Their futures look increasingly bleak, but when alien Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) arrives on Earth in search of the crashed meteorite, US President Hathaway (Stephen Colbert), gives Monger the go-ahead to put his freaky prisoners to the test and straight into battle with the intergalactic invader.B-movie fans will spot the homages immediately, and there's enough of a modern twist to the rag-tag gang of 'monsters' to delight any children watching. The references are obvious: there's Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, The Blob, The Fly, Creature from the Black Lagoon and Mothra, but the characters are so lovingly crafted and terrifically voiced by a talented cast that they feel more love letter than straight rip-off. Although there are a few laugh-out-loud moments, Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon's film, working from a script by no less than five writers, fails to be consistently funny, and the arrival of Gallaxhar is a one-note plot device designed to bring everybody together. But there are some exciting set-pieces, particularly whenever the weirdly adorable Insectosaurus is involved, and there is enough heart woven into its fabric to make Monsters vs. Aliens one of Dreamworks' most underappreciated animations.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar has nothing to worry about,"This is what happens when the film-makers think that the audience will only be very small children who will only notice sounds and colours. A relatively small amount of script rewrite could have risen this film to the level of Pixar's greatest achievements. The premise is interesting, and the rest of the talent involved is top notch.But as it stands, it's a lot of very lazy internal illogic an inattention to detail.Pixar writers would have cleaned it up before one cel of animation was generated or one line of dialogue was recorded. And such improvements would not make it harder to understand for very small children.Dreamworks is a microcosm of what I don't like about Spielberg. He's a very competent director in many aspects, but there's a ""suck factor"" that seems to invade much of what he touches.Could it be that the thing that costs the least and requires the least amount of technology (writing) is placed way too low as a priority?",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A banal and flat affair.,"Every once in a while, a children's animated film will come out that is tailored towards children, and yet written from an adult frame of mind—like the best works of Roald Dahl, such works usually incorporate both the younger and older audiences into their respective appeal. More often than not however, the animation genre is one flooded with tired clichés, dry, disconnected vocal performances and mundane writing fit only for the minds of those unaccustomed to the more substantive forms of entertainment. It's the kind of writing that is not only targeted at children, but consistently feels like it was written by them; unsurprisingly, the little ones will get some kick out of it all, but for everyone else (and I include some of the more discerning of children in this exception), Monsters Vs. Aliens will instead only mildly distract with its pretty pictures and sporadically amusing farce.What's most surprising about the extremely derivative writing present within the movie's script however, is that it comes directly from chaps involved with quite a few of the genre's most enjoyable and original outings. Yet constantly burdened with lame plotting, contrived moments of three-dimensional dazzle, and jokes that grow calluses on their proverbial faces after the first act, Monsters Vs. Aliens is a remarkably dumb, forgettable affair that is sure to induce more yawns than laughter. Of course, it's rather unfair to judge a children's movie purely on an adult perspective, and so I must concede that younger viewers will inevitably enjoy the experience quite a bit more than adult counterparts; but not by much.You see, part of what makes a good animated film the nice breath of fresh air for adults, and the sweet piece of candy it is for children, is usually reliant upon one thing; the characters. It's disappointing then that Monsters Vs. Aliens lacks any definable, or memorable personas within its ensemble. Sure enough, there's B.O.B., the gelatinous blue blob who inherits Seth Rogen's signature dumb-ass laugh (which still isn't getting old, believe it or not), and even a surprising addition of Stephen Colbert as an obnoxious United States President (go figure), but even these two mildly amusing additions never truly come off the screen. Not only is it frustrating to be forced to artificially root for a protagonist we're never really given a chance to care about (that's Susan by the way, played by a bland Reese Witherspoon), but there is also a distinct lack of comic relief to the whole thing—in fact, the best parts to Monsters Vs. Aliens aside from Colbert's brief appearances, are all the cool space shots and action sequences.This of course, brings us to the primary reason many people will be seeing the feature in the first place; the 3D. As a separate medium, or movement on its own, the three-dimensional movie has yet to truly take off, but with frequent glimpses into what the technology can do over the past few years (and with many in line for this year alone), there's no denying that those images at least do tend to take the breath away. Seen through comfortable glasses, Monsters Vs. Aliens can be a wonderful treat for the eyes. There's the beautiful exterior shots, and the close-quarters actions sequences which all flow terrifically and jump out at you in ways that aren't always contrived for the sake of milking the technology. Yet for the good that it does for the movie's aesthetic appeal however, the overall impression is that without such an artificial distraction, Monsters Vs. Aliens would be a banal and flat affair.The problem is that despite the awe-inducing animation and sometimes amusing performances, the majority of the feature is actually devoid of any life. The story, which I have neglected to give a synopsis of, simply because I have deemed it largely unnecessary (okay, so aliens come to take over Earth, and monsters have to stop them), is so predictable and formulated that it will literally take a child who has seen no more than five movies to not see everything that's coming. Furthermore, there's also the complete lack of character, humour and heart that are key to delivering an enjoyable and memorable experience fit for both the children, and the adults who have accompanied them. Children will find B.O.B. funny, and they will laugh whenever his buddy Missing Link (Will Arnett) bangs his head on something, but that's about it—ask them who their favourite character was and they'll probably just say ""the blue guy"". Why? Because he's silly and brainless, much like the script in which he resides; and yet he is the highlight of the feature so what does that say? - A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,Animation
Another somewhat mediocre CGI flick,"I had high hopes for ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" and in certain respects it met those expectations but substantially as a whole it failed to meet them.Why? Because essentially it lacks real heart.It just felt wrong - you'll know what I mean when you watch it. Like Pixar's ""Cars,"" it just lacked the heart, the engaging storytelling of their past triumphs.The story is fine, if a bit retreaded from alien movies - a super-secret group of monsters sequestered away by a vague, mysterious government agency is finally (after 50 years, holed away in a facility that, had it been real, likely cost billions to operate, but let's not let reality intrude) called to action when an evil alien named Gallaxhar invades earth to retrieve a vital mineral that made one of the monsters-Ginormica, voiced by Reese Witherspoon--a monster in the first place.There is some good action, the CGI animation pretty solid (standard, I'd say, by today's standards), and the climactic battle scenes good but, while it is supposed to feel heartwarming as Ginormica grows surer of her identity as a ""monster,"" it feels somewhat limp.My theory - and take that for what it's worth, which is nothing - is that these CGI movies generally fall flat because there are too many big name, big screen actors taking these roles. I'm serious - there are just too many big names here and I don't think they're up to the task of good voice acting, which is a whole different ball game than screen acting. I didn't think Reese and Hugh Laurie were particularly good though Seth Rogen as B.O.B. the blob is pretty funny.Let me provide a supporting argument for this theory: In the movie ""Bolt,"" John Travolta, in my opinion, was not that great as the movie's namesake dog. Likewise Miley Cyrus was not that great, which is not saying much as Cyrus is a questionable actor anyway. But Mark Walton, who voices Rhino in that movie, and is a professional voice actor, was very, very funny and really made that movie worth watching.The biggest problem in my opinion is not that the big name actors are especially bad - though I think they lack the art of good, professional voice actors - but rather that we know the voices themselves. We know Reese's voice and Travolta's and so on.Of course my theory falls apart in movies like ""Kung Fu Panda"" where major names like Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman, voice stars of that movie, deflate my theory entirely. Of course ""Kung Fu Panda"" was ""A grade"" CGI, storytelling, and easily on par with Pixar fare which has set the gold standard for animated CGI. ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" - not so much.All said ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is decent, not spectacular, somewhat fun, but not amazing. Much of the humor feels rather flat to me. It's enjoyable to a point and then seems to strain.My feeling? Wait for the DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good sarcastic fun in glorious 3d,"This movie looked amazing especially in Imax 3d. The textures in particular were great. I liked the monster designs except perhaps for Insectosaur but I would have liked more actual aliens. Beyond the beautiful 3d graphics (which eventually might look dated), it was lots of fun to watch with a few clever in jokes for movie or geek fans. A special mention goes to the president ""talking"" to the alien. It did lack some of the heart and magic present in most Pixar films but it did have more fun sarcastic humor and was overall quite entertaining. The simple plot was serviceable except for one particular predictable ""twist"" (which kids might not see coming perhaps).Rating: 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Monsters vs. Aliens is a good enough for a rental or a cheap matinée screening, but paying extra for the 3-D glasses isn't a good investment for such an adequate product.","Animation is a wonderful medium that allows us to create worlds and creatures that would not be possible in the realm of live-action film-making. However, like in live-action, the most important aspect in animation is the story. No matter how fantastic your visuals will be or how funny and multi-generational your jokes are, if your script is not up to snuff, your film is going to be simply average. Featuring an all-star cast of talented film and television actors, Monsters vs. Aliens is similar to an amusement park ride. You have fun while on it, it all passes by very quickly and then you forget about it some moments later as you go on the next ride.When a planet explodes and a meteorite enters the Earth's atmosphere, Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) comes in contact with it and soon she grows into a giant. Naturally, she is caught by the government and detained in a top-secret building with other monsters: a scientist who experienced a botched experiment to give people the live-span of cockroaches (Hugh Laurie), a gelatinous blob with no brain (Seth Rogen), a playboy fish-ape hybrid (Will Arnett) and finally, the chemically-altered Insectosaurus. When an alien leader Galaxaar (Rainn Wilson) attacks the planet, the President (Stephen Colbert) calls upon this group of monsters to help save the day.Monsters vs. Aliens just feels like a fun excuse to show off some impressive visuals, but without a concrete story, it's hard to care for the main characters or their quest to save the world. Susan is quite under-developed and I didn't feel much emotion for her character in the same way I did for, say, Stitch (from another animated science-fiction comedy Lilo & Stitch) or last year's Wall-E. The best aspect of the film is B.O.B. Seth Rogen does a great job in the role and even when he's not saying anything or when the scene is not centered on him, the character's facial expressions are hilarious to watch. Stephen Colbert also does some funny work as the President of the United States (the role he was pretty much born to play). The rest of the actors do good jobs, but nothing quite impressive. Had a professional voice actor like Jim Cummings and Tress McNeille taken on those roles, they would have knocked them out of the park.In any case, the film has enough good humour and well out-together action sequences that the audience will not be bored by it and Monsters vs. Aliens feels half as long as the advertised running time. However, some added character development would have helped the film from being just another run-of-the-mill DreamWorks animated comedy. While certainly better than the likes of Shark Tale or Madagascar, it doesn't reach the heights of their other comedies, most notably Shrek and Bee Movie. Monsters vs. Aliens is a good enough for a rental or a cheap matinée screening, but paying extra for the 3-D glasses isn't a good investment for such an adequate product.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Finally someone understands the use of 3D goggles.,"The latest effort from Dreamworks Animation is among their best efforts to date and, for the first time, I see them stepping ahead of Pixar.What a better set-up for an animated film than Earth when it is about to be invaded by a squid-like alien with his fair amount of bad eyes and his army of clones? You get to meet a group of monsters in their containment area somewhere deep within Area fifty***. The Creature From the Black Lagoon (Missing Link), the Blob (BOB), The Fly (Dr. Cockroach), Mothra  one of Godzilla's enemies (Insectosaurus) and the 50 foot Woman (Ginormica/Susan)  who is only 49ft by the way  are all covered here. One may wonder where is the Giant Killer Tomato or the Invisible Man but this handful of monsters are enough to nullify the Alien menace.The movie itself is pure enjoyment: Colbert as the President is hilarious, Laurie is an excellent mad scientist and I could not point a single flaw in the cast but, it is definitely Seth Rogen who shines voicing BOB, the inform mass of gelatinous goo. He adds layers of volume to the character and brings his own goofiness with him.The action is well paced, you don't perceive any lengths or unnecessary moments, even better, you don't feel there is missing any either. As an added bonus, the movie does not feature horrible cover versions of musical gems like in some other Dreamworks Animation movies.Monsters VS Aliens raises the bar for animated movies when it comes to technical achievement. It is the first film I see that makes an adequate use of 3D. The computer rendered 3D world is seemingly the only suitable setup for stereoscopic vision as it failed to impress beyond 'Oh Well!' when used with flesh and bones actors and filmed decors.If you are heading to see this movie, make sure it's in 3D, the movie itself is worth seeing no matter the viewing experience but what really makes it special is the rendering of everything in stereoscopy.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"For what it's worth, this movie isn't half bad.","First off, Lemmie tell you guys something important. If you have read my review on Kung Fu Panda, you'll know that it's a true fact Dreamworks have started working on animation for quite some time now since 11 years ago in 1998, that includes their first computer animated movie Shrek and then from where on there, they give us unforgettable moments and fun but very lovable characters to watch.But, as the more we get into CGI and much less of traditionally hand drawn animation in the 21st century, our love for animated movies might of wear out; and then there's Monsters Vs. Aliens.To start off, let's just say I thought Shark Tale and Bee Movie was better before I saw this, not that I'm complaining but it needs a little bit more work. The film starts off with a beautiful young woman named Susan Murphy play by the wonderful loving Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon, getting married to a weather reporter young man from the news named Derek Dietl play by Paul Rudd who you might recognize his work from I Love You Man, Role Models, and Knocked Up. He's not a very hard guy to spot if you're familiar with the voice in this movie.Their wedding goes out fine before she gets hit by a meteor and grows into a 49 foot giant size monster named Ginormica (Funny name if you ask me). That's when she gets send by a little place called Area 51 from a General named W.R. Monger (voiced by 24 action star Kiefer Sutherland. His voice is really hard to realize when you're watching the film cause it's very rough around the edges when he speaks.) and meets three monsters.B.O.B. (play by Seth Rogen, who course lend his voice before in Horton Hears A Who and Kung Fu Panda) a silly goofy little blob. A green swimming monster (can't remember what type he was suppose to be) called The Missing Link (whose voiced by Will Arnett who also was in Horton Hears a Who with Seth Rogen) and of course a human scientist with the size of a cockroach head named Dr. Cockroah Ph. D (voiced by Hugh Laurie who is quite known for his role of that crazy thriller horror show House) Their world suddenly becomes in huge danger when a four eyed alien from outer space plans to take over the world so it's up to Susan (aka Ginormica) and her new friends to save the day! For what it's worth, the movie isn't half bad, but you may want to think it over when you're watching a movie like this. I really personally thought it was gonna suck when I first saw the previews and trailers, but then the more I look at it, I began to realize it couldn't be half bad because Dreamworks has given us a bunch of laughable movies we can watch over and over. Besides Shrek and Kung Fu Panda, there's also Madagascar 1 and 2, Over the Hedge, The Prince of Egypt, The Road to El Dorado, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron and Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas.I know there's a little bit more than that, but I don't wanna waste the rest of my review spamming a list of Dreamworks movies. So if you're really into Sci-Fi stuff, then this movie would be for you! If not, well...there's always something else better to watch. Would I ever recommended for people to watch this film? I might and I might not, but it's their choice. Not mine!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"So-So, If Not For the 3D Effects","They were already showing trailers of upcoming movies when we came in. I was very surprised to discover that all three of the movies previewed all had 3D trailers! These were ""Coraline"", ""Up!"" and ""Meatballs"". The studios really have to go the extra mile to ensure people will still be watching in theaters.As for ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" I frankly did not like the movie too much. The Monster characters who are supposed to be the good guys are not too memorable or cute. Even my 7-year old son found the character of Link and Insektosaurus to be ""corny"". The character of Susan/Ginormica is rather ""meh"", with a predictable character arc.On the other hand, there were also positives. The main bad guy Alien Gallaxhar, a sinister squid with 4 eyes, was more interesting. The artwork of the alien spaceship interior were also more interesting. The character of the US President was the only thing that is really funny, especially the scene where he makes first contact with the Alien probe, and that stupid scene at the end of the credits.But of course, the best thing about this movie is the 3D. I think I would have dozed off if not for these special 3D effects. But then as the trailers have shown with all these upcoming 3D animated features, this trend may not be something extra special anymore in the future.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun but also acts as an example of why Dreamworks remains in second place to Pixar in all regards,"When she is stuck by an alien meteorite, summer bride Susan finds herself growing to enormous size and in possession of great strength – neither of which she wanted as the intervention of the US military does rather put a damper on her wedding day. Next thing she knows she is in a secret facility and part of a group of other monsters and mutants which the government keeps under wraps for the greater good. However, when an alien forces comes to Earth searching for the power that transformed Susan, the Government has no choice but to unleash their ""monsters"" to fight back.The family animated film ""genre"" is pretty crowded at certain times of the years. Since Pixar hit big with films that deliver plenty of adults and children, many have tried to do the same. Dreamworks has probably been one of the more successful and Monsters v Aliens is, for better and worse, a fine example of their output. The adventure story provides plenty of spectacle and, as two people in their 30's watching this without children, we were consistently engaged by it thanks partly to this. What worked mostly better for me was the humour. In the most case the film is pretty funny thanks to the characters and the dialogue – BOB and Dr Cockroach are probably the strongest and they provide plenty of laughs. In contrast I thought the Missing Link was only OK as a character. I was chuckling consistently when the main group were around and the only bits I felt were poorly judged were most of the stuff involving the President (which was a waste of Stephen Colbert – a very smart lampooner of politicians); his keyboard moment didn't work and is quickly followed by an inappropriate joke about soiling himself.Otherwise the voice cast is well used. Witherspoon plays it more or less straight and does a solid job. Rogen and Laurie dominate the laughs and their delivery is great. Arnett is capable of more although his presence along with Tambor makes for an amusing Arrested Development moment and of course Poehler is in there too. The Office's Wilson is fun as the ""baddie"" of the piece although Sutherland, Colbert and Rudd are not really particularly good or well used for a variety of reasons.The one thing that this film cannot do though, is to deliver anything beyond the impressive visuals, smart lines and fleeting laughs. It doesn't appear to be trying to have more than this which is fair enough but for my money MvA does remind the viewer of the difference in class (generally) between Pixar and Dreamworks. Pixar films generally seem to be able to do all that this film can, but also deliver so much more – while Dreamworks seems happy with pop culture references in place of depth. That said it is harsh to judge this film against a very high bar of Pixar's best films, but rather it should be met on its own merits. So, yes, while there are things that don't work and also aspects that could have been significantly stronger, the film is generally colourful, funny and engaging for a wide age range. Not a classic by any means but it is still fun.",,Anonymous,Animation

decent but unmemorable,"When a giant robot from outer space threatens to destroy all life on Earth, a group of adorable monsters - whose very existence has been kept under raps for decades by the federal government - is deployed to defeat the menace. One of the ""monsters"" is Susan (energetically voiced by Reese Witherspoon), an average California girl who becomes a multi-story giantess after she is hit by a meteorite on the day of her wedding. The save-the-planet mission she is sent on gives her a chance to prove to herself and to those around her that she has what it takes to make a difference in the world.""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a minor-league animated effort that is clearly aimed more at the youngsters in the audience than at the adults. Kids will enjoy the cutesy creatures, the frenetic pacing, the bright colors and clean backgrounds, and the nonstop action sequences that make this feel at times almost like a ""Transformers"" for the pre-teen set. And speaking of other movies, the film is stuffed to bursting with cinematic allusions, ranging from ""Close Encounters"" to ""E.T."" to ""The Wizard of Oz"" to ""The Blob"" to ""Attack of the 50-foot Woman"" to ""Dr. Strangelove,"" some of which will be familiar to the kiddies and some of which only the adults in the audience will be able to pick up on.Overall, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is lively, attractive and innocuous and will probably be forgotten by most viewers a good five minutes after they've seen it - the older viewers, that is.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Monster-ific DreamWorks classic,"I saw this movie in 3D, and after that, I knew that it was another DreamWorks classic. Though it might not make it to my ""top favorite DreamWorks movie list.""After a radioactive meteor exposes Susan Murphy to quantonium, she undergoes a mutation that transforms her into a monster. This prompts General W. R. Monger to classify her as such. He sends her to a top-secret prison facility with other monsters, including B. O. B., Dr. Cockroach, Missing Link, and Insectosaurus. The monsters have lived in isolation for 50 years, forbidding contact with the outside world. Susan wishes to return to her old life, but an alien named Gallaxhar detects the radiation and deploys a robotic probe to extract it. Desperate for help, Monger orders the monster crew to combat the aliens and save the world.That's all I could tell you, folks. You'll have to see the film to find out how it ends.

"Mutated creatures, UFO's, and genre satrire: Oh my!","Monsters vs. Aliens is one of the better animated films of the last couple of years. It's really a genre satire film, and makes the humor fresh because its references to other movies are done so subtly. The sight gag bits support the development of the story's own universe. (Much better than those genre-title movies that just reenact scenes from recent films.) Sci-Fi movies are the target this time, ranging all the way from the way out drive-in alien invaders of the 50's to recent sci-fi encounters. I didn't keep count, but some good stuff from at least 25 movies and probably more were hidden to pop up at opportune moments here. Some are disguised, others are more obvious, but the jokes all work.A bride-to-be gets conked by a rogue meteorite, turning into a 50-foot giant. Men-in-black seize her, and she becomes a reluctant heroine joining a team of sci-fi mutated good-guys opposing alien nasties. This story line is a nice framework for adapting all the craziness of the numerous sight gags, and there's a good flow in the action. My only criticism might be that the main character, Susan, is written somewhat melancholy and bitter. It really wasn't necessary, and conflicts with other comically written characters. The gooey blob, the mammoth bug, the missing link, and the bug scientist all make for a great team. I especially got a kick out of the nut case villain guy, who wants to conquer the universe. His multi-eyes that look in different directions are classic.Fun stuff. There's humor in this movie that both adults and kids can appreciate, making for a great family film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Monsters vs Awesome,Honestly I thought this movie was going to be like a lot of other Dreamworks movies a bunch of pop songs and Mike Meyers but instead this movie is hilarious and not filled with a bunch of pop culture references. I have to add this is a pretty original premise the story is kind of predictable but it is a kids movie so I am not looking for too much depth.The story starts with a meteor landing on this girl named Susan (Reese Witherspoon)on her wedding day because of this she gets the power to grow really big and she can't get smaller so the government captures her and throws her in this secret facility with the other monsters. You can tell they are all buffoons but funny ones. Well honestly the aliens attack the government can't beat them so they send monsters it is that simple of a story but it is a fun one at that.The voice acting is phenomenal Reese Witherspoon is OK she is the level headed I just want my old life back girl. Then you got Seth Rogan is perfect as a voice actor I liked him in Paul and I like him in this Seth do voice acting I hate your stoner comedies. His character is a blob named Bob and this guy is so retarded it is funny not slapstick retarded but just stupid funny. Hugh Laurie play a cockroach named Dr.Cockroach and he is great as the mad scientist his evil laugh got me every time. Will Arnett was good his character didn't have any memorable lines but he was still good. The villain Gallaxhar had his moments of hilarity but nothing special.So overall this has a kind of a weak but interesting plot great voice acting and wonderful writing with jokes that keep you constantly laughing. I can only give this movie a Buy if you have kids if not a strong very strong rental.,,Anonymous,Animation
Solid Animation,"The new animated film to grace the theaters this year, Monsters vs. Aliens is quite the enjoyable ride. Completely entertaining although not offering any depth in terms of characters, story, or themes, this is still a very good film.The voice talents are really on point with this one. Seth Rogan sticks out especially as the monster, B.O. B., the no-brain having misfit who steals your heart through the tale. Hugh Laurie, Reese Witherspoon, Rainn Wilson, and Will Arnett put forth their admirable voice works and shine.The 3-D effects were definitely outstanding. They took full advantage of it and showed the audience a very good time. The effects were better than Coraline's 3-D efforts but not as engaging with the story.Simply put, if you have little brothers or sisters, nieces or nephews, or just enjoy the occasional animated film, go check it out but enjoy the 3-D experience, its well worth it.***/****",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Don't expect Shrek quality in this one.Boring for the mature people, but probably be alright if you are younger and haven't seen or made the connection with other films.

"3D is spectacular, but everything else is horrible","This may sound extremely strange if you haven't watched the it, but Monsters Vs. Aliens is an extremely unimaginative movie. The plot has been used millions and millions of times before. Now, the 3D is spectacular, so I give it props for that. But everything else about this movie is so... predictable. The screenwriters, tossed unoriginal material, clearly tried to make the most of it, but ending up flopping in the end, trying to include pop culture potshots, but not pulling it off as successfully as the Shrek movies. The voice direction, may I add, was also painful. If the directors were trying to squeeze any emotion out of Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon during their scenes together, or Hugh Laurie and Will Arnett trying to come up with a plan for their lives, they failed miserably. Seth Rogen seems to have to direct himself in the only decent voice performance in the movie. Yet, kids should eat this movie up, while adults should wince in pain at the horribly placed jokes and cringe at the cheesiness. The shallow plot tries to teach the lesson that it doesn't matter what your friends look like on the outside, it's what's on the inside that matters. Huh, that's a new one. While the producers and screenwriters try to keep kids entertained with ""funny"" jokes while they teach this lesson, the whole thing comes across as extremely cheesy. But, unfortunately, this one should score big at the box office. If anyone happens to read this review, I would recommend going to see I Love You, Man instead of Monsters Vs.

Not Intended To Be Taken Seriously  And That's a Good Thing!,"Monsters vs. Aliens is a lot of low-key fun, as a small group of pretty easy-going ""monsters"" are released from decades of secret imprisonment by the government and, evidently bearing their erstwhile captors no ill will, help the US (""the only country where flying saucers ever seem to land"") fend off an invasion from an evil alien overlord. The invasion comes in 2 stages: 1st a gigantic robotic probe that our heroes battle on the Golden Gate Bridge, and 2nd the archfiend Gallaxhar himself and his army of not very perceptive clones. A 4-eyed squid descendant, he's the sole survivor of his late planet, but he assures Susan, the 49'11""- tall woman, that she needn't feel sorry for him, since he destroyed it himself.You might think that a woman of that height would dominate every scene she's in, but animation isn't limited in scale, and the folx at Dreamworks weren't just thinking big, they were thinking HUGE! Susan isn't even the largest of Earth's monsters; that would be the 350'-tall childlike Insectosaurus.You might also think it would be a challenge to make the monsters (especially Dr. Cockroach and the slimy Missing Link) engaging and endearing, but Pixar showed the way back in 2001 with Monsters Inc., and this production is up to those standards in terms of both personality and technology. And the dimwitted but good-natured BOB the Blob is just a hoot.The whole thing is played for chuckles, and they come at a nice, easy pace, not forced or frenetic. There are some good visual gags, too, including the president's big red coffee- dispensing button on the wall of the war room and BOB's romance with the lime Jell-O.I saw it in 3-D (tho not in Imax 3-D) and thot it enhanced the experience.I have lots more to say about 3-D (and I also lament the demise of voice acting as a career), but there's a limit on these IMDb entries, so I refer you to my blog for the rest of my thots on these subjects:http://richardsrussell.livejournal.com/2009/03/28/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Aliens Vs Monsters, and i went in for the whole 3D experience. well aside that it was 44.00 dollars to see the dam thing I enjoyed the 3D view it was nice and crisp truly it was, second the animation was a step up from other films ""Shrek 1,2,3, and from what I know Shrek 4 and 5 are on the way. well back to the film. the movie over all was fair. but it was dry the humor seemed a bit over done, its like they tried to hard, that whole key board thing was not at all funny. in fact it was dumb. another thing Dreamworks must not have a great imagenation because the monsters (except BOB) were like what ever!!! a giant hamster thats retarded a man fish and a french roach. and the film barley shows anything cool about them. and this giant woman wtf!!!! come on dreamworks do something better. finally the story was OK! could of used a better.......something!!! well PIXAR'S UP IS OUT SOON AND ONCE AGAIN THEY WILL SWEEP THE FLOOR WITH DREAMWORKS WAY TO GO PIXAR!!! 9 IN A ROW",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Apparently y'all don't appreciate the underrated stuff THAT much...,"I think this movie has been judged unfairly. This movie is one of the most incredible movies that DreamWorks has made in 2009! This is one of my favorites tied with Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. And I loved all of the characters, and I had a crush on Susan when I was a kid when it first came out. I loved every second of this sweet blockbuster! If I loved it as a kid, your kids are gonna love it! Just ignore the low rates and just watch it please.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Could've been better,"Well, let's see what we have here. Another one of them 3-d movies that are becoming very common nowadays. It's pretty predictable, and on the most part is family friendly and quite light hearted. That being said, the humorous parts of the movie reign supreme. Some of it is just random humour typically found in these type of movies. Some of it contains references to sci-fi films and such.The lead character, Susan, is not really interesting. However, the side characters, particularly B.O.B and the president, are hilarious. Unfortunately most of the screen time is obviously given to Susan which is a downside. Even though the overall plot is pretty predictable and maybe even a bit generic, things are generally kept interesting. The animation and effects are good, but not great by 2009's standards.The problem with this is that I found the high points of the movie it's funny parts, but they weren't enough to make this a great movie. Susan's love/drama life was given too much attention. Plus, the plot felt a bit rushed.If you're an animation fan like me, go ahead and watch it. It definitely has it's moments. However, it could've achieved an unforgettable status with just a bit more work. I think it deserves a 6.5 but since IMDb doesn't have that option, I'll give it a generous 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Galactic Showdown,"Monsters vs. Aliens is an animated film featuring a group of quirky monsters tasked with saving Earth from an alien invasion. The film features a talented voice cast including Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Hugh Laurie, and Will Arnett. The animation is visually stunning, with colossal battles between the monsters and alien forces. The film balances high-octane action with genuine emotion and camaraderie, appealing to both children and adults.

Monsters Vs Aliens,"First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The actors for this movie were perfectly chosen. I loved how they got a lot of comedians to do this film. I think that was the best part. For example, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogan, and Steve Colbert(perfect president). It was hilarious throughout the entire film, expect for the sad parts, obviously. Bob was probably my favorite. Seth Rogan was perfect for that part. However, what I didn't like about this film is the fact that it was originally in 3D. In my opinion, Pixar, Dreamworks, IMAX 3D, and other animation companies should seriously STOP MAKING 3D MOVIES. I think it's getting pretty ridiculous. Everything animation that's coming out these days are in 3D. It's seriously not necessary. But other then that this movie was awesome and hilarious. I loved it. 10 all the way!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Oooze gonna save us?,"When a radioactive meteor hurtles into Susan Murphy on her wedding day, she is transformed into a towering, platinum-haired giant. Taken away by the government, Susan is introduced to other scientific oddities, including the amphibious Missing Link , the dim blob B.O.B., and the brilliant, bug-headed Dr. Cockroach. These ""monsters"" are released from captivity when a massive alien robot sent by the scheming Gallaxhar appears in San Francisco. With little time to adjust to her new stature, Susan must learn to work with her strange allies to avoid an all-out extraterrestrial invasion.MVA is what I would call a ""safe"" movie. It's fluffy and nice, but it doesn't push boundaries. It sticks to entertaining the audience for 90 or so minutes and it does the job well. Compared to Pixar's most recent movie, UP, it's pretty much crap, but I won't do that because most animated movies can't reach Pixar's greatness.MVA starts off pretty quickly and the movie runs in a fast pace. I'll admit it, some of the jokes are plain dumb and unfunny. There's one scene where the president of the US plays a well-known tune when first meeting an alien spaceship. It was cringe-worthy to say the least. However, the movie also has a lot of funny moments, most coming from Seth Rogen's character, B.O.B. He's my favorite character in the movie. The other actors were decent, but nothing to shout about.The movie also has plenty of great spectacles and some truly vibrant action sequences. I did not see this movie in 3D, but this is one of the few rare movies where watching it in 3D could possibly make it a BETTER movie. As I watched through the movie, I envied the fact that I was watching it in 2D, seeing some obvious shots for the 3D technology when it was in theaters a few months back. But overall, it's a fast-paced, forgettable, harmless movie for the family to enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
quality vs quantity,"and there I was, watching Monsters vs Aliens. it must be easy to make an animated movie. how stupid can someone be? I can see the company sitting on their desks already, thinking what else they could make a movie of. then suddenly, some of the 'artists' jumps up and says 'I have a great idea! let's make a movie about monsters and aliens and let them fight each other!' probably it has been like that. in a time like this, where animated features are being made like dozens in a year, it's a competition to make the best picture. oh wait... did I say 'best' picture? guess again. it's not about quality anymore, it's about quantity. if the movie could make money the most, it's considered a 'good' movie. and you know what? this junk movie actually does make movie a lot! it's easy, it's like a formula: make something kids could enjoy and you will have millions, or perhaps even... billions??? (anoying Dr Evil laugh) I was very happy to go see this, but when I did, I was praying for some beep that would come up, so I would have a reason to go to the lavatory. I hoped I could puke a bit, my own beep would be more interesting to look at than this movie (which is not flawless).so why did I stay? good question. well, I was there with somebody who actually did like the movie, so I couldn't just get away.if you want quality, don't see this monstrous piece of 'art'. it's too bad I can't give this movie less than 1, so I'll have to give it 1 point, which it does not deserve at all.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not spectacular but still fun,"First of all, let me start off by saying that I had never sat through an entire movie in 3D before, and it was kind of fun. Of course, I was swatting at things for the first ten minutes, but after I got used to it, it was an enjoyable experience. DreamWorks made a dynamite decision by choosing to release their latest installment in 3D, because although there were some decent laughs, the movie mostly relied on visual effects to keep the viewer interested.Monsters begins with the protagonist, Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon), on the day of her wedding to her pompous, weatherman fiancé Derek (Paul Rudd). Right before the ceremony, a freak accident involving a massive falling object (evidently carrying a substance called ""quantonium"") pummels Susan into the ground. The quantonium has a bizarre effect on Susan, making her grow 50 feet tall and inexplicably turning her hair white. Understandably frightened to death by the giant woman, the government tranquilizes her and she awakens to find herself in a secure bunker. There, she meets an array of other creatures, appropriately called monsters, and befriends them. First, there's B.O.B, a blue, goop-like substance (Seth Rogen), whose handicap of not having a brain actually makes him more adorable than anything else. Then there's Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), a brainy yet mad scientist whose own crazy experiments led to his transformation into bug form. Will Arnett voices a half-fish/half-lizard hybrid named Link that has a curious obsession with weight lifting. Then, topping it all off, there's Insectasaurus, a massive caterpillar-like creature who, sadly, cannot talk.When an alien probe lands on Earth, the President (the incomparable Stephen Colbert) and his advisors decide to release the monsters in order to take on whatever has just invaded American soil. The creature aboard the probe, a slimy, tentacled Martian named Gallaxar (voiced by Rainn Wilson, who's so clearly having a blast), has come to Earth to obtain the quantonium in order to create a clone army of himself to take over the universe. In exchange for defeating the outer-space invader, the monsters will get their freedom.Although it had its fair share of laughs, one of the problems I had with Monsters was that the humor was very topical, but about a year too late. Colbert's President was humorous and well intended, but his general incompetence thwarted him at every turn. Mostly, his advisors just used any opportunity to manipulate him. Does that sound like anyone you know? Maybe a certain president that just left office? What I'm saying is, topical humor is fine, but when it's not relevant anymore, it just becomes stale. Another issue I had was that (and I've noticed this in a couple other DreamWorks movies) the reliance on big name stars to do voice work makes the filmmakers a bit more lax on character development. Admittedly, a primary reason I even wanted to see this movie was that I'm a fan of Seth Rogen and Stephen Colbert, so I wanted to hear them. Most of the voices used in this movie are recognizable because of how popular the actor is, not because there's anything particularly distinctive about them. I remember hearing a joke at the Oscars this year in which Jack Black quipped that he'll do a DreamWorks film (he recently voiced the title character in Kung Fu Panda) only to see the prize go to Pixar come awards season. Well, Mr. Black, DreamWorks movies are usually just as impeccably animated as Pixar but all the big name actors in the world won't captivate audiences if there's no creativity. In the last few years, DreamWorks has come out with, among others, Shrek (1, 2, and 3), Horton Hears a Who!, Bolt, and Kung Fu Panda. The first Shrek is a bad example because that wound up being one of the most original and funny animated movies I've ever seen, but when you compare the latter three with Pixar's most recent installments of Cars, Ratatouille, and WALL-E, there aren't nearly as many big names in the credits, but they also have three things DreamWorks doesn't have—Academy Awards. I think the creative team at DreamWorks needs to kick it up a notch if they're going to have a shot at their first Best Animated Feature Film award since Shrek. That means no more sequels (I'm looking at you Madagascar 2 and Shrek the Third). Also, try and hire some less popular but more talented voice actors. Rogen and Colbert can stay, though, because they make me laugh. To wrap up, Monsters vs. Aliens was captivating in 3D, but lacked finesse in the storytelling. The monsters (Dr. Cockroach, B.O.B, and Link) provided for most of the humor, but it wasn't quite enough to make it stick out in my mind as a truly hilarious movie. As I was leaving the theater with a friend of mine, she pretty much summed it up for me. ""That was cute,"" she said. ""I'm glad I saw that."" Need I say more?My grade: B-",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A fun movie full of funny in jokes to the sci fi genre and great cameos,"After seeing the trailer for this movie about 3 months ago I was n't really impressed and did n't really think this was the type of film I would want to see. But after seeing some of the big name stars they had in this film I decided to give it a try and I must say I am happy with it. It is another generally funny family film by Pixar.The next paragraph is just plot, if you know it you can skip to the third paragraph.The films plot starts at the wedding of Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon), who is getting wed to a cocky news reporter (Paul Rudd) who has a long plan to become head anchor of a big city, instead of the small local community he conducts from currently, but when Susan is hit by a meteorite she grows 50-100 feet tall (I think its that tall) and is placed in a government quarantine by General WR. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland from ""24"") with B.O.B (Seth Rogan) a big blue blob without a brain, The Missing Link (Will Arnett) who is a lizard thing captured after terrorizing teenagers on a beach, Dr. Cockroach Ph.D who was a scientist studying how humans could become more like cockroaches but then becomes one and Insectasourous a huge and dumb animal but still lovable .

Taken For Granted,"Now here is something that is close to my heart. An animation film based on 1950's sci-fi fodder - it's just got to work. Or has it?Thankfully, yes it does. As film lovers in the digital age, we have become so spoilt for choice over the last ten years, what with Toy Story, Finding Nemo and Wall-E to name but a few - that we are quick to knock films of this genre with even the slightest flaw - forgetting the time, patience and effort that goes into producing one of these modern day miracles.Monsters Vs. Aliens isn't a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but is ludicrously good fun if you're a fan of science fiction. There are too numerous references to list here, but needless to say if you've ever watched a black and white sci-fi flick, you'll recognise plenty here.Technically, the film holds it's own, and at the same time manages to resist the temptation to overwhelm the viewer with flash/bang trickery. The monsters all have their own endearing qualities that children and adults alike will love - while the aliens thankfully fall into the category of 'so smart they're stupid' that made the likes of 'Mars Attacks!' so much fun. The vocal acting is competent and manages to keep disbelief at bay for the best part.As mentioned before, MVA isn't great great - but it's not bad bad either, and there are plenty of animations that fall into that category that really do get a bad time in the press, simply for not being a Pixar movie. All aside, kids will love this - and if you're a big kid like me, you'll love it too. Good stuff!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
My Thoughts,"I'd like to start by addressing any kids reading this review; get the Fuckk off ""The Boards"" you little assholes. In the past i have posted many reviews that would not be suitable or understood by the young ones and the last thing i need is to talk another 10 year old through masturbation on skype. One of the main reasons i did not like this movie is because of Regal Cinemas. For starters, i'm 100% sure there was multiple puddles of dried semen on my Real D glasses. When i asked ""Monica"" who was an employee at the time for another pair, she told me to stop busting her balls. Since i was at Regal of course to my right and left there were families from Somalia who heckled the vast majority of the movie in some third world language. The actual movie was the worst part of the entire experience. I sat through 94 minutes of sheer garbage and was bothered by an on again off again boner that returned in every major fight scene. Overall, the movie had an ongoing message that taught kids it's OK to be different, which is just not true. In actuality if you are different at all you deserve every bit of the cruel and creative sexual harassment techniques of today's youth. I would bet my left foot that there is a sequel on the way that will go straight to DVD and that it will be bought only by the Carvalho family. In closing, I'd like to say on my way out of the Theater a concession stand employee tried to sodomize me behind the arcade. Oh and since i have some extra characters i'd like to make an unrelated prediction. In the next 4-7 years Maya Kirkpatrick will gain 160 pounds.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

I certainly didn't enjoy it and I am very disappointed. I was hoping for something along the line of Monster Inc where the storyline is on some level cute and funny, even though it is about monsters.

While cool, I don't think it's make or break.What I liked about the movie. I saw it in Blu-ray. So the animation quality was impressive. It's not like it was a few years back when every CGI movie was improving noticeably. But every movie gets a bit better.There is tons of impressive detail in the animation. The Golden Gate bridge scene was very cool with interesting perspectives.The plot was pretty standard. I had envisioned it being just a bit different. But it worked. The evil alien reminded me a bit of Marvin the Martian. It would not surprise me if he had been a little bit of an inspiration.I would have liked to see a bit more teamwork from the Monsters. There was some, but I would have liked more.The role of the gigantic woman was OK. None of the monsters really stood out to me. But as a whole they worked OK. I have to admit my favorite was probably insectasaurus and he did not talk. Can't say why I liked him. He was just cool to me.The president was a trip. I especially loved the scene where he played the Yamaha DX-7. I have always loved that synthesizer. Nice touch - I hear Yamaha helped to make it look authentic, and it did (except for the display which was pretty modern looking compared to what I remember from the DX-7.) Anyway, the president had some pretty funny moments.Overall, I enjoyed the movie. Could it have been better? Maybe. But I think they implemented the basic premise pretty well. Monsters take on an alien invasion. The key was that I enjoyed it more than most movies I have seen lately.

Pretty awful,"My wife and I watched the movie on HBO at home tonight (not in 3D), and we were really disappointed. We both tend to enjoy animated films, but ""Aliens Vs. Monsters"" did nothing but let us down. The commercials played it up, and we actually wanted to see it, however the commercial was just about all the good there was.First off, it was terribly written. The characters were entirely one-dimensional. There was hardly any growth by anyone except the main girl, and that growth couldn't have been more annoying. The plot was cliché and terribly predictable.Now, I realize that it's a fantasy/sci-fi type movie, and there are going to be unrealistic elements, but you have to give the audience something to work with. I can suspend my disbelief for a goo monster that can talk, but I can't suspend my disbelief for atypical human behavior. The characters were not real at all, and not just in the sense that some of them were monsters. They didn't have real emotions, and everything felt like it was forced in there awkwardly just to advance the plot. Parts of it felt like they were literally just spliced together at the end.Overall, it was one of the worst movies I've ever sat through, and I don't recommend it to anyone. It does not deserve the rating it has, and honestly I'm shocked that it ever reached a 6.I give it a 3/10 because there were a couple amusing comments from B.O.B., and it still wasn't the absolute worst thing ever made.Edit (Dec 29, 2011): I originally posted this comment in March 2010, and my feelings toward the movie have remained the same.

Two thumbs way down,"The idea was fun. The story was even fun. What made this dreadful was the timing. Now this isn't the editor, this is the director and script. You would have moments that were just not even remotely amusing and time would be wasted and wasted and you'd still be there waiting for a punch line that never came. And of course when the moment was witty you never held it for the laugh.So poor timing and a tedious script could not be made up for in vocal talent. I am a huge Hugh Laurie fan and he couldn't save the dreadful lines. And Stephen Colbert should have been given his writing team to make the president amusing. He couldn't deliver the lines given to him. Not his fault, he isn't an actor in the traditional sense. He is more of a presence/personality - and his show is hilarious.My kids left the theater and never brought up the film again. They said they like it but unlike other films, they didn't ask for merchandise, to see it again ... and they aren't picky. They even liked the Dragonball movie today.Don't waste your time paying for it. Rent it. Better yet, wait for free redbox Mondays and pick it up then.

A 2-D Review,"So, I saw Monsters Vs. Aliens not too long ago, and I can sat that I would've loved this movie more if I saw it in 3-D. It's not as if 3-D makes the movie, it just makes it better. However, since I saw it without 3-D, I was able to realize any cheesy and obvious pop-out effects, and there were only two effects like that. Seeing it in 2-D was fine though. This movie involves aliens invading Earth, and the government calls on a group of monsters to take care of them...I guess. Well, the plot doesn't really matter. I throughly enjoyed this movie, but little things annoyed me. First of all, there were a bit too many obvious references being jammed down your throat. Also, some jokes are bland and just...fail. However, some jokes are really cleaver and funny, and I think that kids will enjoy the...pretty colors and the adults will appreciate the humor. However, If you ARE an adult without children wanting to see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's on DVD, unless it's in 3-D in your theater.One final thought, this movie is comparable to Kung-Fu Panda, but in my opinion, Kung-Fu Panda is much better.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It desn't do much in the way of satire, but is still a fluffy and fun affair.","'Monsters vs. Aliens (2009)' doesn't actually do all that much in the way of satire, especially considering it barely touches the wealth of parody-esque possibilities its central conceit should theoretically provide. It does use its archetypal 'monster' characters rather well, though, and clearly has a love for the genre it attempts to ape, no matter how successfully it does so on the whole. This leads to a light, fluffy but fun affair that heads in a predictable direction but gets there mostly intact. The animation is the rubbery, slightly off-putting but equally inventive post-'Madagascar (2005)' stuff that came about when DreamWorks settled into its groove and pumped out more filler than it knew what to do with, though the actual movie it brings to life is on the middling to better end of that second-rate pile. I'm the end, however, there's also a sense that the piece doesn't know quite what it should be or what it can get away with. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Overall, this wasn't a bad film at all","One of the great joys of watching ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is that it is a delightful throwback and a parody of virtually every sci-fi ""B""-movie made within the last 60 years. From ""The War of the Worlds"" (1953) to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977), to ""Independence Day"" (1996), to ""War of the Worlds"" (2005), to Godzilla, to both the original and remake versions of ""The Fly,"" ""The Blob"" and ""Attack of the 50 foot Woman,"" you can bet that if it's sci-fi and cheesy (cheesy sci-fi), it gets lampooned by the film-making team of Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon, working with DreamWorks Animation.Nothing about the animation in this movie really stands out when compared to what we're seeing from Pixar or Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli (his animation is truly the best, in my opinion), but ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is pure fun from the start, beginning with a meteorite that crash-lands on Earth, or, more specifically, crash-lands on bride-to-be Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon). Witherspoon's Susan Murphy is really the most important character in the movie because she's the only one with significant motivation and feeling. Her cohorts do their normal supporting-role thing and manage to stand out on their own, but don't have the emotional depth that Susan Murphy does.As she's walking down the aisle to her husband-to-be Derek (Paul Rudd), Susan starts to grow - and I mean really grow - into a 49-foot-tall giantess (while still somehow managing to remain fully clothed in her wedding dress), who the government later names ""Ginormica."" She is soon taken prisoner, watched over by General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland, ""W.R. Monger"" - ""War Monger,"" get it?) and introduced to characters who seem to have popped right out of '50s sci-fi movies - the Gill-man The Missing Link (Will Arnett), the blob B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), mad-scientist Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), and the gigantic Insectosaurus. The octo-pod alien Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) has plans for world domination, but the government soon sees it has no choice but to unleash these Monsters on an unsuspecting human populace to fight some nasty Aliens.""Monsters vs. Aliens"" will at the very least keep you entertained. Should it be seen by adults? Sure, why not. If they've seen enough sci-fi movies over the years, then they might get a kick out of all the movies that get skewered during the proceedings. Obviously, kids will love it, especially B.O.B., who I found to probably be the best Monster character, largely because of Seth Rogen's portrayal of the lovable, stretchable, if not completely brainless and virtually indestructible one-eyed mass of gelatin. (I even got a free B.O.B. plush-toy out of the deal at Best Buy.)""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a great way to kill 94 minutes of your life. I bought the movie on DVD (with the aforementioned free B.O.B. plush-toy) and I can say that it was well worth every penny.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Most Underrated DreamWorks Animation,"It's very disappointing that such a great animation, which not only has a beautiful story but also made my childhood wonderful, is rated so low. It seems that How to Train Your Dragon 1 has stolen the recognition this animation deserves, and the ratings of these two should be reversed. Monsters vs. Aliens deserves an IMDb rating of 8.0, while How to Train Your Dragon, which is a misandrist animation, should have a 6.4 rating. It's truly unfortunate. Unfortunately, in this world, justice doesn't always prevail, and people either don't see the truth or perhaps just have terrible taste. This animation is one of the best in history, and my rating for it is 9.2.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Animated pop-culture spoof is fun but not hilarious,"This quirky movie is loaded with (Easter Egg) references to older science fiction shows. Combine this with sympathetic characters, good animation, and a nice adventure/comedy balance, and you get a film that's entirely watchable by adults. The flavor is a bit ""Duck Dodgers in the 24th-and-a-half Century"" -- it's a bit silly, but not TOO silly.I rate this at 6.5 stars, plus a half-star bonus for rewatchability. That's seven (7) stars total.PS It's possible the puzzle-movie Under the Silver Lake (2018) referenced this film. Here are some ""coincidences"":In Monster vs Aliens, BOB goes on a rant about giant pickle jars. In UTSL, there are (fake) song lyrics that include ""Pennies Dropped in Pickle Jars"" and ""Forever Linked"", which may reference The Missing Link.In Monster vs Aliens, there's a close-up of a boom-box made by ""Moschetti"". This is the name of a (real) coffee company with several corporate logos, all of which involve a red beret. In UTSL, Sydney Sweeney (as ""Shooting Star #2"") initially wears a red beret.Both movies have AXEL F in the soundtrack. Other matches involve items from the opening scene of MvA, including chess, a clipboard, and a hamburger. I could go on and on, but I won't.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Nothing else here folks.In general, I feet a bit sorry for the actors for being hired to voice this useless piece of fluff. Just proves that big-name stars can not create something from nothing.

Crisp 2-D Animation,"7 June 2009. Whether or not 3-D would have significantly altered the ultimate visual enjoyment is difficult to speculate. The 2-D version was crisp and attractively compelling - an animated spectacular that lent a specialness of its own that even live action likely could not have provided any better visual interest. Unfortunately, this movie while having the intelligent humor, the action, and even the emotional drama somehow didn't jell (pun not intended). The chemistry just didn't seem to be there. Not all the various monsters seemed to impart their potential and some even seemed to been weak, if that could be possible. There were a number of animated action sequences that there superb especially with Reese Witherspoon's character. Overall, this movie was entertaining, but its plot seemed not be have been developed for that brilliant presentation that it was capable of. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"When aliens attack, monsters fight back!","What a great slogan to a rather unexpected project from Dreamworks animation studio. I have to admit that I was thrilled by the overall concept and while it's not the first time monsters battled aliens for control of the planet, this was a nice twist and a great tribute to classic 50s creature features.Plot: Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) was about to be married to the dashing reporter Derek when she was stuck by a meteorite full of an unknown but powerful energy, causing her to grow to nearly fifty feet in height. Somehow deemed a monster by the government and renamed as Ginormica, the poor girl gets locked away in a secret facility with other monstrous misfits; macho fish-ape Missing Link (Will Arnett), mad scientist Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), indestructible and gelatinous B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), and the 350 foot grub Insectosaurus. When the evil alien Gallaxhar (Riann Wilson) attacks the earth with giant robots and an army of clones, General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) convinces the president (Stephen Colbert) to let the monsters loose to defend the earth from this outer space menace in return for their freedom.The cast was a lot of fun as they all fit very well with their roles like Hugh Laurie as the intelligent Dr. Cockroach (reminiscent of House) and Seth Rogen as the fun-loving but dim-witted B.O.B. Reese's character Susan a.k.a. Ginormica was a great heroine (as well as easy on the eyes) and was developed surprisingly well and and Will Arnett's Missing Link was also pretty cool, plus Insectosaurus is one of the coolest and cutest monsters I've ever seen. General Monger was awesome as he's afraid of no one and takes no nonsense. Finally, Gallaxhar was a good villain and actually has typical alien characteristics (big head, tentacles, etc). Riann Wilson did a good job bringing out his delightfully despicable nature.The graphics look great right down to the finest detail, then again Dreamworks always brings out some good animation. The comedy made me laugh a good number of times as the jokes range from a little slapstick to references to classic sci-fi films. Heck, the monsters and aliens themselves are funny little parodies to those films like The Fly, The Blob, Mothra, The Day the Earth Stood Still, the list goes on. The action scenes, while not as grand as Kung Fu panda or Disney's The Incredibles, are pretty good, utilizing the abilities of each monster pretty well and bringing a sense of adventure to the movie.There are a couple of bones to pick here. One is that it seemed that the film put more emphasis on comedy then action, which kinda disappointed me, after all this is called Monsters vs Aliens so you would think that there'd be tons of action like The Incredibles. On another note, I felt that some characters where heavily underused and not able to reach their full potential, particularly Insectosaurus and General Monger.The complaints I have here are noticeable, but they don't stop me from enjoying this movie and they shouldn't bother you either. Overall, this was a fun tribute to classic science fiction and very entertaining. Definitely worth a watch, so check it out!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Kind of fun, but the gags rarely work","Pretty much par for the course for Dreamworks' animated features. It ain't bad, necessarily, but it's little more than a diversion. I'd rank this one relatively low among their films, though. Actually, when it's doing action and sci-fi stuff, it's pretty fun. I especially loved the whole sequence where the giant alien robot chased the giant girl (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) through San Fransisco. The big problem with this movie is that it is almost never funny. It tries really hard - Seth Rogen in particular tries really hard as a semi-sentient blob of goo - but all the jokes land with a thud. I should say I kind of liked Stephen Colbert, as well, as the president. The animation is quite good, though nowhere near as good as anything Pixar has produced. The movie originally played in 3D in most theaters, and it opens with the most clichéd 3D image imaginable: a ball and paddle game. I think it might have been a joke, but it's a good example of how flat all the jokes fall here.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Shoulda, coulda, woulda been better - but settled for mediocrity","Monsters Vs Aliens is the latest Dreamworks Animation effort, they have been on the improve over the years but are still light years behind Pixar in terms of quality and consistency. No shame there I guess, (so is every other production company), but DA sometimes are guilty of the ""name actor"" and pop culture references being more important than stories.Monsters Vs Aliens – The Plot in 23 seconds – A meteor hits Earth, (specifically hits a chick named Susan minutes prior to her wedding), Susan is imbued with ""Quantinium"" (doesn't matter what it is) and immediately grows 45 ft taller with super powers. Galaxar (an alien) wants the Quantinium and decides to attack Earth using an army of his clones to get it back. Earth decides to combat the Aliens with da-da-da-da-da-daaaaa Monsters! that they have accumulated over the past 50 years.Included in the Monster's squad are Susan, now known as Ginormica and basically a white haired replica of Elastigirl/Mrs Incredible, a gelatinous blob named BOB, a fishy looking thing (apparently the missing link) called Link, a maniacal genius called Dr. Cockroach due to an experiment gone wrong and finally a giant bug called, you guessed it ""Insecto"".There are really only two fights between Monster and Alien, a few jokes and a couple of pop culture references, though refreshingly less than normal, but not much more than that.You'd think rather than being P.O.'d Susan would be happy to have an excuse to buy an entire new wardrobe! Sure she's 50 odd ft tall but men always notice tall women and there aren't many 4 ft 11 inch models running around?The 9 minutes of credits should mean Dreamworks tried to make this a classic, and I wanted to like it, I really did. The fact is that I laughed three times in the entire 80 minutes (sans credits), all because of, or at the expense of BOB (without details, BOB is stupid and has no memory). 1/ How the others cheat at cards and Bob is none the wiser. 2/ Bob tries to crack onto a jelly plate. 3/ How he acts when he is unaware he is about to die.Before you cry SPOILER!, it is a G rated movie, you know no-one dies.Where they it all went wrong:Not a big deal, but Susan is constantly disproportionate, without harping in one scene she knocks a power pole over with her shin, later on the power poles are head-high. Also Bob is at times around 2 ft tall, then later seems 6 ft in size in relation to Susan. The characters also seem to have no weight when they fall, land or even walk around.The character designs seem half-arsed, (more on this later) and the designs seem more like prototypes than fully-fleshed creations.Dreamworks did limit the pop culture references in this one, I hate PCR as they both date the film, and short sell the value of jokes by using the work of others to almost create ""enjoyment by acknowledgment"". (For the record: Dance-Dance Revolution, Axel-F, Roller-blading).After the credits rolled my first thoughts were that I didn't really like any character, including BOB, who was the token likable character, I also thought that from a marketing perspective MVA would make crap toys if I wanted to buy a present for my son.Boring characters + crap toys = Sequel suicide. Even ""Cars"", which wasn't that flash, is getting a sequel, because car-toys sell!I think somewhere in this review I am expected to say that the animation is ""amazing"" and ""groundbreaking"", but it really isn't if you've seen anything since ""Toy Story 2″ or ""Monster's Inc"". The fact that it is in 3D is irrelevant and is more a marketing ploy in my view.Final Ranking – 6.5 / 10.

Computer animation needs to be left to Pixar in my opinion,"Ever since Pixar started, Dreamworks has been spewing animated films at us to keep our attention. While some, such as Shrek and Madagascar, are able to satisfy us...others like Shark Tale and this movie just prove how hard Dreamworks tries to match Disney/Pix in animation. Illogical, boring, and lacking that emotional spot that other animated movies have, this movie will have laughs for the kids and sighs for adults. As for the studio, quit while you're behind. And parents, brace yourself for the most overrated film of the year. Just be prepared, like I was, to want your ninety minutes back.2/5 stars and a thumbs down",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Monsters Vs Aliens A Very Funny Animated Movie,"Monsters Vs Aliens is a very funny animated movie from Dreamworks. Now I'm not a big fan of these kiddie movies but I have to admit that I found this one to be very humorous with a good story and well developed characters for the most part. I actually enjoyed it a lot more than most recently Transformers Revenge of the Fallen or 2007's Spider-man 3 to name a few which ended up being big disappointments compared to this one and other films out there. Directors Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon are admirable in making this movie that plays homage to the 50's monster films. The talented voice cast including Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, and Kiefer Sutherland brought so much to their roles. They all do a really great job and were just perfectly chosen for their characters. The voices some of them came up with for the characters matched very well and the movie was fast paced making the 94 minute running time fly by fast. The rest of the voice cast including Stephen Colbert, Jeffrey Tambor, Paul Rudd, Amy Poehler, Julie White, and Rainn Wilson are very good as well despite most of their animated characters only having a few extended appearances throughout the movie. Renee Zellwegger and John Kranski even lend their voices for brief cameos in the film. There was a good balance between the humor, action, and character development which some films these days have greatly lacked. The special effects and the action sequences are impressive. They weren't anything spectacular or mind blowing but they were well executed none the less. Even the animated characters seemed to have genuine chemistry together which made their friendships believable on the screen. The commitment by the actors and everyone involved in making this movie made that happen. The music they chose matched perfectly with what was happening on the screen and it added a lot to the movie. The only few tiny flaws were that things moved a bit fast in the beginning and some characters lacked development but the good definitely more than outweighs the bad in this one. This movie seems to be telling us a lot of messages about being true to yourself and that it's not whats on the outside but the inside is what counts. Just like you should never judge a book by it's cover. Overall Monsters Vs Aliens was a lot better than I thought it would be and it was just as good as either Wall E, Shrek, or Kung Fu Panda to name a couple. Monsters Vs Aliens has plenty of humor, action, character development, and a talented cast who help bring these animated characters to life making you care about them. If you're a fan of these type of movies than chances are you'll enjoy Monsters Vs Aliens just as much. Go see it much better than expected.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hollow,"Monsters vs Aliens is the exact opposite of Kung Fu Panda. It has no vision, it has no interesting characters, it doesn't look good, and the heroine is quite irritating. It's the kind of movie I wonder how it even got past the script stage. It all feels a bit... random, and not fleshed out at all.Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is struck by a meteor on her wedding day to a cocky anchorman. Transformed into Ginormica, she is sealed off in Area 51 by the government, alongside four 'monsters' - a mad scientist turned cockroach, the missing link, a weird gigantic larva, not to mention the ""Blob"" himself - only his name is Bob. Their help is needed, however, when an alien emperor plans to invade earth.The premise sounds promising but the execution is all off. Of all the 'monsters' they could think of, they go for those four? They have none of the depth or visual appeal of the characters in Kung Fu Panda. None of the characters appear to have gone through a character design stage at all; they all look quite crude and unimaginative. If this movie had a vision, I'm not seeing it. The plot is very thin and is almost solely held together by gags - which are admittedly quite hysterical at times. But jokes alone don't make a movie. Ever heard of the phrase 'too many cooks spoil the broth'? Well, look no further. What's the point of having many writers if all you're gonna end up with is a mismatched, albeit amusing, hollow shell of a movie? While I enjoyed Monsters vs Aliens a bit more than I thought I would (or should have), it left zero with me. As I watched this movie unfold in the cinema, I couldn't feel any sort of heart to it. It seems Dreamworks learned nothing from their previous film, Kung Fu Panda. What I love about that film is that it's deep and full of substance, and just plain beautiful. I just don't understand how Dreamworks could throw all that out the window. But even the dumbest script in the world can sometimes be saved by just being 'cool' - and this movie doesn't even have enough substance for that. Nothing about this movie attracts me to it. Dreamworks have completely degraded their standard with Monsters vs Aliens, and I hope it's only a temporary setback. I'd rather studios focusing on making movies with more substance than movies that come out of the screen.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Worse than expected,"*SPOILERS*I'm so, so sorry, but I think my expectations went a bit too high for this film. Reese Witherspoon, that unfunny actress that acted in Legally Blonde and Legally Blonde 2 comes and acts in Monsters VS Aliens, a movie that sounds like it will be tons of fun and will have heaps of laughs and (family) action scenes. Boy, was I wrong. Only a couple of scenes of action were in this movie. But that was not the bad part. The reason that this film is so utterly bad is because the ""jokes"" aren't even jokes! I think I just found out how to give people cancer, and that's to watch this movie! The film makers did an awful job with the jokes and quotes, and the storyline was terrible, plus it didn't even have enough action to entertain us through this horrible animated family comedy. Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of family comedies. I also like a lot of family actions. Although this had more action then most family animated films, it had less laughs than most family animated films! Let me start off with how the movie starts.The movie starts off with a woman (Reese Witherspoon) in a relationship with a man, and she gets struck with a meteorite that turns her into a giant. Reese Witherspoon is then stuck into a top secret government facility with MONSTERS...that have terrible quote lines. Hip hip, hooray. So, meanwhile, in deep space, Gallaxhar the purple alien sends ...let's say something to find an energy source on earth. But of course, it has to land in America, doesn't it? It wouldn't be an action film then! So, the fictional president makes contact with the something, and the something goes and has a party at San Francisco. Yes, I know. Terrifying.The top secret facility lets out the monsters that tell horrible jokes out of the prison of unfunny monsters so they can destroy the something. So, they kill the something. Then an alien comes and so on...I won't tell the rest of the story, just in case you do watch it. However, I recommend you don't watch this movie unless you are going to watch it with your kids. Your kids will love it, however, you probably won't.4.4/10!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why does this movie have so many good reviews?,"Character Design - When I saw this movie in theaters as a young child I thought that this was supposed to be a horror movie. Rewatching this more recently, I can see why. The look of these characters is absolutely hideous.Tone - This movie isn't funny. When I rewatched it, I couldn't get any laughs except out of how stupid it is. None of the jokes are even remotely funny. This movie is extremely cringeworthy. A child watching this thing is either going to get scared or bored.Plot - I actually like this concept. Too bad its executed so badly.The voice acting, and the animation are bad. Steven Colbert seemed to be putting in an effort, but even he couldn't work with the terrible script.Product Placement - The first 3 minutes are basically a concentrated dose of product placement. Instead of just spreading it out throughout the movie in the backgrounds, they just lazily threw it all into the first few minutes. I'm not against product placement, movies need to be funded, but the way its presented in this movie is annoying and obvious. This scene doesn't even really have much to do with the rest of the movie. Its just a short scene with characters we never see again lazily introducing the plot. This whole scene could've been cut and it would've barely affected the movie.There isn't that much to say about this movie.

"great animation, fun story, lots of laughs, 3D added a little","The best part was the story was funny and entertaining. I laughed quite a lot, some out of the script, and some out of the absurdity of the characters. What blew me away was the increased animation quality. I saw it in the fire, water, hair and clothing. It just keeps getting better each new production.One of the reasons I wanted to see this movie was it is the first of a blast of 3D movies coming out this year. Hollywood seems to think this is the next best thing to draw audiences and I wanted to see for myself.Certainly the technology has improved and the quality of the 3D was the best I've seen. There were a few moments where the 3D effects were pushed to the limit for effect, and many others where it simply fit well into the movie. Overall though I thought it added little to the movie, perhaps a 5% improvement. On the other hand we had to wear the glasses through the whole movie. In the end, even with my interest in the technology, I didn't think it added enough to the movie to be worth the effort and, I would guess, added expense. Let me say it this way, 3D won't be enough to attract me to a movie soon, and I certainly wouldn't pay extra to see it.

Monster Mash movie hit!,"(In the style of Boris Pickett's 60's hit song ""Monster Mash"")I was hanging in the theater late one night When my eyes beheld an eerie sight For that female's height began to rise And suddenly to my surpriseI did the mash I did the ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" mash The ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" mash It was a box office smash It did the winning cash So do the ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" mashFrom the computer cinematography that is quite a visual feat To the spot-on voice-overs when the actors speak The crowd all came from their humble abodes To get a jolt from those monster rolesThey did the mash They did the ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" mash The ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" mash It was a comedic smash They did the mash It caught in a flash They did the mash They did the ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" mashThe critics were even having fun And the film had only just begun The guests included Meezaman His wife Karly and their son Rock Lobster tooThe film was rocking with all those monster sounds Reese Witherspoon was off the chain backed by her monster hounds The alien-bangers were about to arrive With their clone alien group ""The Crypt-Alien Alive""They played the mash They played the ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" mash It did not crash It was a crowd-pleaser mash They played the mash It brought in quite a box office stashOK, enough! That sounded more like a jingle review of ""Punsters vs. Aliens"" than ""Monsters vs. Aliens"". Anyway, you gotta pretty good idea that the new Dreamworks' computer animated offering ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" was delightfully entertaining and how could I ""alienately"" put it.Far Out!!!!! Reese Witherspoon wonderfully does the voice of ""the about to be wed"" Susan Murphy, who is hit by a meteorite which causes her to convert into the gigantic Ginormica. There are copyright infringements here because I have had a few turds in my life which I have named Ginormica also. OK, I will stop talking s*it. Anyway, the rookie monster Ginormica is taken into a monster jail and befriends other monster colleagues: B.O.B., Dr. Cockroach Ph. D, and The Missing Link. A vicious alien form named Gallaxhar clones his kind to strike Planet Earth into oblivion, so therefore the Monsters are delegated by the U.S. Government to. (Well, you get it, just look again at the film's title.) Besides Witherspoon, excellent voice-over work was done by: Seth Rogen as B.O.B., Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach, Will Arnett as The Missing Link, Rainn Wilson as Gallaxhar, and Stephen Colbert as The President. I will not reveal more of the plot of ""Monsters vs. Aliens"", so I could provide you a missing link to not spoil it for you. So have a blast with the ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" smash! ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Monsters Vs. Aliens is one of Dreamworks Animation best work, it's very fun and entertaining.","I just saw MvA and it was fun, entertaining & sometimes very funny. It was better than Kung Fu Panda & Madagascar 2, it was one of Dreamworks Animation best. Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett & Rainn Wilson as the main villain Gallaxhar were great and fun to watch. But Seth Rogen as B.O.B & Stephen Colbert as the President stole the show with memorable characters, they were funny as hell!! I liked the good visuals, the nice 50's look at alien invasions and mainly the action-packed sequences (surprised how great the action was in this). It wasn't as funny as I expected it to be but I still laughed hard out loud a couple times as well a few more laughs at other scenes as well. The action sequences though, is surprisingly well-made and loved it. Monsters Vs. Aliens is like The Incredibles of Dreamworks Animation, The Incredibles is the best & most action-packed feature from Pixar and this Monsters Vs. Aliens from Dreamworks Animation (more action than Kung Fu Panda, in my opinion). Monsters Vs. Aliens is a very fun, entertaining, very funny & action-packed and one of Dreamworks Animation best features yet!!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It feels empty somehow,"Monsters vs Aliens is a funny and light hearted film, (hilarious especially when the president was doing his 'negotiation')i really appreciate the animation and modeling too. The faces are life-like enough for an animated film, in my opinion. Also the details of the robots. Man! those are the bomb. Maybe about half as good as Transformers! (hah.) Just aesthetically wise, i think it's pretty darn awesome.However, for audience who are particular about the story line, Monsters vs Aliens could use some improvements. Like more character development and story development which would strengthen the existing theme-which i still can't quite figure out yet.i really do enjoy those subliminal messages in movies, and picking up something at the end. Naming a few animated films like Up, or Shrek Final Chapter, or Coraline or The Polar Express.Monsters vs Aliens is a pretty alright movie for families with kids, for parents to join in the laughter.Though the script could be more solid to justify the efforts for creating the good visuals",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"'Monsters vs. Aliens' Confusing and Forgettable, yet Charming","It was the perfect alien movie parody- an outer-being invades Earth and a bunch of dim-witted monsters have to stop him. Add the fact that DreamWorks Animation (Shrek, Kung Fu Panda) is behind it should make it to be a hit! But ever since Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, DreamWorks has been going downhill. Pixar and them were always competing to be the top studio, DreamWorks constantly casting major stars to voice (Aliens no exception) and Pixar always winning awards (Wall-E took home the Oscar for 'Best Animated Feature' last year). But even celebrities couldn't save this train wreck of a movie. The predicaments are frankly unlikely and dumb, and a lot of the scenes are left unexplained, the ending for one. Directors Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon, who have both been with DreamWorks Animation for quite a while, Vernon having been since the first Shrek movie, attempt to create a parody of alien invasion movies like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and may have done just that. In a scene where the president (Stephen Colbert, hilarious but unnecessary) tries to communicate with the foreign ship, he plays a keyboard, obviously spoofing Close Encounters. It'll have you snickering.But snickering alone does not make a good comedy. A good comedy has to have a few sight gags, evenly spaced jokes and a fairly funny cast. The cast is great, and I'm not referring to their talents. Monsters vs. Aliens stars Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen (whose character is pretty much the best part of the movie), Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett (we also get a cameo from Amy Poehler), Kiefer Sutherland, Rainn Wilson, Paul Rudd, Renée Zellweger, John Krasinski (you know him from The Office), Ed Helms (him too), Julie White, Jeffrey Tambor and, as I mentioned before, Stephen Colbert. Of course, we also have small parts played by DreamWorks regulars including the directors plus Sean Bishop, Tom McGrath, Chris Miller, Lisa Stewart, Latifa Ouaou and Geoffrey Pomeroy. A huge cast means huge money, which Monsters is sure to make.In Monsters vs. Aliens, a meteorite from outer space hits a young girl, Susan (Witherspoon), on her wedding day, turning her into a nearly 50 foot woman. She's taken to a secret government lair with other monsters that have been kept hidden: B.O.B (Rogen), Dr. Cockroach (Laurie), The Missing Link (Arnett) and Insectosaurus. When the world faces an alien invasion by Gallhaxar (Wilson) soon after, General W.R Monger (Sutherland) suggests to President Hathaway (Colbert) to release the secret monsters and see if they can handle the situation better than the government can. ""Oooze gonna save us?"" B.O.B, no contest. The giant blob of blue goo saved the movie entirely. If it wasn't for the Seth Rogen voiced character, Monsters would have fell flat. ""I think that Jell-O gave me a fake phone number.""Monsters vs. Aliens is the latest rocket that DreamWorks attempts to land on the moon. It doesn't land anywhere near Kung Fu Panda or Flushed Away, but it's enjoyable if you don't think too much about it. It's full of spoofs, cameos and some goofs only the adults in the audience will get (a pretty funny one from The Colbert Report, watch for it). You get a few giggles, but no real laugh-out-loud moments come from it.Pixar's still going strong, but DreamWorks is staring to create epic money-making bombs.2/5 popcorn buckets.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

A delightful treat for horror fans!,"The reviews that I've encountered on ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"", both from professional and amateur authors, were largely negative and harsh ones, mostly claiming that the film doesn't have a real target audience. Animated movies are usually primarily aimed at young children but this movie is definitely ""scarier"" than your average cartoon and even for the more adult audiences the script it too full of subtle references and little tributes to the world of ancient 50's B-cinema. I even read in one specific review that ""Monsters Vs. Alien"" is the out-of-control project of a couple of obsessive and nerdy film-fanatics and can probably only be enjoyed by other obsessive and nerdy film-fanatics. Well, I am a obsessive and reasonably nerdy – at least when it comes to old horror and Sci Fi movies – film fanatics and indeed I tremendously enjoyed this film; thank you very much! I never dreamed I would ever see an animated movie that brings homage to long-forgotten (at least I assumed they were) and shamefully underrated cinematic milestones like ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"", ""The Blob"" and ""The Fly""! And then to think these titles are only just the famous sources of inspiration. I really couldn't believe my eyes when I spotted references towards much smaller and even charmingly clumsy Sci-Fi films like ""Mothra"", ""The Thing from Another World"", ""It Came from beneath the Sea"", ""The Amazing Colossal Man"" and ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"". To me – although we stated clear that I'm just an obsessive and nerdy fan boy – this is all the more proof that horror and Sci-Fi, and monster mania flicks in particular, are not dead genres. Even though you're not familiar with the era of 50's monsters, the over-the-top grotesque ideas and situations of mass hysteria still definitely inspire the nowadays generation of scriptwriters and, in spite of what a lot of people think, with success!On the day of her long anticipated wedding with the ambitious weatherman Derek Dietl, the beautiful Susan gets hit by a radioactive meteorite and almost instantly grown into enormous proportions. Much against her will, Susan – now renamed Ginormica - is taken to a secret government lair where she's locked up amongst other monsters, like The Missing Link, a blob-like creature, a gigantic moth and a genius but mad scientist with the body of a cockroach. When the evil alien super villain Gallaxhar threatens to destroy the world, however, their guardian General Monger releases the monsters to fight back. It's true that the story of ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" occasionally feels rushed and the creators didn't take enough time to properly introduce the magnificently versatile cast of characters and their fascinating background. On the other hand, though, this is an animated movie and nobody wants to watch a three hour cartoon, right? ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" is fast-paced, witty, incredibly clever and chock-full of hilarious situations and adorable inside jokes. Especially the character of dim-witted B.O.B and self-indulgent evil alien Gallaxhar are downright hilarious. The computer animation and design is damn close to perfection and even the 3-D gimmicks were aptly chosen. Also, Dreamworks made some excellent choices in Hollywood names to provide these delightful B-animation-movie characters with the exact right voice, like Reese Witherspoon as Ginormica, Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach PhD, Kiefer Sutherland as General Monger and Seth Rogen as B.O.B. Don't even bother reading the bashful guarantees; I'm an obsessive nerd and I say this is the best animated movie out there, along with Kung Fu Panda.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
What a let down,"I walked into the cinema thinking that this film would be a decent movie- It wasn't a bad assumption, considering the great movies dreamworks have made previously like Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, even small soldiers. However after seeing the movie, i came out extremely disappointed. The film is basically something that you'll only sit and watch because you payed for it; and if you got a 2D ticket then all the worse- as the 3D addition basically makes this movie.The jokes throughout the movie are pretty dumb and unfunny (i think i laughed at one maybe), with a lot of things that you've seen before in just too many movies. Bob the blue blob isn't that funny, the jokes you see in the trailer are pretty much all you get, and some of the things that happen in the movie are so utterly random that you think ""Why the hell did they even do that?"" It's pretty desperate- Just another tragic case of the film being more funny when it doesn't want to.However i'm not going to completely wreck this movie. It did have its fair share of entertaining bits throughout; a lot of the kids seemed to find it funny... but they are easy to please. Normally a lot of kids film relate to kids and adults, with some humour that you can't believe got into a U-PG.

Simple,"As the user/reviewer ""Dick Steel"" wrote here too, technically this movie seems perfect. The voice cast is great, the animation looks great and I'm sure the 3-D version looks awesome too (I could only watch the 2-D version).Unfortunately all the (best) jokes get revealed in the trailer and B.O.B. has nothing (much) more to say in the movie itself. He almost becomes annoying. The story is too thin, most jokes aren't working (or are revealed in the trailer as mentioned above) and you get the feeling that this was rushed into production. There must have been so many other things/directions the movie could've have gone, but unfortunately we will never know ... well maybe we will, because I'm sure despite the fact, that the movie wasn't successful, commercially and critically, there might be a sequel ...

This film encourages and reveals to viewers that it is possible for everyone to do their part for the world. At times, I feel that I am not doing my part for the world.

"Not a awful CGI animation film, but not that good either","Almost everything about this movie was just generic and predictable and the direction it went was mostly boring at times. So the premise is the Monsters are the good guys and the Aliens are the bad guys, the idea might seem okay but overall it really isn't a satisfying movie. There isn't even a good amount of character development so I found most of the characters to be just bland. Besides them each having their own special skills they are good at. Nothing really got my attention in this and kinda found it a bit boring for the most part. Nothing was interesting and there just isn't anything new to see or even creative. It wasn't that bad but not that good either. The jokes never really work, even for kids I don't think and everything just wasn't explored enough.5.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A cool tribute and a great animated film,"I am a fan of Superheroes, I am a fan of b-movies, and so I love films that blur the line between the two, part of the reason is also because I think that a lot of those old B-movies could be remade as superhero movies very easily, you want proof? Sam Raimi's Darkman was inspired by old universal horror films and mad scientist B-movie, Wes Craven's Swamp Thing also blurs the lines a bit and you also have this movie. Aliens have invaded the earth, sending in a giant robot probe, after attempts to destroy it fail the government resorts to an alternate method; Monsters. For years the US government has been capturing and containing monsters the most recent of which is Ginormica, a to-be bride who is hit by a meteor which contained radioactive material which causes her to grow giant, she joins the team which already consists of Dr Cockroach, B.O.B, the Missing Link and Insectosaurus. Everyone of the monsters is a stand-in for some iconic b-movie monster; 'Missing Link' – 'Creature From the Black Lagoon', 'B.O.B.' –'The Blob', 'Dr Cockroach' – 'The Fly', 'Ginormica' – 'The Fifty Foot Woman', and 'Insectosaurus' – 'Godzilla/Mothra'. As a tribute to those old B-movies this film succeeds, the plot is over-the-top, the story is outrageous and the action is top. But this films succeeds on another levels, this movie is outrageously funny; the verbal humour, the slapstick are both done expertly and the voice actors are having a blast, top points to Hugh Laurie (yes, THE Hugh Laurie) as Dr Cockroach. And yet past the humour and the b-movie tribute this film also has its fair share of tender moments and it's kind of heartfelt overall. This movie is great: kids and adults will love it, proof of my theory that when Dreamworks are good they are fantastic. So where's that superhero remake of The Manster? What about The Amazing Colossal Man? Or The Indestructible Man? Octaman? Blood Freak? The Amazing Transparent Man? Come on studios! Most of these movies are in public domain for crying out loud! And there's no shortage of B-movie loving directors and writers, Make this stuff happen!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It's fine. Unfortunately, it will not impress many people, but it will still find some that can connect with it very easy.","I watched Monsters vs. Aliens back in 2009 in the cinema with my family and from what I remember: we were not impressed by it all that much. And now 10 years later, after many delays, since i have a schedule of movies that i want to watch, because there are so many of them, i thought that i'll give it a shot and see if it still holds up today.Unfortunately, i have the same feelings with the movie as it was 10 years ago. There were so many opportunities to be something very fun and creative, but they are just ideas that they had and they missed the mark by a lot with the execution. It still does have redeeming qualities that save the movie from being bad or worse, but it's not enough and it will go down as one of the weakest movies of DreamWorks Animation.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Colbert Makes a Fine President!,"I really enjoyed watching Monsters vs Aliens even though many people said it sucked. Well, this is not Pixar or Ice Age or Shrek. This is just a good animated feature that parents and kids should have a good time watching. I know I had fun watching this film especially Colbert as the American President. His scenes are definitely the funniest part of the movie.This is about a group of monsters who take on Gallaxhar and his clones. Gallaxhar is about to destroy Earth because he's looking for a rare, powerful mineral. But that mineral is inside the body of Susan Murphy and that enabled her to become gigantic and strong.The voice acting is great. This movie features an all-star cast such as Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, and Kiefer Sutherland.I know this is a predictable movie. I know this is not Dreamworks best because Shrek is.

A Twist On Some Sci-Fi Classics!!,"After conquering fairy tales with such classics as the ""Shrek"" franchise, DreamWorks tried doing so again but fell a bit short in the Sci-Fi genre!! Despite ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" having all the makings of being a potential huge hit like it's recent predecessor ""Kung Fu Panda""; it simply fell short to me on the laughs. The main thing which attracted me to this movie was the fact that it pays tribute to such Sci-Fi classics as ""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, The Blob, Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Fly, Mothra"" and every alien invading movie ever made.""Monsters vs. Aliens"" mainly revolves around (Susan Murphy) a young lady on her wedding day voiced by Reese Witherspoon who has several events occur which lead to her dreams of a wedding to be dashed. Now seen as a threat and possible weapon, (General W.R. Monger) of the U.S. Military voiced by the veteran actor Kiefer Sutherland both capture and recruit her to a secret agency consisting of monsters. Here she meets (B.O.B) the friendly blob voiced by the multi-talented Seth Rogen; the brilliantly mad (Dr. Cockroach) voiced by Hugh Laurie (of House M.D. fame); the overly confident lizard-man (Missing Link) voiced by the usually funny Will Arnett and the gentle giant grub (Insectosaurus) voiced by voice over veteran Conrad Vernon. Meanwhile an invasion on Earth is about to commence led by (Gallaxhar) an alien overlord with a Godlike complex voiced by the still somewhat newcomer Rainn Wilson (you'd know him better on the comedy hit ""The Office"" as Dwight Schrute). Needless to say all hell breaks loose forcing the U.S. Government to rely on their Monsters to even up the playing field causing for much more mayhem to proceed. Who will win and how?? I wont spoil it you'll just have to see it for yourself.In conclusion despite some of the talent/star-power ""Monster vs. Aliens"" packed; it simply came up awfully short. Though most animated movies are aimed at young kids; I found ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" to have something for all ages, cute and endearing but simply wasn't huge on laughs as I had hoped. I'd say, catch it as a matinée or simply wait to rent it. I hope this post was of some help and use. Enjoy.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Something was missing... but what?,"Having just sat through this animated movie, I was a bit disappointed, because I had been told it was super great. Now, don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie, not by far. But there was just something missing, something to make it stand out and go the extra mile.The story told in ""Monsters vs Aliens"" is pretty easy to get yourself immersed into, and it is a fast paced story as well, lots of action and fun along the way. But there was just something missing here to make it unique. Maybe because I watched it after having seen movies like ""How to Train Your Dragon"", ""Despicable Me"" and ""Megamind""?Anyway, as for the list of voices on the cast list, well, only one word is necessary here really; WOW! There were so many really good actors and actresses here, and they really did a great job with their characters, and you really bought into it. With names like Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, Kiefer Sutherland, Paul Rudd, and more, it was just right on the money for the casting of performers to do the voice acting.The animation style was nice to look at, lots of cool effects, details and nice coloring. So that really worked for the movie. I wasn't fortunate enough to watch the movie in 3D, I am sure that would have made the movie experience that much better.""Monsters vs Aliens"" is an alright animation movie, but there are those out there with better story lines and better animation in general. And to me, ""Monsters vs Aliens"" is the type of movie that you never pick up to watch again once you have seen it the first time.

The monsters must fight aliens led by evil Galaxhar (voiced by The Office's Rainn Wilson), and it contains lots of action and humor. The only con is that there weren't enough pop off the screen effects, but otherwise this movie is very good. I recommend it to anyone except little kids or people who just aren't into 3D movies.

Cool Monsters in funniest DreamWorks animation to date,"Susan gets transformed into a 50ft woman on her wedding day and as a result is forced to join a group of monsters to fight an oncoming threat from an approaching alien.Wall-E, Toy Story, The Incredibles and Monsters Inc all show how fantasy comedy and storytelling combined can work. All Oscar winners that are not DreamWorks pictures. Pixar therefore are on somewhat of a role and the arrival of Shrek and Kung Fu Panda have been the closet rivals ever so could this promising picture depicting the most famous of legends finally top the best animators in the business? For this year that certainly remains to be seen after a fairly disappointing trailer for next Pixar release Up! But Rob Letterman's release is certainly enthralling viewing for any age, if perhaps not going to rattle the cages of Pixar's seemingly unflappable reputation.What this picture does is entertain from start to finish with a coolly funny plot that maintains the comic without diving too deep into the weepy soap styled animations that can be the knockdown of so many others. When the plot feels like heading that way up pops one of the cool looking monsters with an in-joke or crazy physical act to keep the laughs coming which is a massive relief as when the emotions hit this film doesn't handle all too well. Susan's overwhelming emotions and The Missing Link's unfit shape make you want to hide your head. But do not fret as this is surely the funniest picture DreamWorks have ever mustered.Shrek had all the attributes for great family viewing. The physical humour of eating disgusting food and Eddie Murphy's Donkey are classic and the emotional core on the concept of appearance is almost tear worthy. Monsters Vs Aliens emotional core may waver but the hilarity from the monsters is beautiful. The physical attributes contributed by BOB are exquisite and the Cockroach's mad attitude towards science is manic humour where even Susan has her moments. Go Monsters! It is an obvious one sided film where you will always route for Monsters as the stereotypical and over dramatic evil alien Gallaxhar (worst villain name ever?) will have you hating him each time on screen.The bizarre representation of the President is often funny if way overboard but the kids will love it.The intertextuality of the film survives on classic Sci-Fi films such as The Blob. Not to mention the inclusion of monsters away from the real world feels Men in Black. But these are handled well through some fine physical humour and an easily accessible plot that will make kids laugh and adults intrigued by the sophisticated action and political agendas.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun family comedy sci-fi movie,"Having two different types of creatures come onto the same screen is an interesting idea. Monsters are organisms created by humans. Many are from some malfunction in scientific procedure that led to the disfigurement of the original organism. Aliens, as we know of from previous science fiction films, are organisms that are not from this planet. But what really makes this film unique, is how it tells the story of finding one's place in the world. Even if you're over twenty stories tall.The characters in this film are very amiable. Reese Witherspoon lends her voice to the character of Susan Murphy, who later becomes Ginormica (a really tall woman), and finds herself in an area she's never heard of before. It is there, that she meets with several other creatures that were all created by a freak accident. The few other creatures that Murphy encounters have their voices through other great actors as well.Hugh Laurie plays Dr. Cockroach who is really fun to listen to because of how he talks. Plus the fact that anything he tries to make doesn't work. Will Arnett is funny as The Missing Link because he always talks about how strong he is but can't really do much. And last is B.O.B who is voiced by Seth Rogen. B.O.B is possibly one of the funniest characters on screen just because how flexible the character of B.O.B. is (physically and mentally). And what's great is that there's almost a funny line for every character in this film, except for the more sentimental parts of course.The other thing that I really appreciate is how this movie makes references to movies released to the older generations, not to mention they're all from the same year as well! For example, Ginormica is a reference to the film, Attack of the 50-Foot Woman (1958), while Dr. Cockroach is almost and exact replica to The Fly (1958), and B.O.B. alludes to The Blob (1958). It is quite clear to what this film was inspired from and it shows that the film crew paid extra attention to the details. It's an honorable tribute if you ask me.The only thing that could've been done better was the actual comedic parts themselves. Yes this movie was funny but when I watched the trailer to this film, it seemed like it was going to have even bigger laughs once I saw the whole film. Unfortunately, it didn't. I laughed often but I felt like I wasn't laughing enough. I wanted more from the screenplay and I wasn't getting what I expected. But in the end, I walk out satisfied knowing it was a fun movie in general.Dreamworks has created a CGI adventure that will not only be fun for kids but also for adults to watch as well. With its goofy script, and sharp visuals, Monsters Vs Aliens is a family film worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
REALD CINEMA shows us what's coming,"3-D technology has really taken leaps and bounds recently with the development of REALD CINEMA. No longer do you need those flimsy red and blue glasses, it's all done in the projection now, and eventually you'll have cut-to-size 3D compatibility with Iphones and Home Computers, in fact by the end of this year.The movie begins with some exceptional 3-D, and any movie that features music by Journey can really do no more (Who's Crying Now? plays in the car when the probe comes to Earth). You might remember Journey has a song that plays during the credits of the 1982 film, TRON, sequel to come out in 2011. While playing cards we hear the song, ""Reminiscing"" by Little River Band, a song recorded in 1978.Overall the film is cute, enjoyable by adults and kids alike with some really silly moments to keep you watching. The war room scenes remind me of Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. This president keeps wanting to resort to nuclear war as a solution, and his general wants to resort to using monsters which have been kept under guard at Area 51 since the 1950's, holding an arsenal of monsters captured over the years, some you might recall.Of whose voices which are played by some of my favorite actors including, Reese Witherspoon as Susan Murphy / Ginormica (Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman), the joke is that she's only 49' 11"" tall, Seth Rogen as B.O.B. (The Blob), Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. (The Fly), and Will Arnett as The Missing Link (Creature From The Black Lagoon).It was also a joy to hear Keifer Sutherland, Wil Arnett, Rainn Wilson, Paul Judd, and Stephen Colbert as POTUS.I'd recommend seeing it, but remember that now that 3D is on a hot streak and we've truly perfected this craft, expect to see more and better films to come.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Buck Turgidson Returns,"""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a bit of let down; we have become spoiled by the animators now putting together what has been a string of fine offerings in the past decade. This movie, like many, seems to have two parts; a vigorous first part and a more lethargic ending portion.It starts off by showing us a bride-to-be having her wedding ceremony interrupted by the fall of a meteor whilst she is outside the church. The result of the exposure – she becomes a giant, and you can't help recalling ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"". She is forthwith whisked off to a secret government prison for other monsters. Some of the incarcerated monsters – and none of them have similar problems – have been there for many years.An alien probe lands on Earth, and no solution can be found to deter them from destroying our planet. Finally an (overacting) general offers that the monsters in the prison should be used to thwart the invasion. This general character is too much remindful of George C. Scott in his role as Buck Turgidson in ""Dr. Strangelove"".After initial attempts to repel the aliens fail, we follow the efforts of the monsters to put an end to the invasion. This is the second portion of the film and is not nearly as engaging as the first part.Despite the rather saccharine lessons we are made to endure – why are we constantly lecturing to kids? – the overall animation makes this one worth watching.Three Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Monsters Fighting for Team Human,"Monsters v. Aliens. Round 1. FIGHT!This wasn't quite Aliens v. Predators and that's OK. The aliens in this movie were a lot more delightful and these monsters--in lieu of Predators--were funnier, more loveable, and clearly on our side.One monster had no business being labeled a monster, just a 50 foot woman. When Susan (Reese Witherspoon) was hit by a meteor on her wedding day in the rural city of Modesto, CA she found herself 50 feet tall with white hair. What she didn't know is that she was hit by a meteor of Quantonium, the most powerful substance in the universe. In any case, she was instantly branded a monster by the government and locked away. That is until Earth was invaded by an alien robot and required monsters to fight it.I enjoyed this Dreamworks animation. It was funny and didn't drag with any slow violin moments. There was the brief sad/disheartening moment but they moved past it fairly fast. There were a few references to some older movies (Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Fly to be exact) which is always a treat for the adults in the room. It was just an overall good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Who Will Win In This Death Match?,"When California girl Susan Murphy is unwittingly clobbered by a meteor full of outer space gunk on her wedding day, she mysteriously grows to 49-feet-11-inches tall. Alerted to the threat of this new monster, the military jumps into action and Susan is captured and secreted away to a covert government compound. There, she is renamed Ginormica and placed in confinement with a ragtag group of other monsters: the brilliant but insect-headed Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D.; the macho half-ape, half-fish The Missing Link; the gelatinous and indestructible B.O.B.; and the 350-foot grub called Insectosaurus. Their confinement is cut short, however, when a mysterious alien robot lands on Earth and begins storming the country. In a moment of desperation, The President is persuaded by General W.R. Monger to enlist the motley crew of Monsters to combat the Alien Robot and save the world from imminent destruction. This film will make you laugh, laugh and laugh some more. Monsters Vs.

i WISH i could mark it 10 stars,"Something prevented me to give this marvelous animation movie 10 stars. I think it is that peculiar (and weak) ending. Weak comparing to the promising beginning of the 'Monsters vs Aliens'. This is what most of DreamWorks animation movies lack. An exact and EverEnding ending. It's just about to remind the great 'NeverEnding Story', each part of which actually was given a great ending! Maybe, it's some kind of marketing move: say, if you, audience, approve the movie, we, DreamWorks, could shot further. No, precious 'producers folks', it doesn't work that way. Please, make it a complete movie! An amusing performance for children and adults with a proper and kind ending. A thoughtful-joyful-at-a-time ending!

Gripping action and clever allusions,"Monsters vs. Aliens works.It's humor isn't top notch, but the movie is. Any of its flaws tend to gently fade into the background, and if you don't enjoy what's happening on screen, something more entertaining will be around in seconds.This film is full of delightful B-movie references and some of the most satisfying role reversals and inversions of classic tropes I've ever seen.The action scenes are fast-paced, coherent, and character driven, and well worth watching in IMAX 3D.Susan/Ginormica may well be the best female action hero to come out of Hollywood in 30 years. She manages to be stay sympathetic and believable in a way the obnoxious Mary Sue powerhouses failed to be.For most people, this will be an enjoyable action film. For hardcore fans of B scifi and schlock horror esoterica, it will be a deeply rewarding experience. The ending may seem trite, until you stand back and think about how this film's romantic subplot sets it apart from not just most action movies with a female protagonist, but a good bulk of contemporary cinematic history.I would have given this ten stars if she had eaten Derek in the last scene.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A 'Monstrous' Success and certainly no 'Alien' to Entertainment!,"We live in an era of dark and gritty action films, most of which have been largely successful-the Bourne trilogy, The Dark Knight, Casino Royale, the International etc. But sometimes, its always better to watch something that exudes pure and unadulterated fun and a large dose of much needed optimism. After all films were originally meant to be a form of escapism and in these troubled times, we can sure do with some escapist fantasy.Who cares if monsters and aliens don't really exist? Who cares if there are no such things as UFO's, alien invasions and meteors which can turn young women into giants? Who cares if the US Government doesn't actually operate a top-secret facility to imprison monsters? Its all meant to be fiction, to be fantasy...and as long as its enjoyable, I'm all for it! The humour is excellent, the animation and effects doubly so. Some of the characters and their antics and dialogues can be extremely goofy and ridiculous...but SO WHAT?! as long as its funny and entertaining.I especially loved the part where the US President attempts 'first contact' with the alien probe. One of the most humorous parts of the film, undoubtedly.Ultimately, you can have all the grim and gritty action, graphic violence and death and stark realism you want in films, but it shouldn't really hinder your appreciation of a real winner like this one...",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun-filled comedy for the whole family!,"This wildly entertaining animated comedy has a long list of tremendous voice actors with a stomach-turning comedic timing to boot. Reese Witherspoon anchors the movie being a 50-foot woman and Seth Rogen is her opposite as B.O.B, an amoeba type monster who is so idiotic it comes off as heart-warming hilarious fun for everyone.Monsters vs Aliens is one of few comedies released in 2009 that can actually make you laugh during it's entire runtime. I failed to laugh at most comedies released in this year, but finally after watching this, I am happy to say I am not disappointed. It's quite honestly, probably, the funniest movie of the year. I'm not exaggerating.It's another Dreamworks masterpiece, and it's no secret why animation is able to beat out most comedies these days. An animated film doesn't have R ratings or 18A ratings for graphic content or profanities. It's family themed jokes and it's fantastic fantasy jokes that can be realistic but totally impossible.From start to credits, I was laughing my head off at the funny antics of B.O.B, the quips and quirks of Susan, the wild and insane Doctor Cockroach and last but not least, the Missing Link who is just funny because of his ego.Monsters vs Aliens is a delightful, funny comedy for everyone. Kids, teens, adults, toddlers, and even grandma will enjoy it. It's fun, it's comedic, and it's wildly entertaining. Don't miss Monsters vs Aliens! You'll regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's all in the title!,"Freddy vs. Jason, Alien vs. Predator and now... Monsters vs Aliens? No, it's not another brainless, cash-motivated horror icon mash-up, but a heartfelt tribute to those '40s and '0s movies where cult genre figures (Dracula, the Wolf Man and, uh, Abbott & Costello) ran into each other for no apparent reason. It's also Dreamworks' most accomplished feature since Shrek 2 (although Kung Fu Panda came pretty close).The incredibly simple story goes like this: on her wedding day, Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is infected by meteorite radiations and becomes a 50-foot menace. To avoid mass panic, a certain General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) locks her up in a top secret facility with other monsters such as Insectosaurus (the name says it all), the blob-like B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), The Missing Link (Will Arnett) and Dr. Cockroach, Phd (Hugh Laurie). However, freedom is offered when an evil alien named Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) starts wreaking havoc and the planet traditional defences prove to be less efficient than expected.Those expecting anything new will be sorely disappointed: Monsters vs Aliens is a 100-minute cliché marathon, from the Dr. Strangelove-inspired secret meetings to the typically moronic US President (Stephen Colbert), with the usual string of references (Star Trek and Close Encounters) and spoofs (Beverly Hills Cop and Mars Attacks!) coming along the way. But for once, the plot's weaknesses are actually a strength: since this is a homage to films that had pretty lame scripts, why should this one have a smarter story?Then again, most people won't care about the plot: the real attraction is the 3-D. Impressive and breathtaking, yes, but as Jeffrey Katzenberg pointed out, the writers and directors were keen to shell out a feature that could be enjoyed just as much even without the funny glasses. This is accomplished through clever gags and even smarter voice casting, Sutherland and Laurie above all (""I'm not a quack, I'm a mad scientist. There's a difference."").In short: this is fun and exciting all the way, whether you watch it in 3-D or not. Besides, what's not to love about a movie that contains the line ""Another UFO has landed in the United States, the only place where UFOs seem to land.""?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Totally Underrated!,"At the time of this review, ""Monsters vs Aliens"" carried a mere 6.4 rating, which is a ginormous injustice. I am a huge fan of sci-fi/comedies, and this little gem had me grinning and laughing out loud from start to finish. It's really more of a sci-fi/super hero movie, except that the ""heroes"" are a rag-tag team of likeable monsters from classic horror films like ""The Blob"" and ""The Creature From The Black Lagoon"". It's both a parody and homage to classic and modern sci-fi films, and is really quite clever.The main protagonist, a reluctant 50-foot monster with the terrifying name of ""Susan"", has a satisfying characer arc, ultimately proving to be smart and tough without being preachy about it. The story is uncomplicated but engaging; the characters are silly and often hilarious, and the voice acting is terrific. And it's worth noting that the animation is great - Pixar has nothing on this one.I can only speculate that the lower votes are coming from viewers who are either not fans of sci-fi or did not ""get"" the cultural references to classic sci-fi and horror movies. Even without these insights, however, the story should appeal to any fan of light-hearted science fiction, and is also safe for kids. I found the alien villian particularly hilarious.The 6.4 rating also does not reflect that the movie was nominated for many awards, winning the Saturn Award for Best Animated Film.So if you like sci-fi/comedy and super hero movies (such as The Incredibles or Guardians of the Galaxy), don't be dissuaded by the ""average"" rating for ""Monsters vs Aliens"", which is a galaxy from being accurate.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Very Good Worth Seeing,"I've read a lot of comments about this not being a Shrek, or whatever, but we are talking about this movie. Most of the trash that Hollywood puts out now days can never compare to Gone with the Wind, but we still go to see movies.The voice cast was excellent. Hugh Laurie gets to use his real voice, something that most ""House"" viewers may never actually hear. And he makes a terrific Dr. Cockroach. Will Arnett plays Link, the big talk little action character which is perfect for Arnett who has played these types before. Seth Rogen is everywhere these days and his lovable buffoonish voice carries Bob the Blob quite well. He has such a command of the nuances of his character that even in voice role come out and make for a great job. Reese is great, she carries her role of a sweet 20 something trapped in the body of a 50 foot women with ease. Plus her tough girl attitude comes out strong and confident but never ""witchy.""Keifer Sutherland proves that he can act just as well as an animated character as in the flesh. He nails his General WR Monger part perfectly, and even sounds a little like a combination of R Lee Ermey and George C. Scott. This helps when viewing the Dr. Strange Loveesque parts. (For those who can remember Dr. Strangelove)Raine Wilson, Renee Zellweger, and Paul Rudd round-out the cast in great form as well. For those of you who are fans of ""The Office"" you should get a kick out of Raine's Mad Alien Scientist role.Again, it's not Shrek, but there were things in Shrek that were sophomoric and rather stupid, but I still liked Shrek. The same goes here; there will be stuff that you may not like, but taken as a whole this is a fun movie. It's great with the kids, or just a couple of grown-ups wanting to escape the stress and doldrums of everyday living. I'll recommend this one to the family and friends for sure.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"good fun, excellent 3D (IMAX version)","Story, well a simple fun story. No deep attempt to moralize or philosophize, but enjoyable. Its a cartoon, OK? And the running time is not too long. Plenty of nice animation, good visual and dialog jokes. Might even be fun to watch a second time, though not if I have to pay for it.What is outstanding is the IMAX 3D. Head and shoulders better than what Disney did for Up. The IMAX version has a fast frame rate and electronic glasses which shutter each eye in sync with the film. The content is also rendered totally in 3D. So, things never feel layered. Motion scenes - and there are lots of action scenes - are stable and clear, better than ordinary cinema (they really do need to stop showing films at just 24 frames per second). So the 3D is immersive. You can sense things in the far distance as well as quite close. This is definitely how 3D should be done, and I give a 1 point bonus on my rating simply because this is a showcase for 3D done right and both audience and other film makers should raise their sights on 3D to meet or beat this quality level. It is a milestone.And a fun one.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Saw it in 3-D, I enjoyed it!","This has been the first 3-D movie I have seen in the last 15 years. Despite the cost being 11 dollars, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, specifically when everything seems to be coming at you, but what made this animated movie a success is not necessarily the 3-D animation nor the plot (which isn't that great), but the cast, particularly on Seth Rogen's part as B.O.B., the mindless blue matter who has the attention span of a goldfish. Hugh Laurie is excellent as Dr. Cockroach. I'm so used to seeing him in ""House"" that I thought he could not pull off any other role, but he does in this. In fact, he changes his voice which is so different from ""House"", that he is almost like a totally different person.Rainn Wilson as Gallaxar also delivers his line brilliantly, as a power crazy alien whose intent is to take over the world. Reese Witherspoon, Keifer Sutherland, Will Arnet, and Stephen Colbert deliver great voice acting to their characters as well. In addition to a brilliant cast, the film contains plenty of satire and parody against the government that most of the time I felt like I was going to fall out of my chair laughing. Overall, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a great film that is not aimed at a specific audience like many of the other animated films out there are, but to the general public. There is some irreverent humor, but it isn't over the top. When it comes out on DVD, you better check it out. My rating: *** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Monsters + Aliens = COOL! (the math is plain and simple),"I finally understand why they're called DreamWorks, it's because they work to make your wildest dreams come true (and as corny as that may sound, it actually sums them up perfectly). Monsters Vs. Aliens (2009) serves as an affectionate spoof of the old-fashioned monster movies, which were all the rage in the 1950s and '60s. It's a big love-letter to that specific era in cinematic history, known as the ""Atomic Age""; a time when motion-pictures used to depict science experiments gone wrong, monsters on the loose, and alien invasions. The film parodies several different famous movie monsters from that decade; Gojira (1954), Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), The Fly (1958), The Blob (1958), Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman (1958) and Mosura (1961). It helped introduce me to these now legendary icons of Hollywood's Golden Age, essentially making it my generation's version of The Monster Squad (1987).The reason I love Monsters Vs. Aliens so much is because I feel extremely lucky that something like this even exists at all (hear me out!). Back then, they typically only did two types of sci-fi horror; ""creature features"" and ""alien invaders"" (but they were usually done separately, though). From concept to execution, it was a stroke of genius for DreamWorks to come up with the clever idea of bringing these two popular subgenres together into one single narrative, successfully managing to merge both of their unique stylisations into an animated family feature that's played more for laughs (a silly, screwball-type comedy). It was trying to be it's own little thing and therefore, it was a very smart creative move on the filmmakers' part and seemed like the only logical step forwards to help progress this long, stale genre. It goes without saying, but it bears repeating that Monsters and Aliens were the most awesome things to any little kid (besides Robots and Dinosaurs, of course).With a high production budget of $175 million, this is the most expensive animated film DreamWorks has ever produced and you can definitely tell. All that money was put to good use, as the film looks visually stunning with its amazingly intricate detailing on the characters and settings (even after all these years, it still looks unbelievably impressive!). From the top-secret underground prison of a high-tech government facility to the tranquil streets of a quiet little suburban neighbourhood, every computer-animated environment felt like a real lived-in location and our monster protagonists were perfectly designed and rendered to fit their individual personalities (the amount of time they spent working on the 3D modelling goes to show their efforts weren't in vain). For an animated movie, the big dramatic action sequences of dynamic destruction were pulled off in such a semi-grounded way (particularly the one set in a populous U.S. city), that they made it all feel as if everything what's happening had some genuine consequence.There's quite a few little nods and many indirect references to classical sci-fi films of the time hidden all over this film, with The War of the Worlds (1953) and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956) being the standout examples. The film also delivers on an inspired musical score that Bernard Herrmann would've been proud of, as some of the more overlooked sci-fi elements are interwoven into its action-packed yet chillingly-creepy soundtrack which, at times, sounds vaguely similar to The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). Even the very title of the film itself, ""Monsters Versus Aliens"", is their way of paying tribute to all the numerous ""versus monster movies"" in the Japanese kaiju genre.The filmmakers' decision to do the movie in a stereoscopic 3D format, as opposed to just converting it into 3D later on during post-production, was certainly admirable (unfortunately for me, I didn't get the chance to experience it up on the big-screen). I feel as though they did this as yet another sort of homage to the original black-and-white classics, as the big 3D craze initially kicked off in the 1950s with films such as House of Wax (1953) and It Came from Outer Space (1953). And also, another added detail I picked up on in regards to noticing the science-fiction aspects is that it was all subtly designed to evoke an old-timey sensibility, making the film's overall aesthetic choices feel just like it's set during the '50s period (while still taking place in a more contemporary, modern day setting).I'm surprised this never turned into an ongoing franchise. It got a decent critical reception from professional reviewers, but general audiences weren't really into it a whole lot. My guess is that common moviegoers didn't understand what kind of parody movie this film was aiming to be, due to an awful lot of people not having watched any of the older monster flicks of which these characters were loosely based on (so they wouldn't have been very knowledgable on the subject, to begin with). People just didn't see it in the same way us B-movie fans did (it's an honorary cult classic in my eyes). If you're looking for a truly great satire like Shrek (2001), then you're in the wrong place. But if you're just after some daft escapism from the horrors of real-life, then give this unappreciated gem of a DreamWorks parody a fair chance to impress.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Difference Between Monsters And Aliens,"While I have enjoyed most of Dreamworks's animation films, only very few have reached the level of 'Pixar' in terms of overall quality.

'Monsters vs Aliens' is a wonderful tribute to the 50s B-movies but if one is expecting a story on similar lines (like what the Rodriguez - Tarantino Grindhouse movies have done) then one might be disappointed and I think many have felt that way. But, this movie deserves a chance and ought to be watched as a stand alone that has some references to those old movies. 'Monsters vs Aliens' has heart. There is not one moment which I can think of that bored me. The dialogues are hilarious and the characters are very funny and likable. The CGI animation is terrific (Dreamworks seems to get better in this department). The star studded voice cast of talented actors who are gifted with comedy (Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, Kiefer Sutherland, Rainn Wilson, Stephen Colbert, Paul Rudd, Julie White, Jeffrey Tambor, Amy Poehler, Ed Helms, Renée Zellweger, John Krasinski and Sean Bishop) is excellent.

Unfortunately, unlike Bullwinkle -- and Bugs Bunny, for that matter - - it doesn't really offer the double-edged adult commentary that makes some cartoons so memorably subversive.I hear the 3D makes the experience more involving.
