The Virgin Queen Redux in an Odd Mix of Old-Fashioned Melodrama and Romance Novel,"There is something stubbornly old-fashioned about Shekhar Kapur's 2007 sequel to his 1998 art-house triumph, ""Elizabeth"". I don't mean the newer movie is a stodgy historical pageant. Far from it, all the production values are first-rate, including a relatively seamless use of CGI in the Spanish Armada sequence, but beyond all the pomp and circumstance, the mindset of the story is pure 1940's-era studio melodrama. Set in 1585, the film picks up the Queen's life a quarter century after the first film, and what follows in the strangely cautious screenplay by Michael Hirst and William Nicholson is a simplistic portrait of an aging, superstitious woman aware of her power but ironically at a loss to define her own fate. This period of her life is familiar from a number of previous films and miniseries, but this time, the psychological complexity behind such a fascinating historical figure has been downgraded in favor of romance novel plot turns and paper-thin character development.The set-up is rich with possibilities only partially realized on screen. Protestant England is on its knees, as Roman Catholic Spain has become Europe's most powerful country. Now in her early fifties, Elizabeth is vulnerable since Phillip II of Spain is intent on conquering England and especially because she has not married and produced an heir. Next in line is her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, a devout Roman Catholic imprisoned in a castle in Northamptonshire. Elizabeth has proved to be a tolerant ruler as she allows her country's Roman Catholics to maintain their religious beliefs, even though they see Mary as the only rightful Queen. In the meantime, Sir Walter Raleigh has just returned from the New World and stimulated Elizabeth's passion for adventure and her long-dormant desire for romance. Complicating matters is Elizabeth's devoted lady-in-waiting, Bess, a comely beauty who attracts Raleigh's attention. Just as this standard triangle is established, there is a threat on Elizabeth's life known historically as the Babington Plot. Mary is beheaded for her connection to the plot, which gives Philip free rein to gain the Pope's approval to attack England. Elizabeth inspires her troops to face off with the much larger Spanish Armada, and the rest, as they say, is history.It's no surprise that Cate Blanchett commands the screen in the title role and does her best to fill in the blanks left by the routine script. She manages to imbue the Queen with a hidden vulnerability at which comparatively imperious predecessors like Bette Davis and Glenda Jackson merely hint. The one drawback is that she is too young for the role, a point emphasized by the periodic and somewhat conceited use of flashbacks from the previous film in which her appearance has not changed significantly despite the make-up. Geoffrey Rush returns from the first film as Elizabeth's adviser, Sir Francis Walsingham, but he has less to do this time. As Raleigh, Clive Owen has no problem playing a dashing figure, but he seems more like a romantic's fabrication of what a bodice-ripping swashbuckler should be. Speaking with a strange burr, Samantha Morton has precious few scenes as the fanatical but forgiving Mary, and her pouty face and petulant manner seem at odds with previous characterizations. As Philip, Jordi Mollà is forced to play the king as a religious zealot, while Abbie Cornish's Bess strikes me as far too contemporary in manner to be credible as a lady-in-waiting, especially with the ongoing hints of lesbianism and a soft porn-like lovemaking scene with Raleigh.Guy Dyas' production design, Alexandra Byrne's costumes and Remi Adefarasin's cinematography are all impressive in their splendor and meticulous detail, though I found the music by Craig Armstrong and A.R. Rahman far too intrusive. There are several extras with the 2008 DVD release starting with Kapur's commentary track, often insightful but excessively verbose. An eleven-minute making-of featurette is included, of course, but it is pretty standard with plenty of now-and-then comparisons with the 1998 film. Three other shorts are included  one on Dyas' intensive work on the production design, one on the recreation of the climactic battle with a mix of ship replicas and CGI, and one on the actual locations used for the filming. There are nine minutes of deleted and extended scenes including one that too-realistically shows Mary's decapitated head. None of these extras helps make the experience of watching this film any more involving.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Huge Opportunity for Greatness is Missed,"With a dream cast, a fascinating subject, and a budget larger than a pirate's booty, this film could have been great. But the chance is missed.(Pros:) The cast is definitely the film's biggest asset. Cate Blanchett is incredibly brilliant even at times that the script fails to provide her with a worthy line. Her powerful performance is utterly captivating. Clive Owen's Walter Raleigh is as dashing as a man can be. As the man who charmed the Queen out of her heart and wits and dared to tell her not to act like a fool, Owen's Raleigh is daring at times, vulnerable at others, but always compelling and spectacular. Geoffrey Rush makes the best out of the very little that he's given to work with and Abbie Cornish and Samantha Morton are each great in their parts.It's also worth a mention that the costumes and the locations are spectacular, paired with a few moments of good story-telling (only if those moments would last all through the film) they make a few absolutely extraordinary scenes. Another great characteristic of this film is it's subtlety, the emotions that are there yet not talked about, the wishes, feelings, disappointments, desires, and fears that are only hinted are the best parts of an otherwise disappointing story-telling.(Cons:) Sloppy editing, campy scenes, and poor writing are what mostly hurts the film. Unfortunately the film's precious time is spent on side-stories that could have easily been discarded, and consequentially, not enough time is spent on the development of the main story. Everything that happens after Sir Walter meets Elizabeth seems forced. Vague at times, the film seems to be in rush to hit certain notes at certain times. Elizabeth meets Walter and a few lines later she's mad about him, so is Bess and so on. The audience is not given the chance to feel or take in what's really happening, not even enough time to get to know the characters let alone feel what they are going through. At times, it seemed as though many of the scenes were cut short in the editing room and had lost their essence in the process. (If that's the case, lets hope the DVD includes the director's cut.)The film could have benefited from more climax and action (the battle is barely touched), (other than a few great scenes) most of the story is told through conversations in closed areas. More than anything, the writers leaned on poetic lines to deliver their story. Also, for all it's subtlety, the film takes sides so obviously that it hurts any chances it had at reaching some level of realism or fairness. For instance, not only Phillip of Spain is utterly evil, he's one ridiculous, petty, dim character.Overall, the cast certainly makes the experience worthwhile, and as long as one does not expect absolute greatness or historical accuracy, this film can be great entertainment for most.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Cate Blanchett,"one of her magnificent performances. and a great story, wise script, superb cinematography and fascinating manner to give not exactly the perfect second part but a subtle, smart and seductive history lesson. because it is one of films who seems changing theories, information, doubts. and the basic motif is the impeccable performance of Cate Blanchett. and the inspiration of director to give one of films who do not gives explanations but only the reflection, in large mirror, of scenes from a reign defined by the force of nuances of vulnerability. the purpose, in this case, has not to build a magnificent monument. but to use a great cast, the traces of others adaptations, the flavor of a period, for a realistic drawing of an unique woman. the result - honestly, impressive.",,Anonymous,History

Her Majesty!!!!!!!,"It's really not so odd that director Shekhar Kapur would wait nine years and then craft a loud, bombastic sequel to his only claim to fame, the lavish period drama ""Elizabeth"" which rightfully launched the career of uber-actress Cate Blanchett, in an attempt to resurrect his own floundering career. It is rather odd that Blanchett, a consummate actress of incalculable range, seems to never turn down a script, including this dud of a sequel to the film that first allowed her to shine. The oddest thing, however, is that the completely uncalled for ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is actually quite entertaining and might've received higher praise had the intrusive music score not induced such a numbing headache.Blanchett, of course, is terrific, and doesn't seem to mind that the screenwriters have turned her signature character into a woman with split personalities: a raving love-scorned woman in private who constantly crumbles under pressure, and a powerful monarch who commands the wind and becomes a divinity to her people in public. Elizabeth has no character arc here like she did in the original film that saw her mature from frightened princess to calculating queen. The sequel suffers from this lack of development for its titular historical icon, but Blanchett rules the madhouse with an iron fist, chewing the scenery when necessary for dramatic effect and maximum entertainment value.The sequel also suffers from too much focus on a silly love triangle involving Elizabeth, Sir Walter Raleigh (an uninspired Clive Owen), and one of her ladies in waiting (a ravishingly gorgeous but ultimately lifeless Abbie Cornish). The rest of the film covers events that were already treated in a more respectful and quietly powerful manner in HBO's miniseries starring Helen Mirren. These include Elizabeth's divisive relationship with Mary Stuart (a blistering Samantha Morton doing an entertaining bit of over-acting), and the defeat of the Spanish Armada, whose sinking is done up in a rock opera style that serves as a guilty pleasure to watch.Meanwhile, director Kapur, who never saw an overhead shot, candlelit scene, or 360 degree crane movement he didn't love, uses his bigger budget to ridiculously grand effect creating immaculate set designs populated with over the top costuming and epic pageantry. ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is completely unnecessary, but despite some of its stunning ineptitude, it turns out not to be a colossal waste of time and will entertain those who will allow it to bludgeon them. Where the first film was a smart period piece inspired by ""The Godfather"", the silly sequel is a dumb art-house film inspired by obnoxious action flicks. Blanchett, who hopefully will become more selective in her roles as she ages, oddly seems at home in both. I'm not sure if that's the mark of a great actress or a desperate movie star.",6.0,Anonymous,History
An Adult Popcorn Movie,"Don't believe the poor reviews ""Elizebeth: The Golden Age"" has received.While it may be true the film is not historically correct, most of us do not go to the movies for a history lesson. We go to be entertained. On that basis, this film is a winner. It has romance, intrigue and betrayal. It is basically a melodrama.The photography is great, although sometimes the director gets carried away with the camera movements. The orchestral score in fine, although it is overwhelming at times. The acting is absolutely first rate.I thought that ""Elizebeth: The Golden Age"" was more entertaining than any of the ""Pirates of the Carribian"" movies. If you want an entertaining movie that is geared more towards adults than children, then you should check the movie out.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Cate Blanchett shines in biographical drama; some fiction added to the events,"Cate Blanchett reprises her role as the Virgin Queen, Elizabeth I, and is the film's greatest highlight. She exudes power, strength and influence in portraying the 16th century monarch. Her commanding presence on the screen really gives the majestic qualities that the real queen certainly had. At the same time, she gives us a personal glance inside the woman's heart, where she has suppressed from public view an inner vulnerability and melancholy. Elizabeth certainly endured many sorrows, and this portrayal gives us a glance inside the woman's who carried all this upon her shoulders, and is credited with raising England to prominent status on the world stage.In addition to Blanchett, the supporting cast all turn in superior work. The sets, costuming, and period speech are all mastered well, creating a true feel for the era being depicted. Although many of the people and events are real, a few liberties have been taken apparently to spice up the drama. Such fictionalizing probably wasn't necessary; enough happened during this queen's rule to make the story interesting without it. One example: the flashy Sir Walter Raleigh was indeed a favorite of the queen, but this movie puts them in a romantic triangle that just gets in the way of other things going on. Also, Raleigh, better known as an explorer, was not the hero in the battle with the Spanish Armada.Blanchett shines when she delivers the famous speech to the troops on the eve of the Spanish invasion. But even she is burdened by the director's preoccupation with Elizabeth as a suffering angst-filled woman facing middle-age with less bravery than facing the world's most powerful fleet at that time. We get endless views of her taking her wig off in secret, and staring at a mirror. The first time this device is used is fine to get the point across of her hopeless situation of never taking a husband (and the slow advance of time having its way), but we see her looking like a shriveled ghost in too many such scenes, and it's way overdone in this context. Her ""real"" hair sans the wig looks like an inebriated Edward Scissorhands was her hairdresser, and her pale complexion looks like somebody pasted white-out all over her face.Those few mistakes notwithstanding, this is a fine biopic with superior acting by Blanchett, and is recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Entertaining, pompous, inaccurate","For a movie set in the 16th century I really didn't expect ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" to be so entertaining and fast-paced. Having not seen the first part, I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be able to follow the plot, but thankfully the movie pretty much stands on his own (which is probably why producers chose not to call it ""Elizabeth I. II"" or maybe ""Elizabeth 1.2""... just kidding).So, yes, it's an entertaining movie, but in the third act it becomes incredibly pompous. The imagery is very theatrical all the way through, but at the end director Shekhar Kapur just takes it one step too far. There are epic battles at sea with horses jumping into the water, thunderstorms and so on and so forth. Even though, I'm not an historian, I'm pretty sure most events aren't portrayed authentically. At least I can't imagine that all Spanish people back then were gay-ish psychopaths.Well, yeah, big surprise: as a historical document this movie doesn't really serve well. It's popcorn cinema. Nothing more, nothing less. I heard part 1 was different. If it's true, then the sequel is a step down.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"A fairy tale about the ""Faerie Queene""?  I love it!","Another Elizabeth I film? Why not? The Elizabethan Era's, indeed, a fascinating periods in English history - an era when England was relatively well off compared to other nations  even if its wealth was unevenly distributed!Director Kapur interestingly puts dramatic and chilling appeal and emphasis on Elizabeth's Golden Age to reveal her personality and struggles to keep her throne and save her country from falling into the hands of conspirators and invaders. Does he give his audience any insight into the Golden Age when English Literature, poetry, music, theater, architecture, scientific and technological advancement, and exploration expansion flourished? Nope. His film does offer some interesting hints that women did enjoy the freedom of movement (ah ha, even a queen's closest and dearest lady-in-waiting could play cuckold to her mistress' favorite man!) and that competing interests and ambitions of colonial powers made it easy for ambitious sailors to legalize acts of piracy! Serious crimes could well resort in severe tortures. Director Kapur does stress that she was the ""peoples"" queen!The story continues from where Cate Blanchett's young, flighty, and reckless Elizabeth made her finale masculine-like entrance in the prequel, ""Elizabeth"", as the Virgin Queen with her face heavily laced with the 'white-as-milke' make-up - an image of a queen ready to lead her citizens.At a deliberate slow pacing, the introduction with its scenes, characters and their dialog prepare the audience to receive Elizabeth as the Queen with a more focused, more rigid personality, in charge of hers and her country's destinies. Yep, a woman with ready suitors, but offering a sense that she is wedded to her Empire! She seems very philosophical in her ideals and yet we see her court filled with sorts of political characters. Elizabeth, then, is seen with roving eyes, easily distracted by the presence of attractive men. Indeed, it's a crafty way to introduce Elizabeth before Director Kapur plunges his audience into a compelling tale of treachery, assassination attempts and romance that affects the Virgin Queen during her reign.The film carries a mix of intriguing historical facts, legends and myths in ways that one can only expect history teachers of English public schools to apply to make their lessons interesting, or hear from gossipy English peers, from history classes, wanting to impress their friends with stranger-than-fiction tidbits and hearsay of those times. This film does promise a refreshing tale to grasp! There are those tongue-in-cheek whims and antics that mischievously provoke thoughts of the political and religious changing tides of modern times. Director Kapur has certainly avoided the creation of a history epic, based on dull, dry substance!Blanchett is magnificent in her strange, enigmatic and multi-dimensional character, constantly faced with the challenges of her foes plotting and counter-plotting to take her down at her Court, in her government, and, from foreign lands. She's seen as almost as a brutal ruler at times and on her consistent guard in her determination to hold on to her throne, alternating between her seemingly vicious whims, her heroism and tangled romantic emotions! Yet, she comes off gracefully as a person who has the heart to forgive. Oh yes, there's also that scene that prompts me to think of Joan of Arc! It's not hard to want to cheer for the Queen in her determination to fight against the religious intolerance, barbarism and fundamentalism of the Spanish Inquisition. Spain was a very powerful Catholic foe and the Church did try to destroy this Protestant Queen and to restore England back to Catholism!The battle in the calm-to-storm scene is exhilarating to watch. We also witness her struggles in her attempt to balance her duties to her country and her vulnerability to infatuation and tempestuous relationship. Clive Owens superbly handles his role as the dashing Walter Raleigh  indeed, one of the most colorful and controversial character of the times and of whom English history has spun numerous tales about. This film also charts Raleigh's colonizing dreams, his involvement in a love triangle, his sweeping in and out of the Queen's favor and his immense dislike for Catholics - that did historically determine his fate beyond this film's exposure. Geoffrey Rush returns as the loyal and polished spy master, Sir Walsingham and historically seen as the man who attracted conspiracy theories. Hhhmh, was he responsible for the birth of modern espionage? He's truly fascinating to watch. This film has a great stellar cast of actors who don't disappoint. There's so much on-screen chemistry oozing out between characters in this film. Oh yes, the villains are so agitating and annoying to the core.The background music soundtracks come across as dramatically bold and nail-biting, poignant at times, and emotionally mystifying at others- appropriately matching the many guises, moods and whims of the Virgin Queen  the cold and strong and always majestic personality vs .her sentimentally vulnerable images - and also effectively reinforce the moments of gripping horrors of the events witnessed or felt. The sounds do have an interesting mix. Some of the scenes really deliver visual cinematic effects that remind me of the paintings of the period. The somber settings work beautifully to support and give intensity to the horrifying scenes and moments. Just love the way the sets and backgrounds are crafted to avoid overshadowing the characters. Oh yes, I love the color schemes presented in this movie to bring credibility to the scenes! The naval battle and Sir Walters' underwater escapade are so fabulously and stunningly crafted - without going over-the-board with extreme flashy special effects and colors to highlight the events.I was captivated from beginning to end. Oh yes, this film does entertain, sending me on a delightfully exciting spell-bound journey in my attempt to separate legend and myths from historical facts. Oh yes, this film will make English history fun to browse all over again. Yep, I was absolutely entertained!!!",9.0,Anonymous,History

A tale of obsession and infatuation - and that's just the director...,"I am somewhat baffled by this movie.On the face of it, this is an immensely powerful, beautifully shot and splendidly acted follow-up to the excellent 'Elizabeth', featuring a cast to die for, a top-notch script and a wardrobe of enormous expense.Never mind that it 'plays fast and loose with history', or that it feels like a Tudor Braveheart - I can put up with such minor irritants for the sake of a good yarn.Yet somewhere along the line, this movie becomes deeply unsatisfying. Perhaps even unsettling. If I had to put my finger on it, I'd say that the director has simply gotten carried away - he has immersed himself so much in the subject that the result is a work of obsession - and that always sits uncomfortably.We are, therefore, treated to a movie that (hopefully) inadvertently proclaims that Protestants are good and god-favoured, whereas Catholics are a bad lot generally. That the English are a grand bunch of people, while the Spanish are vile and evil. That absolute monarchy and divine right are the only way to really run the town, so long as the monarch in question is virtuous, English and Protestant.Of course, all of these things are fine and well for the story itself; the misfortune is that Kapur broadcasts these ideas through the film as his message to the audience.It perhaps doesn't help that Philip of Spain is portrayed as a demented dancing dwarf with Tourette's Syndrome.I'm going to watch this movie again at some point, but I have to say that it is, I think, a glorious Ozymandine failure.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Ambitious period film.,"I hadn't heard too much about this film, but had seen the posters for it, so I gave it a shot. And after leaving the theatre I really wasn't sure what to say about it.There's a lot of good stuff in this film, but there're some pitfalls as well. On the plus side the sets and costumes are magnificent. A great deal of care and love when into the art direction to bring us an Elizabethan renaissance film, replete with court intrigue and foreign emissaries who threaten invasion because of high seas thievery courtesy Clive Owen's character. Visually this film is very lush and impressive, though somewhat confining at times. We're never really shown Elizabethan England, just the ""important parts"" that are salient to the story.And, as Elizabeth's favorite playwright would say, ""there's the rub"". And by this I mean that the film is a bit all over the place. It's a costume drama, it's a romance, it's a period political thriller, it's a military epic, and so forth. It even skids the fantasy genre with some of the fancy camera work that was done. But, all in all, the film's primary thrust is to try and grab hold of all of these genres, and tie them together into some kind of cohesive and suscint manner.The romance, the intrigue, the sisterly emotions, the rivalry between matriarchs, and the ""battle scene"" hearken back to a time when Hollywood used to crank out these kinds of movies with some regularity. But the context between those films and ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" are nearly day and night, even though both are striving for a high water mark in historical drama.I thought ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" was technically a competent production. In fact, given the difficulties there must have been getting some of the shots I'll give it high marks as a pure production effort. But as a film I simply found it to be a touch too ambitious, and over-indulgent near the end.That's not to say that I didn't enjoy a lot of the film, because I did. Blanchet's Elizabeth is a strong woman; full of zest, energy, and a bit of anger, which she levels at her adversaries. But she's also a chief of state, internationalist, and, of course, the queen of England. She doesn't wear several hats. She wears a crown. But even so, and this is where the film falls a bit short, she doesn't demonstrate a cohesive ability to command all. She shows she's in charge, but doesn't act like she's in charge until near the end.The film was geared and aimed at a female audience (a thing which I had not expected), and so a lot of the energy is directed at that audience, with the appropriate emotional flourishes. Combined with some so-so CGI for the action sequences (and a horse with a perm which almost had me laughing), one wonders where the film was headed. Elizabeth didn't save England with her emotional power alone, and yet this is the gist of the film. It's a real let down in this regard.The film is a mixed blessing. There's a lot of decent acting, and some exceptional performances by the leads. Married to a rather extravagant art director to bring to life palace, throne room, chambers, and galleons at sea, and one can easily see that this was meant to be a top notch production. But some of the logical loopholes where Blanchet's character is concerned conspire with some of the story loopholes to hold back a better film.As a guy all I can say is that it's not something I'd watch again, and I'm not too sure I'd recommend it to any female audiences. But, if you don't mind your period dramas skirting the edge of high kamp, then splurge on a ticket, and see what ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is all about.",,Anonymous,History
An improvement overall on the first one,"This one is better then the first one. Everything about it is just a bit better. The acting is better overall as you don't have as much overacting or bad actors. The settings are more expensive and more impressive. There are more rooms and they are decorated better. You also have a few outdoor scenes and battles making this feel more historical. The first one was largely a romance this one feels more nationalistic and historical. There is also a better connection between scenes. In the first one you would have scenes set all over the place with people who didn't even meet each other. Here there is a stroke of plot genius, the sailor who has been to America plays 4 different roles in one. So whatever he does feels connected. This is what the first one needed people meeting each other and reacting to each other. Here this sailor connects Elizabeth's romance life, her female friends, the war vs. Spain and the uncovering of the American continent. He is a lead in a movie really lacking someone who can do more than just stay in her castle and shout at people. You actually see a lead do something and be active. A queen can't really go into battle, get someone pregnant or be put in prison. We do live through him here and without him the movie would be a bore.Of course it's also not that historically accurate either which is really the main issue with these 2 movies besides them actually not being as interesting to watch as they should have been. The timeline is all scrambled up. The sailor, Walter Raleigh, tells the queen he founded Virginia, yet in real life he hadn't even been to America and Virginia was founded after her death. His son was born in 1592 Elizabeth would have been 59 and not some potential suitor. People aged very fast back then. 59 is an age where you have survived several serious illnesses. She would have looked like an old sick lady. Actually, since her smallpox in 1562 I assume she would have looked sick and unattractive. Since the movie is set in 1585 forward it's clear how she should have looked then. But all of this is not as glaring as in the first movie where it feels like they didn't really care about historical accuracy. Here it seems like the history is just all pushed into one single year. Several characters are a combination of 3 characters in one and the conspiracies are all changed. There are even invented names here to replace real historical figures. It's for sure a mess. But all scenes feel historical. Everything here happened just at another point in time and often with different people.Still, overall plot wise it doesn't really shine. Just like the first one it's just okay. But the sets and historical recreations are very fun and shine extra bright in the sequel as there is just a touch of CGI and painted backgrounds making it look a bit bigger and more expensive. It's still not really what I want a historical movie to be and I will forget this after some time. I do think it was smart to make her 30 years younger and combine 40 years of history into one year. At least for the plot this worked wonders. I you think the first one was fine you can check this one out. But it's not all that super exciting. The history is just cool.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The woman and the queen,"With a view clearly centered on the woman behind the figure of the queen, ""Elizabeth"" is a passionate portrait of the XVI century. The court, the costumes, the social hierarchy and procedures are thoroughly depicted showing both the richness and darkness of the time.The queen (Cate Blanchett) is the main character, showed intimately, almost striped before our eyes. She starts as a monarch and with the pose one would expect from her. And yet soon we see that there is something more to that persona: the loneliness, the sense of duty with the lack of freedom it implies, the desire to love and simply be loved in return; to be loved by what she really his and only that.As she lowers her defenses and allows Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), a charming pirate with news of a world she has never seen, to come close, we could almost say she was only a woman during that time; no title, no obligations, pure will to be what she feels like. However the intrigue around the crown rushes in, the plot thickens, and the woman is set aside, giving room for the queen. It is after this, when it comes to the end of the movie, that something changes. Our intimate view of her character is lost and instead there seem's to be a little twist, as the overall feeling of the movie changes to that of an epic. In the final shots there's almost a deification of her and it's hard to believe it. And most of all it's less interesting because the woman behind the ""queen"" is more captivating than the idea of the ""queen"".",7.0,Anonymous,History
Good enough to see it,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" (2007) is a bit of a mixed bag, but at the end of the day i would call it more positive bag. I found this movie to be not particularly involving, but looking so good that i would recommend it to see it once. Orr maybe two times like i did.Best qualities of this movie are acting, costumes and set design. Acting is superb, but as it should be considering performers this good. Story was good but its the storytelling and screenplay that made this movie just OK when it could have been great. Yet at the end of the day there is one reason to see this movie, and this reason is Cate Blanchett - best living actress we have got.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Flawed, but actually one of the better follow up movies to anything I've seen","I absolutely loved the first film, and do think if it was released at a different year to Shakespeare in Love(though that is still a good film), it would've got the accolades it deserved. The Golden Age is definitely not as good as its predecessor, it is very loosely based on fact, and the direction wasn't always rock solid. However, there are a number of things that do fully compensate. The film did look absolutely exquisite, just like the first film did, with the breathtaking scenery, stunning photography and sumptuous costumes. Just look at the dresses Cate Blanchett wears in the film, they were just wondrous. The screenplay is quite extraordinarily crafted, and the performances were superb. Cate Blanchett, though Elizabeth does look a little more youthful than I expected her to be, was simply mesmerising in the title role, and Geoffrey Rush(an example of an actor who rarely disappoints in anything he's in) and Clive Owen both give rock solid performances. And the music was absolutely beautiful. The film was in conclusion to this review, just beautiful to watch, and save the flaws, is almost as good as the first film. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,History
Elizabeth & Walter,"A grandiose plod through just three years (1585-88) of the reign of Elizabeth I, when in her early fifties she was still relatively young and fit enough still to be played by Cate Blanchett.Riddled with inaccuracies from beginning to end (Walsingham is depicted on his death bed just after the defeat of the Armada when he actually died ten years later; and did Elizabeth I really wear armour when she addressed her fleet at Tilbury?). But it sure looks good, especially Ms Blanchett in a variety of ginger wigs and killer outfits against the backdrop of various stately homes.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Cate Blanchett is wonderful,"This movie approaches the brink of becoming another corny, hokey Hollywood travesty but recovers to become an incredibly powerful and unique portrayal of Elizabeth I and her closest advisers and the political situation in Western Europe in the late 16th century. Cate Blanchett offers a masterful, powerful and provocative portrayal of the Virgin Queen which unlike most Hollywood portrayals of historical personages does not devolve into a laughable caricature. Elizabeth has feelings too and cares about ALL of her people, not just those who are of her religious persuasion. Also, the movie offers a credible portrayal of Elizabeth's relationship with her cousin Mary as well as a credible and comprehensible explanation of King Philip's decision to go to war against England. Whether Spain in 1585 was the most powerful country in the world as the movie purports is a matter for debate but the fact that there was a time in history when Spain actually wanted to invade England is amazing and is a story in itself. This movie is worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Nicely entertaining movie... but..,"Great performances by Blanchet for sure and also a entertaining contribution by Owen and clear a wonderful description of that part of the Queen's life with all her sorrows and problems she faces, trying to rule the country at best. But first shocking phrase by the Queen when she said ""Turkey has a sultan"" ... err... since when does Turkey exists again? Maybe Mr Kapur should read his history books again about the great Ottoman empire. At the end of the story when the Queen wants to bless the new born baby we see a nice round globe behind her with the exact world map on it.. is that not a product of the 20th century? At that time the great explorers (Magellan / V. De Gama) were still busy discovering the world and drawing maps. That piece does not belong there.

Propaganda,"I think this film is quite awful, clearly fictional. They depict Elizabeth as a freedom and human rights lover. In fact, she made a law by which every single catholic priest in England had to be tortured and hanged. The UK still has problems of protestants vs catholics. Most of these problems were started by this queen. She wasn't a warrior queen either. It is also clearly anti-Spanish, not only on historical data but also inaccurate and misleading with respect to personality, details and physical appearance of the characters in the Spanish court. Philip II is not only distorted and manipulated at the level of historical facts, but also used as an excuse to, once again, assert themselves and the world that the Spanish are evil, dark, with black wigs and and coal black eyes. Philip II, a XVI century gentleman with blue eyes and red hair is depicted as a dark haired illiterate maniac. All of this film is no more than the perfect occasion to distort and manipulate the reality. Bringing forth the truth as a lie and the lie as truth. It should not be called historical film but propaganda film.",1.0,Anonymous,History

"Disappointingly daft and clichéd but features a rich, fascinating performance from Blanchett","""The Virgin Queen"", Queen Elizabeth I, arguably the greatest monarchial leader England has ever seen, has received the royal treatment when it comes to the cinema. She has been played by an abundantly wide plethora of actresses, both old and young, and has garnered more than a few awards and nominations for those actresses. Arguably the greatest incarnation of the queen, though, and also probably the best film about the monarch, is 1998's Elizabeth, which was unfairly overshadowed by the vastly inferior and overrated Shakespeare in Love due to both films being set in the same time period and featuring a virtually identical cast of actors. But while Shakespeare in Love was light, fluffy, and almost irritatingly cutesy, Elizabeth was a far darker, grander, broodier incarnation of 16th century England, and featured a performance that should have gotten Cate Blanchett her first Academy Award were it not for Miramax's relentless promotion of Shakespeare In Love and the eventual (and undeserved) victory Gwyneth Paltrow of that very film scored in the category. With The Golden Age, the cast and crew were given a rare chance: A chance to re-tread the brilliant ground without the pressures of an all-too-similar parallel film. And unfortunately, for the most part, they missed that chance.While the first Elizabeth film served as a wondrous combination between dramatization of a fascinating period in England's history, deliciously lavish production design, and an intense, amazingly dedicated character study on Cate Blanchett's part as she dubiously explores every possible nook and cranny of the mysterious Virgin Queen. The sequel gains much by retaining high quality in the latter two categories, but suffers miserably from severe drawbacks in the first and arguably most important category.The film easily confuses epic and heroics with clichés, and is weighed down by an overwrought script not much above cheap daytime television melodrama in terms of the plot events. All would be forgiven had these elements been even remotely rooted in historical fact, but in reality the filmmakers took uncanny liberties and unabashedly replaced historical fact with melodramatic romance and epic fantasy action. Is she with child without royal consent? Would Sir Walter Raleigh have ever possibly swing heroically from ropes off of burning ships, dramatically brandishing his sword? Did Queen Elizabeth really ride horseback out to give her army a pep talk, even though we don't even see any of these soldiers in action when the day is done? Does it even matter than in 1585, when the film is set, Elizabeth was over 50 while Raleigh was barely 30, thus rendering their imaginary romance conceived especially for this film quite unrealistic? Indeed probably the biggest drawback to the film's replacing fact with melodramatic fantasy-fiction is that in most of the cases, it is totally unnecessary and barely felt. The film shifts gear from lavish costume drama to epic sea battle action for probably no more than five minutes before hastily returning to form. The Armada battle is over so quickly one barely even has time to notice Raleigh's exaggerated swashbuckling heroics.That said, the film does have two slightly more successful fields, first and foremost its lavish look. Costume dramas traditionally exceed in the production, set and costume design fields, but the costumes Queen Elizabeth wears alone are sure to win awards. Such meticulous detail is put into designing every last frill and tapestry, that the film is undeniably a true work of design mastery, much like the first film. The cinematography is also more than complementary of the look and direction the film obviously was aiming at, drenching almost every scene with very dim but harsh glows, leaving many blacks and shadows, perhaps in order to emulate Elizabeth's state of mind. The country is prospering, but the Queen is forever torn inside.And indeed the film more than excels in that final category, regarding the character study of Queen Elizabeth. And for that I give most of the credit to Miss Blanchett. It's impossible to deny it: Cate Blanchett is indisputably one of today's very best and most prominent leading actresses, and in recent years in particular she has more than excelled in delivering fascinatingly multi-layered and expertly acted roles in every genre possible. Blanchett is no stranger to playing real-life people: Aside from already playing Queen Elizabeth I in the 1998 film, she has also channeled Veronica Guerin, Katharine Hepburn, and Bob Dylan. But with Queen Elizabeth, Blanchett gets to do something very special: Since the character comes from a time before the media era, there is essentially nothing for Blanchett to imitate and to base her performance on. Thus, she is forced to (and succeeds admirably in) finding the character within Queen Elizabeth on her own. She plays her with a wonderfully entertaining combination of authoritarian matriarch and playful, mischievous teenager. Cate delivers a truly powerhouse performance in the film, and her performance is easily the best aspect of it. Just watch how broken she is as she mourns the treachery of her own sister, Mary Queen of Scots, expertly played by Samantha Morton and also the only of the film's plot points that was actually remotely interesting to watch unfold.I was greatly looking forward to this film; the historical costume drama is a consistently reliable genre, and the concept of the combination of epic swashbuckling action-adventure with the dramatic depiction of Elizabeth's reign, as well as the notion of Blanchett returning to arguably her greatest film role, got me perhaps a little over-excited for this release, which made the poor reviews and subsequent box office performance even more disappointing than I would have expected. The film indeed suffered from some inconsolable plot weaknesses, but does feature exquisitely lavish production design and an expertly poignant, rounded and fantastically intense performance from the always great Cate Blanchett, and that's enough to make it even somewhat worth a look.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Much better than the first,"I enjoyed this movie more than it's predecessor, the characters had more depth and the storyline was less confusing. The costume and set design are magnificent, the queens outfits are perfectly outlandish. The acting itself was quite good, Blanchett playing the older and more wisen queen, but Clive Owen kind of stole the show. Overall a decent movie chronicling the latter years of Elizabeth's reign.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Solid but not as good as the first,"I'm thinking that quite a few liberties were taken with this film. It's Hollywood though, so what do you expect? Cate Blanchett ends up the best looking 52 year old queen ever portrayed on the big screen. I didn't realize this until the end though, so as with all the other historical details, I remained blissfully ignorant coming into the theater. Though I had just recently seen Elizabeth, and enjoyed it, and I've been known to go see just about any sequel. No regrets here, but it wasn't as good as the first and won't be considered for even 10% as many top 10 lists.This film merely jumps to a later part of the queen's life and focuses on her relationship with adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and the looming threat of the Spanish Armada. There is of course the unending issue of religion and threats of assassination to make the queen's cousin, Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton), into God's chosen queen. Elizabeth still benefits from the wisdom of close adviser Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush, the only other notable returning character from the first film besides the queen). The size of the Spanish army does not intimidate the queen, and she will not back down from any challenge. She is getting rather tired of the search for a man though. When an appealing fellow like Clive Owen announces he's named a newly discovered colony Virginia in your honor, well, that's kind of rubbing it in your face, isn't it? The production design in a movie like this has no choice but to be good, to both eclipse the original and give this movie its own buzz. No disappointments there. I also liked the story, but most of the performances were by the book. You know what to expect from an historical tale such as this. The only standout performance is from Blanchett. As a queen she is supremely confident and says whatever she wants to. The book of stock English historical characters for BBC productions and stage work doesn't include anything as entertaining as she was here. The camera work is a mixed bag. Some shots that give you the perspective of an outsider looking in are really interesting, but then you have your fair share of pointless, excessive glamour shots, mostly of the queen in bright light trying to look like a queen, maybe even looking directly into the camera. One of her holding a friend's baby comes to mind.",7.0,Anonymous,History

I predict that she will be nominated for, and win, Best Actress in the next round of Oscars.This movie is gorgeous. Everything was stunning, from the settings and cinematography to the costumes. It's a visual feast as well as a compelling drama.Although the script does deviate from historical reality in--for example-- its representation of Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Francis Drake does appear during (and before) the Armada.

I guess anything to get most women crying over a love story! The bad guy/good queen thing was overplayed and it was funny to see the King of Spain walking in abbeys in small steps as if he's just be castrated was ridiculous.Finally, one could see the addition of the role the Ottoman navy played in distracting the Spanish but I guess then we couldn't see the little hysterical queen going insane about her manlessness.All said, very nicely shot and Cate Blanchett does a good job.

I am Myself,"Greetings again from the darkness. Not in the class of 1998's first segment, Cate Blanchett is still a wonder as the virgin Queen. Here she displays much more vulnerability and emotion than in the first, but her weaknesses are a bit too heavy handed. Director Shekhar Kapur is back at the helm, though for some reason he has only made one other film (Four Feathers) since the 1998 Elizabeth.Clive Owen plays swashbuckling Sir Walter Raleigh who charms his way into the Queen's inner circle and more than charms Abbie Cornish (A Good Year), the Queen's personal favorite of her court. Owen adds a bit a cartoonish feel to the film and is definitely shown to be the hero of the holy war. Geoffrey Rush is back as Elizabeth's adviser and he is given a sub-plot with his brother so that he doesn't spend the entire two hours just bowing to Blanchett. The whole Mary Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton) story is presented very awkwardly, but the beheading was actually beautifully filmed. Adding to the cartoonish feel was the manner in which Jordi Molla portrays King Philip II of Spain ... very odd.This one manages to cling to epic status through amazing sets, incredibly wonderful wardrobe and a terrific score.

"Enjoy All The Visual Treats & Acting, And Don't Worry About The Rest","If you're thinking about viewing this film, don't let all the naysayers discourage you. If you enjoy great acting performances, stunning direction and cinematography and more (sets, costumes, etc.) you should be entertained for most of the two hours. The story was pretty interesting, too. I was amazed to look at the user-comments afterward and see all the complaints, nitpicking nonsense like ""the music is intrusive."" The score, like the production values, is just fine.It's tough to beat a foursome like Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Clive Owen and Samantha Morton for good acting but - for me, just like another DVD released this week (""The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford""), the star of the film was the photographer. In this case it is Remi Adefarasin. Between his camera-work, the direction of Shekhar Kapur, and the production design by Guy Dyas, this film is a series of pure visual treats.I'm not one who usually pays much attention to costuming but Queen Elizabeth's attire in this movie is spectacular. A nod to the great costume design efforts of Alexandra Byrne.Some people complain Elizabeth isn't portrayed as a strong-enough woman in this movie. I'll use a British response for that: ""rubbish."" Not only is she strong, she is shown as human - not some cold-blooded machine, but as someone with feelings like the rest of us. All her emotions - and I mean all - are on display along with inspiring leadership of her country, with the latter's welfare her number one priority.Rush is ""Sir Francis Walsingham"" and Morton plays ""Mary, Queen of Scots."" Their roles were smaller than I would like to have seen but both are riveting each time they are on screen, especially Morton. Owen, as the masculine and Errol Flynn-like ""Sir Walter Raleigh,"" also is fun to watch. Abbie Cornish provided eye candy as ""Bess Thorckmorton.""On the negative side, I agree with the criticism that the filmmakers concentrated so heavily on the great costumes, sets and visuals, they didn't give the characters an equal representation. Also, the ending battle scenes were rushed and it wasn't really shown clearly how the Armada was defeated.If I was Roman Catholic (I am not), I might be a little offended at this film. The Catholics, as shown here - the ones from King Philip II of Spain of the 1500s - are shown as ridiculously bloodthirsty and hypocritical to their faith. The writers make sure to show anyone with a cross, rosary beads or any other Christian symbol as a evil, despicable person. It was way overdone. On the Protestant side, it wasn't flattering, speaking as an evangelical, seeing ""The Protestant Queen"" shown as a true believer of some astrologer/ soothsayer (which is anti-Biblical) but was never seen consulting any minister (cleric). For advice, Christians seek God and/or His written word and pastors, not ""the stars."" That is so Hollywood to give that such revered credence.However, overall, being someone enamored with cinematography, I had few complaints with this movie and felt I received my money's worth of entertainment. In fact, it inspires me to check out the 1999 film of the ""Elizabeth"" which, somehow, I never saw. I assume that will be high quality, as well.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Biggest cinema disappointment so far this year,"Cate Blanchett's acting in the central role is as spectacular as in the first film, but she, (and everyone else involved), is totally let down by the writers of the script. The whole film plods along as, in popular history, the Spanish galleons allegedly did in the Armada of 1588 itself; top-heavy, over-manned and extremely sluggish in covering the ocean. Recent naval historians have revised such views and, while the film contains numerous other pieces of historical tosh, (Sir Francis Drake and Raleigh virtually sharing the command of the English fleet against the Armada??? I don't think so!), this was also abundantly true of the original film, ""Elizabeth"". The crucial difference, though, was that the original film had pace, humour, terrific insight into the nature of power and, simply, thrills, which made one more than ready to suspend disbelief and be swept along by the action as it unfolded. Although the latter film looks very good, (the costume department having done an especially fine job and the photography being on a par overall with the first film as well), there is just not the pace or human interest in it to sustain the attention of the audience over nearly two hours, (as testified to by the fact that this was the first film in 2007 which I had seen in a cinema in which more than one party walked out before the end!) As I say, a terrific disappointment, leaving one wishing the writers, (considering all of the assets they had their disposal, not least the massive talents of Ms. Blanchett), could meet the fate of those unfortunates who come under Walsingham's power in both films! The protracted scene in the original ""Elizabeth"" where the plotters against her throne are arrested or otherwise dealt with to a background of achingly beautiful choral music was said to have been inspired by a similar scene in ""The Godfather"". Seeing ""Elizabeth - the Golden Age"" reminds one how ""The Godfather"" was also very rare indeed in having a sequel which at least matched the original film. If a third ""Elizabeth"" is planned for future years, (the Essex rebellion and Elizabeth's final years?), the producers will need to consider very carefully what went wrong this time and not repeat it.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Elizabeth:  Die Hard With a Vengeance,"This rates as high as it does for me because of the cinematography. It is dazzling and Blanchett can't be denied, but ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is like a chick-flick with explosions plus costumes, super hair, and loud, intrusive music. The result is faux epic.My wife summed it up well as we left the theater: ""I feel like I've just flipped through a coffee table picture book for two hours and somebody turned up the stereo."" History wrote this plot but Nicholson and Hirst thought they could do better. They couldn't, or certainly didn't. Freshmen composition classes come up with better stuff. Trite, forced, predictable. Did they even run this by an expert in English history? You gotta wonder. The script is oozing with 21st century mores and clichés. It made me think (during the movie, mind you) of the way Dutch painters depicted Homer and Aristotle in the garb of 17th century Holland. Are we that dumb? Sir Walter Raleigh is a caricature and Sir Francis Drake, never properly introduced, was a throwaway. Geoffrey Rush is wasted as Walsingham. Come to think of it, nearly everybody is wasted. Every single character is underdeveloped, with the possible exception of the title characterpossible exception.""Golden Age"" set the target high and then turned and fired in the opposite direction. Realizing the script had missed, Director tried to make up for it with window dressing. Substance would have served this queen better. With the colon in the title, I almost expected to see Bruce Willis saving the day.You can see why ""Golden Age"" came out in October because it's not going to compete for Oscars in categories that anybody cares about.

Elizabeth: Hardly Golden,"First of all, let me say that I, like many others, walked into this thinking there was no way that it could be anything but brilliant. I gave an enormous cheer when I heard a sequel was planned; fantastic cast, fascinating director, good storyline, and a sure hit. I knew that it wouldn't be historically accurate as the first wasn't, but I see this as a FILM not a documentary, and do not worry too much about that.However I, like countless others, ended up slightly disappointed.If you could separate various aspects of the film, individually they would succeed. The score is almost deserving of a modern classic concert; it is sumptuous when on its own, but it tended to be incredibly over dramatic at many of the wrong moments, and drowned out some potentially fantastic speeches (eg when Elizabeth screams at the retreating Spanish Embassy). It also ruined several moments (such as Elizabeth's silent walk on the hill, looking out over the Armada) which were beautiful enough without it.The writing wasn't brilliant; it covered too little in too long a time. Granted, they would have spoken in the way they did in the film, but there were many unnecessary moments that weren't entirely relevant to the plot. The result was simply too long.On the other hand, some of the casting and acting was brilliant. Cate Blanchett, of course, excelled once again as Elizabeth. In all rights she deserves an Academy Award Nomination at the very least. Abbie Cornish, Clive Owen and Geoffrey Rush were also very good; Samantha Morton was fantastic, even though her part was underwritten. My only casting misgiving was Jordi Molla as Philip of Spain. It was clear from his very walk and manner that he is an actor best suited to comedy (see Bad Boys II), and I think he totally ruined the part. His scenes became slightly tedious as a result, and this broke into the backbone of the plot. A more serious and refined Spanish actor would have been better IMO; Molla is good in other things.The cinematography was good, and interesting. I loved the water scenes, and was amused by the horse in the water sequences; the final scene was visually fascinating, as the camera wheeled round the glorified Elizabeth, but I HATED the moment when she looked into the camera; that broke the reality barrier in the last few seconds in the film, and made me feel... for want of a better word: miffed.Anyway, whilst a little disappointed, it was quite interesting. I shall buy the DVD and watch it again, and see if my mind has changed!",7.0,Anonymous,History

Geoffrey RUSH, reprise his part as well as, he was in the previous film. Clive OWEN, a newcomer in this adventure, is very seductive, Samantha MORTON, plays an heartbreaking ""Queen of Scots"" and Abbie CORNISH is pretty good in her character too.

"Cate Blanchett is still great, but the movie is not so much","It's 1585. An older Queen Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) navigates royal court intrigue and international affairs. Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) is the new man in her life with years of raiding Spanish gold. Spain is preparing to invade with its Armada, and Elizabeth is threatened by hidden dangers.Cate Blanchett returns to play an older Elizabeth from her amazing turn in 'Elizabeth' (1998). She has taken on the personality of the Queen. She has the presence of royalty. The story isn't as compelling as the earlier movie. It doesn't have the same intensity. It's more about the costumes and less about the drama. The Spanish Armada could have been a great counter supplying the movie with much needed action. There is far too little of it, and most of it end up being less than exciting. Cate Blanchett is still great but the movie isn't as great as the actress.",6.0,Anonymous,History
I Laughed -- I Cried -- I Cheered For Blanco The Wonder Horse!!!,"Magnificent, lavish, stunning -- all these words apply. They apply to Cate Blanchett's looks, her talent, her sheer overwhelming allure as Elizabeth, the Golden Queen of England's Golden Age. Unfortunately, the movie itself does not quite live up to the limitless beauty, artistry and sheer animal fascination of Cate the Great.Elizabeth was always decisive, dramatic, and intelligent, but this movie wanders in a daze from dark, dank, chilly looking rooms where nasty people mumble about plots and murder, to lavish and almost comically inappropriate love scenes, to huge phony looking vistas of stormy seas and galloping horses, and then back to more torture, more mumbling, and more incoherent emotional fireworks.Cate Blanchett, not yet forty, is so stunning in every frame it seems laughable to see her grapple with Elizabeth's fear of old age and decay. Clive Owen is actually pretty good as Sir Walter Raleigh, a stud who knows he's got what it takes and sort of lazily enjoys himself, in a laid back, Nicolas Cage sort of way. And newcomer Abbie Cornish is, to put it mildly, yummy. Picture Kate Winslet only sexier!!! As long as it's just heated whispers between these three, the movie manages well enough. It's sort of a dry-humping menage with fabulous costumes and endless closeups of the architecture. You'll cry when you see how much the lush and beautiful Elizabeth longs for one last night of pleasure, only to see her innocent (but ripe and desirable) young lady in waiting steal away the rugged man of her dreams. But after an hour you start to wonder, is this ALL we're going to see?Cut away to Samantha Morton, stranded in a bleak castle and forced to play the alluring, sensual, and irresistible Mary Queen of Scots as some sort of gibbering lunatic. With an accent somewhere between Braveheart and Trainspotting. I kept waiting for her to say, ""hoot, mon! Ye canna be killin' the likes of me!"" The real Mary spoke French, by the way. She was funnier, prettier, had nicer manners, and washed more often.But in this movie, Mary is not helpless and sweet, she's crazy and evil. I mean, eeeevil!! Once she turns loose her flying monkeys -- sorry, I meant her fanatical assassins -- you'll thrill to the most electrifying intrigue ever filmed. Or not. Actually, the assassination in the church scores big points as comedy, as the trembling teenage assassin apparently falls into some sort of hypnotic trance the moment he catches his first glimpse of Cate Blanchett's ghostly white face. Just what is supposed to be happening here? Was Elizabeth a psychic who could hypnotize her enemies and turn weak-minded boys into sex slaves? I kept waiting for her to say, ""you are getting sleepy . . . sleepy . . . no, not the audience, just you with the pistol!"" This scene felt like it went on for three hours and when it was over I still couldn't figure out why the young man didn't pull the trigger. Then a few scenes later Walsingham mumbles that it ""wasn't loaded."" Well, that clears things right up for me. Thanks! Not to interrupt, but Nicholson and Hirst, the two screenwriters for this thing, must have been doing a pretty heavy drug regimen to keep their minds limber, just like Jeff Lebowski in THE BIG LEBOWSKI.But the problems don't stop with a script clearly written by stoned or drunk men. When the big battle scenes come at the end, Shekha Khapur demonstrates clearly that he is absolutely tone-deaf to the visual music of film. He can't manage to put together more than two minutes of real action footage, without cutting away to the most laughable and inexplicable junk ever filmed.You'll thrill to the heroism of Sir Walter Raleigh, diving from his blazing fire ship and ""aiming to find bottom"" just like Huckleberry Finn after a steamboat crash. Then you'll giggle like a madman at the sight of Elizabeth wandering through her empty tent with a dazed look on her face, like the heroine of a romance novel waiting for a hot date. (Where were the dozens of soldiers, nobles, and aides?) You'll cheer for Blanco The Wonder Horse -- a white stallion who, for no reason at all, is shown diving from a sinking galleon and swimming to safety. What does it say about a movie when an uncredited animal who contributes nothing to the plot steals the climax of the picture? Then you'll giggle like a madman again as we cut to meaningless shots of lightning, praying monks, and a twitching Philip of Spain realizing he's made a terrible mistake. I guess that lightning really got to him.Finally, the whole Armada sequence finishes up with jaw-dropping non sequiturs, as Elizabeth, for no apparent reason, sheds her armor and wanders out into the night in her lovely nightie, to stand on the shore alone and take deep breaths and close her eyes in orgiastic pleasure at the sight of hundreds of burning Spanish galleons in the distance. Right, it makes perfect sense. Frankly, I was waiting for Blanco The Wonder Horse to swim ashore and make love to her all night long.The real problem with this film is that it pays lip-service to the idea of a liberated, strong, assertive Elizabeth, but the only language the director speaks fluently is that of Gothic romance. So even when Elizabeth is celebrating her greatest victory, she has to be shown in a super-feminine posture. She's alone, in a sexy white bed gown, on a windswept cliff, looking as if she's a nubile young maiden aching with desire for Blanco The Wonder Horse.Cate Blanchett deserves better than this. Elizabeth deserves better than this. Even Blanco The Wonder Horse deserves better than this!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Disappointing 'sequel',"Historical drama charting Elizabeth's conflict with Spain leading up to the Spanish Armada.A stellar cast including the brilliant Geoffrey Rush, but far from his finest role. Instead, Cate Blanchett owns the film and delivers a strong performance.Unfortunately the script is not great and it's all rather slow and unengaging. The Armada invasion ought to have been much more exciting than it was. The original 'Elizabeth' with Cate Blanchett was much more interesting.

Not as grandeur as it's predecessor but still the film entertains!!,"Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a biographical period drama film directed by Shekhar Kapur and stars Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Clive Owen, Jordi Mollà, Abbie Cornish, and Samantha Morton.The film is sequel to 1998 film Elizabeth also directed by Shekhar Kapur and depicts her tenure where the Spain launches an attack on England and the rise of England politically and financially.The film might not be as grandeur as it's predecessor but still the film has all the ingredients to be an interesting film, the only drawback which I felt was that unnecessarily more time was wasted on the love angle and the same could've avoided and more focus should be on the the rise of England.Acting is superb and Cate Blanchett was again as impressive as the previous film, Geoffrey Rush was equally impressive and myself would've loved to seen him a little more on-screen. In my opinion the end of his character deserves a little better farewell in the film. Clive Owen was impressive and looked perfectly suitable for his character.Screenplay of the film is decent and goes slow in between but comes back on the track quickly, the climax of the film is good but could've been more detailed and better.

"Another triumph for Cate Blanchett, but the film does not entirely make it","This is a sequel, by the same director (Shekhar Kapur), to ELIZABETH (1998), both dealing with Queen Elizabeth I of England at successive periods of her life. (The last period of her life, 1588-1603, still awaits a final sequel.) This film is not as successful as its predecessor, but the central performance by Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth is if anything even more amazing, glorious, and breath-taking this time around. The costumes by Alexandra Byrne and the wigs and hair styling are all Oscar-worthy, some of the best ever seen on screen. A great deal of trouble was taken to find locations, and as the original palaces do not survive, three cathedrals (Ely, Winchester, and Westminster) were used as palace-substitutes, along with a lot of historical mansions. (The use of the ancient coastal chapel at Rame Head, one of my favourite places in Cornwall, is not credited.) Although the use of carved stone cathedrals with unadorned walls is not accurate, for the palaces would have been hung with rich tapestries, the substitute settings do create an eerie and somewhat bleak atmosphere which adds to the film's effectiveness considerably, as if we are watching a Greek tragedy unfold. All of these things are excellent, as are the scenes with Dr. John Dee (played by David Threlfall) acting as the queen's astrologer (though his close association with Walsingham's spying activities is not referred to). But the film goes off the rails somewhat due to the miscasting of the two main male roles. Clive Owen attempts to portray Sir Walter Raleigh (whose name is mis-pronounced in the film, for it should be pronounced 'rawley'), but he is so very much a 21st century person that he just cannot pull this off at all. I am afraid he is not a particularly good historical actor, and he thinks that to be forceful on screen he needs to glare at the Queen with a touch of insolent 'man of the people' swagger. But that is all wrong, so, so wrong. The other casting failure is Geoffrey Rush as the spy chief Sir Francis Walsingham. Rush, unlike Owen, is a very fine actor who is versatile at anything, and he does his usual excellent job, but he just is not right for the part. The real Walsingham was such a sly sophisticate that Rush's gentle and avuncular under-playing of the role is a note so false that, combined with Owen's misjudgements, it throws the film right out of kilter. A number of key historical characters are eliminated as 'non-persons' and do not appear in the film at all, but such simplifications may perhaps be excused, as this is only a single film and you just can't squeeze everybody in. Mary Queen of Scots is brilliantly played by Samantha Morton, and she adds a great deal of poignancy to this film, not least in her marvellously exasperated fit of picque when she is found out as a conspirator and realizes that all of her secret notes have been intercepted by Walsingham. Although the real Mary was a psychopathic murderess who killed her own husband and others besides, Morton's performance, which gives us a tiny bit of sympathy for her, in this context will do nicely. Abbie Cornish is excellent and sensitive as Bess Throgmorton (also spelled Throckmorton). King Philip of Spain is very brilliantly portrayed by Spanish film star Jordi Molla. The film pulls no punches at all about the crazed and bloodthirsty fanaticism of the Spanish Catholics of that age, who were the 16th century equivalent of today's Taliban, lusting to kill anybody and everybody who would not bend the knee to their dogma. The entire story of the Armada is bravely told, and though Sir Francis Drake only gets a brief look-in, never mind, who wants to quibble, as it's only a movie. Early on, as the Armada threat looms, Tilbury Fort is mentioned as a barrier to its advance towards London on the Thames. Alas alack, I have read all the state correspondence about Tilbury Fort. The true situation was far more dire than is hinted. Sir Alexander Temple, hereditary commander of the Fort, and Captain John Smith on the other side of the river at Gravesend, had to fund the only significant defence of London and garrison all the men and provide all the weapons for their forts at their own expense, so broke was the Crown, and they never got their money back. (No wonder Sir Alexander's son James signed the Death warrant of Charles I half a century later, his older brother having also been killed because of another madcap royal miscalculation, the crazy Isle of Rhé Expedition.) The scenes of the Armada, aided by digital technology, are impressive, and convey the danger and conflict very well. I would say that the script was a bit weak, with lapses into modernity for some of the dialogue, and the historical vision (apart from the scenic and design elements, which are first rate) was a bit feeble, even misleading in parts. But then, most historical films about a period as remote as this are worse, so we must not be overly critical. Certainly it would be worth making ten more of these films about Elizabeth just to see Cate Blanchett continue in the part, she is so astounding and convincing. I don't know if young people ever watch films like this, as they have all been so brain-washed by their trendy teachers only to have concern for what is 'relevant to today'. But as the teaching of history in British secondary schools now only amounts to one hour per week, it would seem that films are the only hope left to prevent history disappearing down the drain altogether. Few people under 25 even seem to know who Winston Churchill was, and as for Sir Walter Raleigh, does he do coke; if not, why not?",8.0,Anonymous,History
Fluff and gush,"""Elizabeth, The Golden Age"" is an unbelievable disappointment. If you know anything about what actually happened you'd wonder what you were watching. If you have ever been to Fotheringhay, for example, you would know it is not by a lake in a setting that looks like Scotland.Also Elizabeth's famous speech at Tilbury to her troops leaves out the best part, ""I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain...."" Why? The Armada battle is all-wrong with even the guns looking like they were from the Napoleonic Period.Also Mary Queen of Scots probably had a French accent, as in the Helen Mirren version, as Mary was raised in France.If you want a great scripted film just watch ""The Lion in Winter."" It always astounds me why filmmakers go to such effort with production values but can't get the nuts and bolts right.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Not all that glitters is gold,"A film with the same subject (England's most successful queen), the same leading actress (Cate Blanchett) and the same director (Shekhar Kapur) as the wonderful 1998 work ""Elizabeth"" excites great expectations and, while there are many jewels here, sadly all that glitters is not gold. As with the earlier movie, it looks magnificent, with wonderful locations. sets, and costumes, and the camera work is stunning with clever compositions and remarkable fluidity and angles. Again the acting is particularly fine with Blanchett a tour de force.The focus is narrower in time, beginning in 1585 and climaxing with the defeat of the Spanish Armada three years later in action scenes absent from the first film. The main problem is the script from Michael Hirst & William Nicholson. The narrative is too slow and too confused and some of the lines are somewhat banal, while the attempt to create a romantic storyline between the 'virgin' queen and the adventurer Walter Raleigh (an able Clive Owen) is too contrived and unlikely.",,Anonymous,History
"British pamphlet, but entertaining","Great cast, good photography, but the film depicts the English as all good and the Spanish as evil religious zealots, a caricature of history.

I don't understand the bad reviews....,"This is about as good a film, for watching purposes, as I've seen in a while. Excellent acting, great cinematography, well-flowing editing, and just a pleasure to watch.The dynamic between Elizabeth, Walter Raleigh and Bess is nicely played out, making clear the difficult and unfair position Elizabeth is in as a woman whose only way of truly maintaining power in the eyes of those around her, as much as they try to convince her otherwise, is to not subjugate herself to any man, as much as she wants to be with one for personal reasons. (Unfortunately this is still an issue that is not so far from home.)Again, for ""watching purposes,"" as I say - meaning, for the pure enjoyment of watching a well-made film - this is far better than a lot of the stuff out there, and certainly, in my mind, deserved more attention.

Weirdly fictional from writers I used to trust,"Take some of the most fundamentally important events in European history, employ the most prominent and capable actors from around the world, hire truly talented writers, and throw a decent budget at the whole thing. Oh, and do a little cross marketing with similar current products. What could go wrong? The short answer is: nothing. The longer answer is: you forgot that the movie was supposed to be based on fact. A cursory internet search on e:tga reveals so many bloopers, distortions, lies, and omissions that a person first wonders about the underlying agenda and then is forced to question whether Michael Hirst can be trusted on Tudors and Vikings. Perhaps the most grotesque item on the menu is the portrayal of Elizabeth as ultra tolerant of Catholics. But this has a secondary harm to Americans, who are no longer taught that the First Amendment would never have been conceived of in the absence of Henry 8 and his daughter's actions. We are fed bizarre interpretations of church and state separation by our legal profession, the news media, and, obviously, Hollywood. So, whatever high marks this movie might get for nice production, it loses for hysterical revisionism. Golly, sometimes my cleverness astounds me.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"enjoyable film, but...","This film is entertaining and the acting for the most part is excellent. For a period film, Elizabeth, The Golden Age, is recommended. If the film has any weakness, it would be the acting of Clive Owen. Owen dresses the part and fits the part but he does not carry the part. Owen's lines are delivered cold and without emotion; Owen's acting talent is limited and this film proves it.The costumes in Elizabeth, The Golden Age, deserve a commendation. The accuracy of the historical facts of Elizabeth's reign are fairly accurate but not clearly portray the Elizabeth history knows.Mary is 16 years older than Elizbeth but in this film, it is clearly overlooked. In addition, there is no reference to the pregnancy of Mary which would have played an important part in her life and death under the hands of Elizabeth.The final demise of Mary is clearly misrepresented in this film. Elizabth certainly had no love for Mary and did not have misgivings for her death, Elizabeth did not wish to be attached to the death of Mary and had her secretary handle the event.In conclusion, this film is spinning many stories and the average movie goer should do some reading before viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,History
An imperfect but ultimately rewarding film,"In 1998, director Shekhar Kapur, along with one of Hollywood's most gifted performers, Cate Blanchett, brought new life to one of history's most compelling stories with a surprisingly powerful and entertaining film, ELIZABETH. While stories inspired by history are always going to stir controversy, ELIZABETH found new and creative ways of telling this story through its remarkable visuals and Blanchett's luminous performance. It was a hit with critics, and it landed numerous awards, including a Golden Globe award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, as well as 7 Oscar nominations (Cate Blanchett was also included as a nominee).So how does the second film, ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE hold up? That's a definitely a hard question to answer, especially given the heavy criticisms against the film. Although it doesn't reach the heights of the original movie, the sheer technical brilliance and another spellbinding performance from Blanchett definitely give this sequel a reason to be seen.Technically, THE GOLDEN AGE is every bit as beautiful as the first film. The mind-blowing cinematography and costumes were a sight to behold, and the hauntingly beautiful score was put to great use (the 'assassination' scene and the 'beheading' sequence are still as haunting as they were in 2007).Then, there's Cate Blanchett, returning to the role of Queen Elizabeth, who is now dealing with several new threats to her country and her throne. Her own fears and desires for her own freedom begin to take hold, and Blanchett really succeeds in taking you on that journey.However, therein lies the biggest problem with this sequel. Elizabeth's struggles should have been the main focus of the film. Instead, the film's plotlines often venture into unnecessary territory, and the final battle wasn't nearly as powerful as it could have been. The addition of several new characters was definitely interesting, with Clive Owen as Walter Raleigh, and Samantha Morton as Mary Stuart being the highlights, but their stories felt underdeveloped and sometimes unnecessary. It felt like the writers were trying to cram in way too much into a two-hour movie, which I think was another one of the film's biggest downfalls.Overall, this was a flawed but solid follow-up to ELIZABETH, and even if the convoluted plotlines do prevent it from reaching the heights of that film, it's still worth a look, especially for Cate Blanchett's magnetic performance.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Sorry, but I really did not enjoy this film at all!","I started watching this film in hope that it would be entertaining for a cold February night. The first film was a good watch, despite some of the historical question marks and overplaying of Dudley (not the first, and probably not the last time that this would be done!) As an historian, I have to say that I was very disappointed. Could they not afford Joseph Fiennes for a second movie? Was there any particular reason that one of the key members of court (not to mention Essex, another incredibly influential member of the Elizabethian court)was not included? The Raleigh/Elizabeth 'love story' was really a load of nonsense - is there ever going to be a film about Elizabeth where she is NOT fawning over all the men of her court? Yes, she was human and probably struggled with her feelings, but I suspect that there was more to her life than whether or not she was ever going to marry.As for Mary Queen of Scots, my main upset with this is her accent. She is Queen of Scots, but she was raised in the FRENCH court, and was (briefly) Queen of France before the death of her sickly husband.The film was rather complicated, as those with little or no knowledge of 16th Century British history could easily be lost - many of the characters aren't actually introduced properly, and it took my family some time to work out what exactly was going on. It would have been a much, MUCH better film if they had cut out all of the dramatic, uplifting music and spent more time on the script. As for clichés - my entire family gave up by the point of the horses leaping off the ship (Guinness, anyone?) If you are passionate about history, I would strongly recommend that you AVOID this film, as it will end up frustrating you (and those around you, if you are anything like me - I just have to comment when I'm watching a bad film...)

Its like the director isn't really sure what part of Elizabeth or her history he wants to explore, so it comes across as a little confused. Personally i found the triangle drama rather interesting, not the love aspects of it, so much, but the parts where the Queen lives through her servant (see, the dance scene, for instance). Its most glaring flaw is probably the bad charachstions of the Spanish king and his followers , but really, its not in the forgreound, and you have seen much worse.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A decent whistle-stop historical piece,"I never studied the 'Elizabethan' period at school (choosing instead to get all my knowledge about the era from 'Blackadder II!'), so I'm not entirely sure how accurate the story of - arguably - Britain's most famous queen is, but it certainly ticks off all the major beats from the latter part of her reign (to my limited knowledge, anyway).In some ways it's actually a 'sequel' to Cate Blanchett's first turn as the monarch, however whereas before we saw her rise to power and experiences at being so young and yet so powerful, here we're treated to a far more 'mature' Queen Elizabeth II and the pressure placed on her to find a husband, while at the same time trying to suppress her own (rumoured, so I understand?) desires for Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and the very real threat that the Spanish may well invade soon.Blanchett already proved in the first outing that she's more than capable at portraying the royal in the period and her performance cannot be faulted here either. This is one film where a poor performance from the lead whose shoulders everything rests on can completely ruin the film. Here, as expected, she carries it off with ease and shows how even the most powerful woman of her age had many problems with her personal life and that of generally being a woman.There are plenty of other famous faces in the case - mainly Clive Owen who is at the peak of his rugged charm, but also Geoffrey Rush. Both are excellent and perfectly suit their roles, but this film is Blanchett's baby all the way and she eclipses everyone around her at every turn.Many people who have seen both films seem to think that the first one is better, mainly due to the fact that - apparently - it sticks closer to history and takes less liberties. However, for anyone even vaguely interested in this era of British history could do a lot worse than watch it to get a decent overview of the events of the time. Yes, many are skated over a little and everything seems to happen very quickly, but with a performance like Blanchett's it really should be overlooked. My main gripe was that the budget clearly didn't really stretch to particularly realistic computer-generated special effects during the battle scenes at sea, but if I wanted wall-to-wall special effects, I'd watch a Marvel movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Uncompelling,"I prefer to look at historical films as works unto themselves. This means that I ignore historical inaccuracies--whether real or possible. In part that is because we can only be dependent upon other people´s versions of what happened before us. Every work of history is omissive, so we can never really know ¨the whole truth¨. My disappointment with this film, therefore, has nothing to do with what others may decry as false depictions of history.Instead, I found that the character of Elizabeth ¨The Virgin Queen¨ portrayed through most of this production does not cohere with the conclusion of the work. She is shown to be weak and lacking in self-esteem and resolve for fully three-quarters of the film, making it very difficult to admire or sympathize with her. Even worse, it simply does not make sense that she suddenly becomes a strong woman of determination just so the film can have a triumphant ending.The costumes were great, and I hope to watch the first Elizabeth film at some point to see whether it is more consistently crafted.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Just watch her wonderfully subtle facial expressions as she becomes aware of the inevitable consequences of her actions. Now that's about the only thing that I was moved by in this film. Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush always deliver great performances, but this was not the stage for their talents.

"works, up to a point, as overloaded soap opera, then loses sight as poetic war ensues","I barely remembered the first film Elizabeth (though I remember still that I liked it, however without much enthusiasm to see it soon after again) before I decided, based on a few surprisingly good reviews, to seek out the 'sequel', which follows Queen Elizabeth in some of her most formidable and turbulent years in power. And it turns out to be... what I expected, with a couple of points of merit. It is, actually, not too much unlike the also recent The Other Boelyn Girl, and there's a commonality that will make some want to see it a lot more than others. The performances by the female leads are fantastic, and there's some male eye-candy for the more fashionable and iconoclastic characters (for the former, Cate Blanchett re-assumes her role, and for the latter we have Clive Owen here as Walter Raleigh, a handsome pirate- need to emphasize this again *handsome*), and it's beautifully designed. It rightfully won its costume Oscar, at the least.But the director Kapur is not without his excesses, and isn't entirely sure which movie he would prefer more- perhaps history, as it would seem, doesn't discern the two sides. Elizabeth might quietly have a 'thing' for Raleigh, but she cannot ever show it, despite him being, in a perfect world as they say, the most promising prospect to help her conceive and continue on with kingdom of Britain. But there's also her most trusted assistant, played by Abbie Cornish, who is also smitten with Raleigh, and they end up marrying and having a child behind the Queen's back. There's a lot of tension, too, with the Queen's cousin Mary (Samantha Morton in maybe the best supporting role of the movie, which maybe isn't saying much), who wants to take the crown for herself. Her plot against her, as it turns out, is seen as a treasonous turn for the Spanish, and so they put forward their offense against the UK.Now, for all that Kapur can do with the material, the best choice he does is to let the scenes of human romantic turmoil, repression, and the shortcomings of Elizabeth beside of her strengths, ring out for all their melodramatics are worth. That makes The Golden Age tolerable, even watchable in a guilty pleasure sort of way. But then when the big battle scenes at sea come, it turns into a mess. He just can't seem to direct those scenes without mucking it up with pretentious visual poetic-theatrics that bog down everything to a crawl. And because Kapur can't leave one side without the other, he's left with an enjoyable but turgid muddle on his hands, with a fiery and (color us shocked) complex Blanchett performance at the center. In fact, if you have any reason to see it at all that doesn't include an interest in costume/period pieces or old-school English history, see it for her.",6.0,Anonymous,History

The acting was excellent, Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, and Abby Cornish in particular.

Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"Sadly, someone agreed that a sequel to ""Elizabeth"" (1998) was required so we ended up with this rather fanciful vehicle for a still competent Cate Blanchett but not so much for a terribly wooden Clive Owen as the seafaring Walter Raleigh. Following the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton), England is facing impending invasion by the Spanish Armada. The (largely forgivable) factual inaccuracies that dogged the first film are somehow magnified in this rather poor follow up. It really does miss Sir Richard Attenbourgh and despite the best efforts of Geoffrey Rush is left too much to likes of the somewhat flighty Abbie Cornish. As you'd expect, the film looks great and the use of CGI is effectively complementary - especially as things hot up, but none of that really helps enliven the rather ponderous pace of this history. Fortunately the Queen didn't live too much longer after this so we ought to be safe from ""Elizabeth III - the Essex Years.""",6.0,Anonymous,History
Gorgeous But Clumsy,"29 October 2007. This rich, luxurious,and gorgeous epic level movie is burdened with a convoluted, clumsy script that seems as murky as the plots surrounding the Queen leaving the audience far much in the dark until the bright sun of clarity shines later in the movie. The characters, especially in the first half of the movie seems more caricatures and one-dimensional figures of good and evil that really do not do justice to this much more fully realized world of Elizabeth. Oddly enough it is the role of Mary Stuart played by Samantha Morton later in the movie that takes center stage in such a dignified manner that her performance almost outshines all others. Sir Walter Raleigh and Bess, Lady in Waiting relationship is an attempt at putting a human face on the Middle Ages, but still there is so much overlooked. Skimmed over is war scenes, the Queen's actual decision in the sentence of Mary Stuart. There are far too many plot points that seem to end up skipped, making the audience fill in the gaps, as if having to watch most of the movie, except there are gaps missing along with English dialogue that ironically enough might have been better handled with captions like the foreign languages used in the movie. Overall, Cate Blanchett's while not as stellar as Helen Mirren's performance in 2006 of another Queen, is competent and penetrated though perhaps too overwrought, to manipulative. The movie made strong points, ethical, moral, and otherwise, but it failed to seize the mighty throne of the genre. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This is the year for Cate's Oscar!,"When I saw the trailer for Elizabeth: The Golden Age, I was a little baffled, I know this is going to sound so bad, but I was thinking ""Oh, great, the sequel to Elizabeth, Elizabeth: The Search for More Money"". I mean, they ended the movie Elizabeth so well, why did they need another movie? But after Cate's Oscar nomination, I decided to go ahead and see the movie and just see if it was any good, I watched it yesterday and I have to say that Elizabeth: The Golden Age was really good. I'm a little surprised by the rating of a 6.9, I thought they presented Queen Elizabeth with the great honor and strength that she deserved. Cate Blanchett was astonishing, her performance was just incredible, it's almost like this was the role that was just meant to be her's. She brought Queen Elizabeth to life like no other actress has before.Queen Elizabeth has taken rule to England, she is still childless and unmarried, the war between the Prodestents and the Catholic's is still going strong, since Elizabeth is a known Prodestent, many people do not want her on the throne. Mary Stewart is Elizabeth's cousin and many people believe that she should have taken the crown and will assassinate Elizabeth just to get their way. For once Queen Elizabeth's emotions are starting to show, she's frightened and worried what is going to happen to her and her kingdom, but with the reassurance of the adventurer, Sir Walter Raleigh and old friend, Sir Francis Walsingham, she feels the strength to go on and go into war with the Spanish.Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a remarkable film and I was really impressed with how they presented Elizabeth, she was so strong and admirable. The film itself is great as well, while it's not strongly accurate, the story is terrific, I know they had to give it a little something to grab the audience's's attention. But the sets, the costumes, the characters, Clive Owen made a great performance out of Sir Raleigh, he was the perfect choice. I would recommend Elizabeth: The Golden Age, it's a terrific movie and I hope Cate gets the Oscar she very much deserves for the performance of Elizabeth.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
Doesn't live up to its title,"I wish I could give this film a higher rating in view of its lush costuming, locations, and casting. However, it doesn't live up to its title, and one anticipates a ""Golden Age, Part II"" (Or was that covered in ""Shakespeare in Love""?) Too much of this is simplistic history. The Spanish are depicted as the embodiment of evil while the English are pictured as a freedom loving people who only reluctantly torture captives and lop off people's heads and are beginning to persecute others for their religious beliefs with less and less intensity. The Armada is seen as a vast, invincible force brought low by some bad weather and fire ships, especially the last one launched in superhero fashion by Sir Walter Raleigh. (The scene of him leaping into the sea at the last minute is sort of funny now, because it resembles so much the TV commercial featuring John Jameson diving into raging waters to retrieve a barrel of his treasured whiskey.) And what's with the horse jumping overboard? Was that supposed to be symbolism of some kind? I half expected Sir Walter to come back on land riding the horse! Any one who watches the History or Military Channel knows that the defeat of the Armada was much more complicated. There was no lack of bravery on the part of the English sailors, but bad weather played a much bigger role in the total distruction of the Armada than is pictured in the film. Finally, without a deep knowlege of English history, it's hard to tell who is who in these dramas, and what their motives are for their actions. Even before you can figure out who someone is, he is arrested for treason, tortured, and hanged.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Great Movie led by a great actress.,"Elizabeth the Golden Age is a quality movie, the filming and costumes are great, and it perfectly tells the story of a turbulent time in history.
It also does a great job of making the viewer proud to be English, that our small island won over such greater odds.

"A miss opportunity for greatness, but enjoyable nonetheless","I was surprised to see that this sequel has quite bad reviews in other websites. I saw the first Elizabeth a couple of months ago and I didn't want to address this one thinking it was far too awful. The truth is that I enjoyed this film. It isn't perfect by no means, the script focuses on a romance that feels force to the viewer. A love triangle that's far from being interesting really. We don't care enough for this characters to invest in their relationships. It could have been truly something admirable, a film to quote. It doesn't achieve that. I wish it would spare all of the romantic intents in it and show us more of Elizabeth itself, her struggles and conflicts, in the first installment the best dialogues are when she is with her adviser, we don't get nearly enough of that here.
My favorite parts were when she was by herself, the little of what we get to see of Mary of Scots and the final battle. That should have been the movie and it would've been great.The music, cinematography, costume and production designs and the performances are all excellent.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Blanchett's Royal Tour De Force,"With 'Elizabeth: The Golden Ages' Shekhar Kapur returns to continuing the story of one of the most fascinating and enigmatic queens in history. His 1998 movie 'Elizabeth' gave us a glimpse of Queen Elizabeth I's introduction to the throne. This time he explores a different side of her, that of a respected accomplished queen who possibly desires love and a future with a family while at the same time she has to battle Spain to rescue EnglandIt is good to see Kapur back to the director's seat after a long time. However, this time his direction is inconsistent. His take on the film is very partial (Philip being portrayed as completely evil and stupid). The film starts off as a period drama but the end sequences take a very opera-like form. One should not rely on it for historical accuracy. Parts of the movie look rushed, especially the love triangle of Owen, Blanchett and Cornish. I wonder why Kapur chose to give this film a different colour tone (green-tinted). This was not the case in the first movie which used a rather preferable sepia tone. The score, though beautiful and mesmerizing, is overused in plenty of sequences. The visuals are dazzling and the cinematography is remarkable and the makeup and costumes are excellent.Cate Blanchett is back in the title role. Needless to say that she breathes fire into the role that, as was also evident in the first movie, is meant for her to play. Geoffrey Rush too reprises his role and does no less of a brilliant job with the little that he was given. Samantha Morton is first rate. Rhys Ifans springs a surprise. Abbie Cornish is very good. Clive Owen is clearly overshadowed by his castmates but he works the charm well.'Elizabeth: The Golden Ages' could have been a more effective film had its presentation been more consistent. Although it does not meet the standards of the first film, it is a strong movie that is intriguing to watch and visually pleasing.",,Anonymous,History
Very good historical film.,"I never tire of historical films about this period in history. This is certainly one of the good ones. I'm not certain it is totally historically correct, but the actors do a fine job of conveying that particularly stressful time and place.

I give it two thumbs up and recommend it for history buffs in particular.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An Epic Fairy Tale...,"Sometimes Oscar season can get way too caught up in itself. Too many times you'll head to the cinema only to find that there is nothing but heavy-handed, deep-meaning dramas. Elizabeth: The Golden Age breaks from that with gusto.It is the story of Elizabeth I as she must fight for her throne as the Spanish try to steal it away from her at all costs. At the same time, Sir Walter Raleigh, a somewhat noble pirate, enters Elizabeth's life and draws her attention away from national affairs... and onto him. An epic story of love and war follows in one of the best movies I've seen this year.Cate Blanchett is breathtaking in her portrayal of the Virgin Queen. Every scene, every line, every feeling is done to perfection by this phenomenal actress. She plays Elizabeth with pride, strength... and fear. I'm definitely seeing a Best Actress nomination for this one and probably a win. The other standout is Samantha Morton as Mary Queen of Scots. There is certainly some Oscar potential for her as well. The film looks amazing on screen as well, with gorgeous cinematography and wonderful costumes, all complemented by a grand swelling score.Some people have said that the plot had not much story to it, but I didn't really see that at all. I was entertained the whole time and there was definitely a plot twist I did not see coming. Granted, some of this I'm sure came from the passion Ms. Blanchett poured into each scene. The pain she's going through inside is completely heartbreaking. The film is at the core a fairy tale on a grand scale, but what a wonderful thing to watch.Yes, in a time of year when epic tales are not so common to be seen, The Golden Age is a gem. Go and see it on the big screen while you can. 7/10 stars!Jay Addison",7.0,Anonymous,History
"One grand, beautiful scene after the next","I love a good Elizabeth movie as much as anyone else. In fact, just a few days before I saw this film, I had seen a 1939 film (Private Lives of Elizabeth & Essex) starting Bette Davis and Errol Flynn. It was fascinating to be able to compare these two movies from two different eras, to see how modern cinematography has developed in its depiction of Elizabeth and the late 16th century.Perhaps unsurprisingly not much has changed with regard to Elizabeth's appearance and clothing. At least in modern movies Elizabeth is allowed to take her make-up and dress off once in a while. Even take baths.In the 1939 movie, the theme was the love affair between Elizabeth and the Earl of Essex. This 2007 movie is set somewhat earlier, but it also shows the emotional life of Elizabeth, including her feelings for Walter Raleigh.I thought that the performances in the movie were excellent. Cate Blanchett was marvellous. So was Samantha Morton and Geoffrey Rush. Clive Owen too was really good, especially at the start where he is trying to catch the queen's eye. His tale of making the crossing and reaching the new world was as gripping for the viewer as for Elizabeth. Say what you want about Clive Owen, he's good.In this movie many of the scenes were achingly beautiful. At times it was like looking at a collection of Old Masters in a museum. The lighting, colour, costumes and rich settings were all used to their best advantage.The beauty of the scenes became so striking at times, however, that the artifice kept leaping out at me. At times it was so obviously beautiful, so clearly romantic, that it seemed staged and posed.I really didn't mind this aspect though. I can't get enough of modern attempts to display medieval and renaissance life. Seriously. There must be many fascinating aspects of the period that have yet to be shown on film.OK, perhaps there was a bit too much jingoism in there. I understand that Elizabeth is a patriotic figure to the English (or at least to English filmmakers), but Elizabeth the virgin guardian angel of England? Elizabeth the warrior queen? Elizabeth the mother of her people? This is wishful thinking on the part of the director and themes that don't work for me. I suspect that English people however swell with patriotism when they see Elizabeth portrayed as a virgin-mother-warrior-angel-queen in full Renaissance finery. Even in the 1939 film the Americans did this in an old-Hollywood sort of way.The highlight of the movie for me was the execution of Mary and Elizabeth's anguish at what had happened. Morton played this brilliantly. Blanchett brought to life the doubts about it and the horror of it all. Walsingham did what he had to do, but what a mess this conflict between Protestant and Catholic really was. What did bloody Mary do to deserve this?After the movie I looked it all up on Wikipedia. Mary was actually married to Philip II of Spain. I had forgotten that fascinating detail. History could easily have gone the other way. This movie did not portray the Spanish in a way that I would consider realistic. I'm sure they were not all crazed religious zealots. No more so than English Protestants like Walsingham.There was somehow a problem with the plot or writing. The film seemed a little disjointed, jumping from one grand, beautiful, melodramatic scene to the next. I was on the director's side right up until the scene where Elizabeth exhorts her troops on horseback. That went too far. Even Cate Blanchett was unable to pull that one off.Still I enjoyed the film. It's under-rated on IMDb. I'm not sure why.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Well-made chronicle of the protestant Queen Elizabeth I ...,"1st watched 12/16/2007, 7 out of 10(Dir-Shekhar Kapur): Well-made chronicle of the protestant Queen Elizabeth I and her struggles against Catholic Spain as well as her innermost struggles of being the ""virgin"" queen. Cate Blanchett once again does a good job of portraying the complexities in this historical character and let's us see what many probably didn't get to see in her day(which of course were her private struggles amplified in this film). The movie is partly about the entrance of Sir Walter Raleigh in her life, played by Clive Owen, who is a swashbuckling handsome type from Spain who comes to get on the Queen's good side and permission for his exploring, but instead tickles her fancy and the Queen would like to have him in other ways. The other part of the story is the conflict between Spain and England and how it got it's start. Sir Walter falls for one of her suitors which causes the queen knipchens and makes her make irrational decisions like denying Walter's exploration and keeping him around as captain of the guard, in hopes that things might happen between them eventually. This is where the story is interesting. The war part, in my opinion, is not done very well and just brings down the movie. Elizabeth is very successful historically in this area, but in the movie she gets help from Sir Walter and her expertise in this area is not expanded or portrayed very well. For the most part, though, this is an entertaining and well executed movie with good acting and interesting conflicts. One suggestion though --- hone up on your history before watching it, as I didn't, and you may understand the movie a little better.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Remarkable Rendition of a Historical Icon (No Spoilers),"An Icon of her time, Elizabeth I is an inspiring muse for many dramatists then and now; she's also a socio-political anomaly of sorts, having baffled countless advisors as her father once did. The film does a great job depicting the internal and external conflicts the young queen faced. The Tudor line may have ended with her, but her life and reign marks one of the greatest points in British (and feminist) history.Amazing sets and costuming and an astounding cast. The film's perspective is simple in some ways, but cuts through to the heart of the solitary queen who captured the hearts of her people. Bravo!",8.0,Anonymous,History
two best performers,"I tagged two performers for further investigation with IMDb - strong acting in smaller roles by both Samantha Morton (Mary Queen of Scots) and William Houston as the Spanish Envoy or Ambassador, Don Guerau De Spes. Reading their biographical notes reveals the reasons they stood out. Morton, acting school starting at 13, Houston - Shakespearian training. They shone like gems. I didn't 'get' Clive Owen's portrayal of Sir Walter Raleigh - the words in the script seemed to be right but the passion seemed flat for a swash buckling, opportunist, thief/pirate. The script seemed to position him as more of a wise, guru-type romanticist trying to tread the fine line between lusty and 'lofty'.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"A Visual Feast, A Tedious Film","ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE isn't golden. Expectations were high after Cate Blanchett's first foray in 1998 as Elizabeth I, but somehow this follow-up film, with the same director (Shekhar Kapur) and writer (Michael Hirst with assistance from William Nicholson), does not reach those heights. Visually stunning, with an endless array of knockout costumes for Blanchett, special effects and scenery as majestic as any that have been photographed by fine cinematographer Remie Adefarasin and a musical score by Craig Armstrong and AR Rahman - all of these fine attributes cannot cover the weak script and the general lack of character development that hampers the usually exceptional core of actors.The portion of Elizabeth's history covered by the film is the battle with Spain, England being the only country not participating in the Holy War in Europe under the direction of King Philip II of Spain (Jordi Mollà), complete with the surprise decimation of the approaching Spanish Armada due to the heroism and commitment of Elizabeth with her people. The surrounding events include Elizabeth's dalliance with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and the traumatic (for Elizabeth) beheading of Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton), under the advisement of Elizabeth's trusted Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush).Blanchett is a consummate actress and manages to inhabit the persona of Elizabeth as much with her glances and body language and silences as with the meager material from the script. She IS a Queen reborn. The remainder of the cast is adequate though shallow, and while each has very little to say they maintain an atmosphere of Elizabethan England. This is a DVD that could well be watched without the soundtrack and still be entertaining for the visual splendors. It could have been so much more. Grady Harp",6.0,Anonymous,History
Very Good Biopic - Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"Clive Owen, as Walter Raleigh, almost steals this film away from Cate Blanchett, who plays Queen Elizabeth. His screen persona is quite impressive. That is not to say that Blanchett was not as equally impressive. Even Geoffrey Rush was good, despite having to play an icy, calculating court official. The cinematography of this movie is outstanding, as are all the production values, and the direction of Shakar Kapur is impeccable. The entire production was first-rate and well-deserving of the several awards it won. The story of Elizabeth is fascinating, as is the story of Raleigh as well.

'Elizabeth' still keeps her throne.,"My Take: Not as bold, dashing or historically accurate as the first ELIZABETH, this sequel still has stunning visuals and superb acting.Stated at the end of the original ELIZABETH are the untold events not portrayed in the film. It is said that Elizabeth I ruled for 40 years, and that those years were also known as the ""Golden Age"". Untold, no longer. For now, there is ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE, a sequel to a great film that didn't warrant a sequel. Don't get me wrong, ELIZABETH was a great film. A bold, dashing and exhilarating foray into the dark and powerful reign of The Virgin Queen, but its not the kind of film that would require a sequel. It's like expecting a sequel to GONE WITH THE WIND.THE GOLDEN AGE doesn't even do its homework on history. I'm no history buff, but I don't have to be to say that it's highly improbable that Sir Walter Raleigh, even with his strength, defeated the entire Spanish Armada on his own. That's a thing that happens in films like 300 that doesn't give a damn about accuracy. Putting it in a ""serious"" historical biography could only be the fault of Hollywood. Other than being inaccurate, the screenplay is often confusing and riddling. Either the script can't stay focused on a single point, or the film lacks the right direction. The films main plot concerns the attempts of Span, led by its unruly King Phillip I (Jordi Mollà), and England's own Virgin Queen (Cate Blanchett, in top form) who regrets to surrender. But the film also revolves around a love triangle between the Queen, a ravishing seafarer Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and one of the queens' handmaidens (Abbie Cornish). There's also the plot to overthrow Elizabeth from her thrown by Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton), who proclaims herself the heir to England's throne. Revolving too very often from one plot line after another, it just raises confusion and too many questions.ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE is a practice in style over substance. Ah, but what style! How much can you put so much style under a single 2-hour feature. Although it has a plot and script intact, the real reason for the film's existence is that Director Shekhar Kapur, costume designer Alexandra Byrne and set production designer Guy Dyas had a field day with the costume designs and sets. The costumes are breathtakingly awesome, bursting with style and certainly puts the ""fab"" in fabrics. In fact they are so good, it gets are mind off what the people who wear them are saying. Honestly, we are too busy thinking about how Cate Blanchett wears these outfits each day of filming rather than listening to what the queen is saying. We also marvel at the wondrous sight of incredible set designs that burst with textures and tapestries. The style here is overwhelming, that they even overwhelms the plot.Other than the fabulous designs, the best thing still about the film is the ravishing return of Cate Blanchett for the role that gave her the boost to stardom. Her performance here as the queen is actually tougher and more energetic. When confronted with the Spanish Ambassador, the spunky queen bellows ""I, too, can command the wind sir! I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare when you dare to try me!"". Once again, best best bits of the screenplay goes to Ms. Blanchett, who delivers them with stunning power guaranteed to make a killing at the Oscars. Supporting performances are also fine, especially from Geoffrey Rush returning as the mysterious Sir Francis Walsingham.Overall, it sinks with history and confuses with screenplay, but stuns with sheer beauty, breathtaking style and great performances. It's confusing, riddled, but ravishingly entertaining. Fans of the first film will like what they see, even if it lacks the total control and boldness of its predecessor. For everyone else, its a popcorn-movie which cares less about accuracy but aims to entertain. Set aside the criticism said about this film, and enjoy it for what it is. Sure it's as accurate to history as 300 was (or is that inaccurate), but its fancy and fancifully entertaining.Rating: **** out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A great representation of one of England's most powerful queens.,"Unlike most movies and television series that tend to focus on palace intrigue, more than history and turbulent times for the monarchy; Elizabeth: The Golden Ages takes us back to a time in which the England and the monarchy were genuinely in threat of being taken over.

"20% Fact, 80% Fiction","OK I admit the 20%/80% is a rough estimate....but wow, this film really, really plays fast and loose with the facts. I mean, really. I enjoyed the first film (""Elizabeth"" (1998), for which I gave 8/10), and that one also took liberties with the truth...but this one goes a little too far in my opinion.I will focus on the numerous inaccuracies presented for just one character, Walter Raleigh, to illustrate the point. He is shown describing sea voyages to the new world to an enraptured Elizabeth (wrong - he never went to North America at all and only sailed to South America 10 years after the events in the film). He is shown having a potential romantic relationship with Elizabeth (there is no evidence for this). He is shown taking part in the battle against the Spanish Armada, igniting a 'fire ship,' when in fact he was on land at this time and played no active role in the fight. He is shown being named Captain of the Royal Guard prior to that battle when in fact that did not happen until four years later. And while it is true he impregnated one of the ladies of the court, and was imprisoned by Elizabeth for it, again these events happened several years later than when they are presented in the film. This matters because it affects the 'why' - in the film, Raleigh is released from prison so that he can help defend England against the Spanish Armada - but of course in reality, that battle had happened years before, and when it did happen, he wasn't in it.And sadly, it doesn't end there. The craziness with this tortured history ranges from extremely minor points like portraying Elizabeth speaking German (she didn't) or Isabella of Spain as a child when in fact she was 19-22 years old for the periods shown in the film (why she is shown as a child I have no idea, it did not seem to contain any relevance whatsoever) to serious fabrications or omissions, such as showing King Phillip of Spain wanting to invade England solely or mainly because it was Protestant. Yes some mention is made of English piracy on the open seas, but the crucifix-clutching Phillip is clearly shown to be desirous of deposing Elizabeth for her 'heretic' leanings and nothing more. The fact that the historical Elizabeth in 1585 sent English troops to the Netherlands in an effort to frustrate Spanish plans of domination there is never mentioned, and of course English actions such as these contributed greatly to Spain's eventual decision to send the Armada. But to watch this film, we are led to believe that Elizabeth is happily hanging out in England, minding her own business, when the big bad wolf (i.e., Spain) decides it wants to be a bully and punish England for embracing Protestantism. Yeah, it's not that simple ~Even more laughable in this film was Elizabeth's reasoning for why England could not fall to Spain. What was it? She refers to the Spanish Inquisition! She states that she cannot allow Spain to take over and impose the Inquisition on her people, that they have the right to follow their own consciences, etc. As if that is the FIRST thing you care about. Not that your country would be invaded, or that you'd lose the war, or that England itself would be wiped off that map - no. Your concern is not any of that, your concern is a fear of the Spanish Inquisition? Is this a joke? ""I don't care about my country (or my kingdom), it's that freedom of conscience thing that really gets me..."" This is revisionist at its worst.The film itself looks beautiful. The sets, costumes, locations are top-notch. That part of the film gets a 10. The music is mostly OK, although sometimes ramps up in needless intensity which could be annoying. But the truth...oh, the truth. Or lack of same. So so so far removed from reality it's egregious. And if you want to say it's fictional, fine. But then don't put this forward as history, giving textual preambles and postscripts about Elizabeth, because that suggests that what we are about to see, and then saw, was part of history...and of course it's not. Better to say this was Queen Elizabeth of fictional Freedonia (sorry, Groucho) and you're much better off. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Occasionally uneven in pace and seriousness, but interesting and effortlessly carried by Blanchett","Horror, fantasy and comic-book films tend to have sequels even if the original was bad, as long as box office results were relatively positive. But biopics? Who would actually green-light a second installment of someone's cinematic biography? Even Cate Blanchett was unsure whether to play Queen Elizabeth I again, despite the Oscar nomination she received for the first movie. It took some persuading from director Skekhar Kapur and co-star Geoffrey Rush (the only other returning cast member from the original film) to get her back on board, and even though Elizabeth: The Golden Age isn't nearly as good as the previous chapter, Blanchett confirms she is one of the best actresses ever.Ending the first picture with Elizabeth fully embracing her responsibilities as sovereign of England, The Golden Age shows her struggles to maintain her authority. That isn't easy, as dangers are hidden everywhere: though locked up, the Queen's villainous cousin Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton) keeps plotting to claim what she believes to be rightfully hers, and to achieve that she seeks the help of King Philip II of Spain, an overly devout Catholic who sees it as his mission to rid the world of a Protestant ""traitor"" like Elizabeth.Things don't fare much better at court either, for the monarch, still unwilling to get married, may have met a man capable of stirring conflicting emotions in her, emotions she deemed lost after her disappointment with the Earl of Leicester in the previous installment. This man is Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), a brave and sufficiently cocky ""pirate"" who has brought a lot of trouble to Spain's ships. As he troubles Elizabeth too, she leaves him in the hand of her most trusted maid (Abbie Cornish), inadvertently setting in motion a chain of events that could cause a quite unexpected reaction on her behalf: jealousy.Much like he did back in 1998, Kapur delivers a visually perfect feature, with sets and costumes that render the period while keeping the movie from feeling old-fashioned. He also employs the same narrative technique as he did last time, intertwining conspiracy thriller and romantic tragedy, with the addition of a little action in the third act, which sees the British fleet face the Spanish Armada in one of the most riveting naval battles to have been put on screen (it even manages to make Pirates of the Caribbean look lacking in explosions). What precedes that epic showdown, however, is at times frustratingly uneven: certain scenes succumb to a bout of slowness, and certain dialogue exchanges between Blanchett and Owen (appropriately charismatic and ""rude"" as the Errol Flynn-like Raleigh) are corny to say the least. But overall the suspense is rather consistent, and the dangerous love triangle at the second act's center manages to get more dramatic as time goes by.All of that, though, is unimportant in assuring the film is watchable. The first Elizabeth's saving grace was the actress playing the main part, and the same happens in this sequel: the mere look on Blanchett's face as she stares at a potential assassin should be enough to give her the Oscar she didn't get in 1999, such powerful is the sense of authority, control and restrained rage she conveys in the continuation of what will remain her crowning achievement (pun not intended). Only Morton, using her three or four scenes to perfection, comes close to stealing the limelight from the protagonist, with a wounded, compelling depiction of dignified defeat.At this point, the only question left is: do we need a third film? Not really, although Kapur intends to make a final installment about Elizabeth's last years. Do we want one? Well, yes, but only if Blanchett accepts to reprise the role. Oh, and returning to the qualitative heights of the original movie wouldn't hurt either.7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Even better than the first one!,"When I saw the first Elizabeth movie, I thought it was a crying shame Cate Blanchett didn't win the Oscar when the woman who did win (Gwyneth Paltrow) acted in a 1500s period piece as well. Now that I've seen the sequel, I realize Miss Blanchett's loss in 2007 was an even greater shame (although the victor, Marion Cotillard did give a lovely performance). Blanchett's performance as the older, more experienced Queen Elizabeth was fantastic - even better than the original. And since she was very, very good in the original, this is quite a compliment.Complete with beautiful sets and costumes, authentic light, and timing that takes you back to the slowness of the day, this is just as visually pretty to watch as the original. Except for the violence, of course. Where the first movie showed beheadings and women being burned at the stake, the sequel shows just as much violence. In this one, you'll see excessive torture and a tongue being cut out - or if you're squeamish like me, you'll have your fast-forward button handy.Don't fast-forward the special effects, though. In this movie, Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) comes to court and asks permission to colonize the New World. Elizabeth is drawn to him (and yes, there's the famous puddle scene) and refuses to let him leave. But his nature is to explore and conquer, and you'll get to see a very impressive Spanish Armada sequence. Even more impressive is Cate Blanchett, who manages to convince you she's not Cate Blanchett. She's Queen Elizabeth, weary with age, jaded by experience, who realizes love has passed her by and values loyalty among her friends and court advisers above all else; and who knows, though it doesn't make her feel good about herself, that sometimes threatening her power is the only way to gain affection.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",,Anonymous,History
History Is What You Can Remember,"The original ""Elizabeth"" from 1998 told the story of the first fifteen years or so of Elizabeth's reign and of her progress from a frightened young princess to the ""Virgin Queen"". ""The Golden Age"" moves the story on to the 1580s. Despite her success in dealing with domestic opposition, Elizabeth is still not completely secure on her throne. English Catholics dispute both her legitimacy and her right to rule, and many regard Mary Queen of Scots as their rightful sovereign. King Philip of Spain, Elizabeth's former brother-in-law, threatens to invade.Cate Blanchett returns as Elizabeth, as does Geoffrey Rush as her Machiavellian counsellor Sir Francis Walsingham. The most important new character is Sir Walter Raleigh, portrayed here as the new great love of the Queen's life, and also as the mastermind of the defeat of the Armada. The film deals with the supposed love-triangle between Elizabeth, Raleigh and her maid-of-honour Bess Throckmorton, which also formed the basis for the 1955 film ""The Virgin Queen"".Like its predecessor, the film takes liberties with history. Although it takes place in the years 1585 to 1588, King Eric XIV of Sweden is shown as one of the suitors for Elizabeth's hand in marriage. He was in fact deposed in 1568 and died in 1577. Raleigh did not marry Bess until 1591, three years after the events shown in the film. He does not appear to have played any part in the defeat of the Armada; the real heroes of that engagement were Lord Howard of Effingham and Sir Francis Drake. The film also takes liberties with geography. In real life Elizabeth's speech to her troops was made at Tilbury, a town in the low-lying Essex marshes, but here it takes place on high chalk cliff-tops. We see the Queen sail past the New Building and Bridge of Sighs at St John's College, Cambridge, although these buildings were not built until the nineteenth century. Mary Queen of Scots was not imprisoned in a castle on an island in a Scottish loch (she was, of course, in exile from Scotland) but in one on the flat plain of the English Midlands. The real Fotheringhay Castle could not have been used for the film (it was demolished in 1627), but no doubt a closer equivalent could have been found.The film, however, is not overly concerned with historical accuracy. Like the earlier film, it is a stylised pageant very different in style to the traditional English costume drama such as ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" or ""Mary Queen of Scots"". These differences may reflect the fact that the director, Shekhar Kapur, is originally from India and has worked in the Indian cinema both as actor and director. Although it was made by a foreign-born director, the film is quite unashamedly patriotic (and therefore something of a rarity in the modern British cinema). As in the first film, cathedral interiors (Wells, Winchester and Ely) are used to represent Tudor castles and palaces. The idea is to present not so much a biography of Elizabeth the real woman as one of Elizabeth the myth, the iconic ""Virgin Queen"" who plays such an central role in England's National Legend. (Each country has its own National Legend- a selection of stories from its past which define its idea of itself and its place in the world).""The Golden Age"" has been accused of anti-Catholicism, a criticism which in my view seems unwarranted, although it has given rise to a good deal of debate on this page. (One thread on the message board, in particular, displays remarkable amounts of bigotry on both sides). Although the film undoubtedly portrays the events of the 1580s from the English perspective, and therefore shows Philip II as the villainous aggressor, the Catholic Church of today is a very different institution from the one which existed 400 years ago. Criticism of the sixteenth century Church, therefore, should not be seen as reflecting badly on the modern Church, any more than war films which portray the Nazis as villains should be seen as anti-German or as attacks on the democratic Germany of today.The stylised, symbolic nature of the film becomes particularly clear when Cate Blanchett (as good here as she was in the original film) is addressing her troops. At 38, Blanchett is much younger than the historical Elizabeth was during this period (she was 55 at the time of the Armada). For most of the time, this discrepancy is hidden by the use of make-up, but in this scene Blanchett appears, not as a middle-aged lady who hid her greying hair beneath a wig, but as a beautiful young warrior-maiden in armour, her long red hair flying in the wind behind her. The cliffs used were actually in Somerset, but they are doubtless intended to represent the White Cliffs of Dover, a powerful symbol in English history and folklore. This scene has little to do with historical reality, but it is one of the most memorable images in the film. This is the sort of folk-history which remains in the mind long after the schoolroom version has been forgotten. And, as Messrs Sellar and Yeatman reminded us in ""1066 and All That"", history is what you can remember. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
bit of a mixed bag but visually impressive,"The long-awaited sequel to 1998's 'Elizabeth', and using some of the same cast (notably Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth I and Geoffrey Rush as Francis Walsingham), this film scores on visual splendour but fails to engage in its battle scenes.As Sir Walter Raleigh in an upgraded part that doesn't pay much attention to history, Clive Owen is OK but nothing spectacular. If anything his characterisation is overwritten for such a dull person. Smaller parts fare better in a muddled story which involves court intrigues, Mary Queen of Scots (played quietly and with dignity by Samantha Morton), Catholics, burning ships, and the Spanish Inquisition.Kapur's direction does not fail in the scenes of regal spectacle - the Queen is never anything other than stunning - or in the more intimate and thoughtful scenes - but something is missing, and the gung ho pirate-like Armada adventuring is a bit of a misfire.A worthy sequel, but not as good as you might think, and not as good as the first 'Elizabeth'. It will probably repay a few viewings to make sense of the complicated plot.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Intrigue, romance and war in this historical sequel","The previous film, just called 'Elizabeth', showed the early years of Elizabeth I's reign; now she is an established monarch but her problems are not over. There advisers want her to clamp down on English Catholics as they believe they are plotting against her in an attempt to put her cousin, the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots, on the throne. The Spanish are looking for an excuse to invade and pressure is being put on her to marry and produce an heir. Explorer Walter Raleigh, just back from claiming an area of the New World, which he has named Virginia in her honour, catches her eye and they become friends. He is also attracted to her attendant Bess Throckmorton. As various plots play out the Spanish launch a giant armada to invade England; the odds are in the Spanish fleet's favour but a small English force prepares to meet it.If you insist on historical accuracy you are likely to be disappointed but if you are happy with a film that provides romance, plotting and a fiery naval battle then this is a lot of fun. The story moves at a good pace and has interesting central characters. Cate Blanchett impresses in the title role; the rest of the cast are solid too; notably Clive Owen and Abbie Cornish as Raleigh and Bess Throckmorton respectively. The settings mostly look great... even if the iconic Eilean Donan Castle; a coastal castle in Scotland sees an odd standing for the inland Fotheringay Castle in Northamptonshire! The battle scenes only take up a small part of the film but were thrilling even though the result is known. Overall I enjoyed this far more than I expected and would recommend it to fans of films with historical settings who aren't too worried about historical accuracy.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Magnificent! A visual feast!,"There is quality and excellence wherever you look. It's all here. The acting, the sets, the music, the script, the direction all combine to create an outstanding visual and aural cinematic experience. The costumes are vibrant in colour and rich in texture; perfect down to the smallest detail.In the first film made 10 years ago, Cate Blanchett played an Elisabeth who transforms from an innocent young girl in love, to a young queen ""married"" to her country. In that film she was good, but in this film she gives a truly remarkable performance. Geoffrey Rush is also retained from the first film as Walsingham, and has now become her cunning, personal counsel who has created the 16th century equivalent of the secret service.Now Elisabeth is a strong, mature monarch, confident of her abilities after many years on the throne of England. She is still a woman though, despite her being known throughout history as the ""virgin queen"", and the film explores her feminine side, as she falls in love with Sir Francis Drake (Clive Owen) and then her humanity, as she pardons the two people she loves the most after they have deceived her. We are shown her great dignity and strength as she dons full battle armour and rides out with her army to confront the forces of Philip of Spain, as they approach the English shores.There is a gradual and constant build up of tension leading to the arrival of the Spanish Armada. However, the director has thankfully avoided the temptation to impress with vast, sweeping, battle scenes, as indeed, this is not a film about war or military achievement. It is about a woman; a woman who sacrifices her own happiness for the good of her country, a woman who succeeds in commanding respect in the world of men, and a fearless queen who leads her country from ruin to greatness - into the Golden Age.Could this also mean a golden statute for Cate Blanchett? I would not be at all surprised to see this film win the 2008 Oscars for best actress and best costumes.An outstanding film. Don't miss it!",10.0,Anonymous,History
somewhat better than advertised,"""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" picks up pretty much where 1998's ""Elizabeth"" left off. The time is 1588, a full thirty years into Elizabeth I's phenomenal reign as Queen of England. On the continent, Europe is caught in the grip of a papal-decreed Holy War, while, in Britain, the Virgin Queen faces numerous threats to her throne and person from enemies both within her realm and without. The latter include King Phillip of Spain, who views the Protestant Elizabeth as nothing less than the devil himself come in female guise to tear down the one true apostolic faith, while the former consist mainly of her own disgruntled citizens, loyal to the Catholic Scottish queen (and Elizabeth's own cousin), Mary Stuart, currently being held prisoner for suspected acts of sedition against the Crown.Whereas the first ""Elizabeth"" was a remarkably dark and brooding study of the times in which it was set, this follow-up takes a much more feel-good approach to the era (despite the occasional torture sequence or the random tongue-removal or beheading). Returning as director, Shekhar Kapur has mounted this film with an eye toward mass audience consumption, focusing far more on the rather jejune - and largely fictionalized - romantic escapades of the Queen and Sir Walter Raleigh, than on the far more intriguing sociopolitical issues of the time. The scenes depicting this more or less ""platonic"" love affair are the most poorly written in the film, utilizing dialogue that ranges from the pedestrian and the pretentious to the downright laughable and silly. Clive Owen certainly looks dashing enough as the legendary, cloak-dropping ""pirate,"" Sir Walter, but he plays him with such an Errol Flynn air and demeanor that he quickly reduces the character to a movie-swashbuckler anachronism.Cate Blanchett, who turned herself into a virtual household name with her star-turn in the earlier film, scores a similar triumph in ""The Golden Age."" She helps to humanize a figure who has all too often been encased in wax when presented on screen. In an obvious effort to make her more ""identifiable"" to modern audiences, the writers, William Nicholson and Michael Hirst, may have erred in making her just a mite too petulant and petty at times, but Blanchet is scrupulously careful to avoid crossing the line into buffoonery at any point in the film. This Elizabeth is definitely feeling the burdens of her position and she often finds herself caught between reveling in her position of authority and privilege and secretly desiring the unscrutinized life of the anonymous, ""regular"" commoner. The always reliable Geoffrey Rush also returns as her now-aging adviser, Sir Francis Walsingham.Yet, for all its flaws, and despite its tendency to wander off into the realm of soap opera and melodrama a bit too often, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is still a fairly engrossing and entertaining piece of historical drama, and certainly nowhere near the unmitigated disaster many critics have accused it of being. For despite the extreme elaborateness of its clothing and sets, the film never really devolves into a stagnant or stale costume drama, thanks, in large part, to the richness of Blanchett's performance and to the reasonably fast-paced nature of the narrative. Luckily for the audience, Kapur keeps the movie going by never dwelling too long on any given scene. (I do wish, however, that he had toned down the music a scosh.)There's no question that the first ""Elizabeth"" was a genuinely great film. Yet, while this second installment may not be quite as ""golden"" as either its title or its pedigree might lead one to believe, it's still hard to resist the lure of that olde Elizabethan magic.",7.0,Anonymous,History
the age's reality,"I were expecting more of this movie a queen more energetic, because of the history books describe Queen Elizabeth one of the most courage and wised queens of all times,the life day by they lived in a passion and in the same time in a defense for her people. All the environment of conspiracy trust and lies, the queen can survive to all that,because the Queen have in her trust side Sir Walter Raleigh the man who make her see the beyound of her kingdom, and because of that she achieve the victory.Other thing that i liked was the character of King Philip II of Spain all its role play seems really because the true person of this king was very sterical and nervous man a wrong and dark catholic person its really good his role play.

Whats all the fuss?,"This was a very good movie. I cannot simply understand what was so bad about it. It is accused of being too short, the plot flimsy and having Geoffrey Rush under used. This is rubbish and I advise readers strongly to not listen to it. It is only 114 minutes but that is only bad if it actually feels short. To me Elizabeth was done justice and I felt that the ending was fine and summed up the movie well. As for the plot being flimsy there is no way of that. It was as strong as the first Elizabeth maybe even stronger when you think of it. Finally Geoffrey Rush is the last person to be called under used. From my point of view he was nearly used to much with his emotions flying everywhere in some places. The one person who was under used was Samantha Morton as Mary, Queen of Scots but no offence to her but she just wasn't pretty enough for the role. Apart from those small hiccups I could easily recommend this film for one sole reason. Cate Blanchett! She was absolutely brilliant. At least all the critics agreed on that. She really have off the vibes of a queen and we aussies are proud to say she is ours! Go see it and throw the critics rating in the bin!",7.0,Anonymous,History
An involving tale from a dark era,"I've seen some trailers of this movie a couple months ago, and I added this movie to my 'mustsee' list. Tonight I had the pleasure of watching it and I can honestly say that it did not disappoint me.I am a fan of epic historic films so I first of all enjoyed the scenery, the costumes and the buildings. The film is shot at amazing locations, such as palaces, castles, ships and on the cliffs near the sea. It all looked very authentic and it gives an extra dimension to the scenes.The scenes are well put together, and most of the scenes really are important to complete the main storyline. The atmosphere of the film is brilliantly good brought to the screen, with help of the locations, the music and last but surely not least...the acting.I have to say that this film has a superb cast. All characters are acting very well, but Queen Elizabeth acted perfectly throughout the whole movie. In my opinion she deserves a Oscar for that.The story of the movie is quite good. There was no boring moment in this movie for me, but the story couldn't hit the spot I desired it would. I mean when Maximus died in the arena in Gladiator I felt chills down my spine, I did miss that a little in this movie.The only thing, that wasn't right in this movie. Protestant people do not believe in 'what the stars are telling'.Overall I can say that I enjoyed watching this movie very much, and I can recommend it to everyone!

Stick to the 1st film only.  This is unnecessary & not so good.,"If Cate Blanchett hadn't come back for this film, there would have been no reason to see it. The original ""Elizabeth"" is a wonderful film, and this film adds nothing to the mythos. I think Cate is a masterful actress and she is good in this too, but an Oscar nomination? Um no. I believe that just because a performance is outstanding it is much harder to justify it when the film it self isn't very good. Now don't get me wrong there is a lot of worse out there, however there really isn't much to get engaged in. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone except the die hard fans of the first or of the Queen herself. I found myself to be pretty darn bored through just about everything. The cinematography is excellent, the acting is decent, and the sets are gorgeous. The problem is that the script just doesn't have that Umph you need to seriously get into it. I think 6/10 is generous and that is only because Blanchett is superb. Without her I would knock it down quite a bit.",6.0,Anonymous,History
I will live right until the endElizabeth: The Golden Age,"Whereas Elizabeth told a tale of royalty and the politics underlying every action to gain power, Elizabeth: The Golden Age weaves the story of how that strength survives. Michael Hirst gets help this time from the capable William Nicholson to explain what happens once the queen has proved her worth. The country has accepted her, yet many Catholic dissenters hide behind Mary Stuart, looking for an overthrow. Outside her kingdom sees Spain reviling her crown, standing against the God they hold dear. King Philip has a plan that will use Elizabeth's most trusted advisors' loyalty against her. This is a time where religion hangs over everything heavily. One cannot become a leader without God's acceptance and one cannot start a war without that permission either. As a result, the story starts off at a subtle pace, slowly unraveling the conspiracies at play, to later crank up the suspense for a war that will shape the world as we know it today.The years between the two films has seen director Shekhar Kapur hone his skills and develop an aesthetic much flashier here than its predecessor. Yes, he had the majesty of set and wardrobe in the first film, but here he takes it to the next level. Elizabeth begins in power; therefore she must show off her royal beauty. The movie can be seen as one of over-extravagance, but I don't think it ever goes too far. Kapur's attention to detail should be commended, and while the visuals are stunning and at times overwhelming, they never are at the detriment to the story being told. This can't quite be said about the cinematography. He appears to be a bit over his head on composition, giving us many instances that beg the question, why did he do that? One such moment, at the end, shows Geoffrey Rush (reprising his role of Walsingham to much the same accomplishment) lying on his bed through a pinhole gap in the ceiling. The screen is black besides the small opening with its blurred edges. Not only is it strange, but it lasts for only about five seconds before cutting back to a normal vantage point. Another example is of the queen standing to the left of the screen while a column fills the other five-sixths. She isn't even showed in full, but allows a bit of her dress to go behind the obstruction. Awkward moments like this seem out of place and take the viewer out of the worka little misguided auteurism.I can't fault him too much for these transgressions, as there are just as many instances of pure beauty. From Sir Walter Raleigh swimming underwater while ships burn above him to the execution of Mary Stuart, Kapur gives his share of emotionally stunning sequences. Give him a weighty score and the ability to film in slow motion and let him do his thing. Even the many times he portrays metaphors and allusions to faith and God are done so with a deft hand. The shadow of religion covering most of the proceedings help allow him to get away with it, as that was a standard of the time, but he never lets them become too heavy-handed or laughably easy. I also give him credit for knowing his limits and instead of showing horrid action/war scenes, he holds back to only shoot the destruction the war creates. Maybe it was his experience with battles on the critically panned Four Feathers (I can't weigh in here as I haven't seen the film), but his masking the fighting with only explosions and aftermath works effectively.Just as with Elizabeth, The Golden Age's aesthetic, great as it is, only equals the acting on display. With both Rush and Cate Blanchett returning, one could not ask for more. Blanchett shows her strength at all times while also letting a bit of her dreams for a normal life seep through. When she is with her favorite ""lady in waiting"" Bess, a nice turn from Abbie Cornish, or alone with Raleigh, her true self shows through the façade of stoic leadership. She longs for a love affair, but not so much that she would sacrifice the people she rules. Her ability to hold to her word that she will protect everyone of England, no matter their religious preference and to even go to the front lines while they fight for her, (a nice scene even if the speech was a tad lackluster) shows her humanity and greatness.Kapur has assembled another dream cast of British stars to support his lead. Clive Owen, as Raleigh, is the perfect amount of charisma and self-assured defiance needed to make his role believable. In order to have the queen's full respect, he had to stand up for himself no matter what she might do as a result. Samantha Morton is fantastic as Mary Stuart. The role is somewhat of a MacGuffin, but effective nonetheless; hopefully she will take more roles as the villain in the future. She is a great actress and it's nice to see her branch out of the heroine mode. There are many other familiar faces, all doing an admirable job to keep appearances up for this wonderful period piece. One more of notice, however, is the almost unrecognizable Rhys Ifans. Completely gone is the goofiness I know him for from films such as Notting Hill and Human Nature. What a surprise he is playing the Jesuit priest on a mission from Spain that no one quite knows until it is too late.",8.0,Anonymous,History
QE1 meets MTV,"Historical drama meets rock video in a glorious but over-the top sequel to the sublime original. Blanchet is again superb. She looks, and most definitely acts the part with all guns blazing. Wonderful. Rush likewise provides the voice of reason and calm with is portrayal of wise old Walsingham and the relationship between the two is a constantly fascinating golden thread running through this sometimes patchwork production. The screenplay is a curate's egg of high passion and gory drama mixed with occasionally stilted and cliché-laden dialogue. The cinematography is curiously over exposed for much of the time and lacks enough of the colour and richness that a Tudor court would have possessed to near-excess . Maybe some artistic meaning is intended by this curious seoia tinged effect . If so then It's lost on me and much of the film simply looks like a badly faded print. I'd be disappointed if my photos came back from Boots looking like this. The supporting cast is headed up by an unconvincing 007-style Clive Owen as Raleigh. Whats up with Owen? His acting verged on drama-school at times, his timing and inflection weren't great and his West Country accent barely perceptible. He looked right. The roguish smile and the cocky stance were Flynn-esquire but when he opened his mouth... And the fire-ships scene where he swings from the rigging. Oh dear - pure silent-movie hokum. I was expecting Douglas Fairbanks to join in at any second. It no doubt seemed like a good, robust, macho scene on the story board but really it didn't work at all and for a few moments turned a largely well made and serious drama into a pantomime. Thankfully there are enough positive moments to overcame such flaws. The striking image of Mary Queen Of Scots in brilliant red gown looking up from the block prior to execution is exceptionally vivid and lingering scenes of Elizabeth bathed in light, more deity than monarch, also catch the eye. But when she stands on the cliff top, night dress billowing in the sea breeze, watching the Spanish Armada consumed by flames on the horizon I was expecting her to break into song. Pure MTV. But hey! It was enjoyable and griping in so many ways that the fluff and the silliness can be mostly forgiven. It's a movie after all, not an Open University documentary.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Very enjoyable viewing,"Contrary to some of the other comments on this site, I just saw the movie yesterday evening and I found it to be very enjoyable viewing with an excellent cast. Cate Blanchett was wonderful in this movie as were the other cast members. The actress who plays Mary Queen of Scots haunted me as I knew I had seen her somewhere before but couldn't place her. It was only just now when I checked with IMDb that I learned she was Agatha in Minority Report! Just couldn't shake where I had seen here before. I would like to comment on some of the other reader postings as well as touch on some of the points I found enjoyable about the film.1) That the movie depicts the Spanish as black-wearing religious zealots. Well...yes...and your point is? If you look at any period painting of the Spanish court and courtiers they are always dressed in black. The only exceptions usually being very young members of the royal family. As for being religious zealots you only need to open any history book to see the countless religious wars that the Spanish waged at the time. The persecution at home with the Spanish Inquisition. The later destruction of the Americas by Spaniards that destroyed anything they viewed as pagan and un-Christian. Religion was an obsession with the King of Spain who ruled under the idea that ""I will not, nor shall I ever be, King of a realm of heretics."" 2) That this movie depicted a woman prone to flights of fancy and girlishness. Well again, in every in-depth history book on the Queen you will find that she was exactly that. A woman who had a terrible, traumatic childhood where her death loomed every day. Who was suddenly thrust into rule, as a female ruler surrounded by males. Someone who was vain, girlish, tempestuous. All of these characteristics are well known to have been held by Queen Elizabeth I who later in life banished all mirrors from every palace and insisted on having her official portraits painted by just a few painters always depicting a younger personage. Someone who never felt the honest love of another person who didn't want anything from her. Who like everyone felt her youth fading with every year. I thought this was captured magnificently by Cate Blanchett in this film. Especially at that one beautiful scene with she and Raleigh in front of the fire where she secretly begs him for just one kiss. You can feel the insecurity and lovelessness in her every move and calculated word. I thought that was one of the best scenes in the movie.That the movie did not do justice to the Queen who ""invented modern drama."" Hardly. Queen Elizabeth's reign is given far too much credit in this department. If you look at the dates of many of the great Renaissance English dramas such as those produced by Shakespeare, you will find that the majority were written after her death in 1603. It was her successor King James that really patronized the arts, not so much Elizabeth. Elizabeth was actually more famous for never being able to make a decision. Upon her death, James inherited a whole host of problems. She deferred the execution of Mary for a very long time until finally every adviser told her that it had to be done as Mary had committed treason and for years was going around referring to herself as the Queen of England. That's eccentric if you are some beggar on the street, not when you are second in line to the throne. Finally she got her much overdue whack and roll.I also thought the sea battle was done very well. I did not view it as a ""rock em sock em robots"" filming. I thought the scene toward the end that showed the fleet in flames was very well done. If anything I thought this part of the movie could have been more gruesome and violent.As for Walter Raleigh's personality. I really don't know as I was not there. He is known to be a gentleman but also a pirate/privateer. He couldn't have been too courtly as he frequently attacked ships at sea, Spanish cities, and was thrown into the Tower on I believe at least two occasions. He is shown as gallant in the scene in the movie where he throws down his cape for the Queen to step across a puddle.All in all I thought this was a very enjoyable, rich movie. Fantastic settings, great costumes and interiors, a good sense of the period, the majesty, religious fervor, secret practices with plenty of the day-to-day courtly practices that the rulers of the time experienced. I would recommend it highly.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great British history reduced for American viewers,"I was deeply disappointed. While stirring in places, and unabashedly patriotic (finally- a film that is allowed English patriotism!) it misused the rich history for something muddled and ultimately void. The plot veers all over, with little organisation or synthesis. Characters come and go with little concern for story exposition or viewer comprehension. This Raleigh is certainly not the man I think of, and if the movie will show scant regard for true history (Mary Queen of Scots would have spoken with a French accent), then why would they not give Elizabeth the rousing words later writers gave her about having the body of a weak woman but the heart of a king - ""and a King of England""? Many of the scenes are completely over the top (especially during the turning point of the Armada battle with Philip reduced to obvious symbolism and Elizabeth standing around alone doing nothing but having the wind in the castle blow her clothes majestically)which are ultimately empty and do little to compensate for the emptiness throughout. www.lairdkeir.spaces.live.com",7.0,Anonymous,History

A Visually Stunning but Less Impactful Sequel,"Elizabeth: The Golden Age continues the story of Queen Elizabeth I, offering a grand, visually rich portrayal of her later reign. Cate Blanchett once again delivers a commanding performance, embodying the queen's strength and resilience while also showcasing her inner conflicts. The film excels in its lavish costume design and breathtaking cinematography, making every frame feel like a Renaissance painting.However, while the film is undeniably beautiful, it lacks the depth and political intrigue that made its predecessor so compelling. The focus on Elizabeth's personal struggles and romantic tensions sometimes overshadows the historical weight of the period. That said, the performances-especially from Blanchett and the supporting cast-keep the film engaging. Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a solid historical drama that may not reach the heights of the first film but remains an enjoyable and visually striking experience.",7.0,Anonymous,History
ruling a country may cost an Armada and a leg,"Back when I saw the first ""Elizabeth"", I found it OK if not a masterpiece; my friend and I discussed a joke version (the credits would feature Jackie Chan). ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" focuses specifically on the period when England went to war against Spain. The movie switches back and forth between Queen Elizabeth I's (Cate Blanchett) private and public lives (wondering about her role in the world vs. looking the imperious grand dame).Having not lived during the era portrayed, I can't verify the authenticity of anything in the movie. But overall, I thought that they did a worthwhile job looking at this particular time during Elizabeth's life (sort of like ""The Queen"" did looking at Elizabeth II). If there was anything that they didn't show that I would have liked to see, it was William Shakespeare (although he got famous after this period, so he probably wasn't important). Otherwise, I recommend the movie, if only to see once. If my review seems too short, sorry but I can't think of anything else to say.Also starring Clive Owen and Geoffrey Rush.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A Brutal, Dark and Humorous Movie","A brutal, dark and humorous movie. These words best express ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE. You will learn something about the royal court and about the history of England. The film is beautifully overwrought, although the main plot (a romantic triangle between the queen, discoverer and lady of court) is about nothing. Most of the time we are looking at these three characters, instead we could watch strategies, motives and intrigues of Spaniards. Spaniards appear in the movie only a couple of seconds (really only a couple!), paradoxically the story of the film is set in the war between England and Spain. It seems that the director had forgotten that it should not have been a movie about an imaginary love, but about Elizabeth and her most important role in the history of Europe- the war! Similarly seemed the final fight: do not expect any effects, most interesting things about it, you will hear in the “subtitled epilogue”.

A Wonderful Film About An Important Chapter in History!,"I enjoyed this film so much I actually watched it twice on the big screen! Something I have not done in a very long time. The acting, costumes, screenplay, cinematography and soundtrack are all fantastic! And, since this magnificent film is based on a true story it makes it all the more gripping!To all those who feel this film is in some way anti-Catholic, portraying historical truth does not make the Elizabeth: The Golden Age prejudiced. The Inquisition, Spanish, and otherwise, lasted for SEVERAL CENTURIES! All those nice people we watched in this movie would have been at best imprisoned, and at worst, put to death because of the Roman Catholic Church & their allies in the Spanish government had the armada succeeded in its mission.If the Spanish Armada had been successful the United States would probably not exist! England would of ended up a Spanish colony like the Netherlands eventually did! And all of history would have been radically changed for the worse. At least in England they had the Magna Charter! Spain's legal system, on-the-other-hand, was an absolute dictatorship. A legacy that did not end until 1975 with the death of the dictator Franco!! Quite simply, being Protestant made you a member of a minority religion in Queen Elizabeth's day! Thankfully, in most parts of the world we have now grown-up and accept minority religions as a fact of life. But during Elizabeth's reign you were literally putting your life on the line.

Vastly Underrated,"If, for no other reason, one rates this film on just it's visual appeal, it would score a 10. Perhaps the director is ""drunk"" on visual imagery. But compared to numerous pieces of mindless dross this film is just gorgeous to look upon. It does have an interesting plot and characters, and of course the excellent Cate Blanchett. Don't be put off by the negatives.. if you have the time and opportunity, put aside the negative reviews and just feast your eyes. I am not a particular fan of Clive Owen in this movie-he seems a little bland, but he performs adequately. But the center of the film is Elizabeth and as such Cate dominates-as she should.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"I have not seen the first part of Elizabeth, but was interested to see this one. I read the reviews on IMDb and they were on such extremes  from love it to hate it; very rarely something in between.The story is about Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) the queen of Britain in sixteenth century. There is religious war between Catholic and Protestants. Spain (a catholic country) wants to attach Britain (a Protestant country) with the help of France, overturn Elizabeth's rule and install a Catholic queen Mary Stuart (Samanthan Morton). In the meantime, Princes from various countries come with marriage proposals to the virgin queen. The queen gets attracted to Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) who robs Spanish ships, but he marries the queens' closest maid. In turn of events Mary Stuart is beheaded for planning to murder Elizabeth. Spain and France ships attach Britain. With the help of Elizabeth, minister Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffery Rush) and Sir Walter Raleigh Britain's army defend the borders.The movie starts with highlighting the core subject and like Bollywood movies dwells in comedy and romance in the first half, and emotions and drama in the second half ultimately ending with a fight sequence. A typical masala fair by Indian Director Shekar Kapoor (whose name remains hidden from all promotional and marketing materials of this movie  a case of discrimination? I don't know!) Cate Blanchett has given a tremendous performance with the range of emotions that she exhibits. As a general rule, public and political figures normally carry an expression-less face so not to convey their thoughts to anyone. But this queen Elizabeth was overly expressionist. For me sadly it looked more melodramatic than it usually should be.People who do not know details of history  would find this movie an entertaining, because it tries to present the historical plot in commercially viable manner. Otherwise, the movie and the behavior of characters may look stupid to say the least.Geoffery Rush is worth mentioning for his loyal characterization and immense acting skills. Clive Owen looks fabulous and acts well too! Both the writers of the film, William Nicholson and Michael Hirst  picked up from TV careers and given opportunity to work in a major international flick, try their best to fit a historical plot in a Bollywood story format.The photography and costume are very good. The sets authentic. Surely contender for nominations in various categories.If you close your eyes to minute readings of history, you can just sit back and enjoy this masala fair!

Cate Blanchett is quite good,"As a person, I don't care for Ms. Blanchett. But as an actress, I have come to admire her work. At times she may over do things a bit in this film but there are many more times she really shines.She is able to convey the possible personal aspects of Elizabeth I. Which is no small task. We are given a peek into some of the perplexing personal issues that this Queen may have faced, how she saw them and how she dealt with them.I have never seen the first movie in which Ms. Blanchett portrayed Elizabeth I, but now I may. It will be interesting to compare her most recent performance with her earlier one.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Intense and well told,"This film is the sequel of the Oscar winning film, Elizabeth. This film chronicles the events between Queen Elizabeth I and Sir Walter Raleigh, and the tension between England and Spain.The fine costumes are extravagant and lavish. Together with the well scouted locations, the film easily takes me back to the times when Queen Elizabeth I lived. Cate Blanchett is excellent as Queen Elizabeth I again. Camera work is good, and most shots are well composed. However, I find the shots that look through architectural features too excessive. There are several scenes which the architectural features take up most of the screen, and we only get a glimpse of what we really need to see. An extreme example is when Queen Elizabeth I kisses the ailing man towards the end of the film, we only get to see the scene through a hole. On the whole, this film is intense and the plot is told well. I can only admire Queen Elizabeth I for her firm belief in herself.",,Anonymous,History
Better than Golden Girls.,"With movies that are supposed to capture historic events, you never know what you are going to get. Sometimes you get movies like Saving Privte Ryan that entertain all audiences. And sometimes you get films like 300 that are over-bloated, over-dramatized, and way over-fictionalized that entertain some but not all.And then there is this - a movie that is fairly accurate and has nice acting. This is a movie that plays into the British arena of drama and history. While the story is good, the direction is OK. There simply wasn't enough of the defeat of the Spanish Armada and their French allies to entertain all.And while I did enjoy the rest of it, I still wanted that. If there is more on the fighting, then this film becomes a masterpiece. Instead, it receives a ho hum reception. So overall, its nicely done but well short of perfection. ""B""",7.0,Anonymous,History
All Hail Queen Blanchett,"A history lesson dumbed down so much that 7-year-olds could understand what's going on, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is nevertheless a wholeheartedly entertaining film. It reminded me of the fluffy, goofy historical epics Hollywood used to make back in the 1930s, when the emphasis was on romantic swooning rather than historical accuracy.Cate Blanchett could play a milk pail and keep me riveted, and she's dynamite once again as Elizabeth I, leading her country against the onslaught of the invading Spanish, who are intent on bringing the Inquisition to England. Blanchett is too good for material like this, but she gives it her all like a pro, and no amount of production design (and believe me, there's plenty to spare in this movie), could induce me to take my eyes off of her. Geoffrey Rush reprises his role as Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's right-hand man, but he's mostly relegated to the sidelines. Stepping up to front and center this time around is Clive Owen, who plays either explorer Walter Raleigh or Errol Flynn, I'm still not sure which. All I know is that by the end he's swinging on ropes like Douglas Fairbanks, carefully groomed chest hair blowing in the breeze, as the English navy takes its stand against the Spanish armada. Actually, the silent film reference could apply to the Spaniards as well -- they're so deliciously evil that you half expect them to start twirling their villainous mustaches. I hope all the Catholics out there have a good sense of humour.By the end, all attempts at realism have been swept aside, and the movie has descended into pure camp, Elizabeth practically calling down God's wrath to defeat the Spanish. And you know, Blanchett is such a good actress, I almost believe she COULD call down God's wrath if she wanted to. All I know is that when she shouts out the film's best line, ""My bitches wear my collars!"" I sure as hell sat up and took notice.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,History
Just saw it tonight,"This is easily one of the best movies I have seen all year. Cate Blanchett is unrivaled; if she doesn't receive a nomination for Best Actress, I will be shocked. The supporting cast is brilliant; the costuming is superb and the cinematography is glorious.I do have one complaint about the film, which is why I gave it a 9 instead of a full 10. Several scenes take place in Spain, with King Philip (and his ever-present, never-speaking daughter, whose purpose seems to be window dressing). Naturally, because they are set in Spain, all of the dialogue in these scenes is either in Spanish or Latin. Since I don't speak either language, I had pretty much no idea what was happening in these scenes. I wouldn't expect Spanish scenes to be presented in English, of course, but subtitles would have been helpful.Apart from the language barrier, I very much enjoyed this movie and would see it again. It's one of those rare sequels that manages to surpass the original.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Have we seen the same film?,"How can people say that it is bad? Maybe, just maybe, it is not as good as the first one. But it is still a beautiful masterpiece.The beauty of Elizabeth: The Golden Age lies in that it mixes simple, boring historical fact with personal things of her life- Her public side and her personal side. Because that's Elizabeth. She was most of all politics, but, once in a while, she had personal problems. But even the boring politics are made wonderful here because of Khapur's masterful camera and cinematographic games as well as great performances. It is all about mise en scene, this film.The sequel has the same relationship with its predecessor as The Godfather Part II: While the predecessor is about the transformation of the main character, the sequel is about the character's successful attempt to remain that way.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The way a biopic should be done,"This movie gets a 9 from me, and is a great example of how a Biopic should be done. Usually when you watch a biopic the producers and directors go in either one direction or another based on personal beliefs. They tend to either show somebody in a very negative or positive way regardless of any facts. This one showed an emotional sometimes irrational Queen in a humanistic light that was very refreshing.Cate Blanchett was amazing in the role of Queen Elizabeth. At times in the movie the viewer can't help but hate her, and at other times one can see the burdens that lay upon the Monarch and feels some compassion. Blanchett shows great skill in bringing this historic character to life in a very complex and extremely humanizing way. Never does one really grow to love the character but at the sametime you have to admire her. This surely was no puff piece (Kristen Dunst as Marie Antoinette anyone?) but it wasn't a negative one either.The only downside I saw was 2 fold. One Sir Walter Raleigh's relationship to the Queen. There was in fact rumors of a romantic relationship, but nothing substantiated as proof in history, and he wasn't a big hero against the Spanish Armada as portrayed. Second, I am kind of disappointed that the movie didn't mention more about her father. True, she probably had little love for the man, but I think he would have been a great topic since his split with the Catholic church brought about a lot of the turmoil Elizabeth had to face.All in all, This was a great movie, with great acting, sets, costumes, and pretty much many details. If you like period pieces and history definitely watch this one.",9.0,Anonymous,History
An Unnecessary Sequel But It's Surprisingly A Slightly Greater And Better Movie And Story Than The First Elizabeth,"8.5/10
I was coming to this movie with a very concerned feeling because i feel like it's unnecessary to make a sequel to the 1998 Elizabeth film, and i was even more concerned when i see the synopsis compare to the title, i don't want this film to have a story about Elizabeth Golden Age of romance instead of Golden Age of Elizabeth war lead supporter, and thank goodness they did not do that at least mostly, now i'm not gonna lie at the first 30 minutes i still have that strong concerned feeling, but as the time goes the movie became a little bit greater and better movie and story than the first one surprisingly, i also thoroughly enjoy the film from the beginning till the end, Cate Blanchett performance as Elizabeth is still as great if not better than the first one, there is still some mentionable nit picky here and there, and i believe my concerned feeling kinda impact my rating but it didn't really matter overall Elizabeth: The Golden Age is still an unnecessary sequel but like i said it's surprisingly a slightly greater and better movie and story than the first Elizabeth.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Didn't expect to like this movie about the ultimate Pirate Queen,"I'm mostly Spanish. To me Queen Elizabeth was not some well-meaning, noble monarch, but a desperate, royal cut-throat willing to send her countrymen out on numerous provocative raids. Every time I hear of a new treatment of the period, I'm always interested to see what the spin is. (In case you don't know, public relations got its real start back in Elizabethan times with the English trashing Spain's Inquisition.) There's no attempt to escape the pirate angle in this movie. What is toyed with is the idea that Elizabeth authorized the raids. And it may be the case that she couldn't control people like Sir Walter Raleigh, but nevertheless she did little to discourage their activity, or to turn away their profits. In this movie the question is made to appear one of the poor English holding off the much more powerful Spanish. Raleigh believes that when he takes from the Spanish, he weakens them and, therefore, protects Protestant England. That's probably an acceptable interpretation of events. You can't go praising theft otherwise.All that aside, I'm a fan of both Cate Blanchett and Clive Owen. And Geoffrey Rush is near perfect here. And now I can add the director to my list, Shekhar Kapur. I found the pacing, style and script wonderful and unusually entertaining and you'd have to ascribe a great deal of that to Kapur. Among the actors, Cate is especially excellent as she makes Elizabeth someone even I can admire. She really deserved some high praise for her portrayal, easily the best I've ever seen, and there have been quite a few over the years. About the only thing I'd quibble about would be the sets which seemed a little too opulent, having visited the Tower of London. I imagine the real Elizabeth wasn't quite so surrounded in splendor. Still, the art direction is quite effective. This is definitely a fine movie and well worth renting.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Needs More Clarity,"I understand what really happened during this time period but for someone who is not aware it is hard to follow. Overall though it was good but not too special except for Cate Blanchett. After her, the costumes and art direction it wasn't too great.The acting of this movie overall was OK. Cate Blanchett was phenomenal showing her vulnerability and the complexities in her character having to deal with so many problems and yet having to stay in control. She fit her part perfectly as she did in the first movie. Like the first she really actually gave you the feeling of what a queen from back then might have been like. I like Clive Owen but I hated hated him in this movie. His style was too cliché and what really brought him down was not really realizing the point of his character. I understand Blanchett is supposed to be in love with him but he really just feels like he could have been cut from the entire movie and it wouldn't of made the slightest difference. I would have liked to have seen Geoffrey Rush much more in this movie but unfortunately his role was very limited.The art direction and costume design was great. You could see some great photography and landscapes with great setup with the clothing. It was sort of able to fill the void with some of the mistakes made in this movie but it just was not enough.Overall though the directing and editing was poor. The directing failed miserably at giving you an idea of what is happening. Even if you do get it, the movie fails at really showing how this event makes Elizabeth important great and why it is important. This has to do with the editing a lot as well.I would recommend this movie strictly for Blanchett's performance.

What happened to the editing?,"I thought this had all of the components of an excellent movie...good actors, great sets, exciting plots, the costumes were excellent.

What ever happened to editing? The lack of it ruined this movie for me!!!!!! The synopsis at the end of the movie telling about the consequences of the loss of the Spanish Armada doesn't even appear on the screen, you can tell it's supposed to be there, you can see the top of the letters......weird. This is the worst edited big money movie I think I've seen in years. It's a shame because it's so good in so many other ways.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Elizabeth - rise from the grave and strike back,"I don't know where to begin with how awful this movie is. Perhaps a list: 1. The Music: Loud orchestra music to every scene - this rises to a crescendo and choral singing is added for the triumphant scenes - remember Damien?2. Reality: Elizabethan England obviously has contacts with 21st century orthodontists and speech and language therapists. Let's get real here - polished piano key teeth would not have been the norm and everyone would not have spoken in a terribly polite straight queen's English accent. There was no wind, no rain (except of course a full dramatic thunderstorm for the Armada scene), the castle's were all comfortably warm - hello this is England pre central heating and double glazing days.3. The poor queen. This woman is one of the greatest in English history who faced 70 years of adversity in a male dominated world. This film is an insult to her.4. We know who won the Armada. There is no point having white horses with flowing manes, Clive Owen swinging from the burning ship and Cate Blanchett stood on a headland looking like a figure who's lost its way from the titanic movie.

The finest actress of her generation,"The above comment of course refers to the wonderful Cate Blanchett.I have seen this movie today and once more find myself at odds with the many people who seem to have hated this movie.I can't understand this but I guess that is what makes IMDb such an interesting site.So many differences of opinion plus the chance for all of us to become reviewers.For what it's worth,these are the things that I wasn't so keen on in this film.It isn't historically accurate but that didn't bother me too much.I wanted to be entertained and not given a history lesson although I did learn quite a lot.The story did drag slightly at times and I felt that the battle scenes at the end were rushed,although they were very well done.I would say that the first movie 'Elizabeth' was better but that was a hard act to follow.A good job has been made of this sequel and it definitely is a worthy follow up.What impressed me was the quality of the acting with Geoffrey Rush,Clive Owen,Samantha Morton and Abbie Cornish all giving fine performances.It was a pity that Rhys Ifans wasn't used more as he was impressive in his role.The cinematography was excellent and the musical score was well suited to the movie.It must be said though that the movie belongs to Cate Blanchett who once again shows what a fabulous actress she is.She has a wonderful screen presence and I could't take my eyes off her whenever she was on screen regardless of who's she was acting with at the time.She probably won't win an Oscar for this film but she should do.I can't think of anyone that could have given such a commanding performance and this movie would be so much less without her.So 'Elizabeth:The Golden Age' isn't a perfect movie,but there is enough about it that is right and it is well worth watching.Plus there is Cate and that is reason enough to give this 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Grand Costume Drama About One Helluva Queen,"ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE is a costume drama based on the factual life of Queen Elizabeth I (played by Cate Blanchett, THE GOOD German). Blanchett reprises her role as the highly successful mother to a nation  England  from the 1998 film, ELIZABETH.With gorgeous costumes and scrumptious period locations, Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a very successful film. The dizzying camera work helps portray the immensity of the structures built for the times, and the dark qualities of rooms during stormy nights or barbaric incarcerations is shown exceptionally well.The focus on this film (versus that of its predecessor) is on the time of prosperity coming due for England as it comes out from under the oppressive thumb of the overzealous Catholic King Philip II of Spain (played by Jordi Molla) during the Spanish inquisition. The ultimate destruction of Spain's navy during a horrendous storm ushers in a time of peace for England. Initially Elizabeth is besieged with matters that demand her attention, all while loving vicariously through one of her women in waiting, ""Bess"" (Abbie Cornish) who is enamored (as is the Queen herself) with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen, SHOOT 'EM UP).Being able to reduce herself to a normal woman for even a brief moment is an incredible pleasure to the Queen, and Sir Raleigh allows her these moments whenever he's around. But both know that they can never be together; the Queen because of what's required of her as a noblewoman; and Raleigh because he's basically a pirate with no royal blood. But Raleigh gets as close as he dares by falling for Bess, and eventually marrying her, much to the dismay of the Queen (who, although she knew she and Raleigh could never be together, still dreamt of it).The end of the Spanish armada signals the end of many things: the end of threats from beyond the sea, the end of Elizabeth's possible marriage arrangements, the end of Mary Queen of Scots, and the end of any hopes for a life with someone the likes of Raleigh. But it also heralded a time of awesome prosperity during the incredibly long reign of one of the most successful leaders of the free world.Watching it, one can't help but wonder what would've happened had the Spanish fleet found purchase on the shores of England. Thankfully that never happened and, as an American, I'm doubly glad for it.This is a very well filmed historical costume drama with plenty of outstanding performances and scenery. But it isn't anything we haven't seen before (the aforementioned 1998 Elizabeth film is the prime example). Although there's plenty to look at, most viewers will probably say, ""Yeah. Seen it. Been there.""",8.0,Anonymous,History
Gross historical inaccuracy ruined it all,"I gave this movie one solitary star, and I suppose I will attribute that one to the actress who played Mary, the rival queen as hers was the only acting that stood out to me. Beyond her it seemed that the director had no ability to utilize the skill set of otherwise such great actors such as Geoffrey Rush.Worst of all, the movie bordered propaganda in its political incorrectness and it is becoming more and more of a frustration - as a non Anglo-Saxon - to watch movies such as these. Opening and ending titles which pitch England as the soul country to have fought Spain in those times and the immediate superpower afterwards, leave a wry taste in my mouth. If one makes historical costume dramas then at least tread the genre with some responsibility and don't grossly twist and distort history. As, during this particular episode in history, the French were fighting Spain and the Dutch were waging their war of independence from Spanish rule.Then, to end the movie with the words that England entered an era of peace and prosperity could have used the word 'relative'. As within half a century the country would plunge into civil war and declare one war after another over petty commercial rivalry.Make a fiction film if one cannot tell a story honestly. Otherwise you're a colleague of Leni Rievenstahl.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A Nutshell Review: Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"Cate Blanchett reprises her role as 16th Century Virgin Queen Elizabeth I in director Shekhar Kapur's sequel of sorts to Elizabeth (1998), which I can't recall if it made it to the local screens. However the DVD of Elizabeth was recently released on DVD here, but you need not have watched that movie because the events that transpire here are after the fact of her ascension to the Throne of England, and you need not be a history buff in order to get up to speed on the events that led up to the opening of the movie. Of course it does help a bit, so if you're choosing not to approach this blind, then you can pop over to Wikipedia for a quick synopsis.The movie begins with the threat of war with Spain looming on the horizon. Spanish King Philip II (Jordi MOlla), a devout Catholic, wants to wage holy war against England, of course to expand his empire, but under the guise of Relgion, since Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) is a Protestant. And to do so requires a reason to send his Armada across the English Channel, which involves making calculated political steps, counting upon those who are Catholics, and to throw his weight behind the supposed Queen in exile / imprisonment Mary of Scots (played by Samantha Morton) - here's where you'll probably need some background information to understand the intricacies of the English Mornarchy, in no part made even more complicated since Henry VIII was ruler before his, giving the family tree a healthy boost in the number of branches.The focus however, is still set on Elizabeth, as she goes about trying to deflect questions about her fertility, virginity, and singlehood (there's actually a good reason to why she stays single, not that she's unattractive, or have a lack of suitors). It's like a tale of two halves, where the beginning involves dalliances with her lack of love life, setting the stage for a triangle between herself, her favourite hand maiden Elizabeth Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish, whom the gossip mags credited for coming in between Ryan Phillipe and Resse Witherspoon), and suave pirate Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), who charms them with his tales of the high seas and the finding of the new world. Later to be Sir Walter Raleigh, his initial audience with the Queen was for funding his exploits, but later with Cupid's arrow, it becomes pretty much muddled with affairs of the heart, as we learn of the social impossibility between the Queen and the pirate, and the countless protocols that come with privileged women.Those who were expecting spectacular battle scenes, especially when the trailers have Elizabeth in full armour, rousing her troops, will be sorely disappointed, because history had already decided the outcome of the battle. Moreover, as far as naval warfare go involving ships with sails, Pirates of the Caribbean had already laid down the gauntlet as far as spectacular is concerned, and that unfortunately, had elements of the supernatural and the fantastical in its aid.But for a period piece, with foundation laid in history, coupled with a dash of artistic and dramatic licensing, Elizabeth: The Golden Age does serve up copious amounts of excellent acting, courtesy of Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush reprising her role as trusted adviser Sir Francis Walsingham and Owen, that it still makes it compelling to witness historical events put up on screen (of course with accuracy never being 100% anyway). Historical biographies more often than not have dramatic moments included to spice up proceedings, but this one had enough political intrigue and scheming draped with beautiful costumes to keep you engaged. Time to pick up the prequel!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Not that bad,"The film received mostly negative reviews when it came out, and still has to this day. To my surprise, it's adequate, although fairly average, and not that far below the quality of the original. It benefits from having a more structured plot, and the storyline is more about rising action and a climax (unlike the first). Blanchett is also quite impressive and I actually expected to think she was over the top (like I feel she sometimes is) but I think she plays it brilliantly, certainly not a nomination or performance I dismiss. Overall, it's definitely not nearly as bad as reviews would make me believe and once again the best thing about it is Blanchett.",,Anonymous,History

Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"Almost a decade later, director Shekhar Kapur follows up his critically acclaimed Elizabeth with Elizabeth: The Golden Age which includes the ethereal Cate Blanchett reprising her role as the famous regent.Now firmly settled into her throne, this second film follows Elizabeth facing the crisis of the invasion of the famous Spanish Armada. In addition to this she also has to deal with an internal crisis as she starts having great affection for Sir Walter Raleigh (played by Clive Owen)a pirate staying at the court. She obviously is unable to marry him being that she is the Queen, and a queen who has already refused many offers of princes from all of Europe.This is a glorious, sumptuous epic with award-caliber production. The cinematography is some of the best I have seen since Titanic, and the sets and costumes are magnificent. The sweeping score blends all the scenes together perfectly. Cate Blanchett's performance stands out from the star-studded cast as she reprises her role with a ferocious intensity.I have only one complaint with the film. It is the fact that the director changed Elizabeth's character into a woman publicly longing and pursuing a man in ways that reminded me of a giddy love-struck teenage girl with their first crush. It seemed out of character for a regally mature, sophisticated queen who should already have experienced such things and outwardly have moved on. This film is quite different in tone as the other one. It is much tamer (garnering a PG-13 rating compared to the R rating of the other one) and more entertaining with the love story and the climatic battle at the end. Even with the change and the rather major complaint the film manages to be a stunningly produced, acted, and compellingly wrought epic piece of cinema. It makes me hope Kapur will make the third of his planned Elizabethan trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,History

This Movie kicked ass took name and laughed the entire time!,I love old historical type movies and the work of everyone involved in this and Elizabeth were down to earth versions of real events. The Author definitely took the time to research every little detail.

Personally I believe that anybody who disliked this movie has no appreciation for history at all. So to the Cast and Crew I Salute You all. Thank you for bringing to life one of my favorite Era's. What really impresses me is how life like the sets were. They made you feel like you were really in the Castle. I just can't get enough of it. Also Cate Blanchett Rocks Queen Elizabeth.

what a disappointment,"Let's see now - this is a movie about Queen Elizabeth I in confrontation with the Spanish circa 1585. So where are the important players? Where's Leicester? Where's Sir William Cecil? Where's Drake? Where's Essex? Oh, yeah, in the first movie they said that the Earl of Leicester turned traitor against Elizabeth and participated in a plot to assassinate her. Cecil was real old and retired/fired by Elizabeth early on. Essex did't exist and Drake just kept in the shadows and did nothing important. Hmmmm.... Some peculiar history that Kapur has going on there. Just how are we to regard the relationship of this made-up faux Elizabeth to the real one? There were serious historical problems with the first movie that have only been made worse in this one. (They couldn't even leave the Tilbury speech alone; they just had to mangle it, too.) And yes, facts matter. Or would you accept a film biography where Lincoln went to Ford's Theater but left at the intermission? The only thing this film has going for it is Cate Blanchett, and it's not very kind even to her. She is basically there just to bellow in a ""regal"" fashion, flash a little eroticism here and there, and wear extravagant (and in some cases wildly inappropriate) costumes. The rest of the cast throws it away. Clive Owen in particular should be embarrassed at trying to create a Raleigh that should more properly be propped up as set decor for the next ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film.

I just wasted 12 seconds reading this review,"Reasonably historically accurate film, this was a good movie, there were some instances of historical fact that were presented in a vague manner (e.g. a sexual relationship with sir Walter Raleigh, historical consensus is that this actually happened), however most of the presented facts actually happened, the beheading of Mary queen of scots (after a lenghty internment in the tower of London), sea battle with Spain and huge storm aftermath that decimated the Spanish fleet and Elizabeth 1 died with no children to inherit the throne. Some of the battle scenes were excellent, In most movies historical script research is a very labor intensive affair, so before you condemn a movie GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT!!",,Anonymous,History
Nicely compelling,"At the end of the Tudor dynasty a queen rules over England. It's a time of great religion based conflict where the Catholics and the Protestants want to bash each others heads in. It's the time where the Spanish try to invade England with a massive armada.Not being a man of history I do not know how far the events depicted in this film deviate from the truth. What is depicted is a queen living her life in a this turbulent time. A queen that is imprisoned in her life, a queen that goes to war with her soldiers, a queen that is in many ways a normal person like any other (and that in many other ways isn't a normal person at all).The film is in effect a costume drama and those stand or fall by the way they get acted out and how events fit together. For me this film worked out very well. Cate Blanchett plays an excellent role as Queen Elizabeth and thereby carries the title role with verve. Clive Owen fits well as the more or less pirating adventurer that aids her in her life in many ways. All other actors revolve around them and each other in matching style. Added to that the events that keep the pace of the film going, a great musical score and a complete lack of unnecessary additions. So, added all together, it's a great compelling story that might or might not be true, and it's a great watch.8 out of 10 turbulent Queens",8.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing little piece of art,"Well, I have to say that I'm a huge fan of Queen Elizabeth I, but I don't know so much about history to be able to point the flaws or the rights of the synchronism between movie and real facts.But after watching and reading some reviews about the movie, seems that Shekhar Kapur flaws with The Golden Age (2007) the same way as he did with Elizabeth (1998). I mean... Shekhar is naturally excessively sensible and poetic with his movies, so all his devotion and all the historical figure that Elizabeth means for him is a lot iconic. So that's the way he portraits Elizabeth in both movies, as some kind of sacred woman guided by God's hands and not just and only a queen. He's not wrong because he, as a director, have all the rights to express all his artistic visions thru his work, but at the same time he exceeded it somehow affecting the final results and all the huge potentials of both movies in its historical meaning. So, both movies turned from historical movies to genre movies with all its romance and divinity icons humanized by Elizabeth.No words, technically it's an amazing movie. All historical rescues for the art direction are perfect and incredibly detailed by Guy Dyas who is responsible to transform The Golden Age from a low budget movie into a visually blockbuster one. Shekhar Kapur is also an amazing director who usually feed people with amazing and large shots over the huge and mesmerizing locations. As anyone here said before, sometimes we miss seeing more of the Elizabethan age in England than it's shown in the limited sets but all the production was so under limits that all that is shown is respectful.About the cast, Cate Blanchett is an actress that any comment is dismissed because she's always perfect and only her persona is the necessary to uplift any kind of movie. Shekhar said that The Golden Age would never be produced without Cate, and we can notice why. The strong and tenderness figure that Cate gives to Elizabeth is something that only her could be able to do. But talk about Blanchett's performance is not being fair with all the cast. Samantha Morthon as Mary Stuart is terrific. The moments which Mary Stuart appears are few and short but Samantha Morthon is a so amazing actress that her dazzling presence during the scenes are just a plus for the excellent choice for casting her. I think that all that Samantha represents as an excellent actress can be seen when Mary Stuart is under house arrest, the scene is superb and the camera could capt every single expression on her face, which are splendid.As I said before, Shekar is a so poetic director that every scene, every camera movement and every effect has a purpose, so, it's a lot recommended for those who watch this movie also check the DVD for the bonus for a better understanding of all the concept of the movie and its director. Maybe The Golden Age cannot be a great historical movie and suffer with some flaws but all the direction, acting and amazing art direction naturally covers everything that seems to fail. And all of that is more than one reason to watch this amazing little piece of art.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Costumes were lovely but script beyond awful,"We have a saying about mediocre movies, ""At least it was better than Borat."" Not this one. I was astounded at how many quality actors, designers and cinema professionals could be sucked into this piece of total junk. There was no script. The dialogue was too stupid to even be funny. Scenes seemed to be in random order. What little plot there was, was laughable. It was like amateur night at the improv bar. I've listened to drunken karaoke that was less offensive. I think the costumes were left over from the first Elizabeth movie, so they had to shoot them and pretend there was a story surrounding it. Honestly, I think high school students could have created a better product with little or no knowledge of British history or film-making. It was a train wreck. I would have walked out, but I was so shocked at how it got worse and worse, my legs would not hold me. I feel sorry for everyone connected with it.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Very well made and entertaining film !,"I saw ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age""(2007)in a cinema hall in New Delhi last afternoon. It is indeed a very well-made and entertaining movie, and I would definitely recommend watching it once in a hall on the large screen, some historical inaccuracies notwithstanding. The film is a visual delight, and the performances of the cast are first rate,esp. by Cate Blanchett, who has once again played the lead role with almost perfection.In my opinion, hers is an Oscar-worthy performance, and I'm pretty certain that she will at least get a nomination for the Best Actress category, even if not win it (that depends on the relative performances of the other four nominees in the category as well !). Cate Blanchett has truly brought out the majesty of Elizabeth, the individual and the undoubtedly great queen that she was.Kudos also to Shekhar Kapur (the director) and the twin writers who have done a great job.However, Shekhar should have been more circumspect and accurate in portraying the battle with the Spanish Armada (which in reality never occurred !). He too stands a pretty good chance in the Best Director category at the Oscar next year (in 2008).Finally, supporting actor Abbie Cornish (who played the role of Bess, Elizabeth's main lady-in-waiting) is a great looker, and the film is worth watching for her alone ! A very promising newcomer indeed...a British beauty in the classical sense.",8.0,Anonymous,History
excellent historical film,"Although I enjoyed this film which is based more on actual history rather than the hallucinations of the Hollywood scriptwriter, I felt it's one flaw was editing: there were several scenes in which I could not determine who was in the scene, who they were, and what they were doing. One lesser flaw was giving the wrong historical impression about the fire ships--leading those ignorant of the actual history to believe that the fire ships had actually annihilated the Spanish Armanda. In fact, the fire ships primarly broke the formation of the armada, sending them northerward in the storm to circle Scotland in order to get home. As the armada ships became wrecked on British shores and in Ireland, the hapless seamen were captured and tortured to death by Elizabeth. None of these most dramatic historical events show up in the film. nevertheless, I gave the film a 9 out of 10 for its excellent acting by Kate ( despite the lack of chemistry between her and Clive Owen), in gratitude for a most compenent film rich and lavish in historical reenactment. I was especially impressed with the fireship scenes (leaving me wanting even more, despite the fact that in most ""action"" films I want far less).",9.0,Anonymous,History
Hogwash in costume,"If your looking for a history lesson, you'd do better with Toy Story. This fluff-piece is a joke compared to its predecessor which has as much historical value as a wooden nickel. Apparently, according to this film, Elizabeth Tudor whined and whimpered and yelled all her queenly life in over-lit hallways that suggest that the halogen lamp was invented in the 16th century. Not a shadow to be seen on these movie sets. This time around, Elizabeth mopes and screams and whines like a jilted fifteen year old. Her maid in waiting, Bess Throckmorton, apparently missed all her acting classes because she could do nothing more than stare and vaguely smile. Clive Owen, who shows no more acting ability beyond that of a disembodied foot, looks like a cheap cartoon version of Errol Flynn in tights as he bandies around on ship ropes. He obviously texted in his role, sounding almost as dull and talentless as Liam Neeson doing Shakespeare. Even Bette Davis' version with Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland, another fluff piece, had the smarts to portray Elizabeth as a real queen, acerbic, angry, confused, intimidating to her suitors, but ultimately capable of running a powerful country, taking up more space than her underlings. Here, Cate Blanchett, whines and sobs like she had just failed her SATS and does nothing more important than wear clothes. Some scenes are so ridiculous, you'd thing you were watching a back story of the making of Project Runway. Cate Blanchett, in this version, seemed more interested in the buffet for the cast members than acting like she ruled one of the most powerful forces in European history. The only interesting piece centers on the revisionist version of Mary, Queen of Scots. Unfortunately, like half the film, her demise is filmed entirely in slow motion, making her drawn-out execution last longer than her actual life. This film would have cost half the time to watch if they hadn't filmed so much of it in slo-mo. Snore. This is the crib notes to history, lazily made for coasting high-schoolers, most of whom cheat on tests and are no more interested in actual history than the wigs on their head and their designer's dresses. Which brings us to the trumped-up reason for Elizabeth's white makeup and hair pieces. In this film, the writers want to give the impression that Elizabeth's most important decision was to become a born-again virgin. In reality, she suffered from eczema, lice and rickets. Her appearance and hair faux paus were more an excuse to cover up those maladies, not a goth need to look wacky to her subjects. While the previous film suffers from revisionism and loose attention to history books, it has beauty and depth this film lampoons. At worst, the first film avoids looking like it's brightly filmed on the set of ""Friends."" And, strangely, in a story about an historical figure whose beauty, or loss of it, Cate Blanchett is not only very attractive but the only character that doesn't age. My advice: stop reading magazines about body consciousness, get the heck off your pointless cell phones, stop watching ""Stupid Vapid Housewives from Any County, and read a book on this amazing woman in English history. She took up a lot more space than this waste of celluloid implies.",2.0,Anonymous,History

Elisabeth created a huge English navy,even bigger than the Spanish one and sent it to the north spain.About 20.000 English soldiers died in that adventure and most of the English ships. So,why don't u make a movie about that part. At the end of the movie Elizabeth appears like the owner of europe,but wasn't true,Spain remained and kept the whole empire in Europe for 50 more years until we started to loose Holand and Belgium.

Unimpressed,"Normally, Cate Blanchett leaves me thoroughly stunned with her amazing acting talent. Every movie she's played in I've enjoyed to watch. However, this was the exception.As Elizabeth, Blanchett tries unsuccessfully to portray a pensive, religious, and strong-willed woman. However, the I've-just-seen-something-I-strongly-disprove-of look she has throughout the film just didn't cut it for me. That, and the mysterious persona she conveys makes her look more like she's craving attention then trying to withstand from it. Also, all of the extra female characters looked the same, which got incredibly confusing. The men did, as well: each had brown eyes, brown hair, and brown stubble.I'll admit the costume design, for which the film won the Oscar, was thorough and beautiful...on the women. However, men strutting around in pantaloons made me laugh each and every time.Overall, I though Blanchett could've done way better. 3 out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Painfully long & slow,"What can I say, the 1st Elizabeth was simply great, the kind of movie leaving you riveted to the edge of your seat! Unfortunately this one is very much the complete opposite. So yes the costumes are great and the few CGI special effects (basically the couple of minutes of action featuring the ships of the Spanish Great Armada) are well made.But apart from that it's a 2 hours torture that could have easily been reduced to a half-hour. There's no rhythm, it's very very slow, with many supposedly ""key"" scenes just dragging on & on & on (e.g. the execution, the baby, the kiss, etc etc...). The trailer pretty much shows what's worth watching out of the 2 hours movie, how sad is that? Kate Blanchett's acting is possibly the only positive note overall & Clive Owen is pathetic as usual (though his worst performance is still Children of Men). As for Geoffrey Rush I really like him but he doesn't have much to do in this movie.In the end, you feel the director made an attempt to picture some kind of intimate portrayal of Elizabeth: her fears, her doubts, her loneliness... Fine, but then stick to making some BBC TV documentary. Because for a full-length cinema feature it's definitely not good enough! Kapur should have stuck to the winning formula that worked so well for the 1st movie: the intrigues, the twisted plots, the action...Sorry, just didn't do it for me.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Cate Blanchette a joke that should play Reinhardt Hiendrich,"Shekhar Kapur once again gives us a complete distortion of history of the reign of Queen Elizabeth the first. The casting of the very masculine Cate Blanchett as Queen Elizabeth is also disaster as the original Queen Elizabeth was a highly sexual creature from the age of about fourteen. Furthermore Queen Elizabeth was a very stoic person who showed no emotion to anyone in an age where royalty really was a sign of divinity. Cate Blanchett and the director are unable to capture the ruthlessness of the Queen Elizabeth nor even a close track of the historical sequence of events. There are many period films depicting great sea battles and this one is not that impressive. Geoffry Rush appears as Sir Francis Walsingham adviser to the Queen but is better suited to playing an Evil Pirate in line with his acting ability.There have been much better films about the reign of Queen Elizabeth the first and the events at the time but students should stick to the documentaries and History texts if they want academic credibility.I think this film would have been more entertaining if Shekhar Kapur gave it the Bollywood treatment with lots of Indian costumes , singing and dancing around decorated trees and re;eased it in his native India. I really believe that Cate Blanchett is best suited to Bollywood films or playing a the role of her look alike General Reinhardt Heinrich head of the Nazi Gestapo.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Elizabeth: The Golden Age  seriously lacking in shine,"I was highly disappointed in the sequel to the first Elizabeth. The title of this movie is ""Golden Age"", but we've been given nothing in the plot that describes to the viewer what Elizabeth did to make it the the Golden Age in England. Queen Elizabeth 1 was one of the greatest monarchs England ever had, and this film does little to show that. True, the film making is beautiful, the costumes are breathtaking, but beyond that the movie is a filled with pompous fluff. More attention should've been given to a better filming of the battle sequence, historical accuracy, development of historical details and dialog. The dialog is more concerned with being quotable and poignant without actually feeling like a real conversation amongst the characters. While trying to be regal it comes off as pompous and full of hot air. I'vie done a great deal of historical reading not only on Elizabeth, but on the Tudor family in general; and while this movie had the potential of being a great historical epic, it simply becomes a silly, expensive soap opera and a waste of the talented actors who star in it.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Catholic-bashing in this time of supposed ""tolerance?""","Can you say ""hypocrites?"" From all corners of the nation, we hear countless cries of injustice and intolerance whenever the ACLU or any other tolerance watch-dog thinks they've caught the merest glimpse of gay-bashing, anti-Semitism, racism of all sorts, and other social atrocities. Yet does that stop anyone, ANYONE, from seizing the opportunity to defame Catholics and the Catholic Church? Where are the cries of the ACLU then? Why don't celebrities and talk-show hosts take a moment to speak about the damaging, hurtful injustices and prejudices when the Catholics are attacked? And here we go once again with yet another history-slaughtering blunder of after-school-special fiction that deems it necessary to skew people's regard for a religion beloved by more people in this entire world than any other religion (~1.5 billion at last count, by the way). But don't take my word for it. I now quote a film critic who has put to words the ineptitude and injustice of this latest bit of hacker's work. Steven D. Greydanus writes:""A lurid sort of Christopher Hitchens vision of history pervades Elizabeth: The Golden Age, Shekhar Kapur's sequel to his 1998 art-house hit Elizabeth.The earlier film, which made a star of Cate Blanchett as the eponymous Virgin Queen, celebrated the triumph of bright, happy Elizabethan Protestantism over the dark, unwholesome Catholic world of Bloody Mary. Even so, that film's church-bashing was tame compared to that of this sequel, in which everything bad, evil and corrupt in the world is ultimately the bitter fruit of Religion. And by Religion, I mean Catholicism.""I will not punish my people for their beliefs  only for their deeds,"" says Elizabeth, conveniently forgetting that in the last movie she rammed the Act of Uniformity through Parliament, outlawing the Catholic Mass and imposing compulsory attendance at Anglican services. In this version of history, the hosts of Catholics martyred under Elizabeth are all traitors and conspirators. ""Every Catholic in England is a potential assassin,"" Elizabeth's advisers helpfully remind her in an early scene. Well, then, every Catholic in England is a potential political prisoner too.""One day, maybe justice truly will be had for all. Until then, we Catholics must persevere as well as we are able in such a hateful, bigoted, hypocritical mess we call America.",2.0,Anonymous,History
A hackneyed and over-baked Elizabethan soap opera,"Elizabeth: The Golden Age attempts to bring us something new in the currently overcrowded realm of Tudor dynasties and kingdoms. In the past few years we have gotten HBO's stunning Elizabeth 1 and Helen Mirren's QE2, The Tudors, and the soon to be released Mary, Queen of Scots and The Other Boleyn Girl. Unfortunately Elizabeth: The Golden Age is just a recycled rehash of these films and a souped up costumed soap opera.The film covers the ground late in Elizabeth's life prior to the Spanish Armada. With the lack of an English male heir, the Spanish kingdom is closing ranks on her throne, pushing forth their candidate to rule the English throne.Elizabeth is the meantime is swept up in her dealings with the smooth Sir Walter Raleigh. She is supported by the pretty but pointless in terms of story lady-in-waiting Bess Throckmorton, and Geoffrey Rush who is surprisingly reserved as her counsellor Sir Francis Walsingham. While all the actors involved are undoubtedly talented, they don't really have anything to do and their efforts are wasted on the atrocious script which amounts to nothing more than soap operatic gazing and tantrums.Not even Blanchett can save this train wreck of cardboard cut-out characters, juvenile musing and tantrums, simplification of the English and Spanish characters, and their respective puerile depictions of good vs evil. To top it off, the nauseating musical score only accentuated the sensationalized soap-operatic elements of this overblown cheese.Kapur seems to have gone downhill from the last Elizabeth. This ""sequel"" was atrociously and pretentiously shot. Such direction involved blocking the characters form the camera with all manner of stupid objects from frames to walls and lights, shooting from ridiculously pointless angles such as ceilings and poorly edited scenes, jumping from time frames across England and Spain with no continuity of what is happening throughout the story.There have been so many better recent adaptations of Elizabeth. The trick is not to create something better than the last, or the umpteenth version of Elizabeth and Essex, but for audiences who crave more of one of our most enigmatic leaders; something that is unique, different and not merely a rehash of soap operatic whining and outbursts. Such material as The Golden Age that would be better off on the front pages of a tabloid magazine. Honestly in the end, I just didn't care.",5.0,Anonymous,History

It portrays Elizabeth I as a whiny, indecisive, scorned woman who preferred feigned affection over the real power that she had. It is an insult to the historical Elizabeth and to Cate Blanchett who has been so amazing in the past. The first movie based on Elizabeth's life set the stage for who she was to become and how her reign brought about England's golden age. This movie should have been a continuation on that theme.

Fact: the hero of the Spanish Armada has Drake, a brilliant tactician, who gets hardly a mention here. Fact: while fire ships were one tactic he used, the Armada was destroyed by the superior tactics and armament of a Navy that was about 80 years more advanced technologically: they had much faster, more maneuverable ships and much longer range artillery; they lay out of range of the Spanish guns, pounded them to pulp, and then closed in for the kill with their much more nimble vessels.

Worthy production contradicts an underdeveloped screenplay,"The second installment of Queen Elizabeth's cinematic chronicles finds all the necessary ingredients returning to impart a classy experience, namely director Shekhar Kapur and Cate Blanchett in the title role. While much of the sumptuous production inherent in such a big studio period piece certainly delivers to the eyes, the plot's bumbling maneuvers cannot help but take viewers out of most of the queen's inner turmoil this film was supposed to be convincing us of, leaving little more then a stylized costume melodrama in it's place. Blanchett, never less then admirable in any role, feels underutilized in a script that coasts by with the conviction of a glamorous history lesson.None of it rears off-ramp too noticeably, but in general the movie will chiefly apply to British history buffs; even if massive liberties were probably taken, the specificity of these poorly developed subplots feel pre-made for those already fixated upon Elizabeth's recent resurgence in entertainment.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Great actors in a film that promises more than it delivers.,"This movie is the sequel to ""Elizabeth - The Virgin Queen"" (1998) and, like all sequels, suffers from an inferiority complex towards the original film. It is a regular historical film, which depicts a key moment of Elizabeth I's reign of England: the Invincible Armada and the English resistance to Spanish ambitions. And Cate Blanchett (who continues to give life to the English queen) is still brilliant in her role, almost being able to become the queen that herself. Unfortunately, as in the first film, this effort follows without the merit and appreciation of the critics and the Hollywood Academy (the Oscar nomination for Best Actress that year did not pass that same). Geoffrey Rush continues to give body to Sir Francis Walsingham and do it with great talent and ability, even though his character has not here the strength it had previously. Clive Owen is perfect in the role of Sir Walter Raleigh and reaches, with this film, one of the most interesting works of his career so far.Historically, unlike the previous film, it didn't seem very able to be faithful to the truth. The script is too imaginative and too much focused on an unlikely and theatrical affair between the Queen and Walter Raleigh. The Spanish Armada is barely portrayed and the struggle between English and Spanish, the natural film climax, ends up being completely emptied of relevance, which makes no sense and puts in question the film edition, and the quality of the script. In fact, there was no ability to foresee the importance of this point for the film's outcome. If the director (Shekhar Kapur) and writers (William Nicholson and Michael Hirst) thought that Blanchett's great interpretation, a very good cast, scenery, clothes and some romantic suggestions would be enough to save the film, they're wrong. Do not make omelets without eggs, says the people, rightly so. This film had everything to be better, to match its predecessor, but a bad script and editing laid everything to lose.Despite its a very still and boring movie (sometimes seems that people have forgotten that they're almost to be invaded), this film is quite reasonable and worth seeing, especially for the excellent work of the actors.",4.0,Anonymous,History
clive owen should never wear puffy shirts,"I liked the first Elizabeth with a fresh Cate Blanchett and Joseph Fiennes. This movie was putrid. The dialogue was wretched - Elizabeth to Sir Walter Raleigh: ""I need something from you. And I haven't had it in a long, looong time."" It's not what you think, either. And when the lady-in-waiting Bess asks Raleigh if a sailor's life isn't lonely, he replies, ""Sometimes.... But it's the life I've chosen."" These were two times when I actually couldn't help myself from laughing out loud.Cate Blanchette and Samantha Morton are terrific actresses, usually.

Flawed visually resplendent melodrama,"Almost a decade after the release of ""Elizabeth,"" director Shekhar Capur and star Cate Blanchett return in ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"" a film which loosely bases its plot from the life of Queen Elizabeth I of England during her 27th year of reign.After vowing a life of celibacy, Elizaveth is now pressured into marrying by her adviser, Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), in an effort. One of her suitors is Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) who returns from an expedition to the New World and swoons the Virgin Queen with tales of having named an island after her. Meanwhile, King Philip II of Spain prepares to launch a holy war against England and her Protestant queen.Visually the film is an eye candy - Remi Adefarasin's shots are nicely composed, and the production design are nothing short of remarkable. But the film is replete with subplots suffering from an uneven script and pacing that the film ultimately becomes a forgettable melodramatic affair. Blanchett delivers a solid performance and is virtually the lone bright spot, while the likes of Owen, Rush, and Abby Cornish as the queen's principal lady-in-waiting fail to impart a commanding presence.What results is a film of deluxe design but lacking the emotional force to be truly involving. And the liberal use of history probably won't win additional affection for this queen either.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Insult to Ingelligence,"Even worse than its predecessor. This movie offends anyone with a minimum of culture and knowledge/interest about history and it must be written by someone that never went to school.Only to mention some of the many historical lies and inaccuracies:No mention to the bloody prosecution of Catholics and support to piracy and rebellion in Netherlands that provoked the war with Spain.Philipp II was a prudent man and a bureaucrat, spending most of his time working in the administration of his kingdoms. He created the first modern administration, not the dark ""king of orcs"" that this movie depicts.The Armada was not a defeat, only 2 ships were lost, and some were lost to storms, but most of the Armada returned to Spain. After that, the Drake-Norris expedition against Spain was the worse English defeat in history. Drake was accused of cowardice and relieved from the navy. That war was finally won by Spain.If we consider this film as a fiction, it also poor and uninteresting with a very week plot and story.

Never Never Lie About History!,"Elizabeth the Golden Age gets off to a bad start with a Clinton-like lie (in the first 3 minutes) about Elizabeth guaranteeing religious freedom to the Catholics in England --- kind of like Michael Vick saying he's kind to dogs -- it's like starting a fine dinner and finding a cockroach in the salad. There is NO REASON to distort history in a movie.Beyond that, Universal has taken one of the most interesting situations in English history and filmed it with mundane boredom. Except for Cate Blanchett in the title role all the players are dull and lifeless. Add to the mix the strange (LSD induced?) dream scenes and we get a film which offers the audience precious little.Imagine this story being filmed by the high talent giants at Warner Brothers or 20th Century-Fox 40 to 50 years ago. The story would engage the audience with fire, and likely be a classic. Oops! Oh, right! They DID film it back then -- more than once -- and each was a classic.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Rent the HBO Elizabeth I Instead,"I have fond memories of 'Elizabeth' staring Cate Blanchett and I had seen an interview of her on TV where she spoke of wanting to bring something new to the role. I had high expectations when I entered the local movie palace from the 1920s, which the film failed to meet.My only reaction to Geoffrey Rush was to think that I had seen him to it better before and that he was old and tired in the role.Clive Owen brought too little to his role and left me with more questions that answers about Raleigh.Jordi Mollà was opaque as King Philip II of Spain.Cate Blanchett added nothing to our understanding of Elizabeth I that we hadn't learned from 'Elizabeth' and HBO's excellent 'Elizabeth I'. She was so mysterious as Galadriel in 'Lord of the Rings' and so ordinary as Elizabeth. She should have waited ten more years to return to the role or studied with Helen Mirren.The film's attention to detail provided the highlights.

Elizabeth 1: The Golden Age needs a third film,"Elizabeth 1: The Golden Age gets only an average: 5. But the acting gets 8 (9 for Cate Blanchett), the rest only 3. Why only 3? The director Shekar Kapur in his second part of Elizabeth 1 (first part 1998) provides marvelous parts such as Elizabeth's court when receiving the ambassadors and Sir Walter Raleigh, the hectic preparation for defending England against the Spanish Armada 1588 and the dramatic naval battle. But the rest is very much Bollywood stuff, though Shekar Kapur is not an Indian but from Pakistan. Great improvements to England were made under Elizabeth's rule. The incorporation of the East India Company which ruled India until 1857 before the rule was taken over by the English Crown. The modest beginning of stock exchange trading (influence of the Dutch), development of industry (textile, mines and naval construction), better agriculture, the acceptance of the growing role of the middle classes, better conditions for the poor... Secondly, the role of Sir Walter Raleigh does not do justice to his importance. No emphasis on his contributions as scholar, soldier, sailor and statesman, just emphasis in the film on his piracy, colonization of Virginia and his sex appeal. The thoughtful viewer is ignored, just historical froth is served up. Shekar Kapur can do better. Let's hope he can be given the opportunity to rise to the challenge in a third definitive version of Elizabeth 1.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"Elizabeth, the golden age","I saw this for the first time last Saturday night and whilst it has a 'top' Hollywood cast list I find once again that it another English historical take 'Americanized'! Not only do they change the plot to suit themselves at convenient moments, the get the facts wrong as well. The biggest gripe I have is about Mary, Queen of Scotts who having been brought up in France at the french court from a young age spoke with a french accent not a Scottish one as depicted in the film.(something like Russell Crowe in Robin Hood who spoke with an Irish accent) This irritated me no end. This may seem like a petty gripe, and it is I agree but I just feel if they are going to spend all that money making some thing so historical, then at least get it right!There are of course plenty of other inaccuracies which have been mentioned in previous reviews so I will not mention them again. I liked Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth, she brought a show of strength to the part which of course is what Elizabeth was famous for but her pronunciation of Raleigh's surname was another irritation.It's not Ray..leigh it's Rall..eigh! Drake was more instrumental in the defeat of the Armada having let the fleet enter the channel and then opening fire. The English fleet were smaller and able to turn around better in the channel and were at no time being demolished by the Spanish.The English only lost 8 men in the entire battle whist the Spanish lost almost the entire fleet. Bad weather certainly did not help the Armada but credit must most certainly be given to the English and not the Spanish. I suggest a good read of David Starkey's Monarchy books which covers all aspects of each and every one of our rulers through the ages with an honest appraisal of each one, then the Americans may just get it right!",3.0,Anonymous,History
no match for the first movie,"Director Shekhar Kapur tries with this sequel to ride on the success of his first 'Elizabeth' movie one decade earlier. However, despite the promising premises of a story of love, war and politics centered around one of the most fascinating characters in the history of England and of the world he largely fails. His rendition of the crucial years of the reign of Elizabeth the time when the English monarch renounces marrying ever, faces internal rebellion from her Catholic subjects, decides to execute Mary Stuart and is caught by the remorse of this deed, lives the impossible passion for the pirate turned politician lord Walter Raleigh, and eventually faces the deadly danger of the invasion of England by the then superpower Spain to prevail in glory and make out of England a great nation tend to be accurate in their historical details but lack the power to create emotion. The counter-performance is even more amazing taking into account that a magnificent team of actors serves the director in this film. Individually the performances of Cate Blanchett, Clive Owen, Geoffrey Rush or Samantha Morton are each of them close to the best level we can expect from such fine actors, but they somehow do not link one with the other and fail to interest the viewer on the human plane. The emotional response from viewing this second 'Elizabeth' is similar to the one of seeing a fine documentary or docudrama about that historical period. Too little for such a gathering of talent.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Not nearly as good as it could have been,"I must admit, I am a sucker for historical films. But this one just confirmed what I see time and time again in the modern cinema - you may have all the money in the world, incredible cast, unbelievable production level and breath-taking art, but if your story and script are weak and the director lacks vision and pace - it will be a failure. This movie is a perfect example of that. The characters are very underdeveloped, the only one which is actually impressive is that of the King of Spain. Editing lacks pace, there is no climax and most of the time I wondered where all this is going? Ridley Scott should have directed this film and he'd make a masterpiece.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Another Romanticized Look At Queen Elizabeth I,"As historical epics go, I have to say frankly that I've seen better movies than this one. Even just on this general subject, one can go back to 1939's ""Elizabeth and Essex"" for a more interesting (if overly romanticized) portrayal of Elizabeth, and 1986's ""Lady Jane"" provided a far more interesting look at behind the scenes action in the Tudor court (admittedly from an earlier era than ""The Golden Age."") ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" (with Cate Blanchett in the title role)deals essentially with the events leading up to the eventual defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. Like the 1939 movie, this one also is overly romanticized (no one seems able or willing to take a cold, hard look at Queen Elizabeth I), and plays at length on Elizabeth's personal fascination with Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) while at the same time hinting (without any substantive historical foundation that I'm aware of) of an intimate relationship between Elizabeth and her favourite Lady in Waiting Bess (played by Abbie Cornish), who eventually becomes Raleigh's wife.Blanchett and Cornish were both very good in their roles; Owen not particularly convincing to me as Raleigh. The most interesting part of the movie dealt with Elizabeth's angst over what to do with Mary, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton) who is Elizabeth's prisoner, the angst being both personal (the two were related) and diplomatic. The actual confrontation with the Armada is restricted to the last half hour or so, and isn't really all that significant a part of the story (except insofar as the threat of it provides the backdrop to a lot of what happens.) I thought the story often seemed to bog down, which sometimes made it hard to follow, and there was some questionable camera work which also made the movie difficult at times. Some of those technical weaknesses were made up for by magnificent costumes and elaborate sets that did give a ""you are there"" flavour. Still, I thought this at best an average movie. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History

disappointing venture,"Elizabeth: The Golden Age – TRASH IT (C-) After watching Elizabeth it was hard to believe that the same director can make such shallow, tedious Elizabeth movie. Everything we fall in love with Elizabeth was gone in this movie. Nonetheless Cate Blanchett was superb and astonishing as she was in Elizabeth but it's the mediocre script which wastes so much time on mockery and love story between the pirate, the Queen and her Lady. Abbie Cornish is overrated, she is boring and even as Queen's lady she doesn't have the elegance. She is sure pretty but not elegant. Clive Owen is misfit and I actually don't really like him. I don't think he ever gave a Hit movie. And this man has worked with Angelina Jolie, Julia Roberts, Keira Knightely, Nicole Kidman and here with Cate Blanchett. I mean he has worked with all big directors and actress but never sure shot hit in years. Overall, don't waste your time on this disappointing venture.

Step down from the first,"I find it hard to find even one sequel that is clearly superior to the original and Elizabeth:The Golden Age isn't one of them. Although this film has more action,with the plot centered around the Spanish Armada,it feels almost more melodramatic than the previous. Like the first the film has no direct storyline and is comprised of many smaller ones involving Spain,Scotland and court intrigue. The Stoccish and Spanish,primarily the latter,serve as the villains in this film but are portrayed in such a cartoonish fashion that they lose all gravity. Watching them sitting around in dark rooms,inordinately discussing their plans you half expect them to suddenly break out in a deep,manical laugh.
The best thing in Elizabeth is Geoffery Rush's supporting role which is unfortunately further contracted in the sequel. In his place,as the male lead,is Clive Owen as Sir Walter Raleigh. There is nothing glaringly wrong about Owen's performance but he just isn't very authentic as the character. Cate Blanchett was once more nominated as Elizabeth(proving unsuccessful the second time as well) and while the character she plays is the same,Elizabeth's older and different physically and mentally.Elizabeth:The Golden Age is at its core a dramatized version of history that distantly resembles a soap opera. It isn't vastly inferior to the first but its definetly a step down.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Strangely...,"... all greatest actors need trying their chance with Shakespearean roles, and all greatest actresses are fascinated with the role of Elisabeth I. Only that this ambition is sometimes risky: much as I would find Cate Blanched fascinating in the role of young Elisabeth, there is a predecessor that shadows her brilliant performance, and that's Glenda Jackson.Cate's character is too attractive for a queen whose ugliness used to be written of by the chronicles of her time. Besides, Elisabeth the movie does not seem to be based on research: Tudor palaces did not have large stone Gothic chambers, but relatively small wood panelled ones. Watching Elisabeth the movie I had the impression I was rather watching a Niebelungen story. However, taking into account that the focus of the movie limits to Elisabeth's early years on the throne, the dangers she faced, her early relationship with Dudley, and her forays into the marriage game, we could assume that, given a better chance to deepen her character, Cate would have matched Glenda Jackson's performance.

Not just Movie Real,"""Elizabeth  the Golden Age"" (2007): I think it's fair to first mention what I said about ""Elizabeth"" (1998): ""I continue to be amazed at the early, huge talent of Blanchett, surrounded by the talents of other actors, set in this world of stone and silk, blood and wine, golden crowns and poisoned gowns. Every time I see this film, I like it more. Perhaps it's not as huge in scope as ""Lawrence of Arabia"", but of equal quality when it comes to being a character study. It just doesn't get any better than this. The transformation of a girl into a woman into a reluctant, then resigned, then powerful queen, surrounded by liars, schemers and self-centered fools, is powerful history enough. Add the very best acting, sets, & costumes that feel REAL (not Movie-real), and a point that never veers away from it's goal, and I've got a film I'll see numerous times. Cate Blanchett is the best."" Now: ""Elizabeth  the Golden Age"" is a great followup effort. All I've said about the latter applies to this one, and I add that the shift from the first ""dark"" film to this, a film full of light, is an interesting visual symbol for the changes in England (not to mention the darkening of Spain). This part of the story is ""grander""  bigger  with huge events  less about the growth of Elizabeth, and more about England and its goals. It DOES get personal, but all is repeatedly set aside for the sake of what was seen as British destiny. This would make a wonderful double feature.",,Anonymous,History

Blanchett's Elizabeth, remarkable as it was, did not rise to that level for me.
