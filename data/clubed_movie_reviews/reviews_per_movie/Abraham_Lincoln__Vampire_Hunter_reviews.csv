Joyously Bonkers!,"It is what it is, a nutty premise made in nutty fashion, but for the undemanding horror fan there's a good time to be had here. Action choreography is of a very good standard, as is, perhaps surprisingly, the CGI. The history aspects of the story, one Abraham Lincoln's accent into justifiable legendary status, are of course a mixture of the based on fact and chaotic popcorn, but it's always interesting, exciting and bloody!I imagine most horror fans have seen it by now, but if like me you are late to it, and like me you go in with low expectation levels, you could well find yourself having a blast and not hating yourself in the morning . All that and Rufus Sewell looks suspiciously like Adam Ant! 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A different tale on the life of Abraham Lincoln.,"This movie was surprisingly entertaining, which I doubted when I saw the trailer. It begins slow but steadily gains speed throughout the film. Though it doesn't get as good as a good vampire film should, it offers a fictional story with a non-fictional setting and characters. Benjamin Walker gives a good performance as the president who believes in vampires. Dominic Cooper as Henry was OK but could of been better. Mary Elizabeth Winstead I believe was miscast in her role as Mary Todd, she was too young for me too believe her as an older Mary Todd. Other than that the film was generally entertaining if leading away to boring conversation parts. The fight scenes are done well and the weapon of choice: An Axe, which is well used in this film. If you like Abraham Lincoln and you like Vampires then you will love this movie!. Thanks for reading and enjoy the Film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What did you  expect to see more?,"If you take this movie so serious you'll be disappointed 'cause it's not. But if you take it as fun movie, fulled of action/fantasy/horror scenes and as what it is then you can give it a chance. Maybe, the character of Abraham Lincoln defined as vampire slayer is naive and childish and is not what you expected to see for historical important figure. Maybe someone thinks that this is disgrace for the character. And finally maybe someone thinks there is a storyline abstraction 'cause the book is better and I don't doubt that even I haven't read it. All this defects are not so important if you like movies in this kind of genre like Underworld, Resident Evil etc. This was a movie that deserves attention and give it a try.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Title says it all,"The title says it all. You get not just the plot, but the style and the tone. Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) is not only a vampire hunter, but his life has been defined by vampires for a long time. His mother was killed by a vampire. As a young man, he tries to seek revenge but fails. But in the process, he meets Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) who teaches him how to kill a vampire. During the Civil War as President of the United States, he comes to realize that vampires are fighting with the Confederate forces. As a result he mounts his own campaign to defeat them.Benjamin Walker is not big enough to anchor this movie. For the lead, they really should have gotten a bigger name and a more compelling actor. There was some really slow moments in the middle, but a vampire threw a horse.... A HORSE. That's worth the money to see for the right audience. This is a ridiculous concept. It could have more fun moments like the horse.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Surprisingly good, great CGI","Supposedly, the beginnings of Vampires in America and a story about Honest Abe (Benjamin Walker) as he hunts them down before becoming our 16th president.I had no idea who Benjamin Walker is. Anyone? Yes, I suspected, but had never heard the truth that Abraham Lincoln was a Vampire Hunter..until now. And, now you will too, if you watch this movie. I can hear you asking, ""is it all true"" Well, of course, it is. Hollywood wouldn't make up something if it weren't true now, would they? And, yes, they are finally admitting the truth about Edgar Allen Poe being a detective who wrote poems on his stake-outs. But, on to Abe..as a Vampire Hunter.But first, before you turn away from this one, let me tell you of 2-scenes that are worth your time. The first one is a battle between Abe and Vampire Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) on horses in a horse stampede. Yes, that's right. In a horse stampede. The way this was done was nothing short of fantastic and you will ask yourself "" how in the world did they do this?"" The second one is near the end on a burning bridge the train is crossing. Unbelievable how they did this. Again, you will ask yourself ""how in the world did they do this?"" They took CGI to a new level. You will be talking about these two scenes for a long time. Kudos, kudos and kudos again.The entire production, photography, dialogues were all first rate as were the actors within. The music was spot on especially with the train near the end chug-chugging in time with the beat. Excellent.Yes, there is some gore as Abe settles in to become the Vampire Hunter we know and love, and his weapon of choice is an Axe. Hey, he was a rail-splitter at one time. Keep up.Abe is befriended by Henry (Dominic Cooper) who teaches him how to kill Vampires. But, waitHenry has a secret.The main villain Vampire is Adam played by Rufus Sewell and he is always good. And, we learn how the battle for Gettysburg was really won. Yes, the North won but now you will learn how they did it. Never before told.One more thing: finally, someone decided on a Mary Todd Lincoln (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who is easy on the eyes. Good choice. And, yes, Benjamin Walker makes a good Lincoln especially with the beard later on in the movie.It's true, I didn't want to see this movie much less do a review on it. A friend I won't name (Russ) recommended it and thanks to him I discovered the truth and it set me free. Now, I know all. Will you? (7/10)Violence: Throughout Sex: No. Gore: Yes, there is some. Nudity: Yes, quick shot of a dead woman with a breast exposed. Language: Only two f-bombs were heard. Otherwise no language at all. (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Abraham Lincoln, Super Hero","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after reading the book. Sadly, instead of any story approximating the book, I got a mess of not-so-special effects with a way over the top story.During the sequence with the burning trestle bridge (I don't want to be any more specific because I don't like posting spoilers) I actually turned to my wife and said, ""This is stupid."" She agreed.My 11 year old daughter liked the movie so maybe grownups weren't the target audience for this mess.If you liked the book, keep away. If you want any kind of thought or story internally consistent story, keep away. If you want mindless depictions of the 16th president acting like a super hero, leaping tall buildings in a single bound, felling giant trees with a single stroke, performing moves that would make Jet Li proud, this is your movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Kick ass Lincoln,"This is what a comedy-action-horror should be like. A preposterous idea mixed with some drama, wit, scares and decent enough CGI. Because of events he saw as a child Lincoln trains to become a vampire hunter with the assistance of Dominic Cooper.He wants to hunt down Rufus Sewell who is the leader of the pack and before long Sewell plans to lead the South against Lincoln who is now President but not before inflicting another personal tragedy on the Lincoln family.At least Benjamin Walker did not have to go through some faux type Daniel Day Lewis authenticity for his version of Lincoln. It was wielding axes, swords and other instruments of vampire death.The action mixes historical fact and fiction with cartoon like action. Its fun although the movie makers might have taken things a tad too seriously in light of the fact that a Spielberg epic on Lincoln was around the corner.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Gem, hidden that is","I saw this movie when it first came out not in the theater, but on my HiDef 72inch brand spanking new TV. I avoided it in the theater because I said to myself that sounds like a stupidly named movie, but I do watch them all eventually on DVD or demand or some way or another, a movie addiction, a healthy addiction at that. Boy was I wrong I fell in love with this flick, and have seen it many many times and have it in my collection. It's cinematography, its acting, action, and story is great. I watched it this afternoon and thought I never reviewed it and gave it a 10 to help raise its rating a little, this is definitely not for everyone but for a great 2 hour ride of action and beautiful made movie its a hidden gem for me. Great cast and cuts no corners, don't be off put by the title, if you like vampire movies it's a must!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
All right.,"Summary: The movie has horrible plot holes and inconsistencies but it makes for a good ""popcorn"" movie. It can be very entertaining and funny but outside of that, there's really not much. 6/10Characters: About 3 of the characters develop (slightly) and the rest are left to rot in their horrible cliché state of blandness and stereotypes. 4/10Effects: This is one of the better parts of the film. The effects are good and at some points great. They fit well with the action scenes. At one point in the movie, I remember it didn't feel like I was watching a movie due to the amount of action and great effects. But it was short-lived due to the silly plot. 8/10Plot: PFFFFFFT. It's bad. Really bad. But funny. Very funny. 5/10Should I see it?: But if you're bored one night and have some dough to waste for a couple of cheap laughs and good action scenes, this movie is fine for you.If you're looking for something deep or for a classic movie you can remember for this summer, this movie isn't it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Different Ridiculous,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter sounds like a strange silly title. Some might find it stupid while some will find it peculiarly interesting. People would expect it as a ridiculously fun bloody action film starring one of America's greatest Presidents. Since it's directed by Timur Bekmambetov, one of the most insane action movie directors ever, it suppose to be enjoyably crazy throughout. The film is fun when Abe is killing vampires with his axe, but it gets really different to the biography moments. While everybody is expecting for some awesome ridiculousness, we instead get a lot of serious biography that would take a lot of time to get to the vampire killing. It's entertaining but it could have been a lot more fun.With that kind of title, people would expect it as a campy horror action film with a different version of Abraham Lincoln that has a potential to be a movie icon. It sounds absurd, but that is acceptable to its title. Unfortunately, its absurdity is limited by the seriousness of the biographical parts. Both elements are strangely mismatch. Made this film a lot more awkward than you would thought. There is nothing wrong with having an accurate history to it. It just feels a lot different when you compare Lincoln's rise to Presidency to the whole vampire slaying sequences. It gets interesting when Henry Strugess distracts at Lincoln's personal life. Every time he appears, it makes you ready for some vampire action.Thankfully, it has Timur Bekmambetov as the director. He's also a vampire movie expert by his Night Watch films. He can make his action scenes impossibly crazy that makes the whole experience a none stop entertainment. Too bad there isn't any glass for him to break in a ridiculously stylish way like he did in his other films. At least we still get to see something interesting, like Abe's axe spinning, throwing a vampire up to the sky, and turning that horse stampede chase into a large scale sequence. The rest is not quite inspired, but it still makes a pretty awesome action film. Like I wish it has more that. It's still entertaining for some reason. The WETA visuals look obvious. It fits well to the director's crazy vision.It's hard to recommend Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. It's not as ridiculous as the title. It connects to Lincoln's life in a serious way. They could have at least give a bit more campier and sillier tone to make this alternate version of Lincoln iconic. Even with an awesome director, energetic cast, and vampires that look scary and kill horrifyingly, it's still not a satisfying vampiric onslaught. It's not horrible or boring either. It just needs to be an endless crazy action movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Why, Mr Lincoln, you're full of surprises!""","Chances are that you've already made up your mind about this film when you read its title. You'll either facepalm at the sacrilege of turning one of history's greatest men into something base and tasteless, or you'll laugh your behind off. Regardless of your reaction, the film may surprise you. Director Timur Bekmanbetov has proved himself to be a master of orchestrating scenes of absurdity and chaos, with beautiful and awe-inspiring action scenes, and with serious demeanor. He does the same here, orchestrating the absurdity with a straight face and plenty of style to satisfy.After ""Wanted,"" a film so loaded with fantastic action sequences, I was hoping Bekmanbetov would deliver a plethora of inspiring new setpieces. Such scenes are few and far-between in ""AL:VH;"" there are plenty of short fights with lots of style and lots of gnarly bloody mayhem, all captured in flowing slow-motion photography. The biggest standouts will be the horse stampede scene, which somewhat resembles a crazy car-chase scene that swaps out the cars with horses and sends horses flying off in all directions (a very clever and inspiring scene, in my opinion, which is sadly marred by some camera shake and lots of dust on the screen), and the climactic train battle, which will likely be compared to the train scene in ""Wanted,"" but I feel it's a solid stand-alone setpiece. In terms of action, the film delivers; it's still the director's tamest and sanest work, but what we get would be something comparable to an ""Underworld"" movie.The story for this madness is generally sound, believe it or not. Regardless of how you accept the idea that Abe slays the undead in his off-hours, the film does a fine job of weaving historical accounts and personal history in with the vampire storyline. I'm no Lincoln expert, so I don't really know how much of the film is accurate (I certainly don't know how well it adapts the original novel). Accepting it as its own little universe, I felt it was generally successful. Half of it does a good job of setting up the vampire story and the other half does a good job of playing out the period drama, all in an earnest manner.If there is any problem with the story, it would be in its consistency; the opening scenes whiz by really fast, before settling into a steady and pleasing pace during Abe's youth. The story then zips through entire years of the story, lightly covering the Civil War aspect and speeding it up to the climax. It's very choppy, uneven pacing; I suspect that 30-60 more minutes of scenes would have allowed the story to breathe, allowing the pacing to flow naturally and make the film even more epic than it is. What we get feels like an abridged telling of the overall story.The film definitely has style. The camera work can be a little shaky in some scenes, but there are also a lot of moments with slick slow-motion photography. There are quite a few unique editing effects. Acting is generally not bad; I grew to accept Benjamin Walker as the title character, for he looked and acted the part very well. Writing is not terribly strong, but it gets the job done. This production has decent-looking sets, props, and costumes. As one other reviewer pointed out, however, the makeup department failed to make certain characters age the way Lincoln does, and it can be distracting. Music for this movie has some really awesome parts.There could have been more to the film: more crazy action, more to the Civil War scenes, more consistency to the plot, etc. Still, if you're looking for stylish vampire-slaying action like I am, the film generally satisfies. I probably wouldn't recommend this to anybody looking for perfect cinema, or anybody who can't accept the premise of the film's title. For everybody else, I'd recommend checking it out as a rental.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Pretty Good)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Good Effort and an Action Masterpiece,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is the new movie from director Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, Night Watch) and Tim Burton, based upon the book by Seth Grahame-Smith, who also wrote the film's screenplay. What if Abe Lincoln was not just a President of the United States, but a vampire hunter, and that history was actually clouded by a series of lies? Bear witness to the truth behind one of America's greatest Presidents that changed the course of history and the fate of humanity.The script was well-written, bearing resemblance to the novel in ways, but never a 100% adaptation. The actors/actresses were fantastic and great for the roles they were given. Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln was fantastic; he was not only believable, but showed a certain determination and love for peace that no other actor could have shown in the role of this old President. Rufus Sewell was incredible as Adam, the main antagonist and leader of the vampires wanting to control America. Erin Wasson was just stunning as Vadoma, who never showed a single care in the world for anyone other than herself. The visual effects were not ""Avatar""-standards, but were still fantastic to the point where they worked; the one scene where visuals were phenomenal was the train sequence. The music by Henry Jackman worked great, as it blended in with the film itself, cued in for the right moments when needed.Overall, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter was a fun, well-made film that could be considered an action masterpiece as it never let up on its impressive action or suspense. The downsides were that it should have been at least 20 minutes longer to fill in gaps and prolong the story, which went by WAY too fast, and the poor script",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better Than I Expected,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012)*** (out of 4)This horror/action film sets up to tell the true story of Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) who witnessed his mother getting killed by a vampire so he dedicates his life to stopping the bloodsucking creatures. ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER might have a silly title but it's actually a fairly ambitious little movie that really took me by surprise. Going by the trailer you'd think that this film was just going to try and do a BUBBA HO TEP and takes a historical figure and make some cheap thrills out of him killing vampires. There's no doubt that the ""cheap thrill"" aspect is on full display here but the film actually goes a bit further by tying all of these events into common knowledge surrounding Lincoln's life. Not only do we get the vampire stuff but it's pretty well blended in with various historical truths like Lincoln becoming a lawyer, marrying Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and we go all the way up to the Civil War. The final thirty-minutes actually take place during the Civil War and the way the writers used slavery and the vampires was pretty interesting. With that said, I really hope no one goes into this movie expecting historical accuracies (they'd be crazy right?). Walker actually does a very good job at playing Lincoln. I thought he was very believable playing the good soul as well as the action hero. Dominic Cooper was excellent as his mentor and Anthony Mackie is also very good in his role as a black man who aids Lincoln. Even Winstead is good in her part even though the screenplay doesn't do her character much justice. The one major issue I had with the film was the incredibly bad CGI effects. I thought there were some that was so bad that you'd expect to be seeing them in a SyFy movie. Just take a look at the scene where Lincoln in chopping the tree or a really embarrassing sequence dealing with horses. The slow motion action scenes also weren't all that entertaining. With that said, I really liked the way director Timur Bekmambetov built up the atmosphere of the 1800's. I was really surprised how how authentic everything was and I think this is a reason why the CGI looks even worse. ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER should have been a really, really bad movie but I think for the most part they got it right and those with a little knowledge of the real history around the war should find the touches interesting.",,Anonymous,Horror
So disappointing...,"If you've read the book, you'll be completely disappointed with this movie. I've read articles about the movie (after reading the book) and knew they were adding characters, but I had no idea they would change EVERYTHING. I understand shortening the story to fit into a movie, but more than that has been done and now the movie is just stupid! I can't even say there's more action in the movie than the book, EVERY action scene had the super-fast-with-the-hands/weapons-dance-but-slow-down- just-when-a-blow-connects/misses; and the ""bass drop"" or BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA­AAAAWM sound (like Inception) during all the action scenes didn't help. Oh yeah, the excessive CGI and most of the acting sucked. It was like some of the actors just walked in front of the camera and said the lines like they really didn't want to be there. When I first heard about this movie I thought it was the dumbest thing ever, but then I read the book thoroughly enjoyed it and became excited about the movie...only to be let down and forced to stick with my initial thought. If someone else hadn't paid for the tickets I would've walked out and demanded a refund, even the person who took me thought it sucked and he never read the book but was also excited about the movie.

The Damned South,"Leave it to a Russian to paint American history with such accuracy. This is not an historical drama, nor does it purport to be, but it bears more stinging truth then the whole of the History Channel.The Southern Confederacy, desiring to hold on to the last vestiges of gentility lest they get their white hands dirty, declared itself free from the Union in order to retain the right to own people as if they were property. The parasitic white slave owners fed off of the blood of the workers like vampires. Bekmambetov simply takes this allusion to the next logical step. Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator, did not merely take up arms against the act of slavery but against the very thought of it, the idea that it is somehow acceptable.Abraham Lincoln, played by Benjamin Walker -- a young Gary Cooper who astoundingly triumphs in an iconic role that could have failed so easily -- learns quickly that his town of Springfield is rife with vampires: the pharmacist, the blacksmith... because you never know where your neighbours' loyalties lie. But where the metaphor that the southern states are best represented by the living damned is most outspoken is when the vampires take up the Confederate Gray and join the Civil War.This not-so-subtle allusion will, no doubt, anger the staunchly southern states that fly the confederate flag with pride. But pride cometh before a fall, and Lincoln fells with one chop.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fun and action-packed ride...,"I must say that this movie was really a nice surprise, as it turned out to be a rather fun and action-packed take on one of the most prominent historical figures in American history. I was somewhat worried that such a take on a legendary figure could have turned out to be insulting in a way or just inappropriate, but it was actually done well enough. Just put off your reality-goggles when you sit down to watch the movie.The story is about Abraham Lincoln before becoming the 16th president of America, how his childhood and youth was molded and shaped by a cruel incident in which his mother was taken away from him by a vampire, and Abraham end up in the hands of Henry Sturges who teaches him how to fight vampires.Actually the story was entertaining, especially because they buffed it up with so much really cool action sequences. And these sequences were nicely executed and made good use of slow-motion capture to emphasize on the action. But the movie wasn't all action, it was also incorporating historical events nicely, of course these were somewhat altered to reflect the movie's story with vampires.The actors and actresses they had hired for the various roles were doing great jobs with their characters. A big hat off (no pun intended) for Benjamin Walker (playing Abraham Lincoln), Dominic Cooper (playing Henry Sturges), Jimmi Simpson (playing Joshua Speed) and Anthony Mackie (playing Will Johnson), as they really did a great job.The special effects in the movie were great and really helped the movie along so nicely.Also the costumes and sets should be mentioned, as they really put a lot of effort into these to make the era and environment come alive on the screen. And they succeeded. It was really a treat to behold and it was like you were right there in the mid 1860's. Really nice work there.However, one thing that was a disappointment in the movie was the final showdown between Abraham Lincoln and Adam (played by Rufus Sewell). It was really anti-climatic, especially by the way that it ended. That was clumsily planned and horribly executed, and had they opted for something else it would have worked all the better.Without revealing the ending of the movie, then I will say that it was really a nice touch to the movie, and I would go as far as to say that it was actually one of the best scenes in the entire movie.So now we have had Abraham Lincoln fight vampires in this movie and zombies in ""Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies"", so what is next? Werewolves? I guess we will just have to wait and see.But ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is well worth a watch. Lots of fun and action, and great acting.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
My First Time Walking Out of a Movie Theater,"This is by far the worst movie adaptation I've ever seen. The fact that I gave it one star is only because I was forced to. Seth Grahame-Smith's book is not a literary masterpiece by any standard, but from what it was trying to achieve it managed to successfully and made it enjoyable. The only thing similar with this movie and that book was its title and the vague idea that Abraham Lincoln was something other than just a president. There is no emotional connection with the audience, no attempt to try to tell the biography of his life, the historical context is all gone, and they even managed to screw up the romance of Abe with Mary. I went into this trying very hard to like this film but just couldn't suffer another second of this butchery of such a good novel. All in all if you want to see a vampire slasher you will definitely enjoy this film but if you are coming to it to see the novel be put on the big screen you will be greatly disappointed.

"An Entertaining, If Unremarkable, Period Vampire Slayer","Although I knew Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (from now shortened to Abe, Abraham or ALVH) was based on a novel, I've not read the novel. I have, however, heard good things. This is most likely not the novel the film was based on. A slick, action heavy vampire slayer movie that has more in common with Blade than Interview with a Vampire, like the novel, this re-imagines a history in which Abe Lincoln became a vengeance lusting, ax wielding vampire hunter, where vampires have a part in American History. The action is great, but sadly, everything else is mediocre. While the film presents some interesting ideas, the acting and plot are mostly ho-hum in favor of a rushed history lesson and speeding from one action piece to another.Timur is an odd choice for this film, but probably one of the most inspired. He has a way of creating slick action, and it's no different here. From his creative uses of slow motion to the interesting action set pieces, in particular the final one on a train and an inventive one through a stampede of horses, Timur flaunts his skills at creating over the top action and reveling in it. And for sure, the action is the best part. With demonstrations of martial skills with an ax and cinematography that thankfully gives us a great view of the action, you're in for a more creative action packed film than the usual vampire hunting affair.Sadly, beyond this, the majority of the film is mostly bogged down by historical details that are somewhat skimmed over and a plot that isn't all that interesting. Every character beyond Lincoln and his teacher, Henry, are mostly dull and cliché. Adam is the cliché, high class vampire villain with an air of superiority. Will is the token black guy, Abe's best friend since childhood and his eventual sidekick. Even the lovely Mary Winstead, who plays Mary Todd, is little more than eye candy (although, admittedly, she delivers one very solid, emotional scene that demonstrates her fantastic acting abilities). The script as well is as much to blame. There is a lot here that should be interesting, like the vampires involvement in the civil war. It's a fascinating idea, but it's rolled over in favor of watching Abe kick vampire butt.Now there have been a lot of complaints about this film having no humor, and quite frankly, I am glad it didn't. Yes, several things seem funny, but the fact that this is a straight forward film that takes it's vampire involvement serious is a good thing. Had this been as comical as it's title suggests, it would have been a lot worse than it is. But as it stands, it is a slightly more than mediocre film with some great action scenes. It's nothing to write home about, and I probably won't be renting it to watch it again, but it was a decent and entertaining way to kill a couple hours on a warm summer day.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Solid all around flick with fantastic action,"Just got back from an advanced screening that was the (according to the director) first screening seen by people outside of the cast/crew of the movie. Overall I was very impressed, having never read the book I did not really know what to expect. Acting was good, nothing Oscar worthy but no poor performances. Everyone did their job well, especially Benjamin Walker and Dominic Cooper. They both excelled in their roles as Lincoln and Henry respectively. Plot flowed well and was easy to follow, and the action was absolutely fantastic. It was over the top, fast paced, bloody, and very well done.

Unrealistically Believable!,"A name and idea so bizarre that actually works? I thought that would be unreal but this movie proved that wrong. Never before have I seen such a creative idea be attached to a huge part of American History and actually make sense. While I did have high anticipation for this film, I was still very surprise and impressed by the outcome.This film stars Benjamin Walker (Flags of Our Fathers, Kinsey), Dominic Cooper (Captain America: The First Avenger, The Devil's Double), Anthony Mackie (The Hurt Locker, Real Steel), and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, The Thing).The story starts you with a young Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) dealing with the death of his mother due to a Vampire. A few years later after his father passes away, he decides to go after the Vampire that killed his mother. While doing this he runs into Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), a real vampire hunter who recruits Abraham Lincoln and trains him to become a real vampire hunter as well. From then on you see young Abraham Lincoln grow as a person with him becoming a great vampire hunter, a politician, and a love life. This is as far as I want to go with the story but from there Abraham Lincoln deal with becoming the 16th President of the United States, deal with the Civil War, and hunt vampires.The 3D was actually pretty good at some of the heavy action scenes which was awesome, but for the slower parts of the film is was just added depth. I recommend seeing it in 3D for some of the really fun action scenes, but if you are not into the whole 3D craze, then the standard 2D should be just as good.I really did enjoy this movie for how realistic they made the story seemed. They tied in this fictional story of vampires with the real life story of Abraham Lincoln so well that it seems like this movie could have been real. Another to note is how good the action looked. The were so many decapitated heads as well as hard hitting chops and slices into the vampires. Every hit that was delivered will make you cringe and believe they were real. The movie is something that you should go into with an open mind and you would think that you wouldn't take a movie like this seriously, but the movie is so dead serious with everything that happens that it is so believable. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes well done stories and intense gory fun action.Rating: 7/10Thank you for reading my review, any feedback is greatly appreciated!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Does it get any worse than this?,"A legitimately awful movie! The biggest waste of $11 ever. Wow. I can't even begin to express in words how absolutely horrible this film is. If there was a way for me to give this movie a 0/10, I would.Firstly, let's talk about the plot. Abraham Lincoln, the president of the United States, killing an uprising of vampires. Really. Good fiction is when the concept within the piece of work is believable. BELIEVABLE. I would adore if someone could explain to me how this film is in any way fathomable beyond idiocy. I can't deny the existence of vampire lore in the Southern states in the 19th century, HOWEVER it peaked in the late 19th century, after the death of Lincoln. As far as I'm concerned, the people of the US thought the existence of vampires brought on tuberculosis, and that's where the myth ends. Thus, the absurd ""accuracy"" (I use that word sparingly) of this film is only barely hanging on. Please spare me the agony of speaking of this further.Secondly, let's talk about the acting. With an already barely tolerable plot, the acting was not redeeming for this film. I was not expecting the most amazing performance I'd ever seen in my entire life, but it's almost as if they weren't even trying. It was horribly over-acted, further digging this show into the ground.Thirdly, let's talk about the action. If you can get past the wretched plot, perhaps the action wasn't all that bad. I, however, could not. I found the action positively drab and random. Some of the scenes were drawn out so long that any of the initial fascination with the action was faded and lost by the end of it. If you're going to this or renting this for the action, do yourself a favour and get a Bruce Willis or Sly Stallone movie instead.Let's all be honest here, this movie made it onto a few film lists, and is a serious contender against other movies for some great titles. Worst film of the century and horrible film lists, but none the less titles.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not as ridicules as it might sound and not as bad as you might fear.,"Forget the premise. It sounds ridicules for just about everyone. Just see this as a period action piece, with some vampire fun thrown into it.And really, the movie is not as silly and ridicules as you might think. It's not a movie made for laughs necessarily but it's more being a straightforward genre flick, that is trying to be good and entertaining not necessarily just through its main, gimmicky sounding, concept. And it works as such. It's not being a great movie by any means but it at least is being entertaining and maintaining to watch, from about start till finish.And how many period action movies are out there anyway? The movie deserves some credit for that alone already. And the time period and settings work out well for most part. It's interesting to see vampires and 'mondern' looking type of action taking place during the 19th century. It provides the movie with some pretty unique and often also awesome and thrilling looking moments.It's definitely true that the movie gets uplifted by the look of it. It has a great visual style to it and the movie truly got skillfully directed by Timur Bekmambetov, who is accustomed to brining visually striking movies to the screen and combining it with some good action and often fine storytelling as well.The story of the movie is still lacking though. And no, I'm of course not talking about it being ridicules but it steps over a couple of things far too easily and the overall movie feels to me as if it wanted or needed to cover too much ground. There perhaps was enough material in its story for 2 more movies but this movie wanted to do all of it and wrap up everything by the end of it. You could say that the movie its pace feels too fast, which also prevents the movie from ever making any emotional impact on a more dramatic level, or to feel involved with any of its characters. But that's just not this movie. It never really slows down and jumps into its action pretty much right away.So as a simple, fun, action flick this movie does not disappoint but also the vampire lovers shall most likely not end up feeling disappointed with this movie. It takes a somewhat original take on vampire, in which the vampires get portrayed as true monsters and they get to do plenty of sucking, fighting and killing in this movie.This is simply and good and fun enough movie to watch, as long as you can take its premise of course.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
So. What the hell was this?,"I have to say it. I shouldn't have seen this movie, but a best friend of mine loves all the types of action movies. So, I watched it just to share a """"fun"""" moment with him one random day.Well, into the movie. I just don't understand. I thought the movie would be self aware from the start. Instead what I watched was a ridiculous mashup of """"serious"""" Lincoln scenes, exploring his life (maybe not accurately) but with real scenes. And between those moments we got the ridiculous, but expected given the title, scenes where we find out he's more than a political figure growing and finding love, but a Vampire Hunter. After that we switch back to the """"serious"""" scene, and we repeat the cicle.And that's when it lost me. As soon as we got serious scenes, relatively well acted, without jokes (that I was aware off) and without a hint of irony (again, that was my impression), the movie completely lost me. Benjamin Walker was """"too good"""" for this movie to work. Im pretty sure that's what the directors wanted out of him, but it was a bad decision. He was an imposing figure with a serious face acting as much as he could the weight of his """"growing love"""" and """"passion for his country"""". And yet those scenes were followed by him talking to a random exposition guy about the need for killing the vampires. It just didn't work. I was bored with the serious scenes and baffled by the admittedly good action scenes.In the end, I don't hate this movie, It's a kind of ridicoulness that do not works with me, where the """"joke"""" is the action/blood and not actual jokes or sarcastic/ironic hits at history. But I guess I can understand why some might like and even love the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Movie - Know what your going into,"This is a good movie as long as you know what you are going into. It is not meant to be a historical documentary. Some look at it and see the name ""Abraham Lincoln"" and expect the movie to contain more of an historical aspect to the flick; however, in reality, it is a movie regarding Vampires. So, if you like vampire movies, you will probably like this. I read the reviews from others and they complain about how the book is so much different, well it is different. But anyone that reads a book and then expects it to be exactly the same (Other than Harry Potter Enthusiasts) has basically gone off the deep end. The movie does contain somewhat of the same plot, but it is not exactly the same. I like a lot of what some would categorize as ""weird movies,"" and enjoy the occasional vampire movie as long as its not overly gory, which this isn't. Its a good movie, just know what you are going to see, not what some wish it could be.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I really wanted to like this....,"...i found the novel to be an entertaining diversion... I've been a fan of Timur Bekmambetov's films ""NIGHT WATCH"" and, especially ""WANTED..I really thought there was the potential for something pretty special here...A b-movie classic in the making.. Sadly the film really doesn't come close to living up to it's potential. This is probably the poorest editing I have seen in a feature film in quite some time. I was really looking forward to the action sequences, but all you got was a lot of grey mist and blurring.The script was really dopey, too. I'm not a huge fan of the stuff they added for the sake of action sequences to the story, because it was all REALLY dumb. I also don't much care for the ending they opted for here. The ending of the book had a whole lot more going for it. I loved the theme of ""Some men are just too interesting to die.""One giant surprise, though, was the performance from Benjamin Walker. This guy really knocks this role out of the ballpark. He has the acting chops to be a major star. It's too bad it was wasted on this poorly edited mess!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not the best, but a night of decent fun.","I saw a pre-screening with minimal expectations, and I must say it exceeded them, so that was good.To get things straight, I did not go into this thinking I was in for an amazing story or amazingly fleshed out characters. I don't see any reason these kinds of films can't be 10/10s when you take them in their proper context but it definitely leaves you wanting more out of what you watched, regardless of genre or expectations. There is a faint sense of something lacking in the film...okay maybe more like a molding cheese on a rotten apple stench, but that doesn't mean there still aren't more delicious snacks in this film's refrigerator!I would say the movie is simply flawed in small areas, nothing on a grand scale. There's lack of exposition on why certain things are the way they are, and essentially you have to suspend your disbelief further and further with every scene. There is a consistent lack of consistency in how the action scenes play out. This constantly leaving you wondering why characters didn't die amidst what you just saw on screen, or asking yourself ""how the f*ck did this black dude learn to flip around and fight vamps?"", not to mention a few cheap set-ups with even cheaper payoffs. Even though you're not suppose to be looking too far into the action sequences for something like that, because they're made to look cool, and they do, but it definitely takes you out of the experience at moments because what you're seeing just completely defies logic, even within the universe they've created for this film. As I said, each new action scene requires you to expand your bandwidth of disbelief, and you can't help but notice that you're kind of accommodating the film's need for you to do that. Like a Russian Doll that never ends, you keep having to remind yourself, ""well the way this scene is playing out is f*cking retarded, but then again it is Abe Lincoln fighting vampires"". You shouldn't have to say that to yourself in a well done film, even of this genre. But this film is far from poorly done either.To get a little more picky, I'd say the first act of the film runs a little too fast, kind of rushing the development for Abe's vampire slaying character, which is unfortunate because the set up in the beginning was decent. So yeah things are a little speedy at first, especially after the inciting incident and first act turning point.Overall, a solid 6/10. Entertaining, over the top, and a little ridiculous for reasons other than the obvious. I put this one on the level of ""21 Jump Street"" in that even though it fulfilled many of the genre expectations, was decently entertaining, and had a lot of heart to it, both films still fall a little short because both seemed to forget what really matters to keep your audience curious, a decent story that we can get lost in as a viewer.I'm only giving the negative critiques I have of the film because you will still get what you want and expect from this film, fun visuals, a few laughs, some legitimately cool action scenes (and not just in the traditional sense, but something that actually seems a little fresh in style. Do I dare to claim after the 70 minute point or so the action gets a little too absurd?). The only thing that really stands out to me in the end is that it seems like there was no significant need for Honest Abe to be the protagonist. This could have worked just as well and been just as much fun with any other host of characters. The historical context wasn't really necessary for me. Maybe I'll scope the book and see how it works there.If you liked ""300"" and can deal with a story as coherent as ""21 Jump Street"" you will get some fun out of this. History buffs and Vampire buffs, stay away, I don't even know where to begin with the accuracy and lack of explanation issues for both American history and why it needs to tie into this story, and the lack of exposition on what may or may not have been altered in the vampire mythos.Watch this baked out of your mind and I can essentially assure a great time. Sober? Well I can't say I'd recommend it but I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone curious to check it out. If you actually wanna see this movie, I think based on that alone you will likely enjoy yourself!I came out feeling like I could have used a little more in certain areas of the film, but also felt like I had been entertained, but just not nearly as much as I should have been. I dunno, maybe compare it to Pauly Shore's best movie or something, minus his voice appearances in Disney films. Easily forgettable but potentially memorable. Overall, I think it's worth taking a risk on if you're pondering forking out the cash for it, but I'd recommend cheap Tuesday or a paid date.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silly story,"For a movie that had decent acting and special effects, they couldn't think up a better story?

So dumb,"Let me just start by saying that I had very low expectations for this movie, in fact I put it on because I was tired but had to stay awake, and had to watch something that didn't require my attention too much. It feels like empty criticism to even have to say that a film with a title as this is unbelievably stupid, because of course it would be, right? But then again, great films have been made on ridiculous premises, it's no more ludicrous to imagine an American president hunting vampires, than, for instance, a boy raised by aliens fighting evil with a raccoon and a tree! My point is, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is even dumber than the title suggests, when it didn't necessarily have to be! Skip it.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Enjoyable, but not perfect","they changed and skipped a lot from the book and there were more things i wish they had added - Lincoln's mother and his step mother were very important figures in his life and they did gloss over the early years very quickly - to me, the beginning of the movie was the weakest, slowest part and it didn't really get going for me until he established himself in Springfield. I thought it picked up a good amount once he got into politics and was a pretty good movie from there.The movie looked really good from a historical perspective - the scenery was nicely done for the most part - the look of the major historical figures was pretty accurate with the notable exception of Mary Todd - who was way too pretty and thin - but a really good actress. In real life Lincoln didn't marry her for her looks anyway - he married her because of her position and the status he would gain from their union.I really liked all the major characters - the acting went really well for the most part. I liked the musical score, but some of the (mostly early) action scenes were a bit over the top - and there was one sequence I highly doubt even Jackie Chan could have pulled off. But i guess everyone in the 1800's was a circus performer One thing that really got me after a bit was that the director is a big fan of slowing down the action so you can see how spiffy every stunt looks in slow motion. That kind of got old, but it was nice in some spots - just overused.I thought it was entertaining once you got over the really weak beginning, but yeah it skipped too many events and had problems.7-7.5/10 is the range I would give it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Nice idea, poor execution","In 1818 a young boy by the name of Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) witnesses his mother's murder and vows to get revenge on the man who took her life. In his late teens he finally plucks up the courage to enact his revenge but when he fires a pistol at the head of the assassin, the man simply gets back up and attacks the young Lincoln. The young man is saved by a strange man called Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) who tells the future President about the existence of vampires and teaches him the art of killing them. Lincoln dedicates his life to the destruction of vampires but finds in later life that words and deeds outweigh the power of his axe and he eventually becomes a Lawyer and later President of the Union. During his Presidency the vampire rich South declares war on the North in the hope of creating a nation for vampires.This film is a case of a title that is better than the movie. The idea behind it sounds great; that one of America's most beloved Presidents was also secretly a Vampire Hunter, but the execution doesn't live up to the premise. I've recently read books about the American Civil War and Lincoln's assassination so probably know more than the average Brit about the President and this period of America's history and there were nice details, incidents and characters taken from the period and Lincoln's life that were included to give a bit of authenticity to the story. The truth, with the added inclusion of vampires could have created a really good film but alas it is not.The film's design is meant to be a sort of Gothic horror but it relies far too heavily on special effects and hardly anything in the film feels tangible. You get the feeling that about 80% of the film is shot on green screen which is a shame because there must be plenty of locations that could have been used. Another design problem is that it was obviously meant as a 3D film but I saw it in 2D because 3D is terrible. As a result things are constantly heading out of the screen at you which in 2D look pointless and this is a film which will probably find success on DVD, a mostly 2D format so why the film was designed in 3D I don't know. 'Atmospheric fluff' is a constant feature of the cinematography and this just gets in the way. Obviously in 3D it's meant to give the sense of depth (which according to various reviews it doesn't) but in 2D it was once again pointless and distracting. For some reason the 30 year old Benjamin Walker looks like an alien or like Benedict Cumberbatch after he's been hit by a spade to the face when he is playing the younger Lincoln but as the older Lincoln he at least appears human. Some of the effects look decent although aren't on a par with the likes of Prometheus etc. The vampires for instance although obviously CGI'd, look quite good but the scene on the train looks awful and cheap. The main problem with the film's design is the constant slow motion shots. Although the film is 105 minutes long, if it was played at full speed throughout it would probably be closer to 70.To me the tone feels all wrong. With a title Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter you'd expect to see tongue firmly in cheek but instead it is played completely straight as a historical epic/action film. There is very little humour and it just feels amiss. This could have been a funny, gruesome film with a historical backbone but instead it's a boring, ridiculous film with a historical backbone. Dominic Cooper stands out on the acting front but his twist could be seen a mile off. Benjamin Walker is fine and does a fairly accurate impression of Lincoln but he suffers under what I presume are prosthetics.Overall this is a mess of a film. The idea is interesting and it could have been great but the execution is extremely poor, from the fake looking blood to serious tone the whole film is a disaster.www.attheback.blogspot.com",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Chix Chat on Film Review: Abraham Lincoln's other job.,"This film was not my first choice out of all that premiered this weekend, however it was my husband Mike's birthday weekend so the choice was his. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter (Benjamin Walker) is the story of the 16th president of the United States extracurricular activities of preparing to become an attorney and slaying vampires. The first as the result of brutality he witnesses as a child against Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie) his friend, and the latter spurred by the death of his mother the victim of a vampire as seen in the trailer. I was a bit apprehensive about seeing this film and felt that it would be a major slight to the president who dared to unite the union by abolishing slavery. But I will admit that it was interesting how the vampire tale was woven into history. I am growing weary of vampire stories and I had to revise my way of thinking about the integration into the life of a man that was instrumental in making my quality of life possible. I realized that this telling was really not that different from Forrest Gump teaching Elvis to wiggle his hips or the discovery that Transformers were the catalyst for the Apollo space program. The story begins with a narration from Abraham to his lifelong friend Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), who I found to be the most intriguing character of those featured primarily because his conflicts of conscience were the most compelling. I would say that this film is the first time that I have seen Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Mary Todd Lincoln) portray an adult character, she is typically a teen or early twenty-something but she came across very convincingly as the First Lady. I mentioned Anthony Mackie was in this film, bottom line if he's in the film I'm with it. I saw the film in 3D, but I honestly do not feel that the premium for 3-D is necessary for this film. The special effects were pretty cool especially the stampeding horse scene, however I just don't think anything would have been lost had I viewed the regular HD version of the film. There were a few moments that the computer generated imagery was just too obvious like the aerial view of Gettysburg, and other moments that were so far-fetched that it was hard to refrain from uttering an audible 'seriously' like the flaming bridge train scene. But overall it was entertaining enough that I give it an amber light",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you didn't like ""Wanted"" you won't like this","This director seems like he is going to be a very one dimensional director. Try to use unrealistic stylized action. Some movies have been able to pull this off but others such as this one just can't do it. There really is not much good in this film. The acting was sub-par, story was bad, special effects were not all that great either. It would seem this director can't make a movie with a big budget. Needs to go back to making indie low budget films. Seems he was better at that. Say like ""Night Watch"". And as far as the story goes I am all about Abraham Lincoln being a vampire hunter. But in this film even that got screwed up. Not even sure this is a film that I could recommend for someone to rent from a kiosk for a dollar.

Well you will enjoy it,"I wasn't holding on to my seat as I watched, wasn't jumping for joy as the bad guys get axed, wasn't thrilled by the lines either but I loved the way Lincoln handled the axe.The movie is based on the 2010 novel of the same name. The film was directed and co-produced by Timur Bekmambetov, along with one of my favourite film makers Tim Burton. Like in the movie poster, the real life figure of Lincoln is seen to identify him as a vampire hunter.Anthony Mackie was the high note in the movie, as he played Abe's long time friend Will, who later joined in the hunt of the un-dead.The plot is a little loose, as it portrays vampires as one of the pioneers of slave trade. In Lincoln's attempt to stop their reign and expansion, the American civil war broke out. With men going after vampires that can only be killed by silver, it was a massacre, till Abe stepped up to the task; willing the axe all over the place, with his life almost cut short a couple of times, he managed to wipe them out.The script is everywhere, the tale is a little shallow, and something's didn't add up. But maybe it was me, but I expected better cinematography, wasn't so thrilled by some camera angles. Tim Burton's presence can be felt in the directing style and the actors kinda grew into their roles.Unlike the mock buster Abraham Lincoln vsZombies, this movie had Abe start with no beards, just a young man out for revenge. After he got into politics the beards showed.Also the movie didn't have wise cracks like the mock buster. Anthony did well here compared to the mockery acting displayed in the movie, Man On The Ledge. Benjamin Walker is a new face to me, but I guess he will now be known as the man who played Abraham Lincoln.Go see it, it was OK.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not Very Good...,"I never really knew what I was getting into when I payed a ticket to see Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter. But now that I've seen it, I want to say that I was satisfied...but I really wasn't.There are some very great sides to the movie and some very bad sides.Some good things:The acting was surprisingly decent! No performances really stood out, but none of them were bad either. I also enjoyed the camera-work. There were a lot of great sets that enhanced the movie and made it a lot more enjoyable! The movie is obviously set in the older times and the movie does a great job of making it feel that way. The fight scenes were also very well done.The bad:This movie was very VERY jumpy in scenes. One moment there could be ten minute scene in the white house to a ten SECOND scene in some dark alley. I felt like it had a lot to get through in order to finish the story on time and that sped up the plot. It almost ruined the movie because sometimes the pace got too fast I was confused and not really sure who was doing what or what event is occurring. Also, I know it's not trying to be realistic in any way, and I tried to suspend any thoughts of realism, but some things that happen in the fights and battles are so ridiculous it's almost laughable. In my theater, actually, there were some people laughing so loudly at the absurdity of what happens in the fights.I should also mention I saw it in 2D, and I don't think 3D would have made me enjoy it much more, but I could tell there were a few scenes specifically designed for the 3D screens.Overall, if you don't take it seriously and are just looking for a good time, this COULD be the movie for you.

I know that, you know that, the world knows that, and the people who made the movie know that. Now that thats out of the way, it actually was very entertaining. Only huge problem, and I almost want to say I even docked it a star for it, was... it took FOREVER to get started. Seriously, you expect movies to start out slow in the beginning, but for some reason this movie moved at like, twice the slowness of a normal movie, and that did get very irritating. There was also a rather large jolt in the timeline I felt could've easily been avoided, but still, it was pretty solid story and action once you got through the beginning. The actor who played Lincoln, whose name I sadly don't know, actually turned in a solid performance. And, as with EVERY movie I see him in, Dominic Cooper once again redefined the fact that he's much more than just a solid actor. I do have some minor quibbles with the story, such as Alan Tudyk's character being completely pointless, (but I LOVE Tudyk so that was like a win lose for me) but it was pretty solid entertainment.

It comes and goes,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a film that appears to either be just a title joke or a joke trailer. It is difficult to envisage a film really coming out of this. The film does bring an origin to the Vampire hunting and doesn't attempt to dump the viewer straight into the action. However the film's run time means it struggles and makes it very sloppy. We get an origin but it is again a very sloppy one. It's nothing that you didn't see coming and fails to blow you away at any point. The film simply doesn't offer anything refreshing but it is fairly enjoyable bringing plenty of action throughout. The action starts out very well but then descends into what many action films become. A particular action scene involving a stampede of horses feels like it has no weight to it. It would look spectacular in an animated film but the CGI hasn't progressed enough where a large group of animals can look realistic in an action film. It looked like a flurry of images. The film does succeed in being engaging with the final action scene making up for any loss of weight in the previous action sequences. Acting wise it is just satisfactory where the performances are decent enough. I never really quite feel the pain that Lincoln is going through surrounding his mourning but its probably because we have this sort of thing many times before. Overall the film is a decent action yarn but does not really bring anything new but does entertain for the most part.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Disaster,"OK I don't know where to begin on how horrible this movie was.I guess I wasn't expecting much from the title, I have seen very bad movies before including ThanksKilling and Troll 2, and both were enjoyable in their own way. So I figured maybe a funny action movie with some bad lines. I could sit through that.Oh no. What was presented before me was Abraham Lincoln's life not only in Lifetime movie drama form but also a way, way over the top action flick. I literally could not stop laughing at how horribly corny and awful most of the scenes were. There was very little plot that wasn't already apparent if you have taken any American History class, which left the film stale, no plot twists or turns. Abraham is ""Honest Abe"" the entire movie though somehow becomes this ass-kicking ninja warrior overnight (the montage is hilarious). And the movie is way too long. It covers a huge span of time and by the time you are at the end; you just can't believe it's still going on.I get green screen special effects are neat but this movie relied on it heavily, creating scene after scene that the movie literally had to keep outdoing itself. The action scenes that should have been memorable just weren't because there was way too much going on. Abraham also had very little emotion in his performance, they tried to make him heartfelt in his fight against slavery but it just felt way too forced as with the whole movie. He was in no real danger either; he was almost caught a few times but somehow just got lucky, too lucky to create a real suspenseful movie I think.All in all, I can deal with the history inaccuracies and even the action, the seriousness this film tried to portray just made is god awful corny. I can't describe how agonizing it was to sit through scene after scene of this nightmare of a film.I am horribly disappointed. If it had even a slight bit of humor or maybe dark comedy features, it would have made this a bearable movie. Even if Abe just had some one-liners, I think I wouldn't be so disappointed.Please don't see this movie, unless you want ridiculous way-over-the-top action. I say go for it! But beware of the lifetime overtones.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

But nothing would be more from the truth, this movie is a fantastic thrill ride with excellent directing, very, very good camera work en good acting. Even the CGI was incredible, there is a chase scene with horses that really blows your mind, not to mention the bridge scene. The movie is even historically correct at 56:38!! I even dare to say this movie is one for the classics.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great book to read. A great movie to watch!,"Ten years ago, an author name Joe R. Lansdale, wrote a short story that made the majority of readers appalled and scratched their heads about it's rubbish. The King of Rock 'n' Roll, Elvis Presley, fighting an ancient, demonic mummy in a nursing home. Later on, director of the Phantasm series, Don Coscarelli, made this bizarre story come to life and the movie made a cult following afterwards. The name of that movie was Bubba Ho-Tep. Think about it. If someone can make a story about an actual historic icon that we all know of, secretly facing off an evil fictional force, the sky's the limit.This is when Seth Grahame-Smith comes in. Instead of a icon like Elvis, he uses the most American historic figure that changed and made our country's history. The sixteenth President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. Smith made a risky step to use Mr. Lincoln as a axe-wielding warrior slaying vampires! Vampires? YES! VAMPIRES! How crazy does that sound?At first, I had my doubts by looking at the cover of Mr. Lincoln smirking at me with both hands behind his back, holding a blood-splattered axe in one hand and a severed vampire head in the other. Over the months, I've decided to give the book at chance because you know what they say, ""Never judge a book by it's cover."" What a marvelous read it was, from beginning to end! How Abe discovered vampires are real when he was young, how he befriends the mysterious Henry, and his primary mission to kill many vampires as he can, intertwining with actual historic events with Smith's never-ending imagination of Mr. Lincoln's feud with the undead beasts! Very exciting read and highly recommend it!I bet you are saying at this point, ""Hey! Wait asecond! You're supposed to be reviewing the movie, not the book. If you want to review the movie, go type away at barnesandnoble.com or amazon.com, buddy!"" In fact, you are right. I had been carried away blabbering about the book. As for the movie, It was equally exciting as the novel!There were a lot of doubts about the cast selection for the film before it's release. But in my opinion, Benjamin Walker portrayed Mr. Lincoln pretty darn well. Even the late scenes when Lincoln aged into his 50's, Walker was still in solid form. As for the rest of the cast members, very great performances all-around!The story plot is almost the same as a book, but a lot of the story itself has changed drastically, just to make it an action-horror film rather than a movie with a lot of dialog. However, Seth Grahame-Smith wrote the screenplay for the film, making it feel that you're still in a safe zone if you've read the book before first. Sure, the story went off a slight different direction, but still keeping it's original touch of the core, thanks to Mr. Smith's clever writing.The fight scenes were very epic and fascinating to watch! Yes, I disagree about things getting CGI'ed beyond it's limit, but how else can two actors fight during a stampede of horses or a handful of actors on a runaway train on a burning bridge? I do have to admit that I felt quite cheated on the scenes when vampires show their true form by CGI'ing up the whole face rather than protruding their fangs like True Blood. But overall, do I really care about it? Not really. I was getting too interested by the combat and the choreography of each intense scene.In conclusion, If you are a fan of the book, like I am, you will enjoy the film, like I did. Be prepared for big changes of the story, but other than that, you won't be disappointed. If you never read the book but curious about the movie, give it a shot. It's full of frights, action, blood and gore, wound up in an interesting, yet amazing, storyline. I suggest reading the book first, but you can read it after watching the movie if you're craving for more adventure out of it's plot. 9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It appears Ishtar has finally been dethroned as the worst movie ever.,"No spoilers here, there is absolutely nothing about this movie worth sharing with anyone. As far as I am concerned Seth Grahame-Smith should be banned from Hollywood for life and owes me $9.50 for the ticket, $5.25 for the pack of smokes I chained down afterwords to get the bad taste out of my mouth and another 17.50 to cover the popcorn and drinks.How anyone could take their own perfectly enjoyable book and slaughter it into this unwatchable abortion is beyond me.Only once in my life did I get up and walk out of a movie to get my money back from the theater manager.

Why would anyone watch this?,"It's already awful that because of Stephanie Meyer's ridiculous book everything and everyone is VAMPIRED. Vampires playing baseball is one stupid thing but an American President, a historical icon and hero being a vampire hunter? Is Hollywood really that low now? I rather read the stupid fifty shades of Grey book than watch this crap! Just because the CGI is good and the story is almost not bad, it does not give people the right to make Abe Lincoln a ridiculous character. The guy has a memorial for Christ sake! I'll bet he can't sleep in his grave because of this movie. Vampires... give me a break. The next movie will be about a werewolf trying to kill Abe Lincoln to stop getting his 13th Amendement trough?

What a liberty!,"In between fighting the Civil War and abolishing slavery, Honest Abe Lincoln somehow found the time to clear the US of vampires! What a daft idea for a book or a movie (both actually).But it works! Well, sort of. You have to take a movie like this at face value. The film it has to be measured against is VAN HELSING, which had a special ingredient in the form of Hugh Jackman. Benjamin Walker displays none of Jackman's charisma, and even Rufus Sewell as the top vampire doesn't get to do much more than snarl and morph into a nightmare creature.The CGI is top-notch and the fights are well-staged. The 3D jumps out at you, as it should, although I didn't like the muted colour palette - a lot of sepia and night-scenes. But, as I said, taken at face value, this is a very enjoyable piece of hokum.But I'd rather have watched a sequel to VAN HELSING.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A waste of time, resources and Rufus Sewell","A mindnumbingly insulting concept and terminally boring execution. A snoozefest. How they managed that with the gorgeous Rufus Sewell, I don't know (obviously, they made poor use of him). The folks who thought this was a good flick apparently don't care how dumb the script or the concept get as long as they get their action scenes. At least I didn't waste money on this at the theater -- but I did have to sit through it when it played on HBO and I lost control of the remote. AAAAAGH! I felt like I was losing IQ points just having it on.Sewell is the only guy in this film who put a decent amount of effort into his acting, and he was sadly wasted here (I hope they paid him a bundle for this, because he sure can't put it into his portfolio of hits). In revenge and to clear my mental palate, I made my TV companion watch Dangerous Beauty with me the moment this abortion ended (Beauty is not only a much better film, but Sewell got a much better role).If I could give this loser a ZERO, I would, because it deserves that. Don't bother with this unless you really prefer being mindless (and in that case, don't brag about it).",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Fun Action Flick That Delivers On Exactly What It Promises,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is exactly what you would expect from the title. A ridiculous, over-the-top, and fun action-horror flick. The serious tone and silly premise may turn off some people, but the serious tone actually works to the films advantage and actually made the movie more fun. I actually think a goofy and comedic tone could've hurt the films in some ways by being a bit too tongue and cheek. The action scenes were well done and incredibly entertaining to watch. The final action scene was actually worth the price of admission alone. I also enjoyed how they included actual parts of Lincoln's history into the film. Benjamin Walker also surprisingly did a good job as Lincoln. The dialogue is corny but I actual think that played as a strength to a film rather than a weakness. The 3D effects are also used very well in the film and delivers a good mix of depth and gimmicky moments and really enhanced the action sequences. I would highly recommend seeing the film in 3D if you have the option. If I had any complaints it would be that I did feel like the film dragged a bit in the middle.Overall, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a fun flick that delivers on exactly what it promises. Abraham Lincoln kicking vampire ass! If you don't go in holding the films premise against it, than you'll have a blast with it!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Apparently audiences are still thirsty for blood and anything that brings back the night creature is a welcomed idea, even if that involves one of the most famous American Presidents.""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is fist of all a nice and entertaining movie. The stunning production will leave nothing to be desired and the enveloping music makes sure that everything is wrapped up together to present a spectacle of choreographed fights and bloody action.

"Unbelievable Disappointment, Read the Book Instead","When the movie began being advertised in theaters myself and my friends joked about it sounding ridiculous, my boyfriend and I decided we'd like to see it for the action sequences and creativity aspect of such an outlandish title. It was then that someone I worked with clued me in to the fact that this movie was based on a book which he found to be ""hilarious."" So, being the comedy, AND American History nerd that I am I purchased the book to see what all the hype was about. I read the book within a matter of days, as it was an excellent read and a prime example of historical fiction. I did not find the book to be ""hilarious"" beyond a few moments where a snicker or giggle is warranted, BUT While the events of the time period in the book were truthful and well researched the author did an outstanding job fitting in the supernatural and weaving together an enjoyable story, the movie falls short in an epic way.The character names are all that the two stories have in common. Events do not unfold as they should and are not in the correct chronological order. Some characters are portrayed vastly different, some characters are completely made up, and some are left out completely. The movie almost completely leaves out the historical events surrounding the main plot, and in doing so leaves the story lacking a real point and focusing on ""How awesome can we make this Abe vs Vampire confrontation look??"" Absolutely ridiculous. Glad I borrowed the Blu-Ray from a friend instead of spending money on this myself. I'm headed off the read the book over again, hoping to wash the bad taste of the movie out of my mouth.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better if you do not read the book,"Very enjoyable and great acting and action. I enjoyed Abraham Lincoln, I found it hard at times because so much was different from the book. What was most odd was Seth Grahame- Smith Wrote both. It is like he decided to take his idea and write a whole new story with that idea. I think Tiur did a good job directing not sure if he was the best, but did a good job. THe concept of the film is how serious do you want this story to be, it walks a thin line. My wife enjoyed the film , as I told her what was in the book, she wished that the had kept to a lot of those stories. The film was beautifully shot the LA scenes were my favorite. Much of the history that was in the book has been left out as well.I feel this movie would have done much better had it been released in October it is not a real summer type of film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well worth watching this fun movie - give it a break!,"My wife and I just watched this movie on DVD, and I can report that we both enjoyed our viewing. This is significant in and of itself, as my wife as rule does not enjoy action, supernatural and/or horror movies - all of which categories you could make a case that this film fell within. I think what made the movie enjoyable is that the fiction became somewhat believable played against the historical context which most people have at least some familiarity. I kept thinking to myself during the film that the premise that Vampires defined Lincoln's actions as well as the politics during the dark period of slavery in America, was as good a premise as any other historic biographical. Quite frankly, I find that most of the purported true biographic films so misrepresent fact that they might as well be works of fiction. Was the movie flawed? Of course it was, but the other reviewers who totally trash this film based predominantly on their assessment of the movie not being true to the book are foolish. I did not read the book, probably never would have as it is not my type of novel; however, the movie should be rated and evaluated wholly on its own merits. The movie was fun, fast-paced, and absolutely different then the same old recycled story lines and remakes. Just watch and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Blade, Vampire D, Let the Right One...","I have to say this movie is one of the strangest vampire films I have ever seen. Now in a way I can understand how some might see that as complimenting. But I don't think this vampire film is of note. It's not the best vampire film or the worst. What's so strange is obviously the Abraham Lincoln aspect.When I say aspect, I mean aspect. The title being split Abraham Lincoln:Vampire hunter is not surprisingly fitting. On one hand this movie is about a vampire hunter. And on the other it's about Abraham Lincoln. In truth this is a movie about a vampire hunter. The writer of both the book and screenplay Seth Grahame-Smith seemingly thought making the hunter Lincoln, made things more interesting but had little interest in actually making it even a little bit convincing as a fantasy. That is to say the Lincoln aspect is completely a gimmick.The fact this film has little to do with what we know of Lincoln is probably not surprising to anyone. But like I mentioned before simply as a vampire hunter film, this one isn't very good. The introduction to the film and Lincoln as a vampire hunter felt like a run through. It seems the writer and director knew they we covering over-used ground and instead of doing something different, they just speed things up.Despite the pacing causing me to be withdrawn, I did find the director Timur Bekmambetov and the editor William Hoy created interesting transition techniques from shot to shot and scene to scene. The transitioning certainly made the overall film more effective, but it did not save the film. Another strength in the film was the cinematography. It had the expected nights basked moonlight, sunrises and sunsets that are essential in vampire films. But overall the look of the film was engaging and artful. I thought the overall custom design was pretty good as well.The acting wasn't bad for the most part, Grahame-Smith didn't give them much of a chance to give a performances of note. I will say that visually Benjamin Walker pulled off being Abraham Lincoln. But does he pull of being Lincoln? I think he does as well as one can be expected to,considering.This movie is of some worth. This is due in no small part to the production designer, art director, set decorator, custom designer, and cinematographer. I think Timur Bekmambetov, probably most known for directing Wanted, shouldn't be written off either. Bekmambetov's two vampire movies Day Watch and Night Watch has gotten him a lot of attention as well(I haven't seen them but they are well regarded by many creditable vampire film aficionados). To be honest I think the one who should be spotlighted for this movie being an ineffective vampire film is the writer Seth. He is new to the screenplay writing game and it shows. Not to say he is talentless. I think this project was a bit to ambitious and it was too easy to go wrong. I won't go into the narrative faults but there are plenty of holes and one key thing we learn about the vampires is thrown out the door in the climax. Maybe if this film had dropped the gimmick, which is what the Abraham Lincoln aspect is, and made a movie about a vampire hunter during the same time, we could of had a far more interesting film on our hands.Oh yes, in the summary/header I put three alternatives for those looking for good vampire films. I listed Blade and Vampire D because those are good vampire hunter films as is John Carpenter's Vampires and their are others. I put Let the Right One In because that is a newer Swedish vampire film that is truly worth watching. The American version Let Me In isn't bad either. But if you have been searching for good vampire films you probably have already seen the ones I listed. But not to worry Let the Right One In proved the foundation made by the original film Nosferatu is to strong to be destroyed by this vampire fad lead by the Twilight Saga.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Better than I thought, not as good as it should have been","So close! That was my first thought when the credits for Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter began to roll. I am no fan of the book, I was only mildly excited for the movie, and I came out mildly disappointed. Why? Because it could have been so much more! It SHOULD have been. If the first half of this movie is any indication, it had big, metaphorical aspirations.However, the final result is still quite decent. No, not decent as in, ""Oh, look at its title! Shut off your brain and have a good time!"" No, not decent as in, ""I had a fun time and the blood was really cool!"" This movie was legitimately decent.The whole concept of transforming the ideology of slavery into an embodiment of evil is clever, and this idea is not lost on the script's translation to the big screen. On one side of the spectrum, this movie can be viewed purely as a metaphor for Lincoln's historical deeds and character.However, this concept also sets up AL:VH for its biggest flaw. The first half of the film runs with this alternate universe for Abraham Lincoln, and it succeeds wildly. We are given characters we accept, circumstances we appreciate, and relationships with which we agree. The pace is frenetic, the dialogue well-executed, and the acting enjoyable.But instead of keeping this attitude throughout its run time, the movie changes mood. Near the halfway point, the movie loses momentum due to a stale plot development that allows for the vampires to be leading the South in the Civil War. The action becomes ""meh"" and the characters no longer seem like legitimate people.Why doesn't it work? Firstly, AL:VH tries too hard to include more history in its second half. With Lincoln as president and leading the Civil War, the vampire actions seems out of place and just silly. This is because instead of REPLACING the historical events with the metaphorical vampires, or at least downplaying the history, AL:VH tries to reconcile the two and the result is downright boring (for example, did anyone REALLY care about that whole ""get the silver to Gettysburg"" plot line?) Also, we are subjected to some seriously bad makeup. The ""aging"" between early Lincoln to president Lincoln consists of a few wrinkles and a beard, and the co-stars fare even worse. Also, side characters stick around for too long, and we don't care about them. The shopkeeper is a poorly written character and never has a fleshed out personality, and Lincoln's black friend (whose unremarkable name escapes me) is also too insignificant but inexplicably good at killing vampires.In the end, DO SEE Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter for its cool action (eons ahead of that atrocity with similar effects, ""Immortals""), great visuals, and hints of moral poignancy and historical metaphors. But don't expect complete satisfaction.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Clever blend of fact and fiction,"This movie is worth a watch. It's quite a clever blend of fantasy horror with historical characters and events. Liked the ""alternative"" reasons for keeping slaves and how Gettysburg was decided. Nice contrast the Spielberg's Lincoln now in cinemas. Vampire movies work better with a historical framework than a sci fi modern setting.Benjamin Walker resembles a younger Liam Neeson and is a competent and charismatic lead. Nice to see the lovely Mary Elisabeth Winstead in a historical role. Rufus Sewell is lead vampire.The slashings are a bit repetitive and the killings could have been more inventively humorous.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointment,"I watched this movie because I found the idea of mixing genres very intriguing (historic drama plus vampire fantasy). However, what annoyed me most is the look of the movie, it's in sepia... terrible! Also, it does not really mix genres. It's mostly an action movie. So do action movie goers get one's money's worth? I personally don't think so, because the action scenes are very exaggerated and unrealistic. In most of the fight scenes Abraham Lincoln behaves as if he was a super hero. I just don't buy it! Benjamin Walker didn't convince me in his role at all, but maybe he was just one victim of the bad script and cinematography. My advice: don't be a victim yourself! Don't watch this movie unless you are really desperate!",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Old Lincoln Fun,"Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker), the 16th President of the United States, discovers vampires are planning to take over the United States. He makes it his mission to eliminate them.Director Timur Bekmambetov wowed audiences with ""Night Watch"" (2004) and its sequel ""Day Watch"" (2006), so there was no surprise he had more in him and knew how to make a great-looking atmospheric film.And whether or not the main character is Lincoln, this story puts vampires in a historical era they very rarely (if ever) are placed, and because it is done well, makes this a worthy and memorable film.A special shout out to Mary Elizabeth Winstead who plays Mary Todd Lincoln, a little bit outside the zone for roles she has played thus far.

The book is beautifully written, one that makes a hundred pages fly by, and even after your eyes hurt from the strain, you still want to go back for more. I was really looking forward to seeing how they would transform some of the powerful scene in the book to the silver screen. But unfortunately, not a single scene made it from the book to the projector. Only a few characters were kept from the book, and were only represented in name, none of their actions or their personalities made it through the Hollywood-ization. At one point Abe grows from a 30ish year old to a 50 year old in two minutes flat. As if there was no growth for him as a man, no substantial plot or character building happened during those years just *poof*: shopkeep to president, just like that.

The original Lincoln Project?,"The ads for this film made it look like it was possible that it could be semi-farcical tongue in cheek material like the Johnny Depp version of Dark Shadows. But instead it is a serious movie that did not turn out to be bad at all. Not great, but definitely watchable.This film has Abraham Lincoln as a child watching his mother being killed by vampires, and in adulthood deciding to go out on a crusade of killing them with his handy ax. He is initially hunting only one vampire, the one who killed his mother, but he soon learns that there are many vampires in America, making their main encampment in the South where they can own vast plantations with slaves as both workers and food.So it's basically an alternate history in which the president annihilates vampires in the name of freedom. Hmmm. Confederate soldiers as vampires - interesting analogy. In this universe, vampires can be killed by silver, like werewolves. So during the Civil War the Union troops shoot silver bullets in battle. It is a little too CGI'd for my taste, but since Blade (1998) established vampires as wearing the finest in black leather and doing Olympic Gold Medal caliber flips and acrobatics, I guess the audience is expecting that.I'd recommend it, and it doesn't get boring on repeat views either.

Sure, this movie makes little sense. But isn't trying to do so either, it just is what it is, take it or leave it. For example; how are the vampires running around in the sun? If defies all logic. And what? You get super strength just by taping in to your emotions? How? What? And the whole concept of the movie is actually straight up ridiculous. But I actually liked the mix of historical accuracy and the vampire narritive with over the top crazy vampire action. I like that the movie is actually taking it self kind of serious when it comes to the historical characters but gets goofy when it comes to the action. And the actions scenes are boonkers but still well made and so is the world, it's a high production on costumes and the set and the world looks authentic.

Not a horrendous train wreck!,"I'll follow suit of my good friend, and the star of Abe Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, and not fill your head with lies. This movie is tremendously enjoyable. AL:VH has a great sense of style, which is apparent in both the visuals and action sequences. A ton of hard work went into the craft of this twisted and cartoony early United States, and it shows. Along with the cool visuals is some fantastic action. Its highly stylized, axe-fu style scenes are terrific and choreographed to leave a smile on your face, and the finale is to die for. It's an excellent payoff to an otherwise ho-hum film.There are two excellent action scenes here, while the rest feel like little teases to urge you towards the epic finale. The acting is also passable here. The script is mad cliché, but Mr. Walker plays an actually pretty good Lincoln, and some great moments flourish while others are laughable. Other side characters are actually pretty well done, but nothing Oscar worthy of course. What is mainly the problem here is the story telling. It's...well...non existent. The film basically hangs by a thread of ideas about racism and slavery, all of which are cleverly portrayed, and some revenge plot.It's basic as basic can get, but that's not why you're going to go see this film. You're going to go see Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter because it's just that: our finest of presidents being a boss with an axe and chopping up vampires in the most stylish and fantastical of ways. It's fun, it's enjoyable, and it's much better than expected. From a film stand point, it's 3/5 stars, but from what I was hoping for, an action packed historical fiction with ridiculous scenarios and hyper-stylized action, and what I got...it's exactly what I asked for. Abe has his noticeable flaws, but this is a rough diamond of an action film that is sure to be in Blu ray players for a long time, and many times over.Verdict: Yup, see it. 3 stars And a side note: 3D was excellent. Great sense of depth, but also tons of excellent effects created a truly unique experience, unlike most post production films.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great movie!! Give us a sequel please!,"Now this movie is everything I was expecting it to be: Cool bloody action, great atmosphere, amazing visuals! The director Timur Bekmambetov did 'Wanted' before that and it totally shows.The movie did over 100 million $ worldwide and I hope they (=Fox) make a sequel to it. It's just great well-made entertainment and a lot of fun. Why the movie wasn't that big of a success in the US is just beyond me. But it was the same with Prince Of Persia: Great movie, no success in the US, but a big success overseas.. go figure!So Timur, please give us another one of Abe's adventures! I'm definitely up for it!",,Anonymous,Horror
Weak Coctail with poor taste,"The makers of this movie obviously were only up to produce another blockbuster without any message.The plot clearly is a cocktail of stolen ideas from actually hip and successful blockbusters as Twilight, From Dusk Til Dawn, Django Unchained, etc. but mixing up too many flavors without selection ends up with a very poor taste as this movie clearly shows.When I think of the potential this story had provided, if the vampires of the south would have been more a synonym than 'real', this movie is not only worth a single star. Only the 3D effects, picture and action scenes made me give 3 stars for this idiotic botch.The way it is, it shows Abe Lincolns talents more an axe swinging madman than the brilliant thinker and speaker he really was. If the modern US had been founded on a guy as shown in this movie, what a poor nation would it be? To me it's no surprise that no really good actor obviously wanted to part in this movie, why the set is filled with rather no-names that act as such.Even if I had only want to spend an entertaining afternoon with a movie that does not need me to activate my brain cells, there would have been many better choices. Definitvely not a movie I have to watch again...",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not well developed but still entertaining,"Now when I first saw the poster for this movie, it got my attention. I mean Abraham Lincoln is a vampire hunter in a movie? As odd as the connection is, it was intriguing and was awaiting for this movie to come out. Now was it a amazing movie that has a lot of creativity going for it? Not really, but it's still a entertaining movie that gets better as it progresses. When this movie started after couple of minutes in I thought it was going to suck. But it gradually started to build it's momentum. Now the main flaw about this movie is the editing and how the story progresses. Now this movie is based on a novel so it probably can't fit everything in here. But the movie felt like it skipped around a lot of stuff. Like if this movie came out on Blu-ray or DVD it my have some extended parts but just wasn't put in the theatrical released version or something. The editing just felt all over the place all around and didn't seem coherent. Also I know I sometimes put emphasis on development of characters although some movies are fine without much development. But this movie revolves around the man the legend Abraham Lincoln, one of the most popular and notorious president. But for the most part especially Abraham's younger yrs, it didn't feel like it was Abraham Lincoln. Like the character didn't stand out as the soon to be legendary president. And seemed like it could have been anybody for a while. Which is a bit disappointing, even if it's fictional it would have been nice if there was more depth and development in a imaginative way. So he at least seem like Abraham Lincoln. But I guess that is just a small gripe, cause this movie isn't about Abraham Lincoln's biographic movie but it's him kicking vampire ass. And I gotta admit he is a badass in this movie. Besides the upcoming movie featuring Daniel Day-Lewis ""Lincoln"" is the movie that tells the story in a realistic direction of the rise of a great president. I guess you can think of this movie kinda like ""Inglourious Basterds"" except less self indulgent and with more focus on action instead of dialogue. And the vampire killing action is sweet in this and there is a lot of it. Even the way the movie ended, it left in a good note. Overall I enjoyed this movie and might see it again, not a great one but it's entertaining.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Axe is Mightier than the Sword,"As if old Abe wasn't lionised enough, they had to make him a vampire slayer. I saw this film hoping it would provide the same level of satisfaction as Stephen Sommers' 'Van Helsing'. As usual, I expected too much.The film fails chiefly because of the limitations of its protagonist. Unknown Benjamin Walker plays Lincoln with an esprit more appropriate for less ludicrous material. Abe's arsenal is nothing more than his axe. Yes, it is also an unlikely gun, but the trailer saw to it that that wasn't going to be a surprise. Action choreography is clichéd (apart from an exhilarating horse stampede), and the countless slo-mos are infuriating. And I predicted the train decoy. The effects are suitably spooky, but I have no respect for vamps that can't fight.Prolific actor Dominic Cooper ('The Devil's Double', 'The History Boys') is very well miscast as Henry Sturgess, Lincoln's disgruntled vampire friend and coach. The part needed someone older, more grizzled and more interested in their subsidiary role.Elementary goofs turn this fantasy into farce. Why doesn't Abe question Henry's superhuman strength when he sees him dispatch a vamp? The plot reveals that vamps can't kill their own, but why does this stop Henry from intervening and at least setting them up for Abe to axe into oblivion? He's a lazy, unproductive sort, who talks a good game but goes missing when punches fly. Also, how is it that Henry manages to control his vampiric urges? Must be those blood patches I've read about.History is cheekily distorted to make vamps culpable for slavery. Propaganda? I wouldn't rule it out. The whole film is ridiculous, but what was I expecting from 'Wanted' director Timur Bekmambetov? He was, after all, born in the same country as Borat.www.moseleyb13.com",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.,"Abe Lincoln Vampire Slayer is nothing short of a masterpiece. The cinematography alone is enough to make me recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates being visually amused. Every scene is so shockingly detailed that occasionally I found myself paying more attention to the floating dust particles than the movie itself, which was incredibly impressive. I remember how excited I was to see that Burton was a part of this movie, because then it was guaranteed to be the work of art that it is. While still being somewhat historically accurate, the story is interesting with twists that I hadn't anticipated. The action scenes were so original and intense that they had me stunned. I literally was in awe (eyes wide with a big smile) at the brilliance of every sight. My expectations for this movie were dangerously high, but I was still so impressed that I wanted to stand up and applaud. I had so much fun that I didn't want it to end, and I will go back to see it again and again. I passionately recommend this movie to everyone that is capable of appreciating it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cheesiness That Is Fun,"It seems that vampires have the ability to do anything they please. They can walk in the sun, bend the elements, and wield guns and swords like ninja warriors. This weekend they add yet another quality to their ever growing list starting the civil war. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter has opened this weekend and just as the title has suggested, there is a load of cheesy ideas to fill this movie. Was this like most vampire cheesiness though or does Abraham Lincoln's tale stand out? Read on and decide for yourself as I give some insight into the movie.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, for those of you who haven't seen the trailers, is a story that starts out with death. A vampire by the name of Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) murders Lincoln's mother as he watches in fear. Nine years later, Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) attempts to avenge his mother by murdering the wise cracking vampire, only to fail his mission. However, a new ally named Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) save Lincoln and trains him in the art of vampire slaying to prepare him for a bigger mission. That mission is to not eliminate one vampire, but a whole army that resides in the south who are planning to establish their empire one nation at a time.Now let's face it although the trailers have made it look really cool, the idea of our 16th president being the newest Buffy is a little out there. Yes it is supposed to be a satire on a classic tale, but honestly why vampires and not something else. Despite the cheesy ideas though, the production team did a clever job integrating their imagination with historical events. The underground railroad, the silver mining operation, and the civil war were all modified to have an undead twist to help create a new story that was although cheesy entertaining to watch. However, like most movies these days, the team sometimes stretches their creative minds too far, which results in some annoying/stupid ideas that make you roll your eyes. The varying dialog doesn't help much as the most in depth comes from Lincoln's various speeches and addresses that can be found in any textbook or historical site. Sure a few of the jokes and one liners are funny, but it is due more to irony one sees with Lincoln saying them.Perhaps the biggest strength of this movie is the action scenes, which for once has finally lived up to the trailers. Lincoln's moves are pretty sweet, and although it's hilarious and rather ridiculous to see the president hacking away, the moves are rather well shot. The various action scenes are diverse enough to keep the action fresh and fun, helping to give vampire slaying an edge that's been missing for quite some time. Lincoln uses his environment and hatchet to fulfill his hits, and most of the scenes are fast and exciting to bring one into the moment. Unfortunately for some, there is also some rather disturbing and graphic factors that I wish to warn you about. Those thinking of taking younger audience members may want to think twice as the countless close ups of vampires may have nightmare provoking faces and ear shattering screams that can scare you half silly. If you're one who gets sick from gore filled scenes then again avoid this movie as with nearly every swing follows a river of black blood. Yet another thing that seems to go hand in hand with action these days is the 300 technique of delayed motion. Like so many action scenes, Lincoln is filled with exaggerated swings and ducks that would put walking under water to shame. I can see two reasons for this overabundance of slow motion scenes. Number one is to help emphasize the finishing kills and help the audience feel the thrill of the final kill. The second reason, and perhaps the biggest reason, is many of the scenes were shot for 3-D. Whether it's throwing an axe, or a horizontal swing the movie has countless scenes to pop out of the audience, which in the 2-D version of the movie was lost on me. However, for those who love the technique, well drink up this movie and enjoy.I guess the last thing to comment on is the acting, which was okay but nothing special. Walker does a decent job capturing both the younger and older versions of Lincoln, acting rogue enough to be a hormonal teenager, yet calm enough to be the authoritative figure. As for Cooper, well he did a decent job playing the hunter as he captured the drifter/ranger character well. However, he also had numerous other emotions down and when the time called for him to show those emotions he delivers. The rest of the cast is fine and play their parts well, but I don't have much room left to comment on their strengths, since the acting isn't the strongest part of this movie.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is an entertaining movie that is full of action and gore. Although the concept is rather ridiculous, it is worth a shot for any action lover or vampire movie watcher, though it is not a masterpiece. The clever integration of fiction into fact is worthy of applause, despite the rather predictable story. Perhaps the next time they do a movie like this though they find a better balance of using slow motion and perhaps even leave out the 3-D filming.

Why this movie ruin my Halloween in 2012,"Worse movie I have seen all year. The story line is ridiculous. Acting is cheesy, and it's far from scary.

Blah blah blah..Abe wins and defeats the vamps..ie ending slavery too..huh???? Spending 2.99 at blockbuster on this thing was a waste.

nice,"first - a nice idea for explain parts of history. then - nice script and CGI. and a story who use, in decent manner, a trend represented by The twilight series. a fairy tale, off course. in sauce of noble patriotic emotions. as many others American films. the only error - Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln. he did a good job but it is far, in the last part of film, to be a credible Lincoln. and not only the physical traits are the source of breakdown but a script who ignores a realistic structure of the administration. the Civil War discovered as result of need of justice/revenge of the great Abe is, almost, a childish solution. but it has a virtue - blockbuster recipes is used with great precision. and this detail defines it.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Big, silly and fun all in one.","If you're unsure what tone to expect from Russian director Timur Bekmambetov's latest outing, then there's a massive hint in the outlandish title. This is a big, silly action flick; no less and certainly no more. The violence is suitably gory; the set pieces are large, ambitious and entertaining – the melee between Honest Abe and a vamp amidst a stampede is fantastic – and the cinematography/CGI/3D is by no means perfect but decent enough to not detract from proceedings. There are a few head-slappingly dumb plot contrivances and character choices, however they somehow add to the glorious b-grade feel of the movie, whilst the acting is solid without being brilliant. AL:VH is unlikely to stay in anyone's mind after the end credits roll, yet it's a fun ride whilst in the moment.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Delivers what it promises. Stupid, but entertaining.","Just watched 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' (2012)History's not my strong suit, but I have this nagging feeling that they seem to have taken liberties with some of the historical facts here. ;)Just reading the title of the movie, I won't fault you for thinking how ridiculous the premise is. It's likely to be the first thought that would spring up, and I won't fault you for that, cos... well, it IS kinda ridiculous.But the title sums up the movie - the tone, the premise, the setting, the era, the genre, the plot. Never has a movie title been so revealing since 2006's 'Snakes on a Plane'But you should not be disappointed. If someone read the title of the movie (which is the least amount of pre-watch research you need to do for ANY movie), you can hardly be surprised at what you get. Unless you were forced to watch the movie at gunpoint, you don't really have a right to complain on this one.Abraham Lincoln is one of my favourite leaders, and I was wondering why they chose him as the subject for historic mangling, even if it's for fun. Of course, he was a physical guy, with a lot of energy. But why not pick out a fictional president? Of course, a story about a fictional vampire hunting president may not pull in as much bemused attention as latching on to a big name like L, seemingly pulling out the unwritten pages of history. But there was more to it. The vampire movement was linked to slavery, and Lincoln's presidency was a pivotal element of setting the slaves free.I'm sure they didn't select Lincoln because he was the emancipating president. I think they chose emancipation as a central plot premise so that the plot would fit Lincoln. In either case, the end product is a good watch.Don't get me wrong - the movie is as stupid and illogical as its premise. It has flimsy character development, sketchy plot, pointless villainy and unintentionally funny action sequences. But it's still enjoyable for a one time watch. And the special effects used in recreating the old era were quite interesting.The movie was promoted as Tim Burton's movie, but it's actually directed by Timur Bekmambetov. I was about to complain about the bait and switch maneuver here, but then again, I should have read the poster more carefully, I guess.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
It ages not so well.........,"So obviously this film is not supposed to be taken very seriously, just look at the title. But the CGI in this film is horrendous.

So for those reasons, I think this movie is just not very good or enjoyable to watch.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Man prefers history to legends,"Many have conceived the combination of biographical drama with the very contemporary and perhaps oxymoronic fantasy genre as the pitfall in this picture. Ironically, this review will probably be an oxymoron to one above or below it terms of its disagreement with this opinion. This unique blend has great substance to feel as if the hybrid film is almost necessary to engage a modern audience to appreciate the life of the 16th US president, as if he could be more valued.Timur Bekmambetov's piece successfully delivers exactly what the title suggests. We recollect many details in the life of the one of the greatest US presidents, paralleling with the use of literal and allegorical vicious vampire figures to represent the 19th century confederacy. Lincoln's battle against this commences as a quest for retribution, only to evolve into something much bigger than himself; the retaining of core American values.I find this film to be a masterpiece in some respects. Most notably the editing by William Hoy, whose transitions provide us with quite sensational storytelling, further assisted with an adequate script and admirable performances from a highly respectable cast. Unfortunately however, the telling of the president's two pursuits, overlap as his fight for the abolishment of slavery begins. It appears less emphasised that feels necessary and is more so casually added to the narrative as salt is added to pasta, we know it should be there but head chef Bekmambetov has thrown it in without realising its significance. Nonetheless, the motion picture remains a great spectacle throughout, only until plot holes and moments of..well silliness begin to unfold towards the climax of the feature. Feeling the need to make a face of brief disappointment where I roll my head and say to myself ""really?"" over the ridiculous and inconceivable mistakes made in production, I remain engaged to see how, what is foremost an enjoyable film, will conclude itself.As we conclude (both review and film), we return to the narration witnessed during the establishing shot, a technique that contains structure. ""History prefers legends to men"". While film history will not note this collaboration of genres as legendary, it does metaphorically tell a fictional interpretation of the life a legendary man.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A movie torn into pieces,To be honest I had great hopes with this movie but was utterly disappointed with the way this movie was made. It seems that the movie was an experiment of whims and fancies of the director. The direction was below par and acting could've been better. The movie is torn into pieces and leaves it's path into the middle. The director tried to bring the movie on the track but failed. The film also turns boring in between.

A terrific action summer movie with a fresh visual style.,"After watching Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter at home I asked myself why I didn't go to see it in a movie theater during the summer. I should have but I guess the reason was that I thought the premise was silly. Too bad because this is a terrific action film. It's very entertaining but I stress that it's not dumb. All the actors deliver good performances. Benjamin Walker creates a fantastic hero in Abraham Lincoln, a secret vampire hunter and the 16th President of the United States. Walker is good in the action scenes as well as at delivering Lincoln's historic lines. He begins hunting vampires as a young man with the assistance of his mentor Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper). Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Lincoln's wife Mary Todd and Anthony Mackie plays his closest friend William Johnson. Rufus Sewell as Adam is the film's main antagonist, a powerful vampire with an interesting story. The film is based on Seth Grahame-Smith's mashup novel of the same name. It plays very much like a comic book movie, and it takes liberties with the facts of Lincoln's life while poking fun at some of them. Director Timur Bekmambetov has a talent for creating impressive visuals, but here with the assistance of cinematographer Caleb Deschanel the look of the film is often stunning. The scene in which Lincoln fights Jack Barts on horseback at sunset is just one amazing highlight. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter earned almost twice its budget at the box office but it should have been a bigger hit. It's serious fantasy horror. I won't be surprised if it becomes a cult movie. It's one of the best films of 2012, and I definitely recommend seeing it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Put this on a penny and spend it,"I'm all for titles that spawn preposterous reactions and incredulity among the public, but Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter's begs ""notice me."" It is so strangely concocted, with a noun and an adjective strung together with little to no connection, that it demands you see it. The film takes one man's bestselling novel and gives it the seventy million dollar+ Hollywood treatment, and by the end, it doesn't walk out entirely gutted, but with some limbs missing.That's right, this was a novel, but I'm sure that fact is seldom known by the public. After weeks of seeing the trailer in theaters, for many different films, reactions were always different, yet there was always spry laughs coming from some audience members. A friend of mine stated, ""I doubt that was what the director was going for."" I disagree, as it brings me back to the incredulity part I was talking about. The idea is so strange, so cockamamie, and sounds so hilarious that while you're laughing, you're hiding the fact you want to see the film. An intelligent marketing plan if you ask me, but execution beats marketing intelligence.Benjamin Walker, who looks impeccably like a young Liam Neeson, jumps into the shoes and suit of our sixteenth president, and is holding a monumental grudge against Jack Barts (Marton Csokas), the man who poisoned his mother. When Barts informs Lincoln he is an immortal vampire, the bearded man is taken under the wing of Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), who tells him that he can teach him to become a skilled vampire hunter. Along the way, the man reconnects with an old African American boy he grew up with and Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), the women who would eventually become his wife.Director Timur Bekmambetov has taken the Tim Burton approach (who unsurprisingly has a credit on this picture) to the film and has given a dark and eerie look to it. Seeing it in 2D, I can't imagine how dingy and foggy the picture must've looked in the third dimension, what with the muted colors that are already muted and the loss of brightness when there is almost none to be lost. The cinematography, and of course, Benjamin Walker's brave performance as an ax wielding Lincoln, are the two things the film can offer before the premise begins to catch up with us.This is a film that was better an idea, or possibly a novel, than a one hundred and five minute picture. To begin with, it has an immensely pompous attitude towards this ""vampire"" premise, when really, its goal should be to achieve campiness and not a long-lasting impact on people. Brief escapism if you will. The whole picture neglects to recognize its absurd, revisionist ideas and treats the film as a masculine period piece established on modest obscurity. The film isn't modestly obscure but fully obscure, and it's unclear whether Seth Grahame-Smith (the writer of the film and the novel) wants us to laugh at it, although he makes very little attempt at black humor, a feat that would've been welcomed with open arms by myself, or if he wants us to sincerely care about it.There is a scene early on where Barts and Lincoln are fighting in a field, where CGI horses are racing pasts at stunning speeds. They are dodging, weaving, and carefully slipping under the horses' bodies for a good three or four minutes before Barts picks up a full horse and throws it at Lincoln like it's nothing. The film needed more ridiculous scenes like this, rather than monotonous action set pieces. The final sequence, involving a speeding train on a burning bridge, works great, yet, still occupies that unnecessary level of indulgence.As far as an impact on the audience, it seems the only thing Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter will succeed at is having a legion of internet users creating immature, mildly amusing, childlike SNL title/video parodies featuring other famed political icons. As a film itself, it is a cute idea, blown up on the big screen in a strangely pretentious way. Audiences are likely to appreciate the absurdity of it all, but if not, there's always the cult following business...Starring: Benjamin Walker, Dominic Cooper, Anthony Mackie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rufus Sewell, and Marton Csokas. Directed by: Timur Bekmambetov.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not for me: Nonstop CGI fight scenes.,"I was torn between 3-4 since the cast and production quality are quite good, but overall I thoroughly disliked the experience watching this.I love campy horror movies, and the theme here is amazing. I was expecting a Van Helsing style movie focused on Lincolns secret life slaying vampires, and I wanted it to be a campy good time whether they tried to do is seriously or comically.Unfortunately, they didn't achieve that, and I did not have fun. It has a few fun moments, but not enough. The movie is essentially back to back over the top CGI fight scenes reminiscent of ""Matrix: Reloaded"" with some callbacks to ""300"" and got repetitive and boring quickly.You might really enjoy this if you like non-stop action movies, don't mind the CGI, and aren't expecting a real vampire-hunter story, but it was not for me.The cast and production quality were good and there was so much wasted potential.=== More info ===Ironically, there is very little time spent on training, hunting, or killing vampires. They basically just have a bunch of high action (and long) fight scenes jammed together with short dialog scenes in between.The ""vampires"" are poorly defined, have very few 'rules', and could be any kind of arbitrary monster. Lincoln is supernaturally strong for no explained reason, so he can fight them, but no one else can. As mentioned above, the fight scenes are over the top, all CGI (decent quality), and repetitive.They jumped the shark early for me when they have a fight while running inside* and on top of* a stampede of horses, even throwing horses at each other. While that sounds funny, it just didn't fit the vibe, and was not entertaining. I was checked out for most of the movie after that, hoping they would bring me back in, but they never did anything interesting enough.They try to mix it with a slow, narrated documentary-esque vibe in between the scenes, but it just doesn't fit together right. It had so much potential, but was a big flop and two thumbs down for me.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Action and fun yes, history no","So I just finished watching this movie and I have to say that I liked it! No, its wasn't the visual, factual Abe Lincoln, but who cares! Alright, I guess if you are a history buff and WANT actual events, then you are better off watching ""Lincoln"" which I heard was pretty good as well.So, based on events when he was a child, Abe becomes a vampire hunter and a pretty darn good one a that and, based on past friendships, he becomes the man we all know and love today (equality makes anyone a friend in my book). Rufus Sewell plays the villain well (love him in most of his roles since Dark City) and Benjamin Walker wasn't bad (loved the ax-welding bit!) either. Supporting cast also did a good job.On a whole the movie was good as long as you like action, Rufus, and vampires (raises hand right here :D), not so much if you like history (drops hand).Cheers!!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tosh of the highest order,"And so Hollywood churns out YET another lame vampire film packed with rubbish CGI and action that looks like it's been choreographed by a hyperactive 5 year old. Seriously, who choreographs fight scenes like this? The action directors should take a look to their Asian counterparts to see what a real fight scene to look like, not deliver audiences this mess.The story is non-existent and merely an excuse to shoehorn vampires into a real-life historical scenario. Benjamin Walker, who plays the titular character, is awful; artificial and wooden in his youth, and stupidly fake-looking in his later years. Supporting actors like Dominic Cooper and Rufus Sewell should know better, although Mary Elizabeth Winstead seems to be making a career of appearing in films of middling to poor quality.The narrative lurches from one set-piece to the next, so there are chase scenes, fights on CGI trains, rubbish-looking battle set-pieces, and a plot so hackneyed that it should have been staked through the heart. In the end though it's the combination of poor quality CGI and badly choreographed fight scenes that make this so pitiful.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

A worthy effort wasted on an unworthy cause..,"""Abraham Lincoln: VampireHunter"" was strangely able to awake a peculiar mix of very different, conflicting emotions in me. Excitement and satisfaction on one side and sadness and discontent on the other kept me overwhelmed for a while. Eventually, the latter won and I had to face the hard truth that almost drove me into a rather painful melancholy.There was no way around that. I had to admit to myself that ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is an elegant nonsense, a professionally made nullity, an exciting shallowness, a worthy effort for an unworthy cause.Irrespective to its ultimate worth, the movie turned out to be well done professionally.The script was adequate to the task. The story had a solid literary source in its foundation – the SethGrahame-Smith's mash-up novel with the same name. It even featured some character development - a rarity for a mainstream Hollywood movie nowadays.The only truly silly and incredibly cheesy scene in the ""Abraham Lincoln: VampireHunter"" happened closer to the beginning of the movie and somehow even made it into the trailer. Fortunately, my fear that the rest of the film would continue along the same dangerously ludicrous lines turned out to be unfounded.The interesting and provocative concept was implemented skillfully and effectively and the sensitive historical subject was treated carefully, in a graceful manner, with a good taste and a proper respect.The directing, the casting and the acting in ""Abraham Lincoln: VampireHunter"" mostly did not disappoint.Timur Bekmambetov was able to repeat both the professional and the box office success of his 2008 movie ""Wanted"" by producing and directing an above-average action flick that kept the audience excited and entertained until the very end.Rufus Sewell was good as usual in the role of the chief vampire Adam, creating an original vivid character that nicely blended charisma, style, and self-irony. In my opinion, however, Sewell's Adam was not fascinating enough for an ancient demonic creature who was supposed to be a thousands years old ancestor of all vampires. I cannot help but thinking about the Bill Nighy's magnificent Viktor from the ""Underworld"" movie series whose immense charisma by far exceeded everything that Sewell's Adam could possibly offer.A similar charge can be held against Dominic Cooper, whose Henry Sturgess was charming yet too lightweight for a mysterious stranger responsible for first saving Abraham Lincoln's life and then initiating him into the secret order of the powerful vampire hunters.My personal favorite was Marton Csokas in the role of Jack Barts – a nasty, cunning, and ruthless vampire, responsible for the death of Abraham Lincoln's mother in the movie. Marton Csokas played his relatively small role masterfully, and, similarly to Sewell, employed a so appropriate strong touch of self-irony in his performance. The chase scene with Abraham Lincoln furiously pursuing Jack Barts to get his long-awaited and earned through much suffering revenge was arguably the best scene in the whole movie.Overall, the fight scenes in the ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" were done very well. They were imaginative, original, colorful - far superior to the dull monotonous back and forth clashing in ""The Avengers"".Portraying the 16th President of the United States was without a question the most difficult acting task in the movie. While the rest of the cast had much more freedom in impersonating their characters, the actor playing Abraham Lincoln for obvious reasons faced various constraints in order to remain true to the historical image. He, for example, could not afford the luxury of self-irony widely employed by the rest of the cast. Nevertheless, previously little known Benjamin Walker passed the tough acting test with flying colors and delivered a multifaceted, nuanced performance that powerfully reflected the character development. His Abraham Lincoln was both likable and believable at various stages of life – from youth to maturity.A promising talent Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whom some of you might remember for her strong lead performance in ""The Thing"" was nearly perfect in ""Abraham Lincoln: VampireHunter"" as Mary Todd Lincoln. Her small but warm and touching role became a nice addition to the movie ensemble dominated by the violent male characters.Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about Erin Wasson whose unimpressive performance essentially ruined the potentially very interesting character of Vadona - the dangerous and sinister Adam's sister.Finally, the solid original music score by Henry Jackman (""X-Men: First Class"") was a first-class citizen in the movie, easily flowing from the lyric heights to the dramatic depths to the violent rage of the fights and chases.Overall, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" decisively surpassed the far more popular ""The Avengers"" in almost every area, except maybe the special effects.""The Avengers"" was an unworthy effort wasted on an unworthy cause. The only true valuables spent in vain on ""The Avengers"" were time and money. There was no good script, or directing, or acting, or music to be sorry about.""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" on the other hand had many good, redeeming qualities including the script, the directing, the acting, the music, and the humor. For that very reason it is truly regrettable when such a worthy effort is wasted on such an unworthy, hollow, and disposable subject as ""vampire hunting"".knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not silly enough for its own good.,"'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012)' has a delightfully pulpy title. Unfortunately, although it is pulpy, it isn't very delightful. The main problem is that it just looks terrible, shot in its entirety like the opening montage from 'X-Men: Origins Wolverine (2009)'. It doesn't feel real, and its narrative plays out almost as a series of vignettes framed through the reading of Lincoln's diary (which also allows for near-constant narration to propel the story forwards between scenes). There's very little to hold on to here; everything is just so bland that it's difficult to remain invested in anything that's going on. Abraham Lincoln as a protagonist is really flat, although I think that's more to do with writing than performance, and you don't really get a good sense of who he is other than as this vague approximation of the legendary American president who's impossibly virtuous even when slaying undead bloodsuckers.The picture feels a little tacky at times, too, because it directly ties its absurd 'Honest Abe vs vampires' premise into slavery and The American Civil War (the vampires use slaves as food, so get involved in the war in order to keep slavery in the South; the war, including the infamous Battle of Gettysburg, is depicted as being especially difficult because the Confederate forces are comprised primarily of vampires). It seems to think it's making some sort of statement about these issues, tied between giving its audience silly vampire slaying and a more 'faithful' account of Lincoln's rise to president and subsequent actions. The two halves never coalesce, and sometimes clash so harshly that the affair leaves a bitter taste in the mouth.It does have its merits, though. A couple of the action sequences - in particular a mansion rescue and a train-based siege - are relatively entertaining, and the pacing is more-or-less as tight as it needs to be. There's a sequence involving a stampede of horses that's possibly one of the most ridiculous and over-the-top things I've ever seen in a movie, but it simply isn't as entertaining as it should be given its luxuriously ludicrous nature. The same is true of the whole thing, really; it doesn't live up to its gleefully goofy title/ concept. It isn't the worst film I've seen, but it's definitely not good. It's a wasted opportunity.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movies is awesome!! My friends and I freaking loved it!!,I don't like vampire movies!! But this movie is awesome!!!! I jumped like 2 times during this movie!! Please go watch it! It is absolutely amazing !! Even from the beginning it caught everyone attention. Usually it takes a minute for me to get into a movie but from the second it came on it completely caught my attention. Its not what I expected I thought it was going to be boring. We only watched this movie because it was the only thing playing at that time. So we was like whatever lets just watch it if its not good we will just leave. Not even close! I had to use the bathroom but I wouldn't DARE move because there was always something happening that you just didn't want to miss! Awesome movie! Go watch it NOW!,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Vomit,"I only went to this gastrointestinal challenge of a movie so I could comment.Having watched Avatar, Prometheus and now this stinking pile of dross my concerns about western society, let alone movie making, are becoming serious.I am a New Zealander who spent a lot of time in the USA and has done the rounds of Bull Run, Antietam, Gettysburg etc, and has a profound interest in the Civil War and its origins and outcomes. This is history, and maybe apart from an error of judgment or two at Gettysburg, the South may have carried the day, but they did not. Lincoln seized the moment to realign Union strategy with his famous speech.The rest is history.What is this retarded nonsense about him being a vampire hunter? The vampire genre has been cooked to a cinder. There is only one vampire flick worth looking at, Dracula (?1993) with Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, Keannu Reeves and Winnona Ryder, and even that is flawed but is close to the original Bram Stoker novel.This movie is just putrid rubbish. If people want to watch such mindless escapism then let them do a pure work of ridiculous fiction like Austin Powers: Vampire Killer or Waynes Vampire World. Are we going to have Barack Obama: Secret Zombie, next? Goodness gracious.And I won't go on about how Peter Jackson and NZ made Lord of the Rings, but hopefully we will through the Hobbit bring back true movie making to Wellywood.As a postcript, I learned today from a cousin in Virginia some interesting information. He tells me 17 Turnbull's served with the CSA but another one (Major Thomas Turnbull) was in charge of the lead battery in the Union line that faced Picketts Charge at Gettysburg. His battery killed one cousin on the CSA side. I am told that this is the only known incident at Gettysburg of family killing family. He was forever outcast from the rest of the family. Makes me even more wild about this insult of a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome Action Packed Thriller,"Enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. Simple, yet interesting story line. Tons of action, thrilling ride all the way through. Neat choreography of never before seen fight scenes. Frightful looking vampires with awesome bloody decapitation from our hero. Costumes and makeup are well presented here for the era and character/role. Explosions, special effects, cgi backgrounds were adequate. Best scene: burning bridge and train was spectacular. All actors played their part with adequate portral of their roles. So, if you are looking for a no brainer action sequence movie, this is it. If you want Oscar winning acting, drama, witty dialogue, plot with twists and turns....check the title of the movie again...and move on. Would watch a second round just for the over all action.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disappointed!,After reading the book I wanted to see this story on film. What I got was an audio book with excessive special effects.The movie left out essential details that help molded Abe's character into a vampire hunter in the book. The movie make him look like a fool and the action is so far fetch that it is laughable.The narration in the movie was excessive also. I paid for a movie not an audio book! Yet they kept filling in spot with word not action.This movie was leaned on special effects more than plot and acting so it failed miserably.I had to leave an hour into the movie.*Note to self to stay away from the everyone associated with this production.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A serious attempt at Lincoln hunting vampires. Seriously?,"A film with Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, the guy with the iconic beard and a very tall top hat, hunting vampires? Sounds like fun!Unfortunately, this film takes itself way too seriously, which is kinda baffling considering the title and the synopsis. It's not all garbage, but with light-hearted action and the thrill of supernatural violence written all over the premise, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter proves to be a major let-down.Maybe a simpler story would've helped? Why have so many pieces in it, when all people come to see here is what has been promised even before the film started: Mr. President kicking some fang-toothed butt amidst the internal turmoil of 19th century USA. Considering that being the main attraction here, the tone is also all wrong. Why so serious? If a point is being made here, it's really being lost in all the blood and the ax-wielding.Admittedly this film does have some cool shots and some nicely inventive action. But in the end, a neater package and a lighter approach would've been the key to success. Now it's bouncing off the walls and running and bumping into household objects like a 3-year-old on a sugar high.If they ever decide to make Teddy Roosevelt: Zombie Hunter or George Washington: Alien Hunter I hope they take note of all this and treat us to some quality leave-your-brain-at-the-cloakroom fun this film promised but failed to properly deliver.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Clearly someone forgot to mention how RIDICULOUS this film is,"I gave it a four star out of generosity. First, I bought this movie on i--Tunes thinking it was going to make a solid addition to my action/adventure genre. It didn't. The film lacks many things: originality, acting, storyline, and directing. First, the film is very much like watching an episode of Supernatural (at least Supernatural had a better way to kill vamps). There is no original way to kill a vampire here. Everything is the same: stake, sunlight, crosses, etc. Second, the acting is horrible. The lead actor tries too hard to be the clumsy, intelligent, vampire killer that closely resembles a Clark Kent double. His acting is dull, and unlikeable. Next, the storyline is weak! Another sad attempt to achieve originality. The directing is terrible. There are far too many UNBELIEVABLE scenes, even for an action film, that you just begin to laugh. Especially as the film is about to end. I gave it a 4 because the CGI was impressive. I wish I could get a refund.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A surprisingly satisfying ""alternate history"" adventure","I read the book almost on a dare, but was surprised to find that the author had put in almost as much solid research as Doris Kearns Goodwin, the author of the definitive Lincoln work ""Team of Rivals,"" to make his background solid. The film mostly lives up to the book and with or without the trashy/fun overlay of the supernatural admirably depicts the LOOK and feel of America in the mid-19th Century.While some admirable elements (like the frame) of the book are passed over, with the exception of the few White House scenes where only one Lincoln child is mentioned, the Cabinet is ignored and Lincoln's actual two white secretaries, Nicolay and Hay, are conflated into one black friend of the President's, most of the actual historical figures are more than fairly painted even as the film starts to drift from the tight structure of the book toward the end.Over all the film is a fun ""alternate history"" which ironically does bring the actual issue of slavery back into an examination of the Civil War. We came away (and the friend who went with me had not read the book) having found the film exceptionally well cast, acted and directed and immensely satisfying. Most satisfying of all, the more solid knowledge of history you HAVE, the more you'll enjoy the film, although it plays well merely as adventure. Benjamin Walker's Lincoln - he made a notable mark on Broadway last season playing a ""Bloody, Bloody (President) Andrew Jackson"" - is particularly good, blending a credible young Lincoln with the more ingrained popular image from the penny. If the film has a fault, it is over produced in places (the burning bridge scene) - but to criticize it for that would be like damning GONE WITH THE WIND for the ""burning of Atlanta"" scene going on too long! Mark it as something better than a guilty pleasure. Too many of the print critics heard the concept and assumed it had to be a campy spoof like Roman Polanski's THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE SLAYERS or PLEASE TAKE YOUR FANGS OUT OF MY NECK - and seemed upset that it wasn't. Go for what it IS, and you'll have a very good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

They even slightly messed up Lincoln's real life...I read the book and I was so excited to watch such an exciting book come to life, but after watching it, I was quite disappointed! It was good as a MOVIE....but as a movie based on a book...not so much.

The untold story of Abraham Lincoln,"With the title Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Wanted director Timur Bekmambetov bringing his highly stylized approach, here is a movie that really wants a cult audience. It'll be an uphill battle, as it frustrates as much as it satisfies.As a young boy, Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) saw two of the biggest blights on humanity: slavery and vampirism. It was personified in the form of his father's boss, Jack Barts (Marton Csokas). After his father (Joseph Mawle) is unable to pay his debts, Jack kills Lincoln's mother (Robin McLeavy) in front of him. Hungry for revenge, a skilled vampire hunter named Henry Struges (Dominic Cooper) teaches Lincoln about vampires and how to kill them using an axe lined with silver. In Springfield, Illinois, Abraham is given targets to kill as he studies to be a lawyer, but his quest evolves from a mission of vengeance to a ideological one to rid the world of slavery and vampires as his political career grows alongside his vampire-hunting exploits.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter delivers on the action, which is when it's most inventive and fun. Bekmambetov gives us a bloody experience as Lincoln decapitates his way through vampires and swings his axe in such slow motion that Zack Snyder would be embarrassed. Bekmambetov knows how to shoot an action scene and the fight choreography was top notch, though the editing in some scenes was a bit too choppy (no pun intended) and hard to follow. Bekmambetov also employs a very direct use of 3D as he points guns and blades in your face, but much of it was blurry and unfocused as with most poor post-conversions.Sadly, the $70-million budget was all too clear. The CGI replacements were rather obvious and the Battle of Gettysberg was very limited in scope, taking away the epic feeling one would expect from such an iconic battle. A horse stampede was also ruined by the weak CGI and choppy editing.Seth Grahame-Smith adapted his own novel here and he has in fact come up with some interesting ideas on vampirism to add to the already rich lore, like why silver is so effective on vampires, why they cannot kill another vampire and how they are able to stand the sunlight.But at the same time the screenplay has problems. The first half of the movie was fun and action-packed but when Lincoln becomes more involved in politics it starts to take itself way too seriously. You can't make serious points about racism and slavery when the man making them has been hacking creatures of the night to death. The film needed to loosen up and have more fun with its premise.As a character Lincoln does evolve from wanting revenge to widening his crusade against a menace, but he story is sluggish at times and skips major moments of his life, fast-forwarding to when he becomes president. It felt like large chunks of the movie were missing and some character actions just happen out of the blue. Hopefully this will result in a director's cut home release.Judging Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter as a historical piece would be an exercise in foolishness, but I will say this: for a movie that treats the issues of racism and slavery with dead seriousness, it is hard to believe the portrayals of friendly relations between the races at times.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter serves as Walker's first major movie role, so quite the undertaking for a rookie. He was strongest in full presidential mode, making his grant speeches and leading his nation, but early on he was a bland hero who disappears off the screen compared to the more colourful Cooper (who had a very interesting The Crow-like back story) who seemed to have more fun with his role. Rufus Sewell plays a villain who lacked any real menace or fear and Csokas gave a messy, scenery-chewing performance not helped by some of the film's worst dialogue. As the romantic lead, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is adequate, giving Mary Todd Lincoln plenty of charm.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is sadly a cheap-looking movie that took itself too seriously, but it is certainly not the worst vampire movie ever made. Stylized action fans will take some enjoyment from it, but it's not going to be the cult hit it strives to be.5.5/10 Please visit www.playeraffinity.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, Of the People, By the People, For the People","Well-Well - Isn't it just like the American movie industry to finally stoop to taking their country's most beloved and respected president and literally reducing him to the level of being an idiot vampire hunter? (and, all for the sake of cashing in on his name for a buck)Or, maybe I'm mistaken here - Was this nonsensical horror movie made in a deliberate, yet decidedly blind, attempt to elevate Lincoln even higher into the stratosphere of folklore heroism?Anyways - For the sake of keeping a U.S. president's reputation intact, I'm kinda wondering now what we're in for next from the likes of nut-case film producers such as Tim Burton?Like, how about? John F. Kennedy: Zombie Crucifier! (or, better yet) George Bush: Smurf Annihilator! (Ha!)Though I found the axe-wielding Abe Lincoln to be a truly laughable character (as well as this film's story hinging on the very edge of being a total Looney-Tune cartoon, sans any humour), I was actually quite impressed by the striking cinematography that prevailed, as well as the attention to detail which was placed on the period setting.All-in-all - This was a pretty average horror movie (with some decent gore). But, in the long run, it did absolutely nothing to evoke any reverence in me over the apparent charisma and political might of its title character.I, for one, sure hope that using U.S. presidents as a cheap marketing ploy to sell second-rate horror movies isn't going to turn into a new trend in this business of show business.P.S. - It really killed me that this film started off with a ridiculously laughable, out-of-context quote from the Bible - Genesis 17:5 (Look it up if you're at all interested)",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie is dumb!,"What is there to say about ""Abraham Lincoln - vampire hunter?"" Its a dumb idea, and it makes for a dumb movie.Oh be open minded I hear you say. Well I am. I went too see the film in the cinema didn't I? If it had just stuck too showing Lincoln as a younger man battling evil vampires then I could off maybe enjoyed it (These parts are the best parts off the film after all) but the trouble is it goes beyond that. Trenching right through Lincolns life, and attempting to link the most important off events in the life off the 16th president too a Van Helsing type character.Now if this had been done as a comedy it could off worked (I was laughing at later bits either way) but its not even trying too be funny. The Flick desperately tries to be clever. Working its way around the life off this historical figure, with ideas that are no doubt going over most off the audiences heads.What's left is an over the top mess with a so called plot which rushes through 50 years, yet still manages to drag. There's an obsession with slow motion, and tacky 3D (even though I saw it in 2D) and by the end I just felt kind off embarrassed that I'd just sat watching yet another vampire movie. Which thought it was being original because of the way it fitted itself around some forgotten history.I've heard the book was rubbish and yet they still decided to make a movie out off it.

As I had missed watching it in the cinema, I had to wait until it was released on DVD. In that time, I honestly could not wait. I constantly watched the trailers for it, tried to avoid any plot details in case of spoilers, and even looked up on some of the cast members I hadn't heard of before, including Mr Lincoln himself, Benjamin Walker. I got it the week it came out, and I didn't regret it. As well as fun yet exciting action scenes, the acting was just perfect from the majority of the cast, especially Walker, Dominic Cooper and Rufus Sewell. It also references Lincoln's actual life as a President very effectively as well as including this secret life as a vampire hunter. I also enjoyed the soundtrack, mainly because of Linkin Park's 'Powerless' being featured at the end but all the other songs went very well with the scenes, too. It may sound like a weird film but to me, it's one of the most unique films made in a long time.

Mostly different from the book,"I am giving this movie a 5 out of 10 because it was halfway completed in regards to story. While I realize that there are too many elements in a book to include in a full length movie, the results here are ridiculous. Main plot elements are both entirely removed or rushed for no reason. I do not understand the reasoning behind this. The book had a captivating story that tried to fit elements of Lincoln's past to make the story more believable. This movie didn't even attempt to do the same. Instead we have new/unnecessary characters and new plot elements that leave you wanting to rip your hair out.

During that he discovers vampires are planning to take over the United States. He makes it his mission to eliminate them.

Either Read the Book or Watch the Movie...Not Both!!!,"I saw trailers for this movie and it intrigued me enough to buy and read the book. As subsequent trailers have been released I have been more and more excited about seeing it--so much so that I went to see it opening weekend. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!I liked the book. It is not my favorite, but it was a fun read. For the book, the author did a really good job of researching Lincoln's life (yes, Wikipedia does count) and then ""filling in the holes"" with the fictional vampire story. While there were some obvious historical inaccuracies in the book (besides the vampires), for the most part, it was pretty historically accurate. The movie was such a huge departure from that philosophy that I found it supremely disappointing.In short...if you haven't read the book, you might enjoy the movie for the fight scenes, but it really doesn't have anything else going for it.

If you have no respect for good cinema, zombie movies and enter this movie with no expectations for the movie, you may find yourself mildly entertained.

Some people want no script and a lot of special effects and I have no problem with films that acknowledge that.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is going one step further.

This film should have been aborted in pre-production. It's almost as if this movie was made entirely from storyboards and no script. A Hollywood B-Movie burrito. It's as if every movie with plot holes and lackluster action scenes borrowed costumes from the set next door all rolled up into one silver screen atrocity.I don't save movie ticket stubs, but I saved this one because it was that horribly memorable for the first 50 minutes.

"Bizarre story, enjoyable movie","I was somewhat prepared to be disappointed by this movie due to its rather bizarre title and story but to my enjoyment I wasn't. I found it to be a quite enjoyable movie.The story is somewhat bizarre indeed, but then what would you expect when Tim Burton has stuck his fingers into the production? The blurb about the film is also not exactly correct. The 16th president doesn't discover that vampires are planning to take over the United States. It's more on the line that he enters politics and actually becomes the 16th President because of the vampires. The story also manages to, more or less, blame the slave trade on the vampires. After all, slaves would make a nice food source for plantation-owning vampires wouldn't it? As I said, the story is indeed somewhat bizarre.The film as a whole is quite enjoyable though. Well, I guess you have to like vampire/action movies in order to find it enjoyable but then, why else would you want to see this movie in the first place? There's enough action to keep the film going most of the time. If anything, maybe the training parts were a bit rushed and too short. The action is quite well done, reasonably blood-splattering, and fun to watch. The axe-swinging Abraham Lincoln is a cool twist instead of the usual wooden stake, cross swinging or dart throwing vampire hunters that we're used to see. He must be bloody, as in unnaturally, strong to be able swing around that axe the way he does but what the heck, it's a vampire movie after all, so one should perhaps not nit-pick on such things.There's a scene near the end of the film where a train is about to crash down into a ravine since the bridge, that the vampires have set on fire, is about to collapse. That's scene was a bit silly and overly unrealistic. There's also a fairly big whoops in the make-up department where Abraham and his friend Joshua clearly has aged a lot towards the end of the movie, which you would expect, but his wife and his friend Will seems not to have aged at all.

The book ending was really quite good, the movie end was stupid. I was given Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter the novel on CD by a friend. It was surprisingly good for a novel about an ax wielding president killing vampires in his spare time. The thing that made the novel so good was how careful Seth Graham Smith was to keep everything historically accurate. People dates places were very accurate in the book with some liberties of course. This movie, however did not even try to link the story line to any real history. The characters in this film felt very wooden and over played;Kind of like one of those lawn silhouettes painted fluorescent orange,not a pretty sight. The key events in this movie are rearranged from the book to make way for big holly wood stunts that seem very unnecessary and make little sense to history, or the original story. The movie went away from everything great about the book and made the whole idea of Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter as hooky as it sounds. Do yourself a favor and get the book on CD and skip this movie. You will enjoy the story a whole lot more.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
another cheap horror,"In the last few years i've seen hundreds of these movies come and go. Cheap horror that lacks excitement, a decent cast and a good script. It must be really easy to make films nowadays cause everyone seems to be doing it. I'm sure there are people who like this type of film, lets call it cult B-movies. But to me it's just a big waste of time and money. The poster looks fantastic, thats probably where all the money went.From the very first frame you get a good sense of where this film is going, absolutely nowhere. I guess it's made with a home or semi-pro camera. (thats how it looks to me) Most of the time thats my cue to sign off. But the trailer i saw seemed promising so i stuck with it. But after 30 minutes i got so bored with the bad acting and the terrible dialog i had to call it quits. What a shame that so many bad directors give the horror genre a bad name. I could have made this film, my 10 year old nephew could have. I don't want to be mean or disrespect the makers of this film, but they made it hard for me not to.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Abe is a myth?,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter - It has been circulated for his greatness and determination. The father of all men in United State resembled too much of greatness to be rewritten in such plot and story. The myth and history combined into a fantasy epic film wasn't impress me much. For a huge character in a very tremendous journey of Abe, Benjamin Walker made it quite well. Alongside with his fellow friends, Henry Stugess (played by Dominic Cooper), Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie) and Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), the struggle and adventure for a better nation free of vampires themed to the best brilliant attraction within this movie. Every aspect of action slot-visually or in storyline came out quite well though the CGI technique seemed too fragile and unreal in some parts of it. Speak to the moral values, every good wills or speeches, and the acts for greater kindness or versus the evil, the fact of Vampire Adam (Rufus Sewell) reminded me of some perspective where people keep turning our faith over something like this. But if you are some audiences looking for just entertainment and weekend out, this one certainly a good movie. Don't mind your logic too much. It may ruin your mood. And this isn't a history class but just fantasy after all. I shall give a solid four stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awful 3D and mediocre storyline leads to wasted potential,"As a movie, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is kind of a mess. There is no denying that there is some fun to be found here, especially if you're into the so-bad-it's-good genre. The cast is adequate and visually, it is quite striking. If you're looking for something any more substantial, I would suggest considerably lowering your expectations. I caught the midnight show.If you know the title, you can pretty much figure out the plot. We follow Abe Lincoln on a life- long journey after discovering that the creature who killed his mother was indeed a vampire. Along the way, he meets the love of his life and a fellow hunter who shows him the ropes.So right off the bat: I wasn't expecting an Award-winning film here. I mean, do you go into a movie called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and expect something extraordinary? Hell no. That said though, even with a premise as silly as this one you still have to find ways to make it work, ways to engage the audience beyond anything glimpsed here. For me personally, this movie just does not work when it needs to.The casting isn't the problem; everyone is actually quite good including the big man himself, played by a dashing Benjamin Walker. I did have a big issue with the aging makeup, though not so much on Abe. Everyone around him is supposed to get older as the time passes, and yet no one looks to be aged within ten years of Abe. I can understand some minor discrepancies, but seriously? The makeup on Mary Elizabeth Winstead made her look about five years older. The visual look of the film also isn't the problem, even though the special effects are overly shoddy at times and can pull you right out of the movie. Overseen by Tim Burton, the cinematography looks great even when the special effects don't. The action scenes usually fall pretty flat for the most part and didn't really impress me much. The whole section where Abe hunts down his mother's killer made me practically keel over from laughter, it was so preposterous.For me, the biggest problem lies in the script which relies quite a bit too much on the historical side of things without doing anything to really flesh out the characters. It also takes itself much, much too seriously for the movie's own good. Some dialogue and even entire situations don't make the slightest bit of sense. For instance, (minor spoiler here) it is established early on that one vampire cannot harm another vampire. So why, in one specific instance, does the very opposite of this established rule occur? There is no given explanation. There are all sorts of little plot holes, issues with the mythology, and logical impossibilities that definitely bothered me (how was Abe's hat able to hold the entire body weight of Mary without capsizing?), but there was quite a lot that I was willing to let slide.The positives: An energetic Dominic Cooper. Benjamin Walker completely immerses himself in the role of Abe and is believable even when the situations aren't. The visually pleasing look of the film. Lots to laugh at, even when it's unintentional. The look of the vampires. The comical overuse of slow-motion.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter isn't your typical vampire movie and it certainly doesn't establish any of the mythology to an understandable extent. However, I laughed a lot. It was a fun throwaway movie and certainly could have been much worse. Hilarity ensues from the second the movie begins. If you're looking forward to this flick, I would wait to check it out on DVD. The 3D was absolutely terrible and there was nothing that popped out at all, unless you count a few specks of dust. / Rating: D+",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not the Vampire flick we were waiting for, but the Vampire flick we NEEDED","""This world could do without another vampire flick"". ""Enough already"". This is what I told myself. And even the trailers and promos of this film were kind of okay-ish but not exactly charming enough to drop-your-jaw.Until I SAW this film.I guess that should be more than enough to say anything about this movie. Spielberg better pull up his socks. His upcoming biographical saga on Lincoln will need something out of the blue to convince his audience that Lincoln was just a normal president with a beard and not ...you know what. Wanted took my expectation level to a stratospheric high. With this movie the level has rocketed to the exosphere. Wanted 2 better be that good Mr Bekmambetov.

Honestly Entertaining Abe,"It's not often you find a blockbuster without any star-power in its ranks unless it's some sort of epic disaster movie which Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (ALVH) isn't. With a rather eccentric concept where the 16th President of the United States is an undercover hunter of vampires, Timur Berkmambetov manages to deliver an action packed feature with some stunning cinematography.While munching on their popcorn, audiences won't be inundated with simple action as writer Seth Grahame-Smith has blended in Lincoln's milestone moments in to the tapestry of the film.ALVH doesn't claim to be a profound movie but it does deliver as an action-packed, popcorn- munching entertainer and would be worth watching on the big screen let alone at home.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
bizarre concept but what the heck....,"The attraction of Vampire (and zombie) movies to the movie maker is that they legitimise as much wanton bloodletting and gore as can be served up inside of 120 minutes. 'Body count' movies became politically unacceptable after 9.11 and this became the favoured Hollywood solution. On that score this movie will not disappoint. The extreme violence and CGI blood spatter will not disappoint those with the appetite for gore. A cast of complete unknowns must have been necessitated by the refusal of any known actor, however minor, to participate in such a mess of blood and guts and the greatest disservice imaginable to one of America's greatest presidents. They are all well cast and acquit themselves with whatever dignity is available to such bottom feeders. The ultimate irony would be if every other (historically accurate) record of Abraham Lincoln got lost in the mists of time except this movie and 2,000 years from now our ancestors believed that the American Civil War eradicated not just legalised slavery but also vampires. That would be funny and make it altogether worthwhile.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Plays fast and loose with the truth.,"This movie is so full of historical inaccuracies that this becomes part of the appeal; one watches for the entertainment as well as to identify which facts they're going to get wrong next. I could make a long list of these, but it's pretty clear the producers of this film knew from the beginning their audience understood the fantasy inherent in the premise.This is not intended for greatness, and of course greatness was not achieved here. This was intended to be entertaining, and it certainly is that. This is kind of like a Marvel ""What If"" applied to our sixteenth President, and indeed the movie has a comic-book quality.This was fun to watch. Yes, it demeans the Civil War, unfairly attributes evil intent to the Confederacy, and rather cheapens the great man himself. But if you're looking for a good time for roughly and hour and a half, you could do worse.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
typical Timur flick,"This flick will divide the viewers in two camps just like the story itself, how cool is that. By which I mean, it's not a straight horror story. It's never frightening and the story itself can't be taken serious and it's that fact that will turn away the lovers of horror.On the other hand it's easy to spot that it was directed by Timur Bekmambetov. Just watch the fight scene's how it all was filmed. Most done in slow motion and that's so typical for Timur. Remember Nightwatch (2004) and what followed. So for people who loves this kind of filming or do adored The Matrix (1999) its fight scene's then this surely will be your cup of tea.That it was shot in 3D gave it an extra but it does hide the weak script. Don't get me wrong, it never was boring but if you think about Lincoln really being a vampire killer and the battle at Gettysburg being done between vampires from the south and humans from the north then this in fact a rip-off of his own Nightwatch franchise. But I must say that the effects looked stunning and that the 3D really worked. Just watch the horse ride and towards the end the disaster with the train. It's all exaggerated but let that also be the autograph of Timur.The acting itself was believable except when getting older you could spot that the beards were as fake as it could be. Still i enjoyed it because I don't have any problem with Timur's films so far. But some are fed up with him giving always the same treat.At the end of the day it's just a twist on American history filled with extra effects.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Offensive, stupid and unintentionally hilarious.","Hilariously, almost endearingly stupid, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter succeeds only as so bad it's funny cannon fodder. Pitched as a what if scenario, the film follows Lincoln through his early days, struggling with a need to avenge his family's death by the hands of a, you guessed it, vampire.The book from which this is based on, of the same name, is wholly entertaining because it accepts the ridiculousness of the premise and plays in it, giving it a wink to the audience charm and wit. However, Wanted director Timur Bekmambekov, with a lesser cast and a lesser budget, fails to even acknowledge its own stupidity and instead opts to play it completely, seriously straight, making this a dull exercise in slow mo action and tedious cliché.And so the film has to rely on the (limited) talents of its cast to pull the mess of a script together, and for the most part, they don't. Straddled with the Po faced role of the hero, Benjamin Walker fails even at being the Po faced hero, instead registering as a humourless, witless and idiotic impersonation of the great president, especially misfiring on the suitably misfiring romance between him and co star Mary Elizabeth Winstead, between this there is no chemistry, or in fact, sign of anything but air between them, which begs the question why bother with the love story and instead just make a 80 minute gore, slow mo and CGI fest of generic and repetitive action scenes of which the director is so, so fond of? Less poor, and by some miracle quite impressive, is Dominic Cooper, who, with the more extravagant role of 'Henry' the vampire hunter's trainer (as ridiculous as it sounds), stands out as the only actor in this who is both a) genuinely exerting some effort on his facial muscles and b) way too talented to be in an undercooked, overblown and offensively serious as this steaming, hot mess.This is made all the more surprising when the screenwriter is the author, Seth Grahame Smith, who is evidently much more talented as a novelist than a screenwriter. The sheer lack of depth in the depicting of Lincoln is as disconcerting as it is awful; the only mildly interesting thing they seem to reveal about Honest Abe is his affinity to killing vampires. An attempt to add some humanity to him in the latter stages is as misjudged as the prosthetics they added to Walker's facial features, which looks to have cost around £3 from the local arts and crafts store. His dialogue, hindered by line upon line of clumsy exposition, has at least a slip shod, B-movie charm to it, with such pearls as 'I was out freeing slaves' or my personal favourite 'they say he's a madman'.Verdict: In many ways, the acting in Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter by the lead and many of the supporting cast may well be a work of tongue in cheek ingenious; an, unbeknownst to the director, mutiny against the terrible script and tone of this, the worst film of 2012. Appealing only to fools and pre pubescent schoolboys.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Action and Worth Your Time,"So I saw the first ever premier of the movie. First of all don't let the title scare you, this movie is an action packed, fun flick.

What he lakes in the scenario (but quite imaginative if you realise they managed to tied up a historical figure to such an absurd vampire background!), he manages with the visual and the techniques: the director knows as to make a good entertainment and when you see all those wonderful unrealistic action scenes (real chain of events) you practically see a ballet so well orchestrated than you can only admire the work.So, don't miss this funny version of a myth: freedom.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than expected but is only as good as its promise,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a movie which delivers exactly what it promises. It promises a movie that takes itself seriously on a humorous topic and has good action scenes. And for an action flick it does deliver. The action is good, though sometimes repetitive, but it is still overly violent, bloody, explosion filled action. Of course the movie's plot isn't super complex or anything and doesn't try to be deep. It is a fun movie and is meant to be simply enjoyed and not really thought about.The whole movie is basically a joke that takes itself seriously. Apparently vampires live in the south and are confederates so that they can use slaves as a food source. This explains as to why Abraham became a politician because his mission is to stop slavery and ultimately kill off the vampires. It is kind of hard to review this movie in depth because... well... there isn't much to talk about. The movie is entertaining, it has good action, its action sequences start to get repetitive, and it doesn't really stand out from the movie crowd other than its title. The acting was solid and the score was decent. There are some arguably offensive aspects of the movie such as saying that the Confederates were a bunch of murdering vampires and watching them get brutally killed seemed slightly... inappropriate.All in all Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is an entertaining movie and doesn't really do anything wrong but doesn't really anything special.

Worst Movie of the Year,"There are movies that if they were human would be a strong argument for birth control; needless to say, this is one of those movies. This movie is nothing more than a $70million substitute for water-boarding. The dismal plot of the movie comes across as a cruel experiment by Hollywood to discover how poor of a script they can produce if they simply disguise it with an endless series of CGI action sequences and slow bullet time effects. I have seen Playstation games with less CGI than this movie displays. The bullet time effects are only appreciated because they provide longer relief from the banal acting than if they did the same scene in real time. The intended grotesque and gritty vampires come across as silly and comedic making Bella from Twilight comparatively seem frightening. The only mentally engaging aspect of this movie is trying to figure out how this movie was ever allowed to be made. Otherwise, my mind is more lifeless than the vampires from beginning to end. I went into the movie without having high expectations, yet I still left with an overwhelming feeling that I had just squandered two hours of my life with this abuse of my intelligence.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very strange movie...,"""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" the novel was a best seller. ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" the movie didn't do especially well at the box office. I haven't read the book, but I suspect many people didn't warm to the movie adaptation was that a lot of times what works on the written page doesn't work on the big screen. As it is, a lot of the movie had me scratching my head. Was I supposed to laugh? Was I supposed to treat it as a horror movie? Or was I supposed to take the entire thing seriously? I honestly didn't know how to react to what I saw. The movie also suffers from uneven special effects - some look good, but others look way too computer generated instead of realistic. I can't honestly say I was bored by this movie, but more often than not it left me bewildered. If I had hadn't gotten the Blu-ray as a free rental, I suspect my opinion would have been more negative. So I suggest you wait until it plays on cable on a slow night.",,Anonymous,Horror
Absurd Revisionist Fantasy,"From the title, it is obvious that this is NOT the Abe Lincoln that we  know from the history books. The curiosity factors aroused by this  film, directed by Timur Bekmambetov of ""Wanted"" {2008} and ""Daywatch""  {2006} fame, are how creatively the film-makers 'bastardise' American  history, and the set action pieces that Bekmambetov and his crew have  set up.  The answer: They are impressive but a bit ludicrous.  Adapted from the book by Seth Grahame-Smith (who also wrote the  screenplay), the film chronicles the loss of Abe's mother (Robin  MacLeavy) at the hands of a vampire when Abe is still a child. This  serves as the motivating factor for Abe's (Benjamin Walker) subsequent  vampire hunting mission and his burgeoning career as a lawyer and  politician to, finally, his Presidency during the Civil War. Along the  way, he kills countless bloodsuckers led by the vile and vicious Adam  (Rufus Sewell) as part of his secret war against the undead.  The movie is obviously a mix of biopic and horror flick but it fails at  both, and ends up being an expensive action film. This is evident in  the story which has Abe wielding an ax against the marauding vampires  instead of guns with silver bullets. With the ax, we get blood splashes  and dramatic combat action - the sort of targets Bekmambetov usually  aims for. Still, two of his set pieces stand out: a rodeo-styled chase  during a horse stampede, and a climactic fight on a runaway train  speeding across a burning bridge.  I am not really a fan of the main vampire plot which borders on the  ridiculous but Grahame-Smith provides a few interesting and absorbing  subplots, namely the relationship between Abe and his wife Mary Todd  (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). There is chemistry between Walker and  Winstead that makes us care about and believe in this absurd version of  the First Couple. Also, Walker, who looks like a young Liam Neeson (he  has played the younger version of Neeson's title character in Kinsey),  exudes the simple and honest charm one normally associates with Abe  Lincoln. Hence, bravo to the casting department.  One the minus side, the anti-slavery subplot and his rise to the  Presidency are given the short shrift; and the man-vs-vampire clashes  are so absurd that we are constantly reminded that this is revisionist  pulp fiction trying to get on the bandwagon of ""Twilight""'s popularity.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not a bad movie to watch with the young teens.,"This film was not too bad. It had a big budget and you can tell that by the special effects. It reminded me of films like PRIEST, UNDERWORLD and RESIDENT EVIL because of those effects with the slow motion action shots, which I like a lot. The story was actually not that bad as I'd heard some reviews saying this was a bad movie. But I found it to be entertaining and enjoyable to watch only because of the action scenes (one involving a stampede of horses - well done I thought) and I liked how it gives you another version of the history of Abraham Lincoln even though you know it is not true, but for me that didn't take anything away from this movie. Yeah, it's not great and it's over the top, but it definitely is not horrible. An enjoyable movie to watch if you have young teens who want to see a fun movie on a weekend with the parents.

An American Legend Fights a Private War,"It is not surprising this film had an Anne Rice type feel to it as it was shot in Louisiana. What is surprising to me is how, as one friend described it, such a ludicrous storyline could capture my fancy as it has. I suppose my fondness for horror films with catchy names has something to do with it. However, this one is more professionally done than such films as Jesse James vs. Frankenstein's Daughter or Billy the Kid vs. Dracula. (I'm not forgetting Buffy the Vampire Slayer!).If you have read the book, well written by author Seth Grahame-Greene, you are familiar with the story. I believe he did very well in taking a giant of American history, placing him in such a preposterous situation, and pulling it off with dignity and taste.The storyline, in case you are not aware, is straightforward and simple. As a child, young Abe Lincoln, (very well portrayed by Benjamin Walker), witnesses his mother being attacked by a vampire. After her death, he vows revenge. As it happens, a few years later the mysterious Henry Sturgess, (Dominic Cooper), injects himself into the life of Abe, now a young man. Sturgess trains Abe on how to be a vampire slayer. They create for Abe a specially made ax with the blade lined with silver. Older viewers will be reminded of the old Wild, Wild West television program. You will love the martial arts style ax work of Abraham Lincoln as he fights vampires to the death!We are deep into suspension of disbelief territory now, but that is the fun of films like this. Sturgess assigns Abe the vampires to be slain and Abe follows his directions to the letter. Eventually we are introduced to head vampire/plantation owner Adam, played by Rufus Sewell, who was my favorite character in the movie. His ""enforcer,' the beautiful Erin Wasson as Vadoma, adds spice to an already colorful story.Time passes and Abraham Lincoln is introduced to politics by meeting Stephen A. Douglas, (Alan Tudyk in an uncredited role) and eventually becomes the President of the United States. Abe has long since given up active pursuit of vampires, but learns the hard way that vampires and their hidden agenda are behind the secession of the southern states and the true cause of the Civil War.There will be no spoilers here. View the film to see how Honest Abe Lincoln ultimately saves the Union.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter runs 105 minutes, just about right for a film such as this. The special effects are nicely done and, for a film about vampires and blood, the gore is not excessive. Russian director Timur Bekmambetov, perhaps without intending to, injected a slight feel of a European view of the American Civil War into the story.This film will not be for everybody. Some will be offended at the use of Abraham Lincoln's name and reputation being used in this way. But, as stated earlier, it is done with dignity and Abraham Lincoln is every much the noble hero in the movie as we view him in real life. Something just as offensive, if not more so, is the use of the Confederacy as a mask for vampire domination. President Jefferson Davis is seen making a devil's deal with the despicable Adam and, for those of us with southern ancestry, this is disturbing. But, we need to remember this is a work of fiction, certainly not believable fiction in any way and I am certain there was no intention on the part of the writer to be disrespectful to anything or anybody.I would recommend this film if you like modern day horror film making. It is not a great film. It is a good film and highly entertaining, which is all a film such as this needs to be.",,Anonymous,Horror
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter...2.5 out of 4 Skittles,"Okayso let's get this all straightfamed president Abraham Lincoln's mother was murdered by a vampire, which led Abe to become a trained vampire hunter and seek revenge on his mother's killer. Ohand vampires controlled the slave trade in the Confederate South. WellIf you're okay with the new rewrite on history, you can probably get into this movie and enjoy the ride.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is delectably dark. The film's special effects team did a great job making vampires that are actually terrifying. The fight scenes are action packed and gory. Think Underworld meets The Walking Dead. And if you're a fan of the kinds of intensely gruesome deaths found in those kinds of projects, then do yourself a favor and watch the film in 3D. You will get to experience first hand how the vampire blood splatters from honest Abe's silver ax and fly out towards to the audience. Finally a 3D effect I can get on board with.The film is set to a furious pace that refuses to allow the audience to dwell on the insanely dumb plot, and doesn't give way to any scenes that may slow down the vampire killing action, like Abe and Mary Todd falling in love (I mean who really wants to see that when there are so many blood suckers that need to be destroyed).Director Timur Bekmambetov who also directed 2008's Wanted, proves he can handle a big budget film & writer Seth Grahame-Smith apparently saved all his entertaining vampire writing for this one, and not his dud script for Dark Shadows.The film's premise is obviously completely ridiculous. What comes nextGrover Cleveland: Mummy Stalker or Ronald Reagan: Werewolf Tamer. But in the end the film comes out as unique and exciting. And it's kind of cool to see the most infamous president destroying evil with his bare hands while adding a new credit to his historical resume. I meanwho wouldn't want Vampire Hunter listed right above proficiency with Microsoft Office.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
NOTHING like the book,"As someone who read the book, I was utterly disappointed and confused as to why Seth Grahame-Smith would write a screenplay for his own book that was entirely different from the original story. Perhaps the Hollywood execs didn't like his book or Grahame-Smith decided to tell a new tale. Either way, the book was lost in translation. Many historical details from the book were thrown out the window, characters are added and/or altered in their roles, plot lines were lost, and the ending is different. The only real similarities are that Abraham Lincoln is the main character and that he hunts vampires. While the movie is not absolutely horrible, it's unfortunate that a good book was not brought to the screen.

My Book Report: Abraham Lincoln,"Abraham LincolnA book report by Fields201When Abraham Lincoln was a small boy, he had a black friend named Will who was beaten by his owner. Abe was too small to stop him so he got whipped himself which angered his father. His father stopped him but what he didn't know was that he was messing with vampires and they killed his mother and eventually his father died too.Honest Abe vowed vengeance against the vampire who killed his mother, and some vampire hunter named Henry taught Abe Batman-style the ways of killing a vampire. He then sends Abe Lincoln out to this town to kill vampires and is not allowed to fall for anyone or make friends.WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT VAMPIRES: Vampires are really good at being out in the day.

If they attempt to kill each other, they are like magnets and repel backwards as if the forces of God won't allow them to kill.Soon Honest Abe becomes President and sports that weird beard that we all know. The Battle of Gettysburg was very hard because we were up against vampires and they know how to disappear and sneak attack us. Luckily, Honest Abe had a fork and he figured out how to kill vampires with steel. The end.F-Teacher's Note:Did you watch that stupid movie? That is not how the President lived his life. And for the record, even though Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is better than Twilight, it is plagued by a way-too-serious-of-a- tone-for-a-script for the title. Abraham Lincoln (though looks like a young Liam Neeson) is very uninteresting and almost sleep inducing, but luckily the action scenes keep you awake. Next time, read an actual book of Abraham Lincoln instead of a movie you will forget about in a year from now on!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Wassup, Will?","About 30 minutes into the film, I realized that the use of Lincoln as the protagonist was really nothing more than a jokey gimmick designed to attract an audience to a Batman Begins movie set during the 1800s. Why else watch this movie except for the titillating idea of Abraham Lincoln perhaps having been involved in something from the occult?If you're going to involve an important historical figure in your work, I'd think you'd try to marry the history to the activity--what is it about vampire hunting that suggests a different bit of insight about Lincoln?Lincoln was a very formal man of his times. He certainly wouldn't have used the American language in the ways he does here. Nor do I see Lincoln as having the kinetic range of a Neo in Matrix. He was a tall man with a deliberate gait and not at all as animated as he's presented here. This is a character ""named"" Abraham Lincoln, not ""being"" Abraham Lincoln.I was bored because I was watching a substandard super hero comic book kind of movie. All that research supposedly done to convey realism was a waste of time and effort. Someone should have researched language and customs.I forced myself to stay through the train fight video game, then simply walked out on the film. I felt tricked into watching a bad movie that I wouldn't even pay a $1 for in the box.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The 'history' they won't teach you in school,"Yes, as the title says, Abraham Lincoln is a 'vampire hunter.' It's obvious when you think about it. And the civil war was fought against vampires. Again, how did you NOT know? Okay, this film is silly. But then the title is unforgivably silly, so the film-makers assume that you know it's silly before you spend your money watching it. And they're right. It is silly. However, not THAT silly. For a start (believe it or not) the film follows Lincoln's life pretty closely (yes, apart from the inclusion of vampires... obviously), almost to the point that it's historically accurate! Then there are the action sequences. The undead hurl themselves in droves in Lincoln's direction, only to be sliced and diced in trendy slow motion effects with blood splattering everywhere - hardly traits of a comedy.Despite the film's kind of cheeky title, there aren't that many laughs (or even tongue in cheek moments) along the way. That's possibly what made it feel a little odd for me. From the title I was expecting a much dafter movie. What I got was an oldie-worldy action film with some reasonably high production values and attempts at remaining true to the historical text (again, if you don't count the vampire inclusion).If you like vampires and action, you'll probably like this. Think 'Blade set in times past' and you probably get the idea. However, if you're expecting something quite cheesy and tongue in cheek, then this isn't really it.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Bore-fest,"I was expecting something good from this movie but instead I got a very boring movie with very little action for a 'vampire movie'. The script was badly written,very amateurish.I'm so surprised that I made it to the end of the movie.I nearly turned it off a couple of times,especially by 1hour into the movie but I decided to stick it out to the end.You would think with how much these so called big productions cost that the writer would have put more effort into the script.But again I guess somethings are just asking too much.In-fact the B-Movie 'Infestation' was more exciting than AL:VH.OK it had some interesting parts but few and far between.Hey;there's more plot and action in an episode from 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' than there was in this over-priced movie!!Sorry but sometimes the truth hurts and some people are easily entertained,but that isn't me anymore;I expect quality and this just wasn't it!!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
great movie,"When I discovered this movie, skepticism washed over me. I mean, Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter? Having one of the greatest presidents of all time as the character of a vampire hunter would be the last thing anyone would expect. When I entered the theater, my initial thought was that this movie would bring me disappointment. But it turned out to be much better than expected and a fun film filled with lots of violence, blood, gore, and vampire decapitations. So, in the film adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's fantasy novel, Abraham Lincoln is a vampire hunter. But before he becomes that, he's just an ordinary boy living in a world consumed by slavery. One night, his mom died from an undiscovered disease and from then on, he's waited and searched for his mom's killer, only to discover a new large world of vampires. There he becomes a vampire hunter under the guidance of Henry Sturges (who has a secret). However, his vampire hunting career reaches a hiatus in the middle of a movie where Abraham is now interested in pursuing a career in politics. In the end, he becomes the President of the United States, only to have his career troubled by the devastating Civil War where vampires play a part in it somehow. In the 20 or so minutes that focus on his presidency, I felt there was an issue with it as it shifted the focus of vampire hunting and focused on politics and the Civil War instead as nothing about vampires was stated during this 20 minutes. The vampires are led by a leader named Adam. Although he might appear to be the strongest, I felt that the vampire John Barts (killer of Abraham's mother) was actually the main antagonist of the film and represented a bigger threat. While Adam had a lengthy climax, the fight with John Barts was much longer and was more personal as only the two of them were involved and more engaging. The scene also displayed more of the abilities possessed by a vampire. Talking about action scenes, they were all great and fantastic. They were energetic, full of blood, full of gore, extremely violent, and dead brutal. Most of them feature decapitations of the vampires and anyone seeking brutality, deadliness, blood, gore, and violence should be satisfied with the action scenes provided here. But what I noticed in the action scenes, particularly the Lincoln-Barts fight and parts of the climax, was that it was quite unclear. In the Lincoln-Barts fight, the two were in a sandy place with many horses galloping. I felt that there was too much sand flying around and the fight became unclear and a bit brownish. This made it hard to see what was going on. It might intentionally done like that to give it more of an old feeling but it may also be a distraction because you don't know what's going on. The same happened in parts of the climax but this time, smoke and sparks caused it. The script was a bit uneven. While the second half of the film was a bit better, I felt that the first half of the film was a bit lacking in dialog. There was little talk and there was too many decapitations, blood, and gore. I felt that the scenes progressed too fast and they should have taken it more patiently. In fact, most of the talk in the first part of the film comes from Abraham, due in part to the narration of fragments of his diary. The others rarely talk and probably only talk so little and it's only by the second half that they talk more. However, the performances by the actors were okay, not too terrible to burden the overall movie experience. I also felt there was a bit of a disaster with the make-up. Since the time in the story spans from Abraham's early adulthood to his fifties, we could clearly see a change in his facial appearance (a beard). We can also see this change with Abraham's friend Joshua Speed. The same cannot be said with Abraham's wife Mary Todd, and Abraham's other friend Will Johnson. Mary Todd doesn't appear to change with the exception of very few creases on her face whereas Will Johnson doesn't have a change in appearance at all. His face is exactly the same his hair didn't even turn white. However, the 3D was excellent. It takes you and makes you part of the scenes and is recommended although some of the scenes would make the 3D a nuisance. But other scenes where there is blood will be enhanced by the 3D and some of the blood may even squirt out to your face. And the visual effects! Oh they're such a wonder. But of course, impressive visual effects and eye-catching stunts would be what you would expect from a movie directed by Timur Bekmambetov. Overall, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is a film that offers moviegoers a fun time with plenty of bloody and gory action sequences filled with eye-catching stunts, impressive visual effects and excellent 3D effects. Despite the interesting plot, the film is downed by some poor unclear shots, an uneven script that mostly focused on action, not on dialog, and poor make-up. Regardless, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is a movie you should see if you want a bloody fun time.If you like science fiction this is the movie for you. I would recommend for 15 years and above. Form my point of view this is a good movie ever directed and made. This is the best Sic-fi thriller movie.

"OK movie, but a few holes","This is a movie you can't take too seriously. It's not a bad movie, but it's not great either. It's still more entertaining than the Twilight movies. The only thing I didn't understand was the use of silver to kill vampires. It was mentioned that Judas was paid with silver when he betrayed Jesus, so that's why silver can be used to kill vampires. Well, then, what was used to kill vampires BEFORE this happened. I mean, the vampire Adam mentioned that he's 5000 years old, which is 3000 years before Judas. So, silver was just fine before, but as soon as Judas was paid with silver, then voila, silver is all of a sudden deadly to vampires.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as bad as you might first think,"From the title, you would probably simply skip past this with a passing thought of 'I can't believe they made that' before quickly forgetting it and selecting some other DVD. However, having taken a chance, I have to say it was quite enjoyable. There are some clichés of course as with most vampire films, but there are also some different takes on the vampires themselves and what they can and cannot do. As the title suggests,the main character is indeed Abraham Lincoln of USA Presidential fame and follows his life for early childhood to Vampire hunter and onto politics and president. Now I know it sounds mad, I mean how can a president get out and about without anyone knowing and go vampire hunting, however, remember this is the early days of America, the Whitehouse has just been built and the American Civil War is on. So there are no secret service or FBI following the president around and to be fair, most of the vampire hunting happens before he becomes president. Although the film covers many years in the life of one man the pace is quick and it does not drag on, skipping large chunks of his life that are not important to the story which is a good thing rather than bad. There is a bit of a dodgy train scene near the end where you kind of have to stretch the imagination to believe it but apart from that the film is a lot better than the title or the trailer suggests. If you're into vampire films and fancy taking a change, I would give it a go. Just don't expect to be overwhelmed by the script.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'm going to really mad if this does better than Battleship or John Carter,"I always try and give movies the extra consideration for artistic contributions. Which is why I was surprised that John Carter and Battleship actually turned out to be duds. But this movie is really kind of a lemon. I mean, come on...vampires....and Abraham Lincoln. I'm sure the book was interesting and entertaining (as most books are always better than the movie). But it just seems that this movie is just trying to ride the coattails of this vampire craze gripping the country. The Twilight series as officially played this genre out for me.I give the special effects a good nod (with the exception of Lincoln's 'aged"" look), but the overall plot is ridiculous at best.Wait until this movie hits the dollar theater or the Red Box.

My Biggest Disappointment in Summer 2012,"I received Seth Grahame-Smith's novel for Christmas in 2011 and loved it. It perfectly blended the events of Lincoln's life with a new life as a vampire hunter in such a way that you could almost buy it as legit (if you have a loose grip on reality). It was portrayed as a secret journal Lincoln kept from his youth in which he documents the events of his life and how he came to be a vampire hunter and why it led to his interest in freeing the slaves in the Civil War. I was excited to find out, shortly after I finished the novel, that it was on the fast track to a movie adaptation from producer Tim Burton and director Timur Bekmambetov (WANTED). It was a perfect combo for the source material! The book was dark, suspenseful, and a gripping read. Well, the movie was none of these things. ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER was turned into summer blockbuster schlock with mindless action and a modified plot that ruined or removed all the best parts of the novel. For those unfamiliar, everything you need to know about this movie is in the title. It's the story of Abraham Lincoln's secret life. Our country's beloved 16th president is famous for his Emancipation Proclamation but spent his free time hunting the undead. When a vampire murders his mother, Lincoln dedicates his life to avenging her and battling the undead threat. Under the tutelage of the mysterious Henry Sturges, Lincoln develops the skills necessary to engage his new enemies.What bothers me most about the Burton/Bekmambetov adaption is how much it seems to veer away from the vibe of the novel. I understand that the script for the movie was written by Grahame-Smith (the original author) but even he seemed almost apologetic when I listened to his commentary for the film. In my opinion, he appeared to spend the entire movie trying to justify all the changes he made. No dice, Grahame-Smith. The changes were unnecessary and seem like pandering to the summer movie crowd in hopes of big box office cash. In a sense, he was successful because the movie made more than it's budget back in returns but it doesn't kill my disappointment. The action in the novel was brutal and fit the darker mood; the action in the movie is embellished and crazy with Lincoln running across the backs of stampeding horses or battling vampires on the roof of a speeding train. The writing and characters tried to take the material seriously (just as I'd hoped) but the events were so extreme that it bordered on campy. And what was the deal with Lincoln's almost supernatural abilities. There is nothing of the sort in the novel; Lincoln is just a normal man who trains his body and mind into peak condition. I know that's a lot to portray in a movie. That's what montages are for. We don't need to see Lincoln chopping a tree in half with a single swing. That's just stupid. I was hoping the movie would approach the premise and treat it as a ""what if this were true"" scenario and not as a semi-superhero tale.I also didn't see the point in adding the additional characters. There was a lot to get across in this movie already without tossing in new characters to develop. I went in to the movie understanding that the movie would need to leave a lot out. The novel covers the majority of Lincoln's lifeway more than could fit into a movie running under two hours long. But don't waste time with new material when the original was great. Instead, we get Lincoln's best friend Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie), a freed slave, and vampire lord Adam (Rufus Sewell). I guess Johnson was tossed in so the audience would have an easy understanding of what led Lincoln to free the slaves and Adam was supposed to be a focus point for all the vampire villainy. In other words, over-simplifying everything for a movie audience. The novel worked perfectly without these characters dumbing things down. The novel had a more overwhelming vampire conspiracy threat with their agents everywhere while Adam merely sneers and hams for the camera. He's your generic action movie villain. But he's the big baddie and gives Lincoln someone to kill during a climactic final battle and that's what summer movies need, I suppose.Anyway, fans of the novel are bound to be as disappointed in the movie as I was. Benjamin Walker was inspired casting as Lincoln. He was the smartest choice the filmmakers made. Mary Elizabeth Winstead didn't fit her role as Mary Todd. She's too adorable to be believable in the role, and the old age effects didn't work for her in the later parts of the film. Dominic Cooper has been scoring some major points as a rising star but I don't like his ""rock star"" version of Henry Sturges. I guess this was more a fault of the script, but I preferred the stoic mentor I remember from the novel. As far as its position as a summer movie, it's a stylish passable bit of entertainment. I was just hoping it'd have been a lot more.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Boring and looks like it has been shot on an iPhone 3,"This movies has a number of shortcomings, I would like to focus on one. The look.There are movies that benefit from a digital look and then there are movies that were shot on digital and look OK. This movie does not fall in either category. It looks really bad. So much so that I was constantly aware of technical aspects of filmmaking. Luckily there is neither much story nor excitement that I could have missed.It seems we are trapped in a close up of Mexican soap opera for most of the movie. Somebody must have thought that ""iMovie preset color-grading"" would help the film. Most of the film is so sepia or so blue that there is not much other color left. What really puzzles me is how this movie changes between ""super sepia"" and ""super blue"" in the same room at the same time for no dramatic reason.For many years ""Hollywood movie"" was a guarantee for a great looking cinematic experience. Regardless of problems with story or script there was a look that made up for other shortcomings. Battleship (2012) is far from a great movie, but it is an example how great a modern Hollywood movie can look.Unfortunately Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is a low point of the cheap digital TV aesthetic. I hope this look does not become acceptable as this has nothing to do with a cinematic experience.To sum it up: A movie called Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter that is neither fun, ironic, cool nor looks good is a wasted opportunity.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I hate vampire movies, but I loved this one","One way I measure a film's success is by the feeling I have when I leave the theater. If my head is still in the framework of the movie after I leave, then I deem it to have been successful, at least on some level. After Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter it was still in my head during the drive to my friend's house, where we all met afterward and discussed it at some length, another sign of success.I usually hate vampires in movies because most of the time they're just a cheap plot prop appealing to narcissistic types. But in this movie they're a cheap plot prop to weave a tale purporting to explain everything about Abe Lincoln and the US Civil War. In some ways it reminded me of Dick, the movie about the Watergate Scandal where ""Deep Throat"" turns out to be two teenage girls, and many of the veiled happenings of that scandal happen to have been caused by Betsy and Arlene, one way or another.To really appreciate Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter in that respect, it helps to know something about US history leading up to and during the Civil War. At the very least, you should look up Harriet Tubman, Jefferson Davis, and Gettysburg in Wikipedia before seeing the movie.Bekmembatov manages to pack a good deal of history, dialog, action, and story telling into this movie. The acting it mostly good, though Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance as Mary Todd Lincoln seemed uneven. Sometimes she was adequate, other times she was spitting her lines out too quickly, as do many pretty young women when playing this kind of historical role.The script veers between using fairly accurate language, to complete anachronism, like ""How'd that work out for ya?!"" But you know, the story is about how Abe Lincoln was killing vampires, so yeah.On the other hand, the sets, costumes, and other artwork seemed historically accurate and some of the CGI provides a new look at that era. There's a scene of the Mississippi River at New Orleans full of paddle wheel riverboats that lingers with me.So in the end I turned out liking the vampire prop, and the bad-ass Lincoln as portrayed by Benjamin Walker.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Good, But Fails to Meet High Expectations","I have long been a fan of director Timur Bekmanbetov's work. I was lucky enough to see his 2004 film Night Watch on the festival circuit that year and I was immediately taken by the visual styles and effects that Bekmanbetov brought to the screen. My admiration continued when Timur worked on his first English language film, Wanted, starring Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman. The film was hokey (a loom - really?) but the effects and action sequences were enough to drive the film to a $350 million worldwide gross.I was excited then to see him attached to the adaptation of Seth Grahmae-Smith's novel Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. I hadn't read the book, but just the idea behind the title and Bekmanbetov's involvement were enough to ensure my opening week-end attendance.The premise is neither complicated nor historical. The film opens with the introduction of a young Abraham Lincoln who witnesses his mother being bit and subsequently dying at the fangs of a vampire. We flash forward many years and Abe is a travelling assassin looking to bring justice to the undead blood sucker who took his mother's life. But his first confrontation is more than what the young would-be President can handle and only thanks to the intervening of Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) does he survive the encounter.In a quick and forced moment during his recovery, Abe learns that there are countless vampires – particularly in the Southern United States – and he agrees to heed the advice and follow the rules of the knowledgeable Henry in an effort to help rid the world of vampires one blood sucker at a time.Time continues to pass and we watch as Abe falls in love with Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), becomes President of the United States and challenges both his constituents in abolishing slavery while strategizing against the vampire presence lead by head vampire Adam (Rufus Sewell) and the deadly wonderful Vadoma (Erin Wasson).Abraham Lincoln – Vampire Hunter is being released in the highly contested summer blockbuster season so expectations for both a rewarding return on the production investment and a potential franchise are on the block. There is plenty of good in Timur's tale to warrant praise. A scene where Abraham Lincoln and vampire Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) chase and fight amongst a stampede of wild horses was a highlight. So too was a finale that included a speeding train and a wooden bridge set afire.As the adult Abraham Lincoln, actor Benjamin Walker, is believable as an axe wielding vampire killer with a grudge to settle. But he doesn't command the same dominant presence when the movie shifts to more of the political undertones of the 1800's.Unfortunately, the film has just as many negatives as it does positive to result in only a moderate recommendation. Henry Sturgess' character is a tad underwritten, and the final confrontation between Abraham Lincoln and Sewell's Adam is anti-climactic and over far too easily.Many of the action sequences are well choreographed. But the slow-motion revolving camera technique that then speeds up right before a blow is administered is repeated a little too often and offers nothing new in terms action ingenuity.It felt as if the final third of the film was dragging and at 105 minutes and I could have easily have suggested cuts in the editing room to chew off some fat. Abraham Lincoln – Vampire Hunter therefore ends up being a bit of a disappointment. It boasted a $70 million production budget. It had Tim Burton listed as a Producer. And it had Timur Bekmanbetov at the helm and his unique vision in bringing action sequences to the large screen. But with all these factors combined, the movie failed to arouse anything in me outside of a mild understanding that my time was not completely wasted and I at least enjoyed my experience even if I wasn't circling the internet search engines with high anticipation for a continuance in the story.www.killerreviews.com",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alternate History is Highly Stylized,"This is the second film since ""Inglorious Basterds"" where I have to accept a different version of events that contradicts actual history. My mind was fighting me, declaring what I am watching is not real history. In the movie ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"", they used fictional members of history, thus removing the irritation of what is truth or not. The story itself is a fun idea, and you can almost buy the alternate reality that a U. S. president disguises a war against vampires as a war against slavery. The action and staging is also enjoyable to watch.Some of the vampires are capable of turning invisible, which created an interesting dynamic in the action scenes. It reminded me of ""Interview with the Vampire"", where the character of Lestat here is represented by the character Henry Sturges. Benjamin Walker as Lincoln works fine, but his character seems dull compared to Sturges, yet Sturges has far less screen time. I thought Rufus Sewell was effective as the head vampire, I have fond memories of this underrated actor back in the film ""Dark City"".Upon initial viewing, I found it hard to recommend this curiosity for several reasons, despite the fun action scenes.First, is the dull demeanour of Lincoln, (who by the way has anybody mentioned he looks like a young Liam Neeson?) Second, is the absence of Sturges for more than I liked. Third, were the slo-mo action shots that were obviously ripping off the movie ""300"", because they happened so often they became annoying. Fourth, was the strange double life aspect of Lincoln's character, it was something I had a hard time getting emotionally invested in. Face it, politics is dull, and our main character is required to show his ascension to the presidency, and it failed to connect. Most other superheroes try to blend into the background, in order to not draw too much attention to their murdering spree. Also, it is no fault of the movie, but I had a hard time getting excited about life in a small town in Illinois in the early 1800's. The production design is fine for this period piece, and the action scenes are well put together. The music draws on the bombastic Hans Zimmer template, which may not have been the best choice for a period piece.But over time, I have found greater appreciation for this alternate history. Especially the stylized look of the production makes it noteworthy. When compared to similar movies, it holds its own.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Actions from the very beginning of the film were good. Although most of them were in slow motion. But only this one side was not good enough. It gave me some thrill at the last few minutes.

Choppin' and Droppin',"I read the Seth Grahame-Smith novel that Vampire Hunter is based on a year or so ago on a whim. I was shocked to find it an engrossing piece of writing that skillfully blended an off-beat version of horror mythology with the multi-faceted political climate that defined American during the Civil War. What's more, the protagonist—none other than Abraham Lincoln himself—was a vulnerable character; one that seemed every bit as flawed as Joe Schmo next door. He'd loved and lost, and any nobler purposes that have defined him as a historical legend were cast aside to reveal his true passion in life: vengeance.Chalk it up to the quirky title or the ridiculous juxtaposition, but the novel was a near instant success. As is usually the case in these situations, spinning the book into a feature film was inevitable. I was well aware going into the theater that much would have to be sacrificed to make the thing watchable (and to maintain a reasonable run time), but I was shocked to see that the subtlety of the novel had been shredded in favor of bullet-time action sequences—the sort that hurl you from one location to the next without allowing a moment to process the significance of what's just happened; the sort that kick you in the head with their stupidity; the sort that just don't make any damn sense.To be fair, it's not all bad news. There are some thrilling sequences, but the clunky transitions that attempt to further the narrative are grating (and the same sorts of associations readers were able to make with Honest Abe in the novel just aren't there on the big screen).As a rule, I try to avoid comparing a movie with its literary counterpart as it's my conviction that the film should be examined of its own merit. Here, though, I found this an almost impossible task, as I kept mulling over the squandered potential. In essence, what director Timur Bekmambetov and his colleagues have turned in is a Cliffsnotes version of a unique story. I get the feeling they wanted something suited for popcorn-munchiness, and there's not necessarily anything wrong with that. But they should have considered the nuances of the source material; the narrative butter that would have made the whole thing much tastier and easier to swallow. In leaving that out, audiences are dealt a stale serving that's half burned. You know, the sort of thing that gets stuck between your teeth and it's an infuriating nuisance until you're able to pry it out with a toothpick in hopes of achieving sweet relief.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Needed to be more humorous or less cheesy,"This film is an amalgam of inconsistencies; While I can't say I thoroughly enjoyed the film I also can't say I passionately hated it, and that in essence is why it frustrated me.Firstly I need to talk about pace; this is an area where this film struggled throughout. I found myself feeling at times that the pace was too quick, character development felt far too rushed to the point where it seemed forced and unbelievable and at other times the pace was at such a crawl that I found myself bored (especially the latter half).Visually this film was very beautiful. The sets and costumes especially were lovely; the visual effects through action sequences were also quite good to stunning, yet often far too 'over-the-top' in contrast with non- action sequences. That alone is indicative of this films fundamental flawThe premise is, let's face it; is silly. Hearing the film title I was, at the time, expecting a tongue-in-cheek action/comedy romp, well it wasn't or at least it tried not to be. Watching the dialogue and character interactions it becomes quite apparent that the film does in fact take itself very serious, then in the blink of an eye the action sequences will ask you to suspend all your disbelief, and in a big way. The action sequences, while visually impressive basically feel like they belong in a different film, they're in-congruent with the viewer's primary experience of the film. The over-the-top nature of what happens in these scenes often made me howl with laughter or cringe at how ridiculous it was. This in itself wouldn't be a bad thing if that sense of absurdity flowed-through into the rest of the film; dialogue/story etc. But alas, it did not. It seemed like the director and the visual effects lead had two separate visions for the film and no one managed the harmony between the two. I appreciate this is a Hollywood film, so plenty of action sequences are required to appeal to the unthinking majority, yet why do they have to be so ridiculous? It cheapens the film as a whole and insults the watcher. The same level of eye candy could be maintained with more realistic actions, that way more of the viewers could be happy.The plot seemed a bit lacking, especially from the middle of the film onwards. Some of the themes which could have been better utilised were glossed-over which removed immersion from the story. The antagonists felt like they were just thrown in because the story needed some bad guys. The characters weren't engaging; I didn't feel myself rooting for them or hoping they survived, I really didn't care about them and I think that was because they weren't built up properly from the beginning. In the latter portion of the film none of the characters had aged convincingly other than Abe, again killing the immersion. Overall I found the acting to be fine but the musical score however seemed out of place at times.If this film was a comedy (not just in action sequences) it would have worked much better and been a lot more enjoyable for me. Alternatively if this film was consistently serious (especially during the action sequences) it may have also worked better for me. But this film is a tight-rope walker; it stumbles along the wire, losing balance over-and- over again. Many-a-time it fell and landed on its crotch, the wire relentlessly crushing fragile parts of its anatomy. While humorous to see at first it soon become embarrassing and painful to watch it get back up again and again.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Above Average: 6.5,"Timur Bekmambetov is one of the most visually focused directors currently working. All three of his most famous preceding films are shining examples of style over substance, and featured cars driving on the sides of skyscrapers and shots following curving bullets through the air. While their stories and characters could never match the sumptuous eye candy, his style has never failed him. Similarly to his World of Watches films (which involved a war between good and evil over a piece of chalk), Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a movie that many could be forgiven for labeling as pulpy fun at best. Incredible title aside, Vampire Hunter takes itself and its bloodthirsty antagonists quite seriously. There are no attempts at limp comic relief, no Lincoln casually spewing the words for which he is known, and (almost) no sexy bloodsuckers. Our sixteenth president dispatches his opponents with swift, gory efficiency, all the while looking cool while doing it. Many fight scenes manage to touch all four walls of a room (and occasionally the ceiling) before the final silver-riddled corpse hits the ground. Each major encounter tops the last, culminating in a truly spectacular clash aboard a moving train. Of course, the entire film cannot be axes spitting skulls, and it is in these other areas that the film stumbles. Young Lincoln witnesses his mother's death at the hands of a vampire, and is taken under the wing of veteran vampire killer Henry Sturgess to learn the coveted art. Henry explains that the life of a hunter does not leave room for attachments or relationships. Lincoln, though, falls in love with and marries Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Their interactions would be more meaningful if they were better written. Seth Grahame-Smith, who wrote the screenplay adapted from his own novel, does not imbue his characters with much humanity. Sure, Lincoln shows emotion and wears grim expressions, but he might as well be the Terminator. Winstead, despite delivering the best performance in the film, cannot enliven conversations by herself. Neither the acting nor the writing allow conversations to fascinate or resonate. Now obviously, this film takes a few liberties with history. The south apparently consisted mostly of vampires, and slavery was nothing but a front to provide them with ample stockpiles of food. And the vampires were not fighting for their right to own slaves, but rather for the chance to establish an entire nation of bloodsuckers. How they would divvy up any unfortunate humans over an entire continent once that happened is anyone's guess. Also, Stephen Douglas is featured in the film, is capably played by Alan Tudyk, and is portrayed as being a pro-slavery activist. Douglas exists solely to provide the political Lincoln with an opponent, and is left feeling inconsequential as well as inaccurate. To its credit, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is full of sound and fury where it counts. Blood and death are the orders of the day, and are delivered in satisfying bursts. However, interchangeable characters and wooden dialogue prevent it from becoming anything more than a competently stylish action-horror flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody Solid Film,"Watched this on a whim, as it was recommended to me on FireStick (because two Rings Of Power actors are in this, I would assume, as well as Halloween coming up), and I don't have any regrets. A time well spent. It had just enough historical details to keep me interested and amused, but it didn't go overboard trying to shoehorn in people and events from Lincoln's life and American history. Lots of blood of both the human and vampire variety, but it somehow didn't feel gory, gross, or excessive. Wish we had seen more from Rufus Sewell. Benjamin Walker was really great.

Much better then first,"I watched this movie after seeing a trailer for it. Before that I made fun of the posters and idea of Abe Lincoln killing Vampires. I avoided Buffy the Vampire Slayer for the same reasons and when I finally watched them they became one of my favorite series. All that said if you watched A L vs Zombies and think this movie will let you down as that one did, watch it. The difference between the two is night and day. Vampires has a much larger budget and is produced by Tim Burton. I guess he saw the potential and picked up the project. It was full of action, special effects where on point, and the far fetched premise was made beleiveable enough as any vampire movie can be. The actor who played AL kicked butt and the fight scenes where awesome. The entire cast was quality. I believe this is a cult classic franchise in the making and would certainly watch the next, what ever it maybe assuming Tim Burton stays involved with the project.

"Disengage brain, sit back and go with the flow.","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. As titles go, it's up there with Snakes on a Plane and Cowboys Vs Aliens. In terms of quality and sheer entertainment value, it's somewhere between the second half of Cowboys Vs Aliens (about the time the aliens arrive) and the middle third of Snakes on a Plane. It's a 'disengage brain, sit back and go with the flow' kind of film. Don't expect much and you'll be pleasantly surprised. It's not terribly inventive, it's deeply flawed but, beyond all else, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a lot of fun.The films starts in 1818 with the young Abraham Lincoln living in Indiana with his parents (Robin McLeavy and, favourite of The Squiss, Joseph Mawle). We're given a quick background lesson as the young Lincoln a) befriends a young African American, William Johnson b) defends Johnson from a beating by the villainous Jack Barts c) watches his mother die after having her wrist 'kissed' by Barts and d) nurtures his desire for revenge for nine years before shooting Barts in the eye only to discover Barts doesn't die that easily because he's a vampire!Lincoln, by now played by Benjamin Walker (as the film progresses he looks more and more like Liam Neeson who, coincidently, was slated to play Lincoln in Spielberg's biopic until he was replaced by Daniel Day-Lewis), is rescued from an extremely narked Barts by the mysterious Henry Strugess (Dominic Cooper on fine form). And so begins an odd partnership that leads to vampire hunting, bloodletting, violence and the love of a good woman.After an enjoyable scene-setting first act, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter dives into the action with great gusto and for forty-five minutes or so completely forgets about the niceties of plot or continuity. The lighting and overall feel of the film changes scene by scene; one moment it's moody and gloomy, the next moment sepia images suggest flashbacks but it transpires we've actually advanced in time. It's both clumsy and erratic and there's nothing else to do than sit back, watch the fights and hope it makes sense again soon.A fast-flowing sequence with a horse stampede is blurred with poor digital effects but still enjoyable for the pace and sheer audacity of it, and that's pretty much the format of the film. And using a horse as a weapon is an act of absurdity bordering on genius. The arrival of Refus Sewell as Adam, the big and very bad vampire boss is a welcome boost to the proceedings. It's a very obvious piece of casting but if you need villain who barely resists twiddling his waxed moustache and muttering ""Curses"" then Sewell is your man.Director Timur Bekmambetov doesn't hide from the obvious references and lessons learned from his most successful films to date: Night Watch, Day Watch and the fabulously extreme Wanted. The fight sequences, Lincoln using an axe rather than the standard vampire-slaying silver bullets, are no longer original but still a great deal of fun although everything pales beside the stunning choreography of The Raid, which didn't need to rely on digital effects, blue screens or wire work. As with buses, there's no sign of an historical horror mashup for eons and then suddenly we experience a glut of them. If you're interested, soon to be released are the unrelated Abraham Lincoln Vs Zombies (direct-to-DVD and with a budget of $150,000 as opposed to Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter's $69 million!), FDR: American Badass and Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. On the basis of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter's box office so far, there'll be a great many more following.And that may not be a bad thing.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk",,Anonymous,Horror

Two points just for a great title,"I am going to start this review the same way I do every single review. I love horror movies.

The other Lincoln,"Based on the same-titled quasi-biographical horror novel by Seth Grahame-Smith retells the story of Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker), portraying him as much more than a statesman responsible for toppling slavery, instead delving into his hidden identity as a vampire slayer. During his youth he witnessed his mother taken away by vampire Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), thus the festering anger evolves into an unrelenting desire for revenge. Reckless in his craze Lincoln is confronted by reluctant vampire Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper), who promises to teach him how to channel the hatred and become the ultimate scourge of vampires. Despite great success Lincoln ultimately stabilises his life in the arms of Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and thus forfeits one craft focusing on his political career. However the path he started cannot be left so easily and simply...Unlike the Steven Spielberg directed biography this Abraham Lincoln portrayal won't be getting any love at the Oscars or Golden Globes. Directed by Timur Bekmambetov of ""Night Watch"" fame offers more of the same in terms of style: bombastic expressive flair with an utter disrespect for substantial script backdrop. Despite an absolutely ridiculous concept, apt for much ridicule, the story premise isn't as cringe-worthy as expected. Various tidbits of Lincoln history fit in nicely to the concept of his career as a vampire hunter, whilst the involvement of vampires into the civil war is pretty sensible, if contemptuously disregarding for historical recounts.All in all groups of audiences will cringe at the audacity of the idea, whilst others are certain to find an appeal. More inclined to the later, I was however put off by the somewhat turgid style of Bekmambetov, who does manage to put together luscious action sequences, but fails to instill enough heart into proceedings to make it anything more than eye candy. At times a peculiarly fun, if bloody, pastiche, else a somewhat nonsensical venture into triviality. Unfortunately not playful enough or conversely dark and dreary, instead has a cartoonish feel collaged with dramatic sequences from Lincoln's life. That said it seems necessary to underline that somehow the absurdity of Lincoln being a vampire slayer is scrumptiously fleshed into his biography, making it somewhat passable and not a sheer ridiculous running joke. Some of the CGI is somewhat plastic and strikingly obvious, especially regarding a sheer terrible vampire chase on top of stampeding horses. Not entirely a failure, but still not entertaining and engaging enough to be anything more than a pass-time: a fun idea devoid of enough fun to make it fulfill its promise.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Superb action scenes and performances make this one a killer.,"Going in knowing nothing about the flick except it was called, well... you know what, and that it was based on a novel of the same name, I expected no more than some cheesy CGI mediocrity.Boy, was I wrong.Let's start with the best thing about the movie: the action scenes. Timur Bekmambetov executes the action in ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" with stunning and extremely satisfying flourish, akin to Zack Snyder's ""300"" from 2006. Slow-mo shots aplenty, and vampire blood flowing across the screen, the action never lets up in its excitement or pace throughout the whole film.What really surprised me was the extreme effectiveness of the film as a historical drama, with great performances put in by all the lead roles. While at first I was a bit skeptical as Benjamin Walker looked a bit like the poor man's Benedict Cumberbatch, but I was blown away how Walker simply became Abraham Lincoln. Both the actor and the make-up department deserve special credit for bringing the 16th president to the big screen. Dominic Cooper was also very memorable in his role as the ""trainer"" of Honest Abe, and was always a pleasure to watch on-screen.The movie's pace is always consistent, and always generates excitement, be it through the simply outstanding action scenes, or the more dramatic ones. Originally, I thought a more humorous tongue-in-cheek would be appropriate for a movie like this, but I definitely would agree that the serious tone that the film employed definitely worked to its advantage by so seamlessly interweaving real-life history with the vampire mythos.All in all, the movie blew away my expectations. If you're in for some simply awesome vampire-slaying action, or even if you're into the historical aspect of Abraham Lincoln, the film delivers on every level. Definitely do not miss up on one of the best summer flicks of 2012.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Like the book-better than the title would suggest,"Seth Graheme-Smith's central premise - that slavery represented a boon for vampires and one that they were willing to fight for on the confederate side of the U.S. civil war - works unexpectedly well. The movie plays out the more goofy part of the notion - that Abraham Lincoln fought them individually and later collectively as President - as a straight-up action movie in line with ""Air Force One"" and the like. Some reviewers have faulted the film for an overly serious tone but given the campy nature of the concept itself, this taking itself seriously also works well. Basically, adding to the camp factor would have produced an annoying trifle rather than a watchable, if limited, American action picture. While the protagonists (Benjamin Walker as Old Abe and others) come across as fairly bland and serious, the vampire characters come across as menacing and, pardon the pun, bloody-thirsty particularly Erin Wasson as an evil seductress. (where was she when they were casting Catwoman?). The battles they fight although implausible (including on top of a train falling into a canyon) do make for some entertaining action sequences. In short, a popcorn movie worth a discount rental, just try not to think about how fighting something with the ability to turn invisible would pretty much be a non-starter (unless they had a really powerful smell).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Think a bit less romp than Van Helsing (2004) but with the same spirit.Benjamin Walker in the titular role is a great choice and exudes the same charm that presumably captured many in his 2016 outing alongside Teresa Palmer, The Choice. The fact that he's a dead ringer for a younger Liam Neeson just adds tons of sincerity and familiarity.Great supporting cast that might just as well be ensemble with well thought out set designs and costuming really make for a fun cinematic experience.

"A bit too ambitious, but it works.","As a young boy Lincoln witnesses how his mother is attacked by a vampire. Since then he dreams of nothing but killing that vampire. As a young man, he is taken under the wing and trained by a vampire hunter, who gives him assignments to kill all these vampires- except the one Lincoln wants to kill. Also in the area is the main vampire. In the meantime Lincoln studies law, becomes involved in politics, wins the presidency, and the civil war begins. The main vampire is a big fan of slavery because it gives him plenty of bodies. So the civil war will turn out to be the north against the vampires in the south. The main vampire also manages to attack Lincoln's son. As these vampires can only be killed with a silver bullet, Lincoln has to to gather all the silver he can get to provide the army with enough bullets to destroy all the vampires, but he first has to transport all that silver to the battlefront.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is surprisingly an entertaining action flick. I wasn't expecting much but ended up enjoying it. You can't expect much in terms of character development but Lincoln's vampire friend is somewhat of an interesting character. The fight sequences are pretty well filmed. The larger and more complex CGI scenes don't convince, they look pretty cheesy but I didn't mind. The final fight on top of a moving train, at night, surrounded by fire is too cliché. This movie tries to cover a lot in terms of the life of Lincold a bit too much perhaps, but it is nevertheless an entertaining movie that is rather mild for it's R-rating.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hyper-stylized action-horror, dampened by self-indulgence","In fairness, this movie never pretends to be anything it's not, and it is exactly what one would expect. It's action-horror, and a bombastically stylized, big-budget rendition at that. If you enjoy similarly minded romps such as the films of Paul W. S. Anderson, 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,' or 2004's 'Van Helsing,' this is going to be right up your alley. If you're less than perfectly enthusiastic about such fare, mileage will vary from one viewer to the next. If you require more information, well - I do enjoy 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire hunter,' but it's the type of entertainment that's best enjoyed in passing, and it's nowhere near ""must-see"" territory.The dialogue, characters, scene writing, and plot development help to foster a swift pace that maintains the zesty spirit of the concept rather than best storytelling judiciousness. This is no major surprise, of course, and nor are the consequent restrictions on a swell cast (Mary Elizabeth Winstead! Rufus Sewell! Anthony Mackie! Other people!) that means all their best skills are turned toward ends that somewhat rob their performances of the heart we know the actors possess. This isn't to say that there's no cleverness or fun to be had here, only that ALVH is unquestionably a popcorn flick that may, after all, have been most enjoyed on the big screen - rather than, say, in the home setting that instead encourages earnest investment in a feature. Earnest investment is not what ALVH is about. Still, I like the plot such as it is - it's suitable, not least as it adds a layer of fictionalized complexity to the United States' Civil War.Of course, we're not here for the narrative, or for acting. Strangely enough, one watches action-horror for the action, and the horror; except in rare circumstances, any underlying concept and the best story ideas or dialogue are mostly just flavoring. For what it's worth, on paper the action sequences are a hoot, and on the face of it they look great, including flashes of nineteenth-century war. The production design, art direction, costume design, special makeup, blood and gore, and stunts are marvelous. Where employed more fastidiously, any effects we see are fantastic. With all this said - in addition to the stylization for which the substance of the feature suffers in turn, the same is true of its violence. Digital creations are proliferate in ALVH, to the point that they become a wretched eyesore in no time at all. Whatever the reasoning for such abundance, the best CGI can never compare to physical, tangible props, prosthetics, and fabrications, and even just a little more favor shown to the latter in this instance would have absolutely benefited the whole. Even by the standards of action-horror, this is is significantly more Extra than it ever needed to be or should have been; by striving to always be More, it is invariably Less.I can honestly say that the picture is better than I expected. My assumption was ""more fun in concept than in actuality,"" with no need for knowledge of the title beyond the root idea. It turns out that I did have a good time watching - which is the least I could have hoped for; I've been curious about this ever since I saw ads on the metro in Prague in July 2012. Only, I just wish the film weren't so self-indulgent. Though the size of the audience may have been reduced, it would have been considerably improved had the material not been approached with all the most outrageous sensibilities of modern blockbuster, notions which rather reduce the climax to a ham-handed flurry of silliness, too on the nose for its own good. Still - this is exactly what we anticipate. Either you'll like what it has to offer, or you don't. Count me among those who enjoyed 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire hunter' - I also have no need to ever see it again. Take that as you will.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

How many movies have been made about a president that kills vampires AND saves the union? Well obviously this is the first. With the potential to be a complete flop, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter holds its ground with adrenaline pumping action sequences and creative connections with the vampires' involvement in the Civil War. Is it silly? Well duh, we all saw that coming. But like Blade and Underworld, it redeems vampire movies (after Twilight screwed it up). What makes the action scenes so alive is the same slow motion action that made 300 such a hit. My only complaint in the movie is part of its middle section when the vampire action temporarily comes to a halt. For plot development purposes it's necessary; maybe just lasted a little too long.

Factulal inconsistencies,"I have not seen the movie yet but i saw this in the trailer and i wanted to be the first one to point out a inconsistency in the historical accuracy In the trailers they show Linclon fighting a vampire near the Washington monument, but the monument was being built started in 1848 and finished 1884 but with him having been assassinated in 1865 There is no way for the monument to be completely constructed in that time, it would have been most historically accurate if they has shown it partially completed But seems how the movie is About a historical figure being a vampire slayer I'm sure there is going to be a lot of fact that don't quite fit.",,Anonymous,Horror

So stupid...even if you suspend disbelief.,"I have no problem with sci-fi or fantasy. In fact I bloody love the genres. So I was really looking forward to this film but what a crock it turned out to be. Note to the film makers; employing slo-mo does not lend your film gravitas.Well, initial rant over. But even if you enjoy the aforementioned genres nothing much in this film makes sense. Character exposition, no. Story development, no. I've never read the comic but I pray to god it was better than this. To even have a basic comprehension or love of it you'd need to give sh*t about American history (and being non-American I do not) and then if you do you need to be able to mould it to stupid possible interpretations. To be honest that sounds far more sophisticated than this film deserves. It was just a nonsense, period, supernatural action film concerning a man which 99% of the Earth's population had heard of and kind of respected but couldn't really give a cr*p about. I realise it's not meant to be an accurate historical portrayal but it tries to be so much more intelligent than it is. Even if you accept that the world is full of Vamps it still makes no sense. for example AbeL only realised, very late in the day, that silver is bad for Vamps. Weird considering he's been using it for ages.To be honest there are so many plot holes I can't be bothered to highlight them all.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Wasn't Fredrick Douglass Killing Vampires in the South, Too?","With all these films with Abraham Lincoln coming out this year, I thought I'd give my two cents, beginning with Timur Bekmambetov's adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's novel Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Bekmambetov is a Russian-Kazakh director who does his thing both in Hollywood and on his home turf. Seth Grahame-Smith is a filmmaker from Long Island who has been working with Tim Burton, wrote the screenplay for Burton's Dark Shadows. Grahame-Greene is a good writer. So I was interested in seeing how he would treat the story in this turning point in our country's history. He came with the idea that the South had amassed a bunch of vampires who were living off the blood of slaves. An interesting place to start a film. The film even has a freedman side kick childhood friend, ""Will Johnson"" in Anthony Mackey, of whom I'm a big fan. But alas, black folks were very much in the shadows of Lincoln and his martial arts master vampire killing sifu ""Henry Sturges,"" played by Dominic Cooper. Mackey get's a tiny bit of martial arts action and even does a move that looks very capoeira-like, but this is a story about Lincoln, played with some charm by Benjamin Walker. It would have been a great opportunity to imagine Fredrick Douglass as an ass kicking martial arts knowing vampire slayer right there with Lincoln. The film is a blockbuster with all the perks of a blockbuster $69 million budget, incredible animation, sweeping animated photography, gravity defying martial arts... it's a lot of fun, really, unless you're Black and keep feeling marginalized by not having enough contribution to the vanquishing of this evil which sank its roots into the origin of slavery in this country.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ripping Yarns for the 21 Century,"Saw this film tonight with extremely low expectation and just needing to get out of the house. So when I watched the beginning I thought this was going to be another failed horror flick full of clichés and dull plot or simply no plot. How wrong I was. When I began to get into it I realised that this was in fact more of an old school Ripping Yarn. This is what was done so well on a lot cheaper budget in the UK years ago. It adds a ton of humour to what is a (Sorry for he pun) dead genre. Vampire stories have long gone by their sell by date and this gives them a new life. I laughed through the whole film and not once did they try to play it for laughs. It helped bring me out of a dull fog from too much work. It entertained me, not once did it scare me. I don't think it ever meant to scare anyone. This is a piece of pure fun and should be seen only as that. Think Sean of the Dead and you've got the idea.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
History prefers legends to men.,"Ole honest Abe was up to more than we all thought,,,When Abraham was 9 yrs old his mother was taken from him. Killed by what he later found out to be a vampire. Abe spent the rest of his childhood plotting his revenge for when he came of age to do so. After finding his nerve with some liquid courage, Abraham set out to avenge the death of his mother,,, and fails terribly. It wasn't completely his fault,, he had yet to realize that what he was hunting was a vampire, and that it would be very difficult to destroy. Thankfully,, Abe meets Henry,, a man with a vast knowledge of how to destroy these vampire, who takes Abe under his wing and trains him to be a vampire hunter,,,Is this movie really good?

"Despite it's flaws, the movie is still superficially entertaining.","Call me old school but I learned just about everything I needed to know about vampires from the classic mid-80s movies Fright Night and The Lost Boys.Rule numero uno: sunlight kills vampires. Period. If it can tolerate daytime, it's not a vampire. So with this in mind, know that everything that is right about Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, none of it overcomes this flaw in it's premise. By-the- way, there's not a whole lot right with the movie anyway.Based off the popular novel of the same name by Seth Gramme-Smith, Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter, the film explores the premise of what if the 16th POTUS was motivated his entire life by a deep seeded hatred and personal vendetta against ""vampires"". (Please take note of the sarcastic quotation marks).These (historically) creatures of the night masquerade in 19th century America as inn-keepers, pastors, blacksmiths and among other things, plantation/ slave owners. The last of which is morally reprehensible to ""Honest Abe"" because his mother was killed by a racist ""vampire"" and his life long best friend is a abolitionist Black man (The Hurt Locker's Anthony Mackie)The main problem with this film (besides my beef with the misappropriation of the word vampire) is that it moves way too fast from scene to scene. The pace reminded me of the way a comic book reads resulting in very poor character development and cinematic rhythm. Some scenes were no longer than just a few seconds long; about the time it takes to read a page or two of a graphic novel.The novel is described as  ""mash-up"" of comic, horror, historical and thriller genres. Unfortunately, the film just doesn't successfully get the chemistry correct. There is little in the way of comedy, horror, thrills or historical accuracy to be found. The script is full of plot holes and logical inconsistencies that make as much sense as the silent ""L"" in Lincoln's part name.There is, however, enough action to almost make up for the lack of real substance and logic. If the film aimed to be a mind numbing action fest rather than a high brow thought provoking, good humored historical, study into the fictional motivations of the""Great Emancipator"", I may have been less cynical and more forgiving. Ironically, watching a young Liam Nesson looking Benjamin Walker attempt to be an action hero is mildly comedic. Whether this was intentional or not; only the film makers know.Timur Bekmambetov who directed the 2008 bullet bending Matrix-esque film Wanted, shoots AL:VH's action scenes once again liberally using that super- slowed- down-then-super-sped-up film style that made movies like The Matrix, Wanted and Sherlock Holmes visually clever and stunning. As a matter of fact, this movie could (arguably) be described as 300 meets Holmes meets Blade although I'm still calling foul in the use of the term vampire! (Yeah, I know, I need to let out go.)The fact that it was filmed in 3D rather than converted to 3D in post production assists this movie from being a complete disaster as the cinematography is remarkable. The camera picks up the smallest detail of the elaborate period sets and the 3D subtlety enhances those minuscule details.Despite it's flaws, the movie is still superficially entertaining. It may have that odd quality that one day land it cult classic status. Had it not been rated R this movie could have been perfectly marketed towards a young audience and shaped the vampire experience of todays teenagers like Fright Night and The Lost Boys did for me...as long as they don't mind sunlight tolerant...",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Utterly Silly,"Awful movie. Point. Everything here is laughable and bland, pointless and bad. Bad playing, terrible and repeated effects, bad soundtrack, very naive plot twists, funny scenery and especially stupid depiction of Civil War battles.

The plots never really collide in the film, as if the real story and all that vampire stuff simply exist on different levels, no matter how much Timur was trying to gel them. It never did. I never was involved into the storyline, and found myself grinning in utter disbelief all the time while watching that horror of a film.

Fantastically Addictive and great plot. Guilty Pleasure!,"Although some say that the plot and story line of this movie is very unrealistic and poorly thought about, i completely disagree. This movie has taken a well known piece of American history and added a fantasy twist. The directors have tried to give you the feel off an alternate world with alternate history, and any good fantasy film tends to do this. Yes there are a lot of CGI effects and action scenes, but it is the type of movie that benefited from that. I myself do not watch fantasy or period/history films, but this surprised me. Acting could be judged at times, but for an actor who has been in very few films their were times when Benjamin Walker showed real star quality.

Who knew presidents could be so tough,"Rating-6/10Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a fantasy horror movie presenting a rather warped view of history, and boy does it bring along some action with it. With crazy fight scenes and a rather serious tone too, this is one movie that can bend the way you look at it. It is enjoyable though, and despite what some say about its rather stupid tones, it is still fun and just rather exciting, an OK film but fun all round in my opinion.To be fair the movie is pretty silly in it's premise, because not only is it about the 16th president of the United States killing vampires like cows in a slaughter house, but also brings in actual events and claims some important parts of history involved vampires in some way, although fictional still kind of stupid at times. I did however enjoy the story and the writing is done well by Seth Grahame-Smith who is also the author of the book this is based on and he manages to create not only an interesting plot but one that never makes you bored or feel this is just another take on vampires.I found the acting side to be slightly on the dull side, now it isn't that the cast do bad or anything but they can feel slightly bored and not utilized enough. Benjamin Walker as Lincoln(who happens to look like a young Liam Neeson) is OK and manages the main role well, other cast such as Dominic Cooper, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Rufus Sewell all do well and I can't really say any ruin the film at any point, just as I say sometimes it feels the fighting choreography and effects overshadow the acting.When we come to the fighting it is ferocious stuff, and very very fast paced so don't blink or you may miss yet another decapitation. Timur Bekmambetov directs this and his experience with his film ""Wanted"" really comes into shape here with all the slow motion but then straight back to fast fighting and an array of gravity defying stunts and weapons people of the day could only dream of owning. The horror element that comes with this is good, but what I will say is that sometimes the horror can be only around the beginning and the fighting and gore can overshadow the truly scary parts, still there though.This isn't a movie typical among monster like films, now that does come mostly from the fact this is Abraham Lincoln here but it also feels different, the vampires seem apart from the usual bunch and can be both good and bad. The vampires are of course blood suckers but it still explains more about them than some films do and also brings a certain humanity to them in the ways you can kill them. I want to just also say about the effects used, now they are not the best but not the worst and for the budget this movie has they are OK. One thing I need to mention though is there over use, at times the action is too intense and so the CGI comes in and kind of takes out the feeling of the time this is set, and any minor feeling that Lincoln could have actually hunted vampires.Overall I felt it to be just about OK and one movie that although divides critics, certainly can be liked by many. If your looking for something to rent say on a night then this is a good little watch and find, with an axe wielding president, vampires with the most repulsive attack face and a weird kind of history lesson, this is a definite must see for action fans, but really not for your typical history classes.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Bloody Good Time!,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is such an absurd idea that you just can't help but love. Seriously, try to say the title without smiling. I dare you!This film whips up a crazy what if scenario that sounds like something a pre-teen boy would dream up in his head while he's bored in history class learning about The Civil War. After a traumatic event during his childhood, Abe Lincoln decides to take upon the duty of slaying vampires who are living among everyday people. It turns out that the vampires were the ones who started slavery in the United States, prompting Abe to get into the world of politics to bring an end to the vampire's reign of terror in the south.Absurd? Yes. Badass? You bet!I knew I was in for a good time going into this movie. Afterwards, I was satisfied. It was everything I could have wanted out of a movie about Abraham Lincoln killing vampires. It has a quick pace, it's got plenty of fast paced action, and some clever twists on historical events. It's pure fun entertainment, the type of B-movie cheesiness that just appeals to the inner pre-teen mindset that rests within us all. You're guaranteed to have fun with this movie, unless if you're some stuck up history snob that can't take a joke. It's also fairly well made for a movie of it's type. If you ask me, there's no better way to honor a great historical figure than turning them into a badass hunter of things that go bump in the night.

This is a work of fiction which uses one of the greatest president of United states as the main character and some of the historical events that happened during his lifetime. The acting was very well done, esp the characters played by Benjamin walker and Dominic copper were very well done. I personally think the whole cast did their jobs very well. Action sequences were fun and well directed. Timur the director did a great job in making this movie( really liked his work in Wanted and night watch) . The story was changed ago some extent from how is it in the book, and maybe would have liked to see some other parts of the book that were not part of the movie, but overall had a great time watching this movie. and will go see it again.

Terrible and disappointing,"I was actually looking forward to this film after having read and enjoyed the book, However what I was expecting and what I got were two completely different things. The movie has practically nothing to do with the novel, the stories are very different and not for the better.The movie constantly jumps many years ahead, leaving important questions unanswered, it's as though the producers knew the movie was terrible and just wanted it over with as soon as possible. As I said this leaves many questions unanswered, you are never given any real reason for the different characters motivations besides some very shallow reasons. You never really care about the characters because the movie does not spend any time developing them. And even the main character mr. Lincoln himself is not given much motivation for going in to the vampire hunting trade, nor for becoming a lawyer, politician or president.What the novel did so well making all the characters so human and making you feel that all the sacrifices that Abraham makes through his long and lonely life, are worth it in the end. Instead we get a shallow and stupid movie that has nothing to do with the book and trades a great story for ridiculous action and a super hero like Abraham Lincoln.Take my advise, don't ever waste your time watching this piece of garbage, but pick up the book instead because that one is actually good.Just a final note, no I would not have liked the movie any more if I had not read the book first, but I probably would have never read the book afterwards, which would have been a shame.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

The concept itself so unique, so very vintage flicked my pleasure buttons on.You may of course be a puritan, believing that a movie shouldn't defile the story of a guy who is so enmeshed in the American Philosophy. I don't really know what's happening in other parts of the world but a high profile debate is raging in India. The majority of course believes that this is just another gig to earn quick buck by hitching a ride on the band wagon named Abraham Lincoln. These sarcastic lot do not even think this movie to be worthy of their precious time.I, a humble blogger, tend to differ. Not only is this good versus evil saga high on the testosterone drive, but it also succeeds in rendering the image of Abraham Lincoln in colorful mosaic. It transforms Mr. Lincoln from a President to a demigod. People do not remember the minute historical details; plain history is drab, monotonous, stifling and strait-laced. What they remember is the myth surrounding the man/event and that is why Mahabharata and Ramayana not only survive but thrive in India. They are mythological pieces of literature, open for all to interpret it in any way they want. To reduce it to facts, would take out the life-juice from it. Similarly movies such as 'Abraham Lincoln- the Vampire Hunter' succeed in keeping the legend on. To read him in factual history books or to watch him in tableaux, live and kicking- what would you prefer?I, as always, would prefer the latter. Even if Mr. Lincoln was to be replaced by one of the Indian Prime Ministers, I would have watched it with equal, if not more, enthusiasm.'Abraham Lincoln- the Vampire Hunter' succeeds (according to me) due to the excellent acting by Benjamin Walker. I really don't know much about the real life Mr. Lincoln (other than the fact that he was lovingly called Abe Lincoln), but I believe that Benjamin had indeed been able to imbibe the character perfectly and has done justice to Abraham Lincoln.This movie indeed boasted of some excellent action sequences and especially those involving copious amount of blood spilling- it was quite graphic.The 3-D effect was good, the setup- quite wonderful. And the movie itself was gripping and fast paced.The dialogs were indeed inspired (also inspiring)!!!!!!!Whether you watch it or not, is of course upto you. But if some creative mind makes a movie called 'Jawaharlal Nehru- a Zombie Killer', I would be amongst the first ones to watch it",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

However, as an action movie where you simply turn off your brain, this movie delivers in every way.No one has ever thought of a movie like this and I think that's kind of how it just works. They went all-in on the campiness and crazy storyline and actually achieved a very watchable movie. The story isn't complicated and the characters are not extremely deep or anything.

Unlike any other vampire movie out there...,"Well now, this is an odd mix of politics and vampires, drama and horror...Action, adventure, gore, and amazing visuals blend to bring us an unforgettable, highly original vampire movie. Why ever did they decide to involve Abraham Lincoln with vampire hunting, I wonder? Benjamin Walker gives a very good performance as Lincoln. He is sincere when he needs to be, and determined and vicious when the occasion calls for it. And then he is a politician as well, which - I suppose - combines both these characteristics.In 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' Lincoln's mother dies after being bitten by a vampire. (In real life, his mother in fact did die in 1818 when he was just 9 years old - but she was NOT a vampire victim! In the film and in real life, his parents were Thomas and Nancy). Nine years after his Dad's death, Lincoln is out to avenge the vampire, Barts, responsible for his Mother's death. He meets a mysterious vampire hunter, Henry (Dominic Cooper), who teaches him to hunt vampires. During his training, Lincoln is given vampire assassination assignments, and can't wait for the moment to kill Barts. However, he meets the love of his life, Mary, who unintentionally complicates things for him.After a fast-paced, action-packed, gore-fest first act, the film becomes much slower paced during the second act, yet - thankfully - remains an interesting watch. The film then picks up again for a thrilling final act. The horse sequence is guaranteed to be unlike anything you've ever seen!

I've clearly seen too few of these kinds of movies and am equally clearly old-fashioned. But to read reviews saying ""it's boring"" or ""the action is fun"" – have we become so completely jaded that we think killing sprees are a bit of fun (yes, I know it's like a cartoon, yes, I know Lincoln's slaying evil in the film - I'm talking about the principle of the thing)?

A Must-See Satirical Horror + History Mash-Up,"I have to be honest...The idea first feel absurd to me.Upon seeing the film however, i have to tip my hat to Timur for attempting something such as this. Imagine... taking a historical figure + setting and mashing it up with a concept so bizarre that it beggars belief.Abraham Lincoln is indeed a figure well-respected in his home country for ending slavery. However, he also has slaves in his employ. This duality and conceit in his person is magnified even further in this movie. By transforming him into a vampire hunter, he is at once the savior of humanity while appearing more distant than ever from the issue of slavery. He only ends the trade because it suited his anti-vampire agenda. The fact that actions ended slavery is treated as just a by-product, rather than being the main issue.As such, i implore you, dear reader! Visit your nearest film house and surrender your money.

The two often mingle in the arts, particularly in the media of film.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a perfect example of how a authentic historical storyline can be mixed with a hybrid legend about vampires.Insane, right? It shouldn't work! It is impossible!Nevertheless, brilliant cinematography, superb writing, and a passionate cast bring it all together, moving disbelief and incredulity into places where few have dared to tread.If you're a fan of vampires (I am) and history (especially the Civil War), Abraham Lincoln Vampire: Hunter will not disappoint, and you'll find yourself mesmerized by this hugely unique portrayal of Lincoln, his wife, Mary Todd, and his intensely loyal friends, Henry Sturges and Will Johnson.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" messes with history in messy fashion","Twisting history can be amusing and in some cases even insightful. Seth Grahame-Smith aimed for both with his book, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"" but his film version doesn't exactly achieve the balancing act.Understandably, history takes a back seat in ""Vampire Hunter,"" but rather than go with a Gothic action approach to the vampire side of things, 20th Century Fox hired Timur Bekmambetov, who employs his hyper-stylized technique, which renders the film into a truly schizophrenic affair. It's a gritty revenge tale mixed with campy horror and philosophical undertones about freedom.Newcomer Benjamin Walker was an excellent choice to play Lincoln, and had he been cast in a non-fiction biopic, he would've excelled. He makes a downright convincing older Lincoln, the president/man we know him as, but obviously, that's not the focal point of ""Vampire Hunter."" Still, Walker's not so bad with an axe. He will remind many of Liam Neeson, an actor capable of both action and drama, who had this been 15-20 years ago, would've been a great fit for the part.The core of this version of Lincoln is defined by the death of Lincoln's parents at the hand of vampires. After saving his childhood friend (Anthony Mackie) from abuse, Lincoln unknowingly got his dad mixed up with a vampire. When that vampire claims his parents' lives, he grows up seeking revenge but knows not what he is getting himself into. With the help of another vampire hunter named Henry (Dominic Cooper), Abe trains himself with an axe to become a vampire hunter and dedicates himself to the profession despite being purely motivated by revenge.Lincoln would rather moonlight as a slayer of the undead, however, and can't help but fall for a local girl in Springfield named Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and pursue other ambitions, namely studying to be a lawyer and flirting with the idea of politics. But delivering rousing speeches and slaying vampires is a tough balancing act that costs him dearly.And that problem is mirrored by the film. With its priorities on telling the vampire side of Lincoln's life, it glazes over everything else in terms of motivation and ambition. We are to go entirely off of what we know about Lincoln from the real books, which ends up to be a big mistake on Grahame-Smith's part in his screenplay. Although he is mindful of the real Lincoln and cleverly twists the real timeline to fit his vampire mythology, when the film fast-forwards to older Lincoln in the final act, we have no real sense of the character and how he has internally been able to reconcile his public and private lives.It sounds like that's asking too much of a film called ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"" and in a sense that's true. As he did with ""Wanted,"" Bekmambetov delivers action and gore that will smack a stupid grin on your face whether you like it or not. It would just be nice if there was a little more effort put into linking the different element of the story in a more cohesive manner. Doing so would've at least enhanced the stakes of the plot, which won't elicit any kind of emotion.""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" doesn't take itself too seriously, but it overestimates how much its audience will appreciate its rhetoric as found in the narration. The idea of how history remembers events a specific way and leaves out certain details about the sacrifice involved is quite valid, but amidst the slow-motion baton twirling of an axe, it only has so much of an impact.Bekmambetov's reliance on digital effects also ruins how effective the movie can be, as much as it does make it ""cool"" at times. Films set in the 1800s usually don't have this problem, but it is here. The style of the action is clearly valued over the style that would best suit the film as a whole. Even then, the budget allows for only a mediocre use of CGI at best, or at least that's the impressive some of the effects shots give off. In today's blockbuster market, you ca't ever afford to look cheap, and ""Vampire Hunter"" includes too many cheap-looking effects shots. Some sequences benefit from a cartoony quality, but most don't.Butchering history (even literally) shouldn't automatically discredit how seriously a film should be taken, but the decision to take factual liberties should at least be based in some creative justification. The mere concept of ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" seems like enough to warrant creative freedom, but the film just doesn't capture that spirit the way you hope something so absurd-sounding would.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"A movie, oddly entertaining","It was an entertaining movie, without having read the book. The premise was particularly extremely bonkers.Wasn't expecting big Abe to be a vampire hunter thats for sure!! He was kinda hot, oh my, loved the premise and vampires. It kept me on the tippest of my toes, and flabbered my gasters. As someone who hasnt learnt American history it was rather suprising knowing that there was a vampire problem! I thought vampires were myths, this movie gave me insight into the history of the Great United States. However I am now rather worried to travel there incase the vampire issue arises once again, since we dont have Abe to help.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting Blend Of History with Action-Horror,"I have to confess that, based on the title alone, this movie has intrigued me for a long time. I have to confess as well that, based on the title alone, I've put off watching this movie for some time. It seemed a little bit - well - too strange. It seemed a little bit too obvious of an attempt to capitalize on the expectations about the blockbuster film ""Lincoln"" that was due to come out just a few short months after this was released. So, with all the hype about that, let's try to put something else together that can capitalize on the interest and make a few bucks. And, to be honest, I wasn't expecting very much from this.Now, truth be told, I was somewhat surprised. ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" turns out to be a reasonably enjoyable movie. It's certainly a unique way of blending horror-style actions with a sort-of quasi- history. It starts with a mysterious and even frightening atmosphere, although that fades into a more action-oriented horror story after a while. The significant events of Lincoln's life (from the death of his mother when he was a young boy to the death of his son Will when he was president) are woven into this account of a battle against vampires, who have seen slavery as an opportunity to satisfy their thirst for blood. Ultimately, the Civil War itself is seen as part of that supernatural battle, with vampires allying themselves with the Confederacy, and the Battle of Gettysburg being essentially against vampiric Confederate forces. I'm not saying at all that the history is accurate. It's just that the movie does manage to blend a historical narrative pretty well into a fantasy.Benjamin Walker was actually not too bad as Lincoln. He was earnest, and obviously took the role very seriously. In fact, while I was glad that this didn't turn out to be a comedy that went for laughs, I did think that perhaps the greatest weakness was that at times it took itself a bit too seriously. Nevertheless it was quite watchable most of the way through. The ""train"" scenes, near the end of the movie, went on a little bit too long, I thought. Yes, they were decent action scenes, but too much for me to be honest. The movie didn't end as I thought it would (which was a good thing, by the way.)Overall, while I found this to be a very watchable movie, I thought that it was a touch too over the top for my liking, and probably a little bit too long for a movie with this type of story. Interesting, though. Definitely an interesting alternative fantasy-history of Lincoln and his presidency, and what made him tick. (5/10)",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
1/ f Perfect Film,"Marton Csokas, Rufus Sewell, Benjamin Walker, Anthony Mackie, Dominic Cooper, Jimmi Simpson, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead have careers of greatness ahead.I have a good imagination, but I couldn't figure out how anyone could get me to buy into this story idea. But I was completely immersed. My heart cheered throughout the show. I was amazed to receive 105 minutes of the food of life!Light defeats darkness. What a thrill. Joseph Mawle was also powerful in his role, but the truth is Lincoln's father abused him. Reality is more complex, and Lincoln's father is the one who made Lincoln know the pain of feeling enslaved.Robin McLeavy was perfect as Lincoln's mother, who embodied goodness and light, for a great slingshot to drive the action of this film.Bekmambetov brought out superb performances. Film is extraordinary and memorable. I want to see it again and again. Plot is tight, and delivers advanced comprehension in human relationships.

The movie is CGI heavy if anyone does not mind that sort of thing,"(2012) Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter
ACTION HORRORSome of it's major influences also include ""The Matrix"" and the ""Underworld"" movies since it's CGI heavy. To enjoy this, one would have to concoct their brains since the first 30 minutes is extremely relative with Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) remembering to deal with the head vampire, the British speaking Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) at such a young age in which he takes his mother's life. Promising his dad not to do anything about, it wasn't until long after his dad died that he made a solemn promise to himself to rid the entire country of the United States of vampires- even if it means that he would have to become President to do that. Except that Lincoln isn't strong enough to take them on, until he met a vampire hunter name Henry. And upon training with him, Lincoln wasn't very good at any weapon except an axe coded with silver which was supposed to be the thing that can kill werewolves, but in this film silver can also kill vampires as well. The first 30 minutes was a kind of ludicrous, which affected the rest of the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter swings his axe and just about beheads the competition.,"Remember when one of America's most famous presidents was also slaying vampires as a hobby? No? Well now you do. When we receive a title such as Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, instantly your mind thinks the worst. The implausibilities and historical inaccuracies (despite being completely fictional) would be enough to send historians into frenzy. But actually, and I would never lie to you, it's pretty damn good fun. At a young age, Lincoln witnesses the death of his mother by the fangs of a vampire. Fraught with vengeance, he soon becomes a vampire hunter. If you've seen any vampire film ever (sure, include 'Twilight'), then you know what you are getting yourself involved with. It doesn't stray away from the typical formula, which in itself does lead to several moments of sluggish monotony and instant predictably. But there is a style. A style comprised of slow-motion axe-swinging blood-swishing action, that just makes the whole damn film entertainingly watchable. Sure, it takes itself incredibly seriously and integrates several key moments of American history with vampiric fictionalisation (particularly the battle of Gettysburg), to a point where the absence of self-awareness is missed and could've made Lincoln's life satirically hilarious. Still, I didn't hate any of it. Walker's role as Lincoln isn't exactly Daniel Day-Lewis, yet he gets the job done with an assured performance. However the main appeal is the stylistic violence that is practically the essence of the narrative. Vampires hijacking a train packed with silver where Lincoln is running atop the carriages, swinging his lumbering axe (no innuendo) in slow-motion. Pure. Disposable. Entertainment. The 3D gimmicky visual effects aren't exactly welcomed either, but it's not too much of a deterrent. The final minute was stupid though, I hate it when cheap films end on a meaningless one liner. Overall, a light, rapidly paced plot with good performances and stylistic action made for simple, mindless entertainment.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Great basic idea, boring execution","On the paper this film sounds great. One of the most iconic presidents of all time traveling across the early USA, killing vampires with an axe-shotgun and taking names. Sure it's corny and over the top, but sometimes that's exactly what we need to be entertained.On some levels, this film delivers exactly what it promises. There is a lot of fighting and many action scenes, which are usually very solid and entertaining. Especially the numerous slow-motion shots were very pleasing to look at in my opinion, though that's just my personal cup of tea, as I know that some don't like them at all. Guess I haven't gotten my fair fill of them yet. Additionally, the lore and mythos of this film manage to work on a reasonable level. The vampires aren't anything special, but they're not laughably erroneous either, like some others I could mention if I wasn't sure that you all already know which vampires I'm talking about. So the action and the vampires do work. Sure some of the action scenes are a bit too... outlandish and hard to take seriously, but I wasn't really expecting anything else, so it didn't bother me all that much. Add in some nice period costumes and a decent, though a tad forgettable score, and the film has a nice basic framework all set up.So what went wrong? Well, the movie is pretty boring for one, which is astonishing given that it's a film about Abraham Lincoln. Killing vampires. With an axe-shotgun. In slow-motion. For that concept to end up being boring is just plain wrong, but unfortunately it's the truth. The actors all do a decent job, but the characters that they play are colourless, without any characteristics aside from a few initially established quirks. One of them is a womanizer, one of them is a bit naive, one of them is evil, and that's about it. Furthermore, the story isn't all that exciting either. Yet again it's not bad, but it's just... colourless. No creativity, no original ideas, no soul. It's there to move the film from one action scene to another, nothing more.And really, in some movies the nonexistent story can be forgiven, especially if their purpose is to be nothing more than an action-packed slugfest. But usually those movies are self-conscious about the lack of story and compensate by being extremely flashy and showboating. This film however actually seems to believe that it has a worthwhile story to tell and thus tries it hardest, making it ever so worse in the process.So to whom I might recommend this film? Well, if vampire films are your thing and you've resigned yourself to the fact that the story isn't going to be anything special, then I think that there are worse ways to spend an hour or two. This movie isn't terrible by any means, and for the fans of fantasy action it's even somewhat decent. If only the story had had a bit more originality, then this might have become a great guilty pleasure for me.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as I was hoping it would be,"I read the book and enjoyed it so I had high hopes for this movie. I thought the premise was clever and fairly original and if had been handled correctly it could have been so much more than it was.Unfortunately, I found the movie to be adequate but nothing special. I thought the actors did a good job with what they had to work with but there was just something lacking. I saw this in 3D and I very quickly got tired of all the sparkly little dust motes and bits of pollen that were floating through the air in virtually every scene, not to mention the copious amounts of blood splatter. I know, I know, its a vampire flick, of course there's going to be blood splatter. But when it's used as much as it was in this movie, it loses its impact. A little would have gone a long way.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointing...,"Now, Timur Bekmambetov is well known for the effects he uses in his movies and this is no exception. There is blood and gore all over the screen as death is meted out in many and varied ways, all in glorious slow motion. The trouble is we've already seen that kind of stuff before; there's nothing new or particularly innovative here. Yes, it's very well done; the effects guys did an excellent job; but I would have liked to have seen something different. The plot; again disappointing, it just followed well documented events in Lincoln's life and added a narrative that meant he had to do this or that to thwart the vampire hordes. Not exactly groundbreaking either. The performances were all pretty good although nobody really stood out and nobody looked like they were really stretched either. Over all I found it pretty disappointing; not quite as bad as 'Jonah Hex' (2010), but heading that way.SteelMonster's verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED (Unless you're a die-hard vampire fan)My score: 4.8/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

The other Lincoln,"Having just also watched Spielbergs Lincoln, I do wonder which one is more historical accurate ... Seriously though: With a title like that, you know what to expect. An action packed not historical account of one Americas most influential presidents. And while you wouldn't expect it at the times we are living, he was Republican. A fact that doesn't really play a great role in this movie (based on a fictional novel), because it isn't political.Which makes the fact that after 2/3 of the movie, it almost turns serious kind of awkward. It feels strange when the action comes to a full stop (even though it's not for long). So while the action scenes are good, the drama is not up to the task.

I guess connecting a story about vampires to a very well know historical character helped bring needed curiosity to sell the movie, but they just didn't pull it off for me.

"Appalling concept, but strangely appealing","First, let me say that we shouldn't be wasting our time with this sort of thing. Things are bad enough without having a generation whose first thought of Abraham Lincoln will be as a kung fu fighting vampire killer. This is all bought to you by the same type of people who run Ancient Aliens night and day on what's supposed to be the History Channel. It's bad for us.That being said, if you take away the CGI super-action, they do create a pretty good representation of the pre-war and Civil War era. Benjamin Walker is actually pretty convincing as Lincoln, especially considering all the silly stuff he has to do. The rest of the top line cast is good as well. So, despite all the problems with this whole thing, I was able to find things I liked in this movie.The ongoing discussion of slavery throughout the movie is taken on decently, almost making me wish that they could inject some more real history into this subject matter.See this movie if you're interested, but don't expect more than the usual big time CGI action adventure that will most likely leave you cold when it's over.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

It is just that taking random pieces of history and rewriting them with supernatural is kind of a good idea, if done right. Not here. Lincoln vs the zombies is very...very stupid. Granted it has good special effects and some minor star power does not give it the gusto that you may expect from a one time flick. It does have some action, a little comic relief and some plot but it doesn't have anything else. It can be summed up as, boy knows vampires exist, boy learns how to fight them, he grows up, then becomes president(that is a spoiler, Abe Lincoln becomes a president) and fights some more vampires. Oh and he literally becomes the president in just one scene, it is like in five minutes its ten years later and he is running the country, civil war and all.

After he becomes president and the civil war has begun, his past starts haunting him which forces him to become what he once was, a true slayer of vampires!I was a bit skeptical about this movie, mainly due to how Chris Stuckmann (the movie reviewer that I follow the most) criticized it for being too serious. I don't like movies that are dumb because they take themselves too seriously. Like the Dark Knight trilogy (not that they are necessarily bad, they're just dumb). But once I actually got to see the movie, I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is great!The problem Mr. Stuckmann had with the movie was that he thought it was way too serious for its concept. And to that I say, this movie is supposed to be unintentionally funny (if that makes any sense). The actual movie is incredibly serious, but the concept is so silly that you can't possibly take it seriously. That's why this movie is so great!Another thing that I LOVED about this movie was the action! The action scenes are filled with epic slow-motion sequences and incredible choreography! And that one part where Abe turns his axe into a shotgun...! That was freaking unbelievable!The movie also has some great characters. I liked the friends Abe met in his past, that would help him in the civil war later. The development on them was really good.So overall, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is great, and probably one of the biggest surprises of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?","I just have to wonder what kind of thought process went on in Hollywood where anyone thought this was a good idea.Technically, it's a masterfully crafted film. The dialog is kind of sharp, the plot moves along, the special effects are seamless into the film (although the final sequence is WAAAAAAY over the top.) But the real offense of this movie is that it take probably one of history's greatest figures, and turns him into a cheap action figure. Why not ""Ghandi, Zombie Slayer"" or ""Martin Luther King: Werewolf Killer!"" Because those WOULD be offensive. Lincoln is sufficiently remote where you can do a mashup between the real man and a cheap action hero, and no one gets nearly as offended as they should.The Confederacy was evil because it held on to the notion that one person owning another was acceptable when everyone realized it wasn't. You don't need some silly nonsense about vampires in there.On a side note, the vampires themselves are cartoonish. I mean, I guess we can be glad they are portraying them as monsters after their emasculation by movies like Twilight.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie takes itself too seriously.,"What I was hoping for when I sat down and watched this was some action and some comedy. I was hoping for a movie that didn't take itself too seriously. Needless to say, this wasn't what I got. I really don't know what to say about the ""vampire"" genre anymore except that I really can't stand it. This movie is trite, overdone and completely laughable (not in a good way).Another issue with this movie is the time sequences. The movie moves too quickly with not enough character development to actually allow the viewer to get to know the characters a bit better. Lincoln is a prime example of this as he goes from tragedy to champion vampire murderer in a matter of seconds it seems. More development could have been done with Henry Sturgess' character as well. He seems to completely fade in and out of relevancy.With that out of the way, there are some good technical aspects of the film. The camera work is solid and some of the effects are neat. Rufus Sewell is good too as the villain (a role he seems to excel in). The venues in which the movie was shot made the viewer feel like they were immersed in the past.Imagine the movie ""Zombieland"" taking itself seriously.

A decent historical hack-fest.,"Man, what were they smoking? Based on the best-selling novel, this little film was brought to life by the dark vision of Tim Burton of all people and what we got was the story of the supposed secret life of our sixteenth president Abraham Lincoln. Personally, I still find the concept of old honest Abe hacking his way through some creepy-looking vampires rather ridiculous. Sure, I can take cowboys fighting dinosaurs or aliens, but at least those make a lot more sense than this film and are therefore more interesting.Anyway, is this movie bad? Well, not really because I've seen worse. Much worse. The story, as silly as it is, is pretty interesting and it ties in pretty well with significant historical moments in Lincoln's life. The vampires themselves are actually pretty scary at times and the action scenes are entertaining. The cast was surprising like Mary-Elizabeth Winstead, Dominic Cooper, Benjamin Walker, etc., performing quite well and doing a decent job conveying emotions. The rest is pretty much downhill as most of the characters are not that special, the villains are not very interesting, the plot again is pretty silly, a few things left me confused, and there are some inconsistencies and plot holes throughout the film.Overall, I wasn't genuinely impressed, then again I didn't expect much from a film like this, but at least I got some good out of this movie. Not really recommended, but if you want to throw reality out the window and have a good time, then check this out. Otherwise, skip this one before it drains the fun out of you like the blood-sucking monsters in this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Make sure you see this one in the theater.,"I'll start off by saying that this film was quite good, if you like horror films. If you don't like horror films or vampire stories, don't go see it and don't review it. It would be the same as seeing a children's movie knowing you don't like children's movies. Stick to what you know. I like vampire/horror movies. So I'm going to review it.I'm going to start by making one exception to the rest of my good review without giving too much away, of what I did NOT like about the movie: There is one scene, in the middle of the film, which was completely ridiculous. It was stupid and unnecessary and almost ruined the whole movie. It was meant to be a serious part of the film, and everybody was laughing out loud at how bad this small portion of the film was. It involves Abraham running and leaping from one fully-galloping horse to another, then a vampire throwing (literally) an 800-pound horse and hitting Lincoln with it. Not only can Lincoln act like a super hero for this one scene, but he can get up and dust himself off after being HIT WITH A HORSE like just tripped over his own feet. This was stupid and very overlooked by the director. He's not a super hero, nor a vampire, so it looked very out of place for the 'ordinary man' that he was trying to portray. It almost ruined the film. Almost. If you can overlook this one flaw, you have a good, entertaining film.With that out of the way -- The rest of the movie was great. It was well told, well acted and the special effects were fantastic. The 'Real D' 3D was awesome. They didn't throw a lot of things at you, but the depth of the picture was great. The action seemed to never stop. It was well worth the price of admission.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire HunterThe idea that Lincoln fought vampires is more credible than assertions that he cared about slaves.And while this horror movie doesn't speak to the mendacity of Lincoln, it does present other inaccuracies.Before his presidency, Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) attacks the man who killed his mother. Unbeknownst to him, that man is a vampire.Fortunately, a vampire hunter (Dominic Cooper) comes to his aid, and, over time, eventually teaches Lincoln how to slay.Maintaining his momentum towards the White House, Lincoln marries Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and has a son.Meanwhile, his hope of ending slavery threatens the vampire's food source, as well as a powerful vampire's (Rufus Sewell) desire to infect the nation.While it's an obvious work of fantasy, its somber tone and deadpan acting removes any potential of camp value.In addition to ending vampire food supplies, abolishing slavery would also impact Thomas Jefferson's love life.

Entertaining but very flawed.,"I put off watching this movie for one reason and that is the god awful title. But after reading many positive reviews on here I decided to give it a watch. First thing I will say is this movie was entertaining and if thats all I judged movies on I would have given this a much higher rating. Due to the fact I judge movies on a whole I give this pretty low and heres why.The acting is pretty atrocious. Some people will argue and say its good but it really isn't. The second thing is the constant inaccuracies such as making silver ball bearing for repeater rifles? which of course wouldn't work. Or ball bearings for revolvers....yes revolvers....Or the fact you see the vamps with a huge mouth of teeth but when they bite they only use the typical two sharp ones. Really makes no sense.This movie is about Abraham Lincoln as he is growing up and discovers there is vampires everywhere. He teams up with one to destroy the vampires and save America.This movie was OK but I wont give it another watch. The acting, the inaccuracies and the ridiculous action sequences make this movie pretty terrible. Everyone who liked this will have to explain to me why.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
the civil war was really the undead war....,"according to this movie. Before watching this film, you must forget everything you know about history, and take this as completely fictional except that their was a man named Abe Lincoln and he married Mary Todd. But what Abe does in this is not based on anything historical. First he some how has super human strength and can cut a huge tree down with one swing of an axe. Then his mom was killed by a vampire, so when older he wants to hunt them. Another vampire, Henry, helps him some, gives him tips, etc. Along the way, Abe meets Mary, he still is killing vamps, becomes a lawyer and eventually President. So skip to him in the White House and battle of Gettysburg. It seems General Davis has made a deal with vamps that are throughout the South and has vamps fighting the north. Abe comes up with a plan to collect all the silver and use it in battle. He rewrites history but the end result is still the same. And of course, the main vamp was the one that killed his mom and whom he wants revenge against.FINAL VERDICT: A crazy vampire movie that came about because of the Twilight movies. Not good enough to recommend.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better Than the Trailers,I must say that this movie was not what I expected. It delivered more than what anyone in the theater thought it would. I was surprised that some folks walked out in the middle of it. This drama with vampires was interestingly contrived between truth and fiction. The story of the vamps was creatively interwoven with the events of Lincoln's brief life. I loved the way the story stressed other important parts of his tenure as our 16th president and the inclusion of real named figures and fictitious ones made you feel as if the vampires were an unwritten part of our country's unique history. The actor playing Lincoln even resembled him and Liam Neeson. The acting was great and the story telling pulled you into a place where you felt as if his life could really have been this spectacular. The special effects were up there with other bigger advertised movies and the fight scenes reminded me of Sin City and Sherlock Holmes. I think this movie is worth watching only if you don't expect a teenager vampire romantic Gothic romp. I am guessing the ones who left expected more sex and something more in the line of recent romanticized vamp movies.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Waste of time,"Terrible. I am a fan of horror films especially ghost stories and those with creepy atmosphere. Unfortunately this one is not even close to that. Every vampire film from 70' s or before no matter how small budget it had was far better than this. This one feels more like a comedy than vampire film. It is basically a non stop action film with almost no horror elements at all. Like John Wick with an axe. No atmosphere, no story, with cliched characters and bad CGI it looks completely artificial and cartoonish. Terrible camerawork, color grading changes from scene to scene, (people are sometimes white, sometimes yellow and then green or pink), amateurish direction etc. Avoid.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fiercely entertaining ride,"When I first heard about this movie, the idea immediately intrigued me. I thought to myself: I like vampires. I like Abraham Lincoln. It's a win-win. I realize that the concept is a little too unconventional for some moviegoers, but it should be given credit at least for being original, which is rare in Hollywood nowadays. People constantly complain that all the current releases are either remakes or sequels, and when something original finally comes around they pan it and mock its concept. The vast majority of these dimwits haven't even read anything about the movie, let alone seen it, before they start jumping to conclusions. The idea of a mashup of genres is brilliant, and the filmmakers succeeded in blending historical and horror nicely.The plot revolves around a nine-year-old Abe Lincoln witnessing his mother being killed by a vampire, which leads him to seek revenge as a young man. In the process, he meets Henry Sturges, who trains him to become a vampire hunter, and Lincoln begins slaying the vampires that Henry directs him to. Many years later, after he becomes president, Lincoln picks up his silver-coated ax again, making it his mission to defeat the vampires as they side with the Confederacy.I've read that some fans of the book it's based on were disappointed in the movie because it differed so much from the book, despite the fact that the screenplay was written by the novel's author, Seth Grahame-Smith. As is the case for most film adaptations of books, some things had to be changed in order to fit the structure of a film, and to appeal to a mainstream audience. Although I haven't read the novel yet, I understand that it reads like a biography of Lincoln's life, and the vampire aspect is incorporated into that. The film would've been too long and most likely a little too dark if it had followed too closely to the novel.The main problem I had with the film was the lack of transition throughout. For example, it seemed like Lincoln was a young lad slaughtering vampires, and before I knew it, he was living in the White House with his signature beard. Very little time was spent at all showing him campaigning. Also, for about a 15-minute period nothing exciting happens during his first few years as president, so that part seemed to drag slightly. However, the action-packed third act made up for it.The film features one of the best transformations into a character I have ever seen. Benjamin Walker embodied Lincoln. Unfortunately, it seemed like the makeup crew spent so much time making Walker look like Lincoln that they forgot to age the rest of the characters convincingly. Aside from a few gray hairs, Mary Todd and Lincoln's friend Will Johnson hardly look different at all. If I didn't know any better, I would've thought that they were supposed to be vampires themselves.I saw it first in 2D, and then I went again to see it in 3D. I can count on one hand the number of films I've seen more than once in theaters, so that tells you how much I enjoyed it the first time. I must say that I wasn't too impressed with the 3D. There were a couple of moments that made me jump where the 3D added a little something to the effects, but overall it didn't really make me enjoy the movie any more. The vampires were fierce and scary enough in 2D, so the 3D wasn't really necessary. Speaking of which, it's good to know some filmmakers are still capable of creating the real, old-school vampires instead of that Twilight trash.It's a shame this movie didn't make more money than it did, considering it's cleverer and more entertaining than 90 percent of the crap Hollywood has been dishing out lately. The film knows its concept is ludicrous, and it presents itself with a serious face because it simply would not work as a comedy. The humor is subtle, as it should be. Anyone who was deeply disappointed with it was clearly expecting it to be something it's not.Bottom line: I paid to see Abraham Lincoln kick some vampire ass, and that's exactly what I got.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A modern classic fantasy/horror/adventure.,"I went in to see this knowing nothing about it, and was prepared to see another ""misfire""--the typical thing one sees nowadays--a good idea only half explored or half executed. Most films I see fall very short of what I consider good and that's what I expected here.Imagine my absolute surprise when I found that ""Abe Lincoln"" is 1. a nicely executed period film with great sets and costumes, 2. a wildly paced action special effects feast, 3. an effectively witty self-satirical historical rewrite and 4. a gruesomely graphic horror flick! This is basically a ""10"" film with a few flaws. And nowadays, that ain't bad.The humor here is quite subtle, most of the time. This film presents what is essentially a very tall tale, suggesting to the viewer that one of America's greatest Presidents was actually also a fearsome, axe-swinging, monster-slaughtering badass. The story of how all this came to be is lovingly presented as the most serious thing in the world, despite its patent ridiculousness.The Civil War-era story links the intended secession of the Southern states with the rise to power of vampires in those states; so vampirism becomes a metaphor for slavery and man's general inhumanity to himself. In the wrapup, evil is merely driven away temporarily, and continues to be stalked by the avenging hunters; what current human evil is today the ally of the vampires?In the midst of what is basically an impossible and absurd story are real human emotions and a strong backbone of morality. The result is simultaneously silly and profoundly moving.In terms of story craftsmanship, this is an impressive piece. It's an old-school ""birth of the hero"" story that recalls the tone of earlier Hollywood epics and historical biopics, but in this case, it also serves up gaggles of vicious monsters.This is a film so strange that many scratch their heads, but I think it will come to be regarded as a classic of genre cinema.Many laughs, scares, and thrilling moments. Yeah. I loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A thoroughly entertaining and inventive movie.,"Everyone just needs to calm down and respect this movie for what it is. Frankly, I don't understand what people were expecting from a movie called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. You'd think it's an entertaining guilty pleasure sorta movie. But even my fairly high expectations were surpassed. What I thought would be a fun popcorn flick was actually a high octane, original and overall epic movie. The movie has great atmosphere and an especially awesome dismal colour scheme. The cast is quite impressive, like Benjamin Walker's Lincoln, while, of course we'll never really know how well he portrayed Lincoln, he seemed interested and dedicated to this roll. The vampire designs were awesome. I loved how their jaws grew to such large size and contorted to a whole different shape, reminiscent of Venom. It's good to see something different than just pale guys with fangs and red eyes. I thought the actions sequences were also well put together and quite inventive. For example, there's a chase between Lincoln and a vampire atop a herd of stampeding wild horses. I never thought I would see that. I've only heard complaints about this movie. A big one is that Abraham doesn't even kill vampires for half the movie, when he becomes president. That's quite the exaggeration. Try the last third of the movie he's president, plus he's supposed to be in his fifties. Were you really expecting him to be slaying vampires at an age when he could retire. And if that's not enough, he does kill vampires, in the film's finale. He has a higher body count than any other action sequence in the film, too. People should just calm down. No, it doesn't have the greatest story line or Oscar winning dialogue, but it did what it came to do: entertain. Stop oogling at the third batman movie, and watch an original movie for once, instead of simply shunning it away. Stick to your franchises for all I care, because I'm satisfied with this. Final rating: 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great movie, enjoyable night at the movies","I've read the book and liked it. Certainly it is not great literature, but it is fun to read. When I've heard that they would make a movie, I was afraid that it would become a cheap flick. I was so wrong. The acting is fine, the characters worked more or less (although their motivations were sometimes lame) and the music was perfect, because I did not notice it. The special effects were fun and did not disturb the movie. The vampires were not cute, the amount of gore was perfect and the atmosphere of the historical Washington was just amazing. And there were good action scenes. Definitely one of the better movies of 2012. I like this movie and will watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best films I've seen in many years,"You will have to bring your brain to enjoy this movie. It doesn't talk down to the audience. It doesn't cheat the audience. And anyone who thinks it's anything less than a work of art didn't see the movie I saw from my perspective. I detested Dark Shadows, the last film from this producer/writer duo, but if they spewed out that to get to this, they are forgiven.Benjamin Walker is superb in this. He's as big as he needs to be to encompass the metaphor. As one might surmise, this isn't about vampires. It's not about the Civil War. It isn't even about Lincoln as much as it is about the moment in time he represents. In fact, the last few scenes clue us in that the director/writer believes the war is still going on, and I agree with them.I simply adore this film. Yes, it's violent, but it's not as bloody as it might have been. It is also pitch perfect. If they had gone one degree more in any direction, this film might have been howlingly silly, but if you're bright enough to get what the director and writer are getting at, I think you'll love it.Benjamin Walker is now one of my favorite actors, and I've only seen him in this The rest of the performances -- as well as the casting -- are first-rate, too. The only bad note is the really bad age makeup on Mary Todd Lincoln, but when a film is so good that you notice stuff like that, it's easy to forgive.I can't recommend this film highly enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Take it for what it is and it's really fun.,"It's definitely a guilty pleasure movie, but once you get comfortable with how ridiculous the concept is, it's great. The whole idea is clever, well-done, and fun and weaves events from Lincoln's life together with the vampire theme in an inventive way. I loved that it was presented very straightforwardly, with no hint of irony or winking at the audience, which I thought was refreshing and made it much more enjoyable than it would have been if they'd tried to make a joke out of it. The action sequences are, as one other reviewer put it, ""a feast for the eyes.""

"A guilty pleasure of mine that is. ""(11/10) (Special Rating)""","(Shortened summary in the bottom of the review)This movie shouldn´t work but it definitely does, with its so ridiculous plot and story, i just really really loved it. This dark fictionalized life story of how Abraham Lincoln came to be, just such a greatly written vampire movie, that gave me this gritty and gripping feeling i just couldn´t get enough of.The acting in this fun and wonderful vampire movie was also phenomenal, with especially amazing performances by the likes of Dominic Cooper (Henry Sturges), Rufus Sewell (Adam), Anthony Mackie (Will Johnson), Jimmi Simpson (Joshua Speed), Benjamin Walker (Abraham Lincoln) and let us don´t forget the wonderful Oscar deserving and such underrated actor Joseph Mawle playing President Lincoln´s dad in the first 10 minutes of the movie, a short part yes, but non the less a great performance by Mr. Mawle.I believe that the reason for this great hidden gem´s failure in success at box office and all that comes down to the fact that Benjamin Walker was too unknown of an actor to lead such a crazy idea of a movie and that is not hate towards Benjamin, because he did a great job. People where just too scared to go to the theater and watch something as crazy as President Lincoln slaying vampires, without the leading actor being someone everyone new for all his great works.All in all, (Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter) is such a great, gritty and unserious movie that really deserves a watch, i really recommend it to everybody, its also really fast paced so don´t worry, you want fall asleep.(11/10) One of the most underrated science fiction movies of our generation.Shortened Summary: this movie is a gritty, unserious and really original story about an fictionalized Abraham Lincoln that was a vampire hunter. The acting was also great with quite a few known actor names in it. A fast paced 1 hour & 30 min movie that deserves a watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly Good,"Went into this not expecting much from it but from the start was given a full on vampire action/thriller. The film could have been set over a couple of days and been a standard action film but setting it over a lifetime gave the picture much more depth by displaying youth and arrogance and then watching lincoln grow older and wiser made the film as good as it is. The supporting characters were good if lacking background. The plot was explained well with few flaws. What really surprised me was simply how it looked. It looks absolutely epic(mainly the scene where he cuts the tree down), the train scene was particularly well done showing drama and action in the same scene. Truly one of the best films of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Criminally underrated,"After just watching this for the fourth time, and again marveling at its pure entertainment factor, I checked on IMDB's rating for it. I was disappointed to say the least.This movie deserves 8 stars, but I'm giving it 9 to help boost its rating. I have found that entertaining movies that take themselves seriously have become extremely rare, so this movie deserves to be recognized.Here's why:
It is a movie, not some video of people on a movie set saying and *maybe* doing things that are just the producers' way of preening some self-righteous morality they perceive themselves as having. By that I mean this movie is a comic book come to life and its purpose is to entertain. The dark scenery, the slow-mo action, is *art*. Abraham Lincoln as the protagonist? Art. [*spoiler antagonists*]? ART! It is essentially a graphical/metaphorical representation of the struggle that Lincoln and the United States endured in the mid 1800s. The movie pulls this off by walking the fine line between being stylish and being goofy, much like The Matrix succeeded at doing.Most of all, though, this movie deserves credit for being devoid of woke politics while presenting a fantasy representation of the root cause of insane woke politics in America. Slavery was/is bad. It's awful. It's any other bad word you can think of. But *Americans* fought and sacrificed their lives to end it. They deserve credit for that. They deserve to be proud of that achievement and to NOT be forever guilted into feeling shame for things *they didn't do*. For that reason, Lincoln was perhaps the perfect choice for the protagonist.So please, watch this kick-a** movie and be entertained.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Over all a GREAT movie!!,"I have to say, when I saw this movie advertise I though to my self 'oh god! they have gone way to far, that's got to be the dumbest thing ever!' when the movie came out on DVD, my friend rented it and told me just to watch it. I watched it thinking it was going to leave me walking away shaking my head, but to my surprise it was a really OUTSTANDING movie! The story line was interesting and new, the effects were good, script was very well written (in my opinion), the actors did a fantastic job, and the actors also look the parts as well. the only thing that I can really complain about is in some of the scenes its like scenes that should have been in were cut out. That is my only complaint though, everything else in the movie was really good!

A surprisingly entertaining romp of a movie,"This movie should have been awful. Battlefield Earth awful. I mean, seriously, who has that much of a twisted imagination or has dropped enough acid to come up with a story that makes Abraham Lincoln, one of the greatest Presidents in American history, into someone who hunts vampires? I don't know, because I don't make this stuff up, but this one sounds so off the wall that I had to check it out. And I'm glad I did, because that was one of the best uses of my chronic insomnia I've had in a while. Although the movie took itself seriously, it didn't take itself so seriously as to be unintentionally funny, and while the actors had to have known they weren't making Anthony And Cleopatra, they put themselves into their characters quite well. The visuals were very good, and the action sequences were convincing, if a bit far-fetched in places. All in all, I'm glad I watched it. Sure, it's not Lawrence Of Arabia, but it was never supposed to be; instead, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is entertainment well done, and as such, it's an enjoyable watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I've watched this film a number of times, it's worth doing as the bits you missed are always a welcome addition. It's recommend it if you're ok with fantasy and, tbh, even if you're not.

A Very ORIGINAL Film!,"This movie's poster came out quite early on this year, and I was really very intrigued by it. The title and concept are really so far-out-of- this-world original, I can't wait to see how this story would unfold. After a long wait, how timely was it that a movie about a great American president(albeit an action-horror-fantasy one) would be shown right on the 4th of July where I am? Cool, huh?The film opens with Abraham Lincoln on a voice-over talking about how History prefers legends to men, then flashes back to his childhood when young Abe witnesses his mother being killed by what seemed to be a vampire. The desire to seek vengeance on the ghoulish murderer would carry him over the next years as the child grew up. After a botched attempt, he meets a vampire-killer named Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) who trains him in the killing craft using his weapon of choice, the axe.From there, this fantastic back story would then intertwine with more historically-familiar events we knew about Abe Lincoln, like his marriage to Mary Todd, his rise to the Presidency, the Emancipation Proclamation, the Civil War, the Gettysburg Address and his fateful date at the theater. This is practically everything the layman knows about Abe Lincoln. Even viewers with only a passing knowledge of American history can readily relate. You simply have to watch to see how they dovetail the fantasy parts into the history parts.I must say that this movie more than lives up to the high expectations I had of it. OK, the stylized violence may not sit well with all audiences, but for me everything just fit in so well. The writing by the book's author himself, Seth Grahame-Smith, was excellent. I really congratulate him for his awesomely radical idea. It was so crazy it just had to work!The story treatment by the director (whose name I have never heard of before), Timur Bekmambetov, had just the right touch of tongue-in-cheek humor to balance out the gore and make the whole thing work without being overly cheesy (like the ""Twilight"" films). I have never seen scenes like that fight atop the stampeding horses, or those sieges at Gettysburg, among so many other visionary scenes executions throughout the film. Those were really amazingly triumphant visual effects! They have succeeded to make a bona-fide American hero even larger-than-life and more noble than he was already known for.As far as the actors are concerned, there were no really big stars here. Only Dominic Cooper was the familiar face, and he did really well as Abe's mentor Henry. At the start I had a small problem with the lead star Benjamin Walker as I did not really believe him to be Abraham Lincoln as a young man. He simply did not seem correct as the young Abe the way he looked and acted. This situation was of course corrected when the wonders of make-up came in when he was already President. I really believe the Make-up of this movie deserves an Oscar nomination at least as it really transformed Walker into the Abraham Lincoln we all expected. This was my one minor gripe about the film although later in my overall appreciation of the movie, Walker's seeming physical disconnect as Lincoln did not really matter after all in the end.I highly recommend this movie to true vampire fans and history fans alike. As odd as that combination is, I am sure there are plenty of us out there.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome over the top action scenes directed by Bekmambetov in his usual creative style!,"'ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER': Four Stars (Out of Five)The popular 2010 mashup book by author Seth Grahame-Smith, who also wrote the 2009 zombie take on Jane Austin's classic book ('Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'), comes to the big screen! The film was directed by Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (who also directed the vampire films 'NIGHT WATCH' and 'DAY WATCH' as well as 'WANTED'), produced by Tim Burton and written by Grahame-Smith himself. It stars Dominic Cooper, Anthony Mackie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rufus Sewell, Jimmi Simpson and Benjamin Walker in the title role. The movie is a decent monster flick with some great action scenes but has almost no depth or emotion to offer. Visually it's stunning though (especially in 3D).The film tells the story of America's 16th (and arguably most popular) President having a secret life as a vampire hunter. It begins with his childhood in 1818 when he befriended an African American boy named William Johnson. Abraham defends his friend from being beaten one day and gets his father Thomas (Joseph Mawle) in trouble with the plantation owner he works for named Jack Barts (Marton Csokas), who's also a vampire. Barts takes Abraham's mother's (Robin McLeavy) life one night in retaliation and Abe becomes obsessed with revenge. One night as a young adult man (after his father passes away) he attempts to take his revenge on Barts when he meets Henry Sturgess (Cooper) who informs him of the vampire world and trains him to be a vampire hunter. Abraham later learns of a vampire plot to take over the country and uses his powers as President to stop them.The movie, like I said, has awesome over the top action scenes directed by Bekmambetov in his usual creative style. It's packed with CGI and is probably best viewed in 3D. The film is somewhat surprisingly serious (which a lot of critics have criticized it for) rather than taking a more fun and campy approach to the material. It's also said to have strayed quite a bit from the book but the author did write the screenplay himself and was greatly involved in the film's production. It's definitely his (and Bekmambetov's) vision so book fan's can't complain about someone else butchering the author's work. I found the film to be a bit slow in places and dry. I wasn't entirely impressed with the casting of Walker as Lincoln and think a better actor could have done a lot more with the role. Despite lacking much substance the film is still a lot of fun and the premise is so brilliant and entertaining that the filmmakers really couldn't go that wrong. I liked it; it's definitely not for everyone but fans of vampire movies and historical fiction might get a good kick out of it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn0mEP_zzoQ",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great, fun flick!","I've never had the pleasure of reading the book, so I went in without preconceptions.It was a fun flick, good story, great FX, and come on, it's Abe killing vampires! How can it suck??Can't believe some of the low reviews people are giving it because it's not true to the book. I wouldn't know, but for what it is, it was a ton of fun. My 8yo just loved it as well.Dinged 1 star because of an editing goof. I can see where it would make things confusing for some who didn't recognize it as such.Overall, definitely worth the price of admission.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Go see it,"I'm not a Fantasy or Horror movie goer, but the idea of Abraham Lincoln fighting vampires was too interesting a juxtaposition to resist. I am so glad I went - loved all the actors in their roles, found myself laughing at the machinations of the vampires. Steampunkers should enjoy some of the gadgets. Seriously though, the opening scene rolling back from modern Washington to the city of the 1800's set a wonderful tone for the remainder of the story. This being the sesquicentennial of the American Civil War - being able to present a history lesson in such an entertaining fashion - kudos to Seth Grahame-Smith for doing such a clever job. Absolutely good fun !!!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I laughed,"You'll read reviews that bag this movie, but don't listen to them... unless of course you've read the book first or think this is supposed to be a real life drama of what Abraham did in his younger years. And believe vampires exist. It was fast, funny at times, silly at times - even though it was played straight and they said they intended it to be played straight when I watched the making of the movie, gory - CGI gore, lots of action, lots of connections to the real Abraham and his friends and family and the civil war. I think his axe should have come from someone special though. That would have made his 'strength' with the axe slightly more believable. Maybe if the axe had come from the first vampire hunter and had the blood of a thousand vampires in the wood. So when you gripped it, it increased your adrenalin etc and made you fast and strong. Maybe the book had him training for 100 hours and that's how he got to be so skilled. Anyway, good show as long as your happy to watch it like you're watching Avengers, or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, or some other show where people glide through the air and have the skill of a marksman and the agility of a trapeze artist.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Real Vampires,"Stating the obvious, but stating here nonetheless, Slave Owners are Vampires. They suck the life out of Humans to sustain their own lives. So when this Movie decides to portray Slavery and that of its Southern supporters analogous to the Fictional parasites, it all makes perfect sense and is not a conceited prejudice.Mostly garnering lukewarm and outright indignation this CGI saturated Movie is somewhat underrated as it delivers what is promised. A blood splattering spoof that is nothing if not a bold amalgamation of Heroic American Icons and the enduring Undead. It is quite a treat for the insatiable masses that love this kind of Digital Cinema. All of it is unabashedly unrestrained and relentlessly presented in all its Ultra-Slow-Motion glory.This becomes truly amazing in the second half as things get really expanded with the Civil War, Lincoln's Presidency and two outlandishly over-the-top scenes of outrageous eye candy. The horse chase and the train chase. It all works in a see if you can top this kind of fun. The battle scenes also open up the creative carnage. This is rather unique and is about as much one could ask for when buying a ticket for this kind of thing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A movie about monsters, perhaps more real than you might think","This is an enjoyable alternate history movie which seems to me, more than anything else, to be a movie that you can walk away having learned something about fighting bloodthirsty monsters. The acting is done quite well, with Benjamin Walker playing a somber and surprisingly believable young president. I especially liked how Lincoln was portrayed as having an unstoppable work ethic and astonishingly strong convictions (both in terms of fighting vampires and more social evils such as slavery).Watching the movie, I was struck by the sheer will and tenacity displayed in Lincoln to defeat what must have seemed to him to be an inexorable force that was bent on not only claiming his own identity for the worse (changing him to a vampire) but also society at large. I also thought that there was sufficient attention brought to the fact that vampires were not all irredeemably cruel, but that they could also display nobility. In a lot of ways this parallels each of our own struggles with the darkness within ourselves, our pride and selfishness. But ultimately this movie teaches that through faith and love and an indomitable courage and camaraderie, we can overcome. Perhaps, like Lincoln, we have a battle to fight, and the outcome will determine the nature of our very soul.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
""" This nation cannot Exist, half Living and half Dead ""","Under the adroit and expert direction of Timur Bekmambetoy, the book indeed, the film, called "" Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter "" was written by Seth Grahame-Smith is shockingly and surprisingly good. Reluctant as I was to view the movie, I went nonetheless with an open mind. But being a historian, I was further skeptical of how one of the Finest Presidents this country ever had could be involved with Vampires. Still, I remained and watched with increasing fascination as the tale began amid the early frontier life of the 16th president of the U.S. It relates the saga of a centuries old Vampire who includes Lincolns' mother among his victims. Putting my prejudices aside, I sat with growing fascination as our hero is recruited to become a hunter of the undead. Through the length of the movie, I was mesmerized by the fantastic action sequences as well as the plethora of exciting scenes which involved a martial art, Axe-wielding chief executive against a plethora of blood drinking vampires. The cast is believable and includes Benjamin Walker and Lux Haney-Jardine as Abraham Lincoln with Dominic Cooper, Anthony Mackie and Elizabeth Winstead as Mary Todd Lincoln. In addition there are many special effects which combine to add credence to this modern but stylish horror story. In the end, I left the theater satisfied the film would rank above the ordinary and Worthy of the price of a ticket. All in all, though I was reluctant to see this movie, I admit, it was great and proof that you can't judge a film by it's teeth marks. I therefore recommend it to any in search of interesting entertainment. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is the second best film (after Hunger Games) I watched this year and might be included in my All Time Best Fantasy Films ;),"I suppose to give this movie eight but considering that this awesome movie is underrated despite of its appealing effects and plot mash ups, I just sacrificed the 2 points and gave it ten- which I think what it truly deserves. Anyways, I still don't get it as to why Abraham Lincoln's character was used here. Tired of Googling though, haven't also read the book yet... The effects were ultimate just enough for you to expect on every fantasy- horror film. I seldom enjoy fictional movies and this one didn't fail me of course.

The Film is better than people are scoring it.,"This is a cracking little action horror. nice take on the vampire myth, don't know why it is being knocked, great for what it is, a lot more entertaining than people are voting. Watched it with a big group of friends,we all thought it was great! Stop being so judgemental, worth a 8 for a Friday night movie. Its no Dracula but it is good fun and well made. Seeing as it is based on short book and takes a well loved historic figure,then turns him into Presidential version of van Helsing(no spoiler,if you don't get that from the title,there is not much hope for you walking and chewing gum.)I have to say,it is done well. Give it a go,worth a better score than it is being given! Anyway, where else are you going to see honest Abe, kicking arse and taking names?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining and fun,"I thought I was going to hate this movie but I was wrong. Turns out it was a fun and entertaining movie to watch. It doesn't take itself to seriously and is much better than sitting around watching a boring ""Twilight"" vampire depression fest.The story is about a boy Abraham Lincoln, who witness the murder of his mother by a vampire. A Young Lincoln, now older, plots his revenge and in a drunk failed attempt is rescued by Henry Sturges(Dominic Cooper). Henry makes a pact to teach Lincoln to kill vampires, but only those that Henry tells him to, and eventually he will get his chance to reap revenge. Lincoln(Benjamin Walker) grows older, gets married, and studies to be a lawyer, to find that Vampires are on the side of the Confederates and he vows to save humanity from their grasp.The action and acting is over the top but in a good way. The sets, editing, and script have a fun appeal and feels sort of like a comic book story which makes it not so serious but very entertaining. This movie was made to be fun, and it accomplishes that.The only thing that scares me about this movie is that our education system is so bad that I would hate to think these kids would grow up and the only thing they may know about Lincoln is that he was a Vampire Hunter. So enjoy the movie, have fun watching it, but don't let your kids think it is fact ;)...It's an 8 for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting Idea,"I think Abe Lincoln Vampire slayer was loads of fun with great special effects. I see that this movie has not been received well, but I like the metaphors and analogies of vampires and history. I enjoyed the movie and I would watch it again. Movies are for entertainment. I think this movie did what it it set out to do entertain. It may have gone beyond entertainment with the ideas of fighting for the right to exist. I like that this movie makes you ask what if?

Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"This movie is a combination of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Ex-Presidents, and every comic book hero character.

"So much fun to watch. ""Underworld"" on speed with more gore. I loved it. Very fun movie. I say A.","""History prefers legends to men. However history remembers me before I was a President, it shall only remember a fraction of the truth."" After stopping the whipping of a slave Abraham Lincoln's (Walker) father is fired from his job. Unable to pay off his debts his boss comes in the night and kills his wife. Young Lincoln sees this and begins his quest for vengeance. Ten years later he sees the man who murdered his mother and sees his chance, but it doesn't turn out like he planned. A man named Henry Sturgess (Cooper) begins to train Lincoln so he can complete his revenge. I have to say that I am a huge sucker for cheesy Sci-Fi movies. I love movies like ""Piranha"" and ""Mega-shark vs. Giant Octopus"". Something about those movies are just fun to me. I bring that up because that's what I was expecting from this movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. While it was a little over the top in some parts, this movie was more of a straight horror movie instead of going for the cheesiness I was thinking. That made the movie even better then I expected. I have never really been a big vampire movie guy but this one was great and may be my favorite vampire movie of all time. This ain't your girlfriend's vampires. This is more like ""Underworld"" on speed and more gore. Very very fun movie and you will never think of the Civil War the same way again. I highly recommend this, if you go in with an open mind and looking for blood you will love this like I did. Overall, a very fun movie that you can watch over and over. I really had fun with this one. I give it an A.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A historical-horror-action film, its meant to be silly as all get-out and that's what makes it fun.The cast performed solidly, the make-up and costuming were great and the effects were sublime. Seriously, the action scenes were worth the price of admission alone for me. The script could've done with a bit of work, but you can't win them all I suppose.If your like your movie premises silly and your action kickass, you will probably like this film.

"abraham lincoln, awesome vampire hunter","This review contains no spoilers :)i fricking loved this film from start to finish. the key is obviously not taking it too seriously. the action is reminiscent of the matrix imo completely fantasy-orientated, with a serious sub-message about slavery. I can't understand for the life of me why the overall rating is only a 6. To me, this is the best film i have seen for a while. It has a kind of feel good factor that reminded me of kick-ass.Of course it isn't supposed to be a realistic film, it's about abraham lincoln as a vampire hunter for Christ's sake! this film, for me, blew me away from start to finish. it is a fun film, end of story. it's not a historical, periodic drama, it is intended to be a fast paced, action orientated eye candy movie.i loved it. my only gripe is that i thought it could've been a bit longer. i also would love to see a sequel, even though this film basically wrapped things up in that sense.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I.E. when shooting someone, you can get away with it because there's no DNA evidence and such. The casting was good and the storyline had a couple of fresh ideas thrown in to make it better and add to the quality of the film, with twists.

Why all the hate? Never payed attention during History class?,"I actually thought this movie was an exciting backstory of President Lincoln. It is a very original concept making a president centuries ago a superhero. Important parts are also highlighted from Civil War textbooks also which is very educational for 2nd graders to see.The story is similar to that of Blade. What I do like about Lincoln though is that all he has is an axe of silver and his friend firing silver bullets. Lincoln is also not enabled with special abilities as he is ""only human"" and the vampires here can disappear. Blade was made by Marvel to be the action packed Buffy with a guy shooting guns without even looking at his targets and has super endurance and strength. Our hero is first introduced by the teacher and becomes pro after his first few battles. He then avenges his mother and goes for the real villain. Lincoln finds out about his mentor's past, gets a friend's help in his battles and is taught of isolation. What makes this interesting is that the creators of this movie made it as realistic to this time period as possible. It makes the Civil War Era more fascinating to watch.I do love the historical references. The Underground Railroad, the death of his child, and the ride to the theater at the end.The vampire cannot kill vampires thing is a bit of a joke for me since Blade is so accomplished. Then again it makes it that much more of a challenge knowing that an ordinary human must be trained diligently to defeat even one vampire with something like an axe.The fight scenes are pretty appealing for me. The constant slow-mo and twirling of an axe just makes you want to do the same.If you go on Watch32.com, you can watch the movie for free without downloading. I saw Lincoln on here since I was too lazy to pay 10 bucks for a ticket. I'm not lying. No viruses and has decent quality.

Time passes but Abraham, who's become president, is not allowed to rest as the leader of vampires prepares a devastating war in order to take over America. Together with his friends and helped by his experience, Abe must once again save the situation which is in need of a savior.It's an interesting action-horror movie which ""creates"" a different version of the history of Abraham Lincoln, posing him as a vampire hunter with a silver axe as his weapon. It features impressive slow- motion undead kills with great moves through eye-taking computer generated imagery. Its story unfortunately isn't on par with its good parts as it is linear and predictable most of the time. Its characters aren't very complex either but they are well played by their actors. It looks good and it is pretty enjoyable, if you're able to withstand the horror part. I certainly did so I ended up seeing a good film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fun and Entertaining For What It Is!,"As a fun summer popcorn movie, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is good at what it's supposed to be doing: to entertain. Despite such an outlandish concept, the movie works because it's so fun to watch. I mean who never thought about the beloved President killing supernatural creatures. I think it's a crazy, but fun idea that works for the most part. Yes, it takes itself a little too seriously, but it has great CGI, a wonderfully-crafted script, plenty of action, and the film just tells a untold, different history of the United States.Based of the entertaining book by Seth-Graeme Smith, Timur Bekmambetov's film tells us the untold story about our 16th President. After seeing his mother get killed by a vampire, Lincoln seeks the help of a Henry Sturgess to learn how to kill vampires. As President, he realizes the Confederacy has vampires and he has an agenda to defeat them.The acting is actually pretty good for the type of film it is. I didn't think Benjamin Walker could pull this role off. I'm still a little iffy, but he did better than I thought. Dominic Cooper and Rufus Sewell were good in their respective roles. Mary Elizabeth Winstead makes a really good Mary Todd Lincoln.Overall, this is a decent summer fare that is nothing but fun. Anything that has Lincoln killing vampires, I'd watch anyday. Of course, this film is not going to be historically accurate but should clarify that for people's sake. The CGI is effective and the vampires seemed rather realistic and pretty scary. There is lots of action and the final thirty minutes has some great scenes involving vampires and a train. I think the book is better but not a bad film adaptation. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Move over, Twilight! Abraham Lincoln is making vampires look cool again","Who knew that our 16th President of the United States had a secret life that nobody (including your friendly humble reviewer here) knows about? And who knew that a movie called ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" would actually be a wickedly cool action/horror movie that has a surprisingly quirky sense of humor as well as a warm heart? Whether if you knew so much about Honest Abe or if you've been dozing off during History Class, this movie might put you in your place if you're looking for something special to watch whether it's on Halloween or the night before your history exam. Directed with visual gusto by Timur Bekmambetov, the Russian genius that brought us 2008's ""Wanted"" and produced by one of my favorite filmmakers, Tim Burton, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" follows our title character, played marvelously with star appeal and charm by Benjamin Walker, before he became the president that created the Emancipation Proclamation. He's a young lad seeking revenge on the vampire that killed his mother when he was a kid. Only then, he will need some guidance from a stranger named Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper) who teaches Abe how to destroy vampires. (Don't forget, Henry is one, too.) His mission is to destroy every vampire he sees including his mother's killer, Jack Barts (Marton Csokas), its leader, Adam (Rufus Sewell) and his sexy enforcer of a sister named Vadoma (Erin Wasson). They have a part to play by creating a nation full of vampires. Whenever he's not around slaying vampires with his silver ax, Abe develops a sweet relationship with Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who will become his future First Lady, but even if he has to keep his profession secret from her, especially becoming the president we already know the history of, it's only a matter of time for him to save our nation before it would be at its end. As one of two movies of 2012 that tells the history of Honest Abe, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is one of those vampire movies that, unlike ""The Twilight Saga"", makes vampires cool again. It's not meant to be taken seriously, even though it's half a true story, it keeps a straight face by not trying to make it go over-the-top. The action sequences are spectacular and wildly original (two of my favorite ones are the chase with stampeding CGI horses and the climatic one with the train on the burning train tracks), the look of the film is fantastic, bringing a lot of grit and beauty to a action movie that has bite and the cast is just perfect, which also includes Anthony Mackie as Abe's childhood friend, Will, Jimmi Simpson as shopkeeper-turned-friend Joshua Speed and even an unbilled Alan Tudyk stops by for a few scenes as Stephen A. Douglas. Even the villains doesn't get to sneer or go over-the-top, except for one. Not to mention, the screenplay by Seth Grahame-Smith, who adapted the movie based on his fantastic best-selling novel, has a lot of wit and some funny one-liners. For example, when Henry asks what kind of weapons Abe like to use for killing vampires, he says that he's not very good with shooting irons, but he adds this: ""But I was a rail splitter."" It's a thrilling, funny, sometimes gory, and intense bloody adventure that's well worth looking at more than once. Plus, does this movie that has a vampire throwing a horse at our hero say ""no"" to you?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Exciting and fun but somewhat flawed,"Learning that a group of vampires have set themselves alongside the South during the Civil War, President Lincoln finds himself forced to use his old hunting skills to eradicate the creatures before they spread throughout the country and take it over.This here turned out to be quite an enjoyable if slightly flawed effort. The biggest flaw to get through here, despite the overlooking of history that this plays with, is the utterly atrocious CGI presented here for all the main action scenes which look so obvious that they're distracting to the overall scene. That this one has so much action as it does is where this one really gets all it's good points at once due to the overwhelming enjoyment they provide as this one has about as intense a collection of action scenes as many traditional genre movies with three stand-out, knock-out sequences that are just a pure blast to sit through. The violence is top-notch and really generates some gruesome moments, and the re-writing of history to suit it's own end is a rather fine notion and makes some sense in the context of the film, as there's not a whole lot of gaping holes to be found in the revisions which is nice, and overall this is quite a bit of fun if only for it's one flaw.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Brief Nudity.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Visually stunning, super unique, fun movie","I'm rating this high because it was super unique and the special effects/CGI were awesome. Just a fun, fast-paced visually stunning movie. So of course its also ridiculous but you know that from the title going in.We follow Abraham Lincoln from a young boy, witnessing his mother being killed by a vampire and then dedicating his life (among other things) to eradicating them. I liked how we got to see him in the different stages of his life; a beardless Abe in his twenties as he's taken under wing and taught how to kill vampires, becoming a hunter and in his fifties as president when the bloodsuckers side with the confederates, threatening to take over the country and win the war. As I said the special effects are awesome (the fight scene atop the herd of horses, the train via the burning bridge among others.) It almost takes on a Matrix-y quality in the way the fight scenes have been shot, all slow-mo flying through the air, just stunning. The acting is also good, the costumes and sets true to the period. A big surprise hit for me. 9/23/14",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Harshly judged by unworthy prigs.  Brilliantly handled.,"This movie is just short of an entertainment masterpiece in its genre. The masterful weaving of actual recorded history and vampire-laden storytelling to recount a seriously-told but thoroughly entertaining story is truly a sight to behold.The cinematography is beautiful, seamlessly letting the viewer know when scenes are set in the relative past and present, and the action beautifully shot, well choreographed and entirely relevant to the story.A rating of below 6 out of 10 is absurd. This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, with fantastic performances from the entire cast, but especially so from Abraham himself, a (to me) completely unknown actor and thoroughly deserving leading man. While I suspect he won't become a huge Hollywood star, it is not for want of acting talent.While played seriously, the film works all the better for it. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Yes!!,"Well, I had very low expectations for this film, but bought it from a $1 bin to watch with my mother because her and I both love vampire movies and/or television shows and series. So, obviously, it surprised me when it ended up being a good movie. Lots of action, creepy-looking vampires, and Abe's signature axe. I loved it. Very few dull moments, if any. But, if a strong, in-depth story line with a big twist of a plot is what you're after, steer clear of this one. Vampire- slaying Abe is not for you. This is strictly entertainment here. And it was a lot of fun to watch, and gave me quite a bit more than I was expecting from it. Go Abe!!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Vampires have bite, while Spielberg is toothless","I am now ready to pass judgment on the battle of the Lincoln films (2012). For those who may have forgotten, there were two: Steven Spielberg's Lincoln and Timur Bekmambetov's Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. One of them was very good (the Bekmambetov); the other was awful (the Spielberg). Spielberg's Lincoln was ponderous and unilluminating, a leaden soporific. It was compelling and came to life only when James Spader or Sally Field was on screen. (I gave it a C-.) Daniel Day Lewis was, in a way, too faithful in incarnating Lincoln, so much so that he seemed to be robotic (the cinematic equivalent of the animatronic Lincoln in Disneyland). I think that the film would have put Lincoln himself to sleep. (Ken Burns did this much better in his PBS series on the Civil War.) Bekmambetov's Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, on the other hand, was a surprising gem of a film. However perverse the premise may be, it was done with such panache that it was credible. (I gave it a B.) In a strange way, this film was much truer to the spirit of Lincoln than the Spielberg was. In addition, it gave one a clearer (and concise) overview of Lincoln's entire life and a fuller (but still concise) picture of the war than one finds in Spielberg's film. Caleb Deshcanel's cinematography shows that he is still at the top of his game. Furthermore, it was a damn good story that kept me glued to the screen. I do not want to give a spoiler, so I will leave it to you to guess on which side in the war the vampires fought. (My only negative comment is that there was one gratuitous expletive in the middle of the film. However, these days, one is practically none. Except for that, I would have rated the film G since I do not think that children need to be shielded from stylized violence.) If you have to choose one of the two, my recommendation is to go with the vampires.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

My kind of revisionist history.,"This film is seriously underrated. Casting: A, Acting: A, Script: B+, Period scenery and costume: A, Action: C.You go into this, that it's a fantasy film based on history, and they use history so well in the story. The message in fiction and non-fiction is the same: The same sinister forces behind slavery drove America to civil war. Those on the right and wrong side of history remain the same at it's core.My only criticism revolves around two scenes which went too far beyond the pale: The Horses Scene and the Train Scene. Though Abe was extremely skilled and agile, he could not have kept up with his super-human foes in those scenarios.That being said, the premise of this film had me laughing, the somber moments had me crying, the scary moments had me jumping, and the patriotic moments had me loving the USA.

Great fun. Lots of humor. Historically accurate (mutatis mutandi).,"What's not to like? -- not a lot. I enjoyed it very much from start to finish. It is a movie that keeps its tongue in its cheek at all times. The special effects rival those of Crouching Tiger H.D. and Titanic, while not as elegant as Avatar. Abe Lincoln was a working class president with a great sense of humor, something which the movie didn't quite capture, although the allusion is there. It is, after all, a comic book of a film, with both lots of comic book violence and some great movie mayhem. While the movie Abe is sweet and charming, the historic Abe's anecdotes and stories would keep people in thrall for hours. Ben Walker's Abe Lincoln is a bit too laid back to be very captivating. The real Abe was a vital, charming character, but not so pretty. I thought in general the movie version of Abe's life was rather flat and understated. Too kind, perhaps, to Mary Todd, who was a very difficult person. I loved how the movie linked slavery with the evils of vampires. These vampires are mean! Not like the gentle souls in the teenage vampire movies. No delicate puncture wounds here. In fact, these vampires come to be linked to slavery in several surprising ways, which I felt required a deft, light hand. Timur Bekmambetov caught that aspect just right and made the film both historically accurate as well as providing justification for movie Abe's eventual anti- slavery position. As a history buff I appreciated the research and attention to detail that went into the making of the film. The fight scenes are marvels of choreography. The cinematography is perfect. The acting was adequate, if understated. Tim Burton is a genius and his hand is evident throughout. I was expecting a B movie, but I give this movie a solid 8 stars. It is well worth watching and will delight on many levels.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A love it or hate it type of movie,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is, in my opinion, a love it or hate it kind of movie. There are many people giving this film a nine or ten star rating, while on the other side of that, there are plenty of people who have given this film a two or three star rating, and the reasoning behind that is simply because of difference in taste. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is not a bad movie by any means and I personally loved it, but I can also see why someone sitting right next to me would hate the movie. If deciding to watch this movie, keep in mind that it is produced by Tim Burton who is a very alternative movie director/producer and some of his movies get lots of attention and end up being classics (i.e Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas) and others end up getting little attention and flunking at the box office.

Contrary to what I thought when I first sat down to watch it, this movie did not focus solely on the vampire aspect, but spanned Lincoln's whole life including childhood, love, lust, vampires and politics.

"Revisionism you can sink your teeth into (Yes, I went there!).","Far too often people make up lies about America's political idols ranging from the founding fathers to President Obama. In many cases it's an attempt to undermine what we stand for, while in others it's wishful thinking. In this case it's a premise that's so fantastic and ridiculous, you can't help but enjoy it.This version of ""Honest Abe's"" story begins when Abe Lincoln was a boy living a life as a child laborer with his parents for Jack Barts, a sadistic boss who tries to kidnap and whip a black friend of his and sell him as a slave. Rejecting his dad's advice to ""look away,"" he attacks his boss, and the family is fired. That night he goes after his mother, and when he wakes up he sees her apparently dying of small pox (actually ""milk poisoning,"" but we're not looking for historic accuracy here), but he knows that Barts is responsible for his death somehow. Years later as Abe enters adulthood for the first time, he vows revenge against his family's boss for the murder of his mother and gets drunk at a bar before killing him in order to give himself the courage to do so. Much to his surprise, his old boss can't be killed because he's one of the undead, specifically a vampire. But one man saves his life and nurses him back to health, then explains tells him what Barts really is. That man is Henry Sturgess, and Abe seeks his training to defeat the monster who killed his mother.Sturgess warns him not to make any friends or seek the spotlight, something which fate has unfortunately made impossible. He also sends him to Springfield, Illinois where he takes a job as a shopkeeper run by Joshua Speed. During his time in Springfield, he slays a few vampires and meets the woman who would later become Mary Todd Lincoln, played by the obviously miscast Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Winstead is far too pretty to play Mrs. Lincoln. Hell, even Sally Field in her current state is too pretty to play Mrs. Lincoln. He also has a casual encounter with Stephen Douglas, the man he would later debate over the abolition of slavery. And once again, he is reunited with his old black childhood friend William Johnson, who is part of the underground railroad and fleeing bounty hunters who intend to sell him and the people he has been setting free.Before killing the monster who made Abe's life a living hell, he reveals that Sturgess is a vampire too. Upon this discovery, Sturgess reveals that Adam, the man who made him the vampire he is killed his fiancé, and he's as determined to kill them as Abe, but can't do it because vampires can't kill their own.As the country moves closer to Civil War, the vampires of the new world become more of a threat to the country, and to Lincoln himself. They kidnap Johnson, and Lincoln reveals his secret life to Speed so they can rescue him from the Adam's New Orleans plantation. Adam tries to make a deal with him to slay Sturgess instead, and naturally he rejects the deal as both rescued. According to this movie, Willie Lincoln died not from Typhoid, but from an attack by a vampire woman, and an associate of Adam at that. It's then that Mary discovers the truth about the her husband. Additionally, the north almost lost the Battle of Gettysburg because the Confederate Army had vampires as volunteers.I don't think I'm going to reveal too much else, because real history is already known. But the way this movie, and the book on which it is based blends the supernatural into real history makes it quite the tale, especially in the way it integrates Abe's determination to wipe out slavery with vampires. It has been pointed out on many occasions that as Lincoln, Benjamin Walker looks a lot like Liam Neeson. But as Adam, Rufus Sewell is reminiscent of William Campbell in his days in that Star Trek episode ""The Squire of Gothos."" Try thinking of that reference.",,Anonymous,Horror
