'Guardians' gives kids some holiday inspiration,"Here's a fresh look at old tradition: a tatted-up Russian St. Nick and an Australian kangaroo-looking Easter Bunny. Rise of the Guardians is based on an original children's book series by William Joyce, who produced the film along with Guillermo Del Toro. The books were inspired by the author's 6-year-old daughter when she asked him if Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny knew each other.Admittedly I was skeptical going in, but the chemistry of personalities works wonderfully. It creates an original formula that goes against certain expectations. Perhaps one improvement in potential sequels would be to focus more centrally on Santa (or ""Nicholas St. North""), but Jack Frost's story is incredibly touching and I found it clever how it parallels the antagonist's motives. The film is slow to start but picks up at a fast pace with non-stop action. By the end, the entire movie theater was in applause.Rise of the Guardians is a cute, adventurous, and heartwarming family film that focuses on hanging on to the best thing about childhood: belief.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Delivers the goods - for kids and adults alike.,"The first major family flick of the holidays, this Avengers-for-children boasts the most epic line-up of characters you're likely to see this Summer: Santa (Alec Baldwin), Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Jack Frost (Chris Pine) and the dream-making Sandman going up against fear himself, Pitch Black (Jude Law). It's a neat concept to begin with, but Dreamworks amps up the fun by contorting our preconceptions of these icons – especially the Easter Bunny, here played as an ocker warrior – and delivering the goods in humour, emotion and action. It goes a moralistic touch too far on occasion, and the story is certainly predictable, but the overwhelming sense of giddy excitement running through the movie's veins outweighs any plot contrivances or missteps that occur. A sweet start to the festive season for kids of all ages – including those in adulthood.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Endless Wonders,"Rise of the Guardians has a lovely concept about these imaginary childhood legends. It tells a fascinating new mythology about them. It sets out to be highly imaginative and thoroughly heartfelt. With these people making this film, there is no surprise that they succeeded to execute those ambitions. Though, the storytelling is a bit messy with endless action set pieces. Despite of those flaws, it's still whimsically magical and heartwarming.The story centers a childhood guardian, Jack Frost. Among the guardians, he's the least known and believed by the children. It's pretty interesting since most of us only know very little about him, we intend to intrigue about his story. When it goes to the famous legends, it gets bigger and quicker with plenty of humor. The film is also an action movie. The action scenes are amazingly done and eye candy, but they somehow get excessive causing a bit mess to the storyline. It's charming when they go to their relationship with the children, and it's appealing when it explores to their worlds.The characters are wonderful enough. The voice performances are great. Chris Pine's performance is charming enough to keep Jack Frost pretty endearing. Alec Baldwin brings plenty of joy to his character. Hugh Jackman uses his Australian accent to the Easter Bunny which really fits to the character. The rest are expectedly delightful.The visuals are undeniably astonishing. Every scene of the film is spectacular and beautiful to look at, making the experience very magical. The 3D enhances the experience more or less. The character designs are inspired. I bet many would love the Sandman's that looks so lovable. And the music score adds sweetness to the sequences.Rise of the Guardians is a little bit disappointing but also a bit satisfying. It has the heart in a right amount but only the half of the film. The rest is all action and having fun, but it's not a bad thing. They just could have moderated the craziness and get a bit of focus to the storyline. The film is still worth watching. It can be a classic if it has a better storytelling but if you don't care then that won't be a problem. Overall, it's filled with excitement and beautiful animation. Rise of the Guardians can be considered one of the great films of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An infusion of magic and warmth,"Rise of the Guardians is capable of giving both adults and their kids a wonderful time at the theatre. I am from a culture that does not ascribe to all the characters from this exceptionally beguiling animation nevertheless even I fell for its charm. That goes to say that people from all cultures, irrespective of their age group could walk into the theatre and be amazed at the awakening of their inner child. Jack Frost was my personal favourite in the cartoon and his story is one that could touch your heart. Many might even be able to identify with him and the trouble that plagues him which is resolved at the end of the story- 'to be invisible'to others. The liberty the creators of this animation took with the 'Guardians' especially the way Jack Frost was depicted,was a delight to me because I had always imagined him to be a a old man with a blue sheen to his skin and a wicked glint in his eyes. Jack Frost in the Rise of the Guardians on the other hand- well go catch it at the theatre and you will know what I am talking about. All in all, it is a heart- warming story with non-stop action, certain scenes to get you to crack up and a message that is very much familiar to most of us but still one worth being reminded of- have faith and belief!!!",,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty good--and the star is definitely the animation.,"Before I discuss what I thought of this film, my oldest daughter insists I talk about the film as seen in theaters. She LOVED the animation and when we watched it on Cinemax HD on our large HDTV, it apparently lost a lot according to her. A lot of the wonderful details were lost and the beauty of the film was lost--at least to some extent. Just thought I'd mention this.As for the film, the plot is quite strange. Among the many fictional characters (though they are real in this film), the Boogeyman is intent on filling the world with awful dreams and driving out all sense of hope or joy. To counter this, Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and the Sandman all seek out a new guardian--a strange character that will help them fight Mr. Boogey. This character is the hipster-like Jack Frost. Together they do battle to save the children of the world and keep faith in them alive.Overall, while a gorgeous film, the plot is a bit limp and is more of an excuse to show off the lovely CGI. Not a great movie but worth seeing. I especially liked Alec Baldwin as the Russian version of Santa--what an interesting accent and characterization.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Truly the most wonderful movie I have ever seen,"I am 24 year old fairly macho male,but I love animated movies. Me and my wife went and saw this movie on date night and hands down best Christmas movie of all times. It was full of wonderment,amazement and magic.I teared up at least 4 different times during the movie. It made me feel like a kid again it made me believe. I found myself gasping and laughing at the same parts as the the 3 year old little girl sitting 3 seats away was and any movie that can do that is worth seeing. best holiday movie of all times.I am the wife :) and I found the movie to be equally moving and evoked emotions about the holidays and that I hadn't felt since I was a child. This may seem like a simple children's movie, but it is so much more than that if you really allow yourself to feel the characters. :) I hope you and your family enjoy the movie as much as we did!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An imaginative and epic adventure that exceeded my expectations,"Before the end of the thanksgiving weekend I had with my cousins, I went with my brother to see this particularly in 3D, hoping that it would exceed my expectations as the trailer had promised. Later, after seeing the movie, I couldn't believe that my expectations were raised by not only how interesting it look, but how beautiful it looked. So, are there any flaws? Well, let's just say that there is one for it does drag a bit on the middle, but there isn't anything else to fault this epic adventure with.Some people may find the story of this movie predictable due to it's good vs evil concept, but for me, I don't think it was that bad. It had it's heart in the right place and has some nice messaging about using your courage and it did got me shedding some tears since it reminded me what it's like to be a child. The dialog is also witty and the script is refreshing and funny. What I also like about the story is how it focused on Jack Frost's origins and how he came to be. I would've like to see the origins on some of the other childhood icons like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Sandman, and the Tooth Fairy, but I think that Dreamworks Animation is saving those for the sequels if they ever make them. The music from Alexandre Desplat is beautiful, tear-jerking, and whimsical and it's orchestra is well done which makes it one of his best music in a feature length film.There are some other redeeming aspects of the movie. First, there's the characters which are likable in every way. Jack Frost is a charming lead, Nicholas St. North (or Santa Claus) is a bada** character with his Russian accent and has a sleigh machine, the Sandman is silent, but that's what makes him more interesting and his comedic moments is funny, the Tooth Fairy (or Toothiana) is a beautiful female character and the way she explains her ways of getting all of the children's tooth is well thought out, and Bunnymund, the easter bunny, is a great fighter and by the far the most hilarious character that most people would adore. Pitch, however, steals the show and is a great villain thanks to Jude Law's menacing voice-work. In fact, the voice acting for the character is great especially Alec Baldwin who was a great surprise being here. The fight sequences and the chase scenes are not only amazing, but exhilarating, but the strongest aspect goes to the animation.It's character animation is well inspired and creative, but what stands out the most about the animation is it's visuals. The places are amazing in scope including the North Pole, the Toothfairy's land, Pitch's evil lair, the Easter Bunny's home with the eggs being the highlight and more. Looks like Dreamworks Animation never fails to amuse me with their beautiful animation.Overall, Rise of the Guardians is by no means a classic and with all of my heart, this deserves some recommendation to those who haven't seen it yet. Go watch it! It's that good just like Disney's Wreck-It Ralph.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Nutshell Review: Rise of the Guardians,"I thought I was probably in a period of time where it would be difficult to sit back and enjoy what is an animated film aimed squarely at kids, but I was indeed surprised by how Rise of the Guardians, based upon The Guardians of Childhood series created by William Joyce, actually encapsulated all the good stuff, from quality of animation, voice casting and to characterization that was pretty basic but good fun. There are many in the same class of late that tried to be too intellectual, but by keeping things simpler, and never forgetting the fun element, Rise of the Guardians stand out from the pack, and dare I say one of the most enjoyable animated movies of the year.This is the story of a new Guardian, Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine), who's about to join the ranks of other luminaries such as Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), The Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman) and very silent Mr Sandman, all of whom thrive in today's world being the beacon of hope, and everything good, to all the little children of the world. Chosen by The Man in the Moon, the Guardians and the children form a very symbiotic relationship, that the chosen few are there to safeguard the well being of the young, while the latter fuel the powers of the Guardians through sheer belief in their existence. Lose one, and you lose the other side quite quickly.The narrative develops at breakneck pace, with introduction to the Guardians, their abilities, and the threat from arch enemy Pitch Black (Jude Law) being the boogeyman personified, thriving on fear and nightmares, and hell bent on snuffing out hope and joy amongst the children. There's a running theme of being alone, and forgotten, that pops up every now and then, being the common thread between antagonist, and the new kid on the block, who is confused as to who he is, and what his destiny lies ahead. It's somewhat of a zero to hero story, about finding one's purpose and calling in life, and the making of sacrifices to get there. Wholesome themes somewhat, for young ones to be able to sit through and enjoy.We would already be very familiar with the many main characters such as Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy, Sandman and Easter Bunny, but what Rise of the Guardians managed to do, is to introduce a little spin of fresh air into these characters, making them unique yet retaining many of their iconic traits that make them who they are. This is something I'd really liked, and had kept me engaged, eagerly waiting for yet another surprise to pop up now and then. Santa Claus complete with tattoos, swords and a thick Russian accent? The Tooth Fairy who is part hummingbird? The Easter Bunny as Australian and with something kept up the sleeve by the story tellers for the final act, and how about The Sandman who's a lot more powerful than he looks? And they offer a lot more in terms of abilities, cause and what they bring to the table, limited only by the powers of the filmmakers' imagination.It's preaching fun, and never to lose sight of having a little fun in life, and the movie walked the talk by filling itself with plenty of side gags, contributed by the many supporting acts each established Guardian came with, such as Santa's tiny elves, and Tooth Fairy's lovelorn fairies who swoon at the presence of Jack Frost, for his perfect pearly whites of course. You'll never look at Santa's lodge and elves in the same way ever again, nor will you at the Tooth Fairy's and Easter Bunny's operations. These unique perspectives, seen and told through the eyes of the protagonist Jack Frost, makes it a journey that we're emotionally vested into from the start, right until the end, and to me they did not disappoint a bit.While I hadn't watched this in 3D or IMAX versions, there are enough set action pieces that tried to exploit these formats, which I suppose either format would have enveloped the viewer and provided a more vivid experience, especially with characters being made to pursue and battle each other in the air, or the numerous extravaganza moments where the prowess of the characters will wow. The quality of animation is superb and is the score contributed by Alexandre Desplat, and again, the simple tale, its treatment and development, are refreshing in not biting off more than it can chew.Director Peter Ramsey has now launched his career with a very solid delivery of a film for children, and balanced this appeal for the adults as well. I'm already all for a sequel should one be created, but as a standalone, this one is definitely for keeps. Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Movie Destined To Become A Classic!,"This movie is magical and utterly charming. In this film DreamWorks did it all exactly right. Every voice is precisely as it should be. Perfection! Chris Pine, Jude Law, Hugh Jackman, too many to list if you didn't know that was Alec Baldwin doing the Russian accent for Santa, you would never guess it. The characters, all of them, are endearing, totally engaging. Sad moments, glad moments, hilarious moments. I haven't laughed this much in an animated movie since.well, never, actually. As I said, this one is destined to become a classic. A wonderful family movie and best of all it doesn't just appeal to the children, adults will love it too. Every adult in the audience,while I was there, seemed as captivated as the kids. And how many movies do you go to these days where, at the end, people applaud? They did for this one. And rightly so. I know I came out of that theater wishing I could somehow have my own Little Baby Tooth...and the friend I was with wished even more that she could have one of the Feisty Elves. You'll totally understand what I mean after you see this delightful movie. Don't miss this one!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

pure  joy,"splendid animation. but that is not a really surprise because technique tools solves all. but this case is very, very special. because more important than spectacular images remains its soul. and the soul is a state of joy who remains, after the end of film, fresh a long time. it is the skill of director, the merit of actors, the talent of entire team. but , in same measure, it is the merit of public expectation to discover a so rich gift, too long time expected. the best review about it is not complicated - must see it ! for the flavor of childhood, for a real watchmaker/jeweler work, for the remember authentic heroes in a period of many super heroes. and for understand than animation is a mixture between precise science and art to remind the fragile beauty, the powerful force of miracles.",,Anonymous,Animation
I would see this again in a second  I'm already making plans to take friends to it,"Sean McQuillan www.thatsmye.comDreamworks animation has not quite had the success rate of Pixar, but if Rise of the Guardians is any example of where they're heading, they're on a good path. RotG is like a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen of children's fables that band together to protect the children of the world from fear itself. Led by Santa Claus, the Guardians include the Tooth Fairy, The Easter Bunny, and the Sandman. An old evil that thrives on the fear of children is returning, and the powers that be have chosen a new guardian to rise to the occasion, Jack Frost. Can Frost rise to legendary status of his peers? Will he be able to dispel fear and bring joy to the children? It's an amazing ride through fantastic worlds to find out.The design of the characters really drew me into this one, when I first saw the trailer. Santa is an enormous, tattooed, urshanka wearing, sword wielding, commander of Yetis. Tooth Fairy is designed after a beautiful humming bird, as are her fairy minions. The villain has a sleek design with piercing eyes. I was not disappointed. This movie is beautiful. The set pieces are brilliant and epic, yet subtle. You can see the influence of Pan's Laberynth Director, Gillermo Del Torro, who was an executive producer here. The animation is great, and makes real good use of the 3D, which I fully admit I normally dislike.The voice casting is superb, Chris Pine holds his own as Jack Frost, while Alec Balwin is almost unrecognizable as North (Santa). The biggest highlight for me is Jude Law as the villain. You can hear a snippet of him in the trailer. The children in the room have young voice actors, but are all greats.The review might seem a little unbalanced, but I'm really struggling to come up with any big flaws. It is a great film for children and adults alike. Some people say it might be too scary for kids, but at its core the movie is about overcoming fear. It is an epic romp. It's not really a Christmas movie, as much as a winter movie. Go see it! Here's a trailer and character posters to hold you off until it's released.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
How to beat the Holiday nightmares with Rise of the Guardians,"William Joyce's collaboration with Dreamworks is an imaginative family film with a cluttered plot and brilliant animation. The film revolves around baddie Black Pitch's(Jude Law) attempts to bring Nightmares to children that are safely apprehended by Jack Frost (Chris Pine), Santa Claus(Alec Baldwin), the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), the Easter Bunny(Hugh Jackman) and the Sandman. Based on the book, Guardians of Childhood by Joyce (Director and Author), the movie is about hope and joy fighting fear and nightmares.

High expectations lived up to...,"As a big animation fanatic, I was very keen to see Rise of the Guardians as it did look like an very interesting film. I have to say that it was high expectations lived up to. The best animated movie of the year? Not sure, ParaNorman and Frankenweenie were a little better(can't wait for Wreck-It Ralph), but I do think it is in the better end of the movies of the overall year so far. Was there anything that could have been done better? Well, I did think the movie drags a little bit in the middle. However, there is very little to fault anywhere else. The animation was amazing, the characters were well-modelled and the colours and landscapes were really beautifully realised . Alexandre Desplat's music score has the right amount of sparkling adventure and whimsical fantasy. The writing is thoughtful and well-balanced, not coming across as too childish for adults or too confusingly sophisticated for kids. The visual puns were marvellous, Pitch's night-mares(very spooky) and Bunny's egg-plants were the highlights. The story was a winner too, some may find it predictable(the good vs. evil concept is not necessarily new territory) and dull, I didn't think so at all, some of the middle is not as securely paced as the rest but the chase action and battle were exhilarating, it was fun and it does have a refreshing holiday feel as well as a meaningful message. The characters have distinct personalities and have a definite charm to them, hard to decide who was my favourite. The voice acting was terrific, nobody was bad, Jude Law is suave and sinister and Hugh Jackman is very funny. But Alec Baldwin was a huge surprise, partly because he was totally unrecognisable. All in all, a great animated movie that completely lived up to my expectations. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
classic characters not quite a classic,"The Man in the Moon has selected Jack Frost to be the Guardian to do battle with the evil Pitch Black. Jack Frost is joined by the Toothfairy, Sandman, Easter Bunny, and Santa Claus.This is a DreamWorks Animation, and it looks good. Certainly it's not groundbreaking, and the selection of classic characters just adds to its feels of unoriginalness. It feels like a slightly different take on the same old stories. And it doesn't help that the characters seems to have powers coming out of the blue. The rules of the movie are never laid out solidly.There is a sub-story of the need for kids to believe. I think it is the bigger theme that needed to be put up front and center. The kids needed to be the lead especially the last one to believe. As it stands, the movie is a nice story.

I would defiantly recommend it to any age, it gives you a total blast to the past of being a kid by bringing together all of the childhood hopes and dreams you had before they were crushed. The animations was excellent, the storyline was so sweet, and I can not wait to hear if there is going to be a second movie or not.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just about has all the right ingredients...Almost,"Now this isn't a great CGI animated movie but it's a entertaining one that the whole family can enjoy. Except maybe the people that gets really offended by others believing in myth and holiday character. What this is, is basically a superhero movie for kids with myth and holiday characters. Such as Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman and the new recruit Jack Frost. I won't get too detailed with the plot but it seemed like the makers put quite a bit of thought into it. Although there is a bit of plot-holes than and there. So Jack Frost is the new recruit that is all about fun and games and he is asked to join the Guardians a group of myth and holiday characters that watch over and protect the children. So it's basically about a guy that thinks he can't do anything put up against a big task. Basically to stop the Boogieman from harming the children. This similar premise has been done before a lot and it goes in a pretty predictable direction. But it does try to bring out some emotions and it works alright. But the thing is this movie just doesn't leave an impact or has that flare to really make it stand out. The 3D was sorta fun and it is used quite a bit in this but I personally wasn't super immersed into the movie. The action sequences is cool and it did seem like it had the right formula but it just seemed to have missed some special ingredients. It just about had all the elements to be a great movie but it missed out by some margin. It felt like watching a cool Saturday morning cartoon except with amazing animation. Overall it's still a entertaining family movie that adults and kids can enjoy.7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rise of the Guardians — Quite an interesting take on children's beliefs,"Rise of the Guardians is an interesting take on some of the major beliefs of children, some of which are geared toward capitalist consumerism. That being said, their spin caught me a bit off-guard. I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the preview. It was a very pleasant surprise, especially for Santa Claus. He rocks! The Easter Bunny... well, he's interesting, but his world, not so much. I guess they spent more time on the northman. The others are somewhere in the middle.Now, there's a few weak moment in the movie, where the script gets too predictable and the dialogs a bit lame. If they could have applied themselves to the whole movie and each of the characters as they did on the North Pole and its denizen, we'd have had a masterpiece.I must admit though, that they did a good work on the animation style. Even though it's not highly polished, it has flair, and a certain personality, so there's some good there. It's also touching at time.Overall, it's a good movie to watch. Just don't expect a stellar story line.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Few Bright Spots in an Overall Glum, Dark Production","The Guardians here are not the owls of Ga'hoole, nor Green Lantern's Oans, but rather fairy-tale creatures from Earthly legend — Santa Claus (here called North and Russian from the sound of him), Bunny (guess which holiday, and sporting an Australian accent and golden boomerangs), Tooth (leader of, and only adult in, a veritable air corps of fairies), and Sandy (the Sandman, where they saved on casting costs by giving him no dialog) — and the thing they're supposed to guard is, I guess, the innocent sense of wonder of the world's children. Standing in opposition to this is the boogeyman Pitch Black. Since my attention wandered often during the movie, I imagined a method actor approaching the director (Peter Ramsey, in case you care) and asking ""What's my motivation here?"", because ole Pitch is out to replace all children's dreams with nightmares for no obvious reason other than that's his thing.Invited into this mix by the Man in the Moon (who seems to pull a lot of strings without ever saying a word) is Jack Frost, a young guy who walks around barefoot on frozen lakes and has been doing so for 3 centuries without any idea of who he used to be or why he got stuck with the job of frostifying stuff. He's kind of lonely, since humans can't see him and occasionally walk right thru him, but the MitM has him tabbed as the next Guardian, so the current lot can see him just fine. Tooth (voiced by Isla Fisher, who even SOUNDS adorable) even takes kind of a shine to him. Only they don't know if he's got what it takes to stand up to Pitch.Standing in as representatives of all humanity's children is a small group of playmates from some anonymous small town in the US, led by Jamie, the most credulous kid on Earth, who still believes in all the Guardians even after everyone else has given up on them as a result of Pitch's machinations. His delightful little sister Sophie made me smile every time she came on screen.There are several manufactured crises, the temporary triumph of the bad guy (ho-hum), a moment or 2 of self-revelation, and the Tinker Bell clap at the end that saves the day for sweetness and innocence. Santa's helpers (the elves literally IN their pointed hats and the big, gruff yeti) were kind of charming visual comic relief, and North and Bun were refreshingly grumpy and irritable, so credit to the screenwriters for not surrendering to convention. But the movie was both literally and figuratively dark and didn't offer much in the line of holiday merriment. Are these really the kind of folx you'd have wanted to hang out with when you were a kid? Nope. They're not such good company for adults, either.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Holiday Movie Ever!! A Must See if You Like Animated Movies!,"What can I say about this movie that explains how amazing it is? I don't think words can even describe how amazing this movie is. I am a 15 year old boy and love animated movies. I can't get enough of them. I love what Dreamworks has done in the last 4 years. They have stepped up and brought us Megamind, How to Train Your Dragon, and now Rise of the Guardians. I think they really captured each character perfectly. Jack Frost, Santa (North), Easter Bunny, Sandman, and the Tooth Fairy. This movie made me believe in these characters and made me feel like a kid again. It was dark a certain parts, but that is what is different about Dreamworks movies. They always have a sense of darkness in their new movies, that I really love. I don't really call them kids movies, I call them just animated movies. Labeling them as kids movies to me would be wrong. The story in Rise of the Guardians was fantastic and sad at times. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say be prepared to be surprised and shocked. This movie was visually stunning in 3D. If you are going to go see it, see it in 3D if you can. You will not be disappointed. The voice acting is brilliant and each actor and actress fits the role perfect. Many people thought Chris Pine's voice would not fit Jack Frost, but I think it fit perfectly. All the actors brought the characters alive and gave them a since of realize that make you believe they are even more real. Why do I give it a 10 out of 10, well because it deserves the best rating for making me believe and feel like a kid again. Not any other movie has ever done that before.

A pleasant surprise!,"As soon as I was aware of ROTG I immediately thought Avengers for children, and I know many others have said this. Well, this is kind of the case as there is of course obvious comparisons but it is best not to dwell on those comparisons, but ROTG is in my opinion a great concept, especially for children, and is tremendous fun. What proves very effective about this concept is the non-traditional depiction of these very traditional characters. Santa, called 'North' as a tattooed sword wielding Russian and The Easter Bunny as a sarcastic Australian warrior. Jack Frost himself is a very cocky upstart and the interaction between these characters proves very entertaining to watch, with plenty of jokes.The animation and the action itself looks spectacular, the winter setting proving a real spectacle that dazzles on screen. For children, I can imagine this is a great watch as there is a perfect balance of heart, action and humour. For adults too, this is a great watch as it is a poignant reminder of the feeling of believing in these characters and of the magic associated with these seasons. There are plenty of themes within the narrative that add feeling and involvement such as finding your own identity, belonging and learning to have faith in others.As much fun as ROTG is, there is still a slight feeling of unrealised potential. For me, there could have been so much more fun to be had with these characters and maybe a stronger script could have provided more laughs for children and adults alike. The story is a little too predictable, even for a kids film, and at times the moralistic messages feel a little too preachy and in your face when a viewer of any age would have already got the message, but this only rarely detracts from what is otherwise tremendous fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's a fun watch,"A very different kind of animated story. In a way, it is for children, but it feels a tad darker. Which makes it memorable.
It certainly doesn't have the Disney feel to it that would make it timeless, and the world it shows you is a bit lacking in comparison (I assume the books are filled with details and would be recommended to read them beforehand for children wanting to watch it, otherwise, it's fast paced, and is not very profound on the characters that aren't Jack). But it is still very enjoyable and cute. Has emotional bits and a nice message to wrap it all up!The most memorable, to me, is how the movement and action scenes are so fluid and well done.

Jack Frost was my first crush and I was only 12 back then, I watched it again today after many years, and I gotta say I don't blame myself. :))
Only I have lost so much believes. this movie reminds of a time I was so full of hope and thought he cold be real.
how many times I sat in the yard listening to the silence of a snowy night and looked at the snow flakes falling down when all the city was asleep..
it was so magical and I can only remember that time by watching this now.
specially that we had no snow in my country this year :(
Animations today aren't so rememberable anymore and mostly doesn't have any meaning that sticks with you as you grow up.
I'm pretty up-to-date about animations and movies and unfortunately the last animation that stayed with me like this was Turbo.
I think it's because people control kids way too much and so animations gotta be so perfectly appropriate.Just as the movies goes the opposite way.
This limits the magic these shows need.Always trying to make a good, appropriate point so kids learn that something is good and something isn't..:/ don't we have enough of those already?!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Odd, charming, and surprisingly deep.","Rise of the Guardians is odd, charming, and surprisingly deep. The themes in this film about the duality of being believed in and just general paralyzing fear resonate so deeply with me-I'm not sure if it's just because I'm a writer starting to establish myself and battle imposter syndrome, but I did really appreciate the themes this film explored. The art style and animation are gorgeous and it's really hard to believe this film is already a decade old. To some extent, I really think the biggest-the only thing-holding the film back is the sheer scope of it all. To create both a satisfying personal journey for the relatively unknowns Jack Frost and the Boogeyman and to create a satisfying ""global scale battle for earth"" to defend essentially the gods of childhood in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, Mr. Sandman, and the Tooth Fairy was a tall order no matter what. I commend the film for trying, but I think it shined brightest in the former.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Standard corporate product.,"The good:Three good interesting characters, enjoyable variations of Santa, the Eastern Bunny and the Sandman.The bad:Unbearable music. Your average formatted philharmonic Hollywood rubbish, yet way more annoying than usual; a record and ears breaker.Pathological hyperactivity. Guardians always move and fight at super-speed (a common source of annoyance in this kind of film). Meanwhile, the orchestra will never allow your eyes to suffer more than your ears.Bad animation. While movements are frantic, bodies are rigid.Dull story. Kids completely change their entire belief system in minutes. Mythic characters lose their power when kids stop believing, except for the hero, powerful yet unknown to anyone.Dull villain. You can't have a good movie with a dull villain.Mawkishness. Very corny, i.e., the usual amount.Conclusion: There is no magician behind the scene here, just a team of jobbers, including a scenarist who has good ideas once in a while.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A holiday theme avengers.,"The film examines the notion of making some well-known mythical characters into superheroes. Jack Frost (Chris Pine) serves as the viewer's entrance into this universe. Children all throughout the world are in danger from Pitch, also known as The Boogie man. The plot of the film develops quickly, and there are many instances of humor, adventure, and unexpected emotional depth. Voice actors maintain their anonymity, which is what voice actors are required to do in roles like this. The characters are rendered as leaner and meaner than what we're used to seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
kids really enjoyed it. but would we watch it again?,"I heard when this one bombed it nearly took dream works with it. It's not that bad. It's quite enjoyable. I assume it was just bad timing when it was released. It was up against the likes Brave and Wreck It Ralph that year. Which are all time classics in my house. Give it a go. My kids 6 and 9 were hooked all the way through. It's not a classic. But it's more fun than The Good Dinosaur. Even though the film features Santa, it's not specifically a Christmas movie. At times it kind of feels like you're watching cut scenes from a kids computer game. But another good solid kids film from the company. I've seen people saying it's the best film ever. That seems a bit extreme. I suppose it all depends on your taste.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Avengers for Kids!,"Rise of the Guardians is about how the myths and legends that we've heard of when we were kids all live in a parallel dimension that bring joy, dreams and protection for the children of the world. And if those children believe in these so-called guardians, these legends can interact with that world and they will get stronger. So one day, the Boogeyman, finds a way to manipulate the guardians and make them lose their powers and the children's' belief in them. That's as far as I'll care to go I guess.I've been really looking forward to this movie ever since last year. First it was called ""The Guardians of Childhood"". Then it was called just ""The Guardians"". And then it was eventually named ""Rise of the Guardians"". Anyway, the reason I was looking forward to this movie was because I liked the idea of taking these light-hearted characters we all knew and loved, and putting them in a more gritty and serious movie. Also, after watching the trailer, I started looking forward to the animation, especially. Ever since How to Train Your Dragon, DreamWorks have started to reach the level of Pixar in animation, so I was really looking forward to them making an action fantasy movie.I really enjoyed this movie, most of the time. The movie starts out really great, but then the story starts going a bit downhill. But while the story gets worse and worse as the movie progresses, the animation and the world we're introduced to keep on impressing. It's really clever how they explain why the ones that don't believe in these guardians, don't see them, and so on.I was a bit disappointed at how the action scenes weren't as long as I'd hoped for, and there was barely any scenes where all the guardians worked together in a battle. Also, the final battle was pretty pathetic. It's near the end of the movie where the movie has become so light-hearted that it doesn't do any of those awesome action scenes with spectacular effects and great character movement, and instead pulls of a typical kids movie slapstick battle with lots of kids humor and stuff. That was really disappointing.But don't get the wrong idea, this movie was very good. The animation, the characters and the landscapes were all animated beautifully.The movie also had a lot of heart to it. At some points, it felt a bit too light-hearted, and I sometimes wished it would go back to the dark and more serious tone that was found in the first act.The characters were very interesting, and the main character was well-developed. But some of the characters were a bit underdeveloped, and the kids could sometimes get on my nerves. Both in the movie, and the theater.The 3D was great. I'm not a big fan of 3D. I usually go out of a 3D movie saying ""I'll never see a 3D movie again, most likely"". Do you remember that The Avengers was in 3D? No, I don't either, but my ticket says so. But I'll most likely remember this movie's 3D, and this is also the best 3D movie of the year ... at least so far. Go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Most underrated dreamworks movie,"This movie is criminally underrated. The idea of binging these mythical characters that we all grew up hearing about/believing in together to form an avengers type team and fight against the boogeyman was pure genius. In the wrong hands, this could've very easily been cheesey or dumb, but the execution is flawless. The voice actors all did a great job and helped make these characters badass and interesting. The action was really well done. There are some legit laugh out loud funny moments. The score is amazing and combined with some incredible visuals will give you a sense of childlike wonder and enjoyment. I haven't seen it in a bit, but i love it just as much now as i did when i first saw it. It's not streaming anywhere atm, but if you haven't seen this movies, definitely seek it out. I can't recommend it enough.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
You have to be a real Scrooge to hate this movie,"""We are very busy bringing joy to children, we don't have time... ... for children.""Dreamworks animation continue to build up a decent body work, and keeping chomping at the heels of Pixar studios. This Avengers style Children's yarn. Has a decent message on the importance of belief in one's self and others.The story is Pitch aka ""The Bogeyman"" has returned to destroy hope and dreams of children the world over. The Guardian's, Santa, Easter Bunny, etc. must fight back and recruit the help of a less known legend of Jack Frost. The animation is fantastic through out, with some particular highlights involving the Sandman character. The characters are likable, well rounded, and inspire some decent comic moments.The story idea is generally quite good, but the film is lacking in that the concentration on the animation. Has led to them forgetting about making a decent villain. Pitch as he is known has a quite despicable goal. But he never truly feels like he is a legitimate threat, and at times with characters back story i actually begin to feel sorry for him at times.Only a real Scrooge McDuck will 100% hate this move.

Guardians Assemble,"To have so many (let's call them) interesting characters pushed into one movie, is quite a feat. And it is very well done indeed. Something a friend of mine kept telling me. He had seen a trailer for this movie and made me anticipate this almost as much as he did. And the movie did not disappoint! Quite the contrary, I had a lot of fun watching it and laughing throughout.I'm guessing everyone will have a favorite character, which is a great thing for an animated picture like this. A movie that not only works for kids, but also for adults. Maybe it does wake up the child in them a little bit, but that is not a bad thing now, is it? The story as it is, is not completely new (the arc of the story that is), but it does work nicely and you have a great ensemble of people with great talent.

Something that wont bore you and exciting for you and the family,"Lacking in a good story, the fun you get from seeing this flick is the fast pace action and the fun effects when light (Sandy) takes on darkness (Pitch). The movie's fast pace is filled with some fun dialogues, but the story does lack in the area of suspense, so at any time there is always a telling of how it was going to end. The voice acting is not bad also, Alec Baldwin pulled off a nice Russian accent in his role as Santa.Rise of the Guardians is a movie filled with so much excitement all arousing from a good screenplay and the action scenes are the best, the special effects used to depict both Pitch and Sandy is exceptional, and stands out all through the movie.The movie is based on a short film named The Man in the Moon a CG animated short film done in 2005 by Aimesworth Amusements a computer animation company. The short film was based on a book series called The Guardians of Childhood by William Joyce (art designer for Toy Story (1995) and A Bug's Life (1998)). The short film was the foundation and basis of this film Rise of the Guardians. Dreamworks bought the right to the film from Aimesworth in 2008 and William Joyce was on board as an executive producer.Rise of the Guardians is a 2012 3D computer animated fantasy adventure film, which was set 200 years after the books stories. The movie's plot is about the Guardians which were North or Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Bunnymund or the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), and the Sandman. The Guardians were facing an evil spirit known as Pitch (Jude Law) who wanted to take over the world by coating it with fear.The Guardians then had to join forces to take on their common enemy who wanted to wipe them off the board by making children stop believing in them, to do this he clouded their minds with fear. The Guardians then enlisted Jack Frost (Chris Pine) to help stop Pitch. Frost is 300 years old in the business of being frost and he seemed to be the only spirit that seemed to be able to match Pitch.The movie is more like an introductory story to who Jack Frost was before he became Jack Frost, and what his driving force is.There are possibilities of a sequel which could be a journey showing us the genesis of each of the other Guardians, but the making of such depends heavily on the box office performance of this one. The movie is fun to watch and is a good one to go see with your family.www.lagsreviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rise of the Guardians: A Review,"Who doesn't want to watch a movie about characters we all know and love? Santa? The Easter Bunny? The Tooth Fairy? It all sounds all very endearing... until you see this movie. Honestly, I was shocked just how boring this was. The characters should've been really interesting, and this movie should've been written way better. When action scenes make me yawn (a first!), something's not quite right. Chris Pine, Hugh Jackman, Jude Law, Alec Baldwin are all good in their own right, but when a movie is just ""off"", there's no saving it. As I mentioned, I was terrifically bored but the story and writing, so much so that great visuals and 3D couldn't save it. And I know, studio heads don't want to overwhelm audiences with a high level of graphics and a convoluted, confusing story, but this was just a pure yawnfest.What I liked: The actors (in their own right), the visuals, and the 3D was good.What I didn't like: As I repeat, the story, the dialogue, and the length. It just didn't mesh for me, and I even went in with an open heart and interest despite crummy reviews and box office opening.I suggest, search for something better for the kids, like a Pixar movie, or practically any *other* Dreamworks animated film. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"With spectacular 3D visuals, inventive takes on classic childhood figures and an delightfully enthralling story, this revisionist fantasy is a truly magical experience","Almost without fail, every holiday season brings an animated film that bears the iconic character of Santa Claus with the candy-coated Hollywood message of embracing your inner childlike sense of wonder. This year's honour belongs to DreamWorks Animation's 'Rise of the Guardians'- the first big screen adaptation of children's author William Joyce's book series 'The Guardians of Childhood' – but instead of just relying on Santa, 'Guardians' brings along with it other mythical childhood figures like Tooth Fairy, Sandman and Easter Bunny to reinforce the message.To be sure, the Santa here isn't your typical bearded old man in a red suit; instead, this Santa (voiced by Alec Baldwin) is a burly muscular Norse god-like figure with 'Naughty' tattooed on one forearm and 'Nice' on the other. For that matter, none of the other figures are depicted quite the way you would expect them to be – Bunny (voiced by Hugh Jackman) looks almost like a kangaroo with a perpetually gruff attitude; Sandman is gold, tubby and always smiley; and Fairy (voiced by Isla Fisher) resembles a hummingbird with a chirpy delightful demeanour.Even more surprising perhaps is how none of these aforementioned characters are in fact the lead; that goes to Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine), a less well-known figure in this part of the world who is most commonly associated with his ability to turn anything he touches into snow. The playwright and occasional screenwriter David Lindsay- Abaire opens the movie with Jack's voice-over, as he wakes up to consciousness staring at the moon to discover that he has magical powers. His origins prior to waking up as an immortal creature is not only key to his journey from mischief-maker to hero, but also form the crux of the movie's emotional core.Admittedly, that journey pretty much follows the standard Hollywood formula of an irresponsible miscreant discovering his destiny as a noble hero, so much so that you can predict that Jack will fall out with the rest of the Guardians before finally emerging at the end to prove his worth. Nonetheless, Jack's transformation that begins when he is chosen by the Man on the Moon to help the existing Guardians fight the scourge of fear and disbelief is still a thoroughly magical one- thanks to Abaire's deft scripting and some gorgeous visuals that look absolutely stunning in 3D.Under the helm of first-time feature filmmaker Peter Ramsey, both the former and the latter perfectly complement each other. Using Abaire's liberties with the characters as a starting point, Ramsey creates a unique fantasy world utterly impressive in its detail. Instead of elves being Santa's reliable toymakers, the Yetis are in fact the ones in his workshop, with the former decked out in pointy hats acting as mere minions not unlike those in 'Despicable Me'. Assisting the Tooth Fairy are innumerable tiny fairies modelled after hummingbirds in both size and speed; and the Easter Bunny's lair is one colourful garden guarded by giant stone eggs and filled with little eggs with legs of their own - oh and did we mention these eggs can candy colour coat themselves to become his gifts to children?But most visually striking is Sandman, both in the way he glides around with trails of golden sand behind him and in the way he conjures up whips of gold against the blackness that is Pitch (voiced by Jude Law) - the diabolical figure depicted in shades of black whose plan to overthrow the Guardians is to get the children of the world to stop believing in them. The contrast of black and gold is breath-taking (especially under the guidance of veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins who is billed here as visual consultant), and the amount of imagination and thought that has gone into each frame is simply amazing.The amalgamation of the magical and the human world must also have gotten a definitive boost from executive producer Guillermo del Toro, borne out particularly in the exhilarating action sequences. Notwithstanding the fact that each one feels like a theme park roller-coaster ride in itself, what astounds is how each never fails to be a distinctive visual spectacle in itself, brimming with its own singular details and colour palette. It is nothing short of a pure feast for the eyes, and totally worthy of the extra dollars just to enjoy the aesthetics in the third dimension.Yet the cornucopia isn't meant as a distraction from the storytelling; rather, it elicits beautifully the power of belief, of hope and of wonder that is sure to resonate with young tots, as well as the lesson of conquering one's fears for the more mature of audiences. A note of caution to parents though – there will be some imagery which may frighten the little ones, but the use of light and shadows to depict the fight between good and evil is so compelling that it will ultimately leave them ecstatic. Revisionist fairy tales rarely come as lively and inspired as this, and this one that reimagines Santa, Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, Sandman and Jack Frost as guardians of childlike hope and wonder is a definitive holiday classic.www.moviexclusive.com",,Anonymous,Animation
Jeez you guys,"Honestly, stop bashing this movie and the characters. I personally think, what they did was just breath taking. The designs of the character, the creativity.

"""Guardians"" rises just above mediocrity","It seems like the gap between Pixar and DreamWorks Animation has closed a smidge of late. I don't know if that's because Pixar's last few films ('Cars 2', 'Brave' and 'Monsters University') have been beneath their usual standards, or if it's because DreamWorks has upped their game. Perhaps it's a bit of both.'Rise Of The Guardians' isn't anywhere close to the excellence of DeramWorks best animated film, 'How To Train Your Dragon', but it's more or less on par with their more mediocre efforts like the 'Kung-Fu Panda' films and 'Monsters vs. Aliens'.

"A bit too much treacle, I'm afraid...","Yes folks, this is the future outlook of our youth... Santa Claus is a heavily tattooed muscleman and his army of Yetis, not elves, make the toys. The Easter Bunny is Australian, pretty handy with a boomerang and can create magic burrows to everywhere. The Sandman and The Tooth Fairy are similarly different to what legend tells us. But our main character Jack Frost... well, he's something else. Here we have a boyband reject who likes to create slides and snowball fights for kids... what he calls 'fun' others would describe as 'irresponsible'. There's a problem though... No-one believes in him, so no-one can see him. AND he has a tortured past that he isn't aware of himself. You just knew they'd slip some teenage angst in there somewhere.The bad guy is the Boogeyman, and I actually found myself sympathising with his plight. I mean, who wouldn't want to rebel against a elite group made up of good-two-shoes, lead by a man who lives in the moon? And give me dreams about dark stallions rather than frolicking unicorns anyday. As you can tell, there's a very fertile imagination on display here, and nearly every scene is packed full of detail making the movie a visual treat. The thing is though, at least for this jaded viewer, the proceedings were too soppy by half and all this stuff about 'the magic of children' and 'having faith in what you can't see' didn't sit right with my breakfast.

Nice animation but not the best story,"I saw this movie with my daughters and grandchildren and I really liked the animation but the story was a little silly.

Interesting if unfamiliar crossover,"I don't come from a culture where ""Sandman"" and ""Jack Frost"" are familiar concepts.

"Beautiful and fun, a wonderful family film","Rise of the Guardians grabs the same group of mythical characters we see in The Santa Clause 2 & 3 and sends them on a journey to insure that children don't stop believing in them (which is the theme of countless Santa Claus movies, including Elf, The Year Without a Santa Claus, etc.) I was all set to be annoyed that this movie was a retread of things I've seen in the past. Yet, it pulls off the same idea better than any of those films that came before. I love how they turned it into an action movie, and set up a true villain in the Bogeyman. The explanation of how the magical world worked was perfect, and made just enough sense that you could buy in without asking too many questions. Plus, they give us an intriguing mystery and an unexpected hero with Jack Frost. It's such a delightful little story that was entertaining throughout, and never left me annoyed with the fairy-tale logic.It also must be mentioned that Rise of the Guardians looks gorgeous. The animation of this movie is excellent, in particular when it comes to the dreamy imagery. Despite the fact that he never talked, The Sandman might be my favorite character in the film, because he has such delightful-looking powers, and seems to be a match for the Bogeyman in every way. I also appreciated that each of the worlds where the Guardians come from has its own unique aesthetic. So the North Pole looks nothing like the Tooth Fairy's home. The voice cast is also wonderful in Rise of the Guardians. I loved the personality that these actors give to each of the mythical characters, and they are different than the same old portrayals you might expect (particularly with Alec Baldwin's performance as Santa Claus, and Hugh Jackman as the Easter Bunny.)I'll readily admit that I've never been a big fan of what any of these characters represent in real life. **Kids, don't read any further.** I have some bad memories from the times when I realized that my parents had been intentionally lying to me, so I harbor resentment towards the mythical characters that someone invented which encouraged them to do that. However, while the harshness of reality can ruin the magical in this world, in the world of the movies anything is possible. And with that in mind, this is probably my favorite interpretation of these characters on film. I'll actually be telling others to check out Rise of the Guardians because it is so much fun, and it is one of the rare ""holiday films"" that doesn't need to be locked down to any specific holiday. You could watch this one in the middle of July and it would be just as relevant as it would be at the end of December.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Enjoyable DreamWorks Animation,"The Sandman, The Tooth Fairy, The Easter Bunny, Santa Claus and Jack Frost. All must join forces to stop the dreaded Boogie Man from taking over children's dreams and causing them endless nightmares.Now, as with a lot of DreamWorks animated movies, the animation in Rise Of The Guardians is absolutely superb and is really amazing to see, especially on Blu-Ray. Unfortunately, the movie itself isn't as good as the animation, BUT in saying that it's still a very decent, enjoyable movie for the whole family to watch. Also, while it's not your typical ""roll about the ground laughing"" kind of animation there are still some good funny moments, of which a good few involve Santa's elves.I have to say as well that the way the movie makers have portrayed each of The Guardians was pretty impressive, from the big, tattooed, imposing figure of Santa Claus and the wise-cracking Aussie Easter Bunny, to the dark, scary & mean Boogie Man. There isn't a single character in the movie that you will feel any annoyance or dislike towards (well, apart from the obvious one of The Boogie Man). Even the big Abominable Snowmen that help Santa Claus are likable and somewhat funny.Speaking of the Boogie Man, there are some scenes that may possibly scare a younger audience (ages of about 5 or 6), but in all honesty there's nothing too bad here that will give them nightmares, and they will more than likely enjoy the movie regardless of any scares they may get from watching the Boogie Man.All in all, while it's not DreamWorks best feature, Rise Of The Guardians is, as I said earlier, still a very enjoyable movie to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Arguably the best Jack Frost ever portrayed on film, but...","Perhaps my long-term interest in horror films involving Santa Claus that predicate off of the fear of the holiday season is my reason for not enjoying Rise of the Guardians as much as I believe I should've. It's a pretty movie, with lively colors, familiar characters, and beautifully created scenery, but pairing iconic figures such as the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, and, more or less, Jack Frost and the Sandman, together seemed to be a creative idea that didn't gel well on screen.This is largely due to the direction of the film, which takes the story with a grain of salt, not providing enough true imagination into the settings and the characters in general, and making its leads, especially the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus, into drab, cynical beings with very few characteristics that can be redeemed in a meaningful way.The story concerns the spirit of winter himself, Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine), who recounts his eternal life that began centuries ago after being summoned by the Man in the Moon. It then goes into the details on how Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), leader of the Guardians along with the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), and the Sandman, is at a loss to try and defeat Pitch the Bogeyman (Jude Law), and appoints Jack Frost as the new Guardian to help the four attempt to defeat the force of darkness/evil.This storyline is a little less than compelling to say the least. Often times, the film is distracted by manic chase sequences that show off the colors of the film rather than its depth and characters. Rise of the Guardians is The Avengers for the little-ones, but the film seldom treats the material as anything more than a simple timewaster. Yet the film has some wonderfully animated sequences, such as the sequence where the Guardians are swerving on the sleigh, or even when they are all paired together in a little boy's room, hoping to make it out of their alive.Certain little instances that punctuate the ninety-seven minute excursion are fun and lively, but the story as a whole is comprised of parts that don't fit so perfectly well. Kids may like it, although they may need to hit that five and up level before seeking this one out. It's mildly amusing and occasionally impressive visually, but it's unfortunate that the characters here are presented in such a gloomy, uninspired tone.

Quite Good Animation,"Above average animation quality in all respects - modeling, lighting, composition, etc. As others have mentioned may not be for the youngest of viewers as character Pitch Black & his dead horses are rather nasty/scary at times. Storyline script is intelligent for all other ages on up. This came with a second DVD in a set collectively called Ultimate Holiday Collection consisting of short tales of other DreamWorks characters such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda Po, Train Your Dragon, etc., but not as high a storyline & animation quality.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Guardians don't Rise,"Rise of the Guardians is the newest film from DreamWork's Animation.Let me get started, Rise of the Guardians has the best voice talents... Forget Brave, Madagascar 3 or even ParaNorman. The voice talents just fit perfectly with the characters.The script is so bad. The plot is too simple and eventually has nothing to do (for its 100 minute runtime), It just isn't good enough. The script seemed like it was written by a bunch of 4 years olds, it just wasn't good... At all... I only laughed about twice.The animation is eye candy. It looked superb, but, Brave had the best animation.Overall, Rise of the Guardians is strictly for kids... Adults may get bored... 2/5 stars.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Rise of the Guardians,"Amalgamating Christmas, Easter and the Tooth Fairy sounds like the  MDMA-induced wet dream of retail giants worldwide.   But before the icons in this animated-adventure can shill merchandise,  they must save their target audience.  The Man in the Man resurrects Jack Frost (Chris Pine) from a frozen  pond in order for him to help Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), the Easter  Bunny (Hugh Jackman), the Tooth Fairy and the Sandman stop the Bogeyman  (Jude Law) from convincing children that the guardians don't exist.  With the Tooth Fairy already fading, the guardians, along with a human  boy (Dakota Goyo), paint eggs in a vain attempt to keep the Easter  Bunny from evaporating from children's imagination.  While an admirable attempt at assembling a make-believe brigade, Rise  of the Guardians doesn't have the charisma, character design or  storyline to make a significant impact.   Furthermore, in reality, the guardians would be entirely comprised of  doting parents.   Yellow Light",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best animated movies of my generation,"I hit the jackpot growing up and getting to see some amazing animated movies in the theater: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Shrek 4, How to Train Your Dragon, Frozen, this... what an epic run of movies, and so many others too. I will never forget seeing the opening scene of this movie in the theater... absolutely enchanting.This was one of my favorites growing up and I just rewatched it today with my dad and yep, still holds out. I teared up at the end. Everything about this movie creates a sense of child-like wonder: the animation, the themes, the plot, the voices... it's all a magical mix of nostalgia and genuine good story-telling!Jack is SUCH a good main character. We follow him as he tries to learn who he was and why people can't see him. He longs for connection and finds it at the end, learning about who he was and what his purpose is. It was a beautiful journey for his character, and was a rewarding arc for him (and the audience) to go on.The movie is dark and sad at times, and I applaud a kid's movie for getting this creative!! Everything from the designs of the characters and their houses and what they all do, the lore of the world (based on the books too), the conversations and moral dilemmas between characters... it's all so creative and cool that I would LOVE a TV show or sequel that expands on the world!!Over all, AMAZING movie. Pulls at your heart and makes you feel like a kid again, whether you saw it as a kid like I did or not. It still holds up, still has a powerful story and message, and still makes me tear up to this day.Beautiful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Christmas cheer tied with a corporate ribbon.,"It comes around like clockwork every year, and 2012 is no exception. As the holiday season draws nearer, so too does the avalanche of Christmas films for the kiddies.Leading the charge this year is Rise of the Guardians, a film that ambitiously teams up Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), the Sandman and Jack Frost (Chris Pine) in their fight to banish the Boogeyman (Jude Law) from the nightmares of children the world over.The A-list voice acting is commendable. The entire cast clearly has fun hamming up their performance, none more so than Baldwin as a re-imagined, tough-as-nails Saint Nick. The film is visually breathtaking, making superb use of 3D and deftly showcasing just how immersive the medium can be when applied properly.Plot-wise, it's certainly all been seen before. The concept of a reluctant hero has been done to death, particularly in this genre, but Frost is infused with a stubborn cynicism that at least gives his character a touch more depth than expected. The film tailors itself for all ages with an inherently non-threatening baddie, with just the right amount of villainy to ensure the target audience will antagonise him, but not lose any sleep over himquite literally.With Rise Of The Guardians, DreamWorks has again stumbled in its punch-for-punch battle with rival Pixar, delivering a film devoid of the alluring enchantment of its primetime opponent, but one that furthers the company's niche of providing a forgettable but passable piece of family entertainment.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

Delightful Viewing for the Holidays,"Rise of the Guardians is a delightful film for the whole family, telling the story of how Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and the Sandman protect children and they thrive on children's beliefs. But when an old threat awakens the group needs to find a new guardian to help them, Jack Frost (Chris Pine).Rise of the Guardians is a wonderfully animated film from first time director Peter Ramsey perfectly mixes the comedy, drama and action. The animation is fast and fluid they is great detail all of the scenes. They are great little designs such as the Christmas Elves and the Tooth Fairies.The comedy is strong, being very physical and visual whiles also have some little jokes and character moments. It is a film that provides plenty moments that will bring a smile to people's faces. It is all weighted with the drama and the darkness of the villain, Pitch (Jude Law). Screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire clearly follows the Hero With Thousand Faces template as a reluctant hero having a destiny thrust upon him and has to prove himself as well find out about his past whiles Pitch reflect of what Jack Frost could become.The film assembles a great voice cast with Pine being perfectly cast as the cocky, fearless Jack Frost whiles playing the character. Combined with the visuals it is easy to feel for Jack's plight as he longs to be seen by the world. Law gave a sinister performance as the voice, also playing it straight and Alec Baldwin was having fun being a Russian accented Santa.Alexandre Desplat supplies another excellent music, giving the film both an epic score for scale of the action and giving the seasonal sound when needed.Rise of the Guardians will certainly make Christmas viewing, working as a fantasy drama and a comedy and it is easy for the young and the young at heart can enjoy.I saw the 3D Blu-ray version and the 3D effort were very score.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Stunning animation, entertaining situations","The first thing I have to say is that the animation is stunning. When watching movies on TV, I often let my eyes wander, checking facebook for a minute, getting up to do some exercises while I watch, but I didn't do that for Rise of the Guardian, because every second of film was worth watching. Imagery is very densely packed and things happen very quickly.I also found the movie quite funny in that same quick, overstuffed way.And yet, there is something about the movie's story that kind of bothers me. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but then I read a review of it that described it as seeming like it was written by committee, and I thought, yeah, that could be it. There is something calculated and safe about the story that made me unable to entirely connect with it. But it was still a fantastic experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fantastic characters, so-and-so storytelling","I adore these stories where all myths are true at the same time, inhabiting the same world and mythos. In this particular instance, all your childhood stories are real, from Santa Claus to Tooth Fairy, from Easter Bunny to our protagonist, Jack Frost. Unfortunately, the darker sides of our childhood stories are also real.I also like that they didn't make these characters be in any way generic. Santa is still very recognizably Santa, but he has a Russian accent, swings around swords and has the words Naughty and Nice tattooed on his forearms. I mean, kudos for originality. The same applies to all the characters, with the possible exception of Jack Frost, but he is the audience surrogate in any case so it makes sense not to make him too exotic.The animation is also fluid, looks suitably festive, keeping with the theme of holidays, and has a great sense of movement and energy. It has aged perhaps a little bit since then, but not by much and the overall design is such that it can withstand time.What keeps the film from being a truly great holiday classic is the fact that the story is a jumbled mess. The beginning and the introduction to the idea is done well enough, but then the film cannot keep it together. We have no idea who the villain is, no idea what he is doing to reduce the power of the eponymous Guardians, what it even means when he captures one of the good guys, and so on. Things happen on the screen, but they have no reason or rhythm behind them. Perhaps the original novel, The Guardians of Childhood by William Joyce, explains it better, but if it does, the movie totally fails in conveying that to its viewers.Still, it's an enjoyable movie. Aggravatingly vague in its world-building, but enjoyable nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Chock Full Of Messages And A Few Cutesy Moments,"I get the message from this, or, maybe I should say the messages. There's more than one. There's the power of belief and the importance of believing. Then there's the heartache of being the one who blends in and never gets noticed. Little children can make a big difference. I get all that, and they're fine messages. And yet, with all those fine messages packed in, I thought this was at best a very average movie; not one that captivated me.It uses a variety of legendary beings (including Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and the Sand Man) and turn them into super-hero sorts, whose role as ""Guardians"" is to protect little children. But the source of their power is the belief of the children, and if the children stop believing, then the Guardians are helpless. Into the mix at the beginning of the movie comes Jack Frost. We don't know where he comes from. He just rises out of a frozen pond as the movie starts; a boy without a past called - to something. He finds his purpose (and his past) when the Boogey Man shows up to wreak havoc and to destroy the belief of the world's children, and we end up with a titanic battle between Jack Frost and the Boogey Man to climax the movie, with the other Guardians and the world's children playing supporting roles in the battle.It was OK. In addition to the good messages there were the requisite ""cutesy"" moments - most revolving around Santa's somewhat gnome-like elves, but also around the Easter Bunny when he's reduced to a mere baby. Jack's past (when it's finally revealed) is also rather sad and at the same time, strangely, happy. This didn't really captivate me, and it won't qualify as a classic to me.

Decent but not amazing animated film,"""Rise of the Guardians"" seems to have underperformed at the box-office, particularly when judged against the majority of Dreamworks animated films. While I'm not a regular follower of Dreamworks animated films (at least compared to how I am with Disney and Pixar), I did catch this one. Something regarding ""Rise of the Guardians"" that stuck with me was that it did come across as a bit childish and saccharine at times, especially in the scenes involving Jack Frost and others interacting with a group of child characters. However, the animation and art direction is fabulous, richly detailed and haunting. I also liked the imaginative renderings of the stock legendary characters, even if the difficult relationship between Jack Frost and the Easter Bunny seemed to scream of cliché. Though hardly the best animated film of the year, it's still worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is THE best animated movie of all!!!!,"Words cannot describe how good this movie is. And if you can watch this in a really dark room on a really big screen in 3D it will DOUBLE your 'Wow' factor!! I saw it in the theater & I couldn't help myself from reaching my hand up trying to pick snow flakes out of the air & stars out of the sky! I'm telling you the 3D in this is TOP NOTCH & will blow your mind!! It is magical. Just magical. I felt like a little kid watching my first Disney movie. My sense of wonder & imagination were stimulated. The picture, colors, & 3D are outstanding. The story revolves around all the Guardians of children: Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, Sandman, & Jack Frost. They are fine as long as children believe in them. The message is positive. There's no loud bad guys, screams, scary growls, or harsh violence. The bad guy in this is a character called Pitch who is a child's nightmare but he's not too scary for little kids. He wants to get rid the world of the Guardians. Nightmares can destroy hope which destroys the Guardians. Children who keep the faith & keep believing in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, etc., etc., keep the Guardians alive. It's an awesome movie with an ending that makes you feel good inside. Especially good for kids but adults will love it too. I highly recommend this!!! If you can, try to watch it one time in a dark room on a big screen in 3D.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not the Avengers, but it'll do.","Good watch, might watch again, can recommend.As someone who's not particularly a big fan of these holiday characters, it was refreshing to see these battle-ready versions of them.Incorporating Jack Frost as a character actually makes a lot of sense, as literally pointed out in the movie that he's an underrated holiday figure.Adding to the holiday-verse with backstories and belief as power with multiple forms is also an interesting touch.The cg animation is very well done, and the writing is actually very intricate. The antagonist does a very classic job of slowly breaking down the hero squad and its done extremely well.The key is in the details, and this one has enough to give it a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dreamworks are off the 'Naughty' list.,"Sadly overlooked during the Christmas period of 2012, 'Rise Of The Guardians' is a sorely underrated of example of Dreamworks operating outside their comfort zone of toilet humour and pop culture references.Jack Frost is seemingly brought to life beneath a sheet of ice in the black of night, with no purpose or sense of direction, and invisible to the inhabitants of the world he finds himself wandering. After many years of wreaking playful havoc on Earth with his ability to manipulate snow and ice, Jack is summoned to join the ranks of the 'Guardians', an elite group of child minders including the tooth fairy, the Easter bunny, and even Santa Clause. Much to everyone's surprise, it is presumed that Frost is to play a vital role in defending the children of the world from the growing threat of the Boogeyman, a malevolent entity who aims to infest civilisation with nothing but nightmares.'Rise of the Guardians' is not a festive film, but its use of the Santa Claus legend and the focus on wintry weather leave it gravitating towards a holiday atmosphere. Visually splendid in a creative sense, not just in the quality of the animation, the film is one that Dreamworks can proudly place by the side of their most important works. Its themes of hope and dreams are universal, regardless of the time of year, and this achievement is especially more profound when you appreciate how the writers wove in the messages of the Easter and Christmas holidays without preaching the corresponding religious values. It isn't very often Dreamworks give characters a genuine arc to explore, but Jack's is not only such a journey, but also a very touching, humble one.Despite the fairly short running time, their is a minor lack of development for some characters, whose importance is therefore realised too late. Simply, however, the film is a pure delight, and 'Rise Of The Guardians' certainly deserves to be lauded. It isn't groundbreaking in any sense, but it is proof that Dreamworks might have finally found their centre.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I thought this was a prequel,"Because I didn't see a single preview I thought this movie was a prequel to ""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"" which was a very good movie. I guess that's better than me thinking that it was a prequel to ""Guardians of the Galaxy.""""Rise of the Guardians"" is about fictitious/religious entities that Christians believe in. The guardians were Santa (Alec Baldwin), the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), and for your non-religious characters there was the Sandman, the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), and Jack Frost (Chris Pine). They had to guard against children not believing in them which was a plot hatched by Pitch aka the Boogeyman (Jude Law).The movie was exciting with some good action even if I thought the characters were absurd. They all took their orders from The Man in the Moon who, I'm assuming, was supposed to be like God. If you're watching this movie purely for the action, or if you happen to be a big believer in Santa et al., then this is an excellent movie. If animated action doesn't excite you and/or the idea of Santa doesn't stir you, then this may not be the movie for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Visual Extravaganza!,"I am terrified by the animation here & I must say that DreamWorks are surpassing those Pixar & Aardman guys like anything in the effects. Rise Of The Guardians is a visual treat with only its conclusion part going a tad amiss.The magical story of the guardians is absolute, while the voices given by celebrities is par excellence of which I loved Easter Bunny's Hugh Jackman! The wits, Santa;s jokes, Sandman's sheen & everything makes this movie look even more appealing. Not being a kid anymore, I still loved this than Brave or ParaNorman.

As for adults, this is entertaining enough because of the zany brightness and visuals, the action-packed story, and the short running time.Peter Ramsey directed a film that brings together Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, Sandman, and Jack Frost as they join forces as Guardians to protect the innocence and dreams of children that the evil Pitch, known as Boogeyman is trying to take away.This film has a solid voice-cast which adds personality to each character. Chris Pine makes a solid, adventurous Jack Frost. Jude Law is really good as the villainous Pitch. Isla Fisher makes for a good Tooth Fairy and Alec Baldwin surprisingly, is a solid Santa.Overall, Rise of the Guardians is a rather fun, action-packed adventure for kids and adults alike.

DreamWorks Steps Outside Its Comfort Zone,"Carrying on the recent ensemble novelty in films, one that saw classic action stars team up for The Expendables and its sequel and superheroes assemble for the mega-smash The Avengers, DreamWorks' Rise of the Guardians tosses together a slew of childhood memories drenched in mythos and lore and twists them into a gang off ass-kicking protectors of children – uhh, I mean butt-kicking, sorry kids.Creativity is certainly abound in this animated effort and even though it doesn't always delve deeply enough into this fantasy world to be a classic worthy of wide-eyed worship, the strong voice work, punchy animation and that aforementioned creative spark combine into a intelligent diversion.Going one step further than simply amassing notable beings of legend, director Peter Ramsey and writer David Lindsay-Abaire (based on the William Joyce book) transform our preconceived notions of the characters that inhabit this tale. Santa Claus is a sword-wielding Russian known as North, the Easter Bunny is laden with boomerangs and heralds from ""The Land Down Under"" and the Sandman stands as a very real entity known as Hush. Also, a member of the guardians is ""Tooth"" (of the fairy variety) and the newcomer to the troupe is the film's hero: the bratty but fun- loving Jack Frost.Chosen for duty by The Man in the Moon, each guardian is picked not only to carry on his or her presumed duties (deliver presents, hide eggs, etc), but also have a role in preserving a certain facet of childhood. North, for instance, has a role ""at his core"" (as the man in red puts it) to keep wonder alive in the eyes of children. With Jack Frost called to arms against the sinister Pitch (as in ""Pitch Black,"" as in The Boogeyman), who is regaining his strength following a fall from power after the dark ages ended, he must stop the evil from spreading and find what his true role is in life.Of these legendary individuals, the most fascinating is actually Tooth, a member upon first glance who seems a bit out of place when talking about a clique of war-ready mythological beings. Plus, you know, touching a bunch of teeth for a living is kind of gross. You see Tooth's role has had far more wide-reaching repercussions for the youth of the world: each tooth she collects represents a memory – a pure thought or moment that can be used later in that individual's life when they need an epiphany, grounding, humbling or, perhaps a smile — most.Both hero and antagonist are also gifted with more background than you'll see in your average film (of any medium) and both are actually quite tragic in their own right, though for decidedly different reasons. The circumstances that first made Jack into the harbinger of winter is deeply sad but later compels him to become the guardian he needs to be, and for Pitch his centuries of pseudo exile for doing only what his core drives him to do. Pitch is the type of villain where it is easy to understand his motivations, even if you thoroughly disagree with them.Rise of the Guardians is certainly one of the least funny DreamWorks products in recent memory, perhaps of all time. When Pitch isn't infiltrating the dreams of kids with insidious-looking spirits, characters are being killed and intense action sequences are put on display. This is certainly not a film for young, young children.This slant of maturity as it turns out is the film's biggest fault, in that its reliance on action to drive home the immensity of the threat and the continued strife in general takes us out of this fascinating universe. In the end, it offers only a little bit more than a skin-deep peak into the world of the guardians.However, Rise of the Guardians is a film destined to age wonderfully, especially for those who first experience it at the proper age. Adults should find this offering more to their taste over most in the genre and the tidbits of humor and the gorgeous rendering of it all will stand only as a bonus.On a final (and refreshing note), though there is absolutely sequel potential now that this team has been assembled, Rise of the Guardians is a solely isolated tale with a clear-cut beginning and end, thankfully sidestepping the curse of the (always blatant and embarrassing) open ending. Whether or not the guardians will return, DreamWorks has in a way stepped outside its comfort zone and delivered a fun and cultured Holiday-themed animated fable.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I was thoroughly bored,"This film is about a young man, who can turn anything into ice, being recruited into a team of guardians to protect the world from evil.In recent years, animations have elements to entertain adults even though they are aimed at children. However, ""Rise of the Guardians"" does not have any elements to entertain adults. I found the plot very boring and childish. The main characters don't look nice or cuddly, in fact the Santa Claus and the Easte bunny look unwelcoming!

A potential brilliant diamond that was wasted,"I have registered myself only cause I felt that I wanted to write this review for a movie that could be amongst one of the best of its kind, but it was so pity that it failed, for very specific reasons.The backbone of the story was excellent, especially for the kids and Jack Frost was also, plus it had nice effects. But the goods stop there.Problems: 1. The bad guy captures large part of the movie and for small kids he is frightening, more than I would tolerate for a kid. I know that he was supposed to be, but...he could be less darker and capture smaller proportion of the film.2. The design of at least two of the guardians, personally to me, was bad, could not think worst. Santa Claus was very ""Russian"" and did not appear even close to kids stereotype. So was also the tooth fairy, i this case the result was totally bad. For Sandman and Easter Bunny I cannot say, as I had not expectations.3. There was a sad part in the story, that I did not find the best thing the kids to see and think of during X-mas.4. The movie here was like abandoned by the distributor or whoever is in charge of this. There was none multiplex chain playing it, one could see it only small peripheral independent cinemas.As another reviewer said, this had so large potential, it could be some kind of avengers for kids and even better, the core idea was a brilliant diamond, however was wasted (I don't know the reason).",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best animated movies of the year for sure,"First we had classic monsters together (HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA); later video game characters (WRECK-IT RALPH); and finally this, with classic folklore characters that the kids believe in. 2012 was like the year for doing a crossover in animation (hell, not only in animation since we had THE AVENGERS too!) and RISE OF THE GUARDIANS is definitely the best one, therefore one of the very best animated pictures of the year; alongside FRANKENWEENIE, BRAVE and PARANORMAN.Part of the success, I think, comes directly from having really good characters. The key character of the story is Jack Frost (voice of Chris Pine) – we learn everything about him and his background (why he became Jack Frost) is so great you just want to learn everything about the rest of the characters. All of them, as you already know, are traditional characters that most people, especially in Europe and the United States, know since their childhood; we have Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, Sandman, the Easter Bunny and the already mentioned Jack Frost (as well as the bogeyman).The film deals with the thing of being a kid that still believes in those characters. Who can't relate to that? Yes, I'm from Mexico and as a kid didn't give a damn for Santa but I did for the equivalent (los Reyes Magos) – the believing thing is universal and is really well used here and definitely brings freshness to the same old story of ""evil threatening the world and heroes saving it"". It's a soulful fantasy for kids that will get 'em in the most emotive mood for Christmas.*Watched it on 01 December, 2012",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
I'm not sure why it failed at the box office.,"Rise of the Guardians is surprisingly entertaining -- and most of that is due to an interesting villain. Jude Law as Pitch Black is calm, collected evil, and it's fun to see how much he savors that role. This movie also has a clever take on traditional folklore and the animation is unique and engaging. I'm not sure why it failed at the box office.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Amazing!,"I took both of my kids to see this, my 17 year old son and 14 year old daughter. We all agreed it was one of the top five animated movies we'd ever seen. My son didn't even want to see it, but as we were leaving the theater he said ""we've got to buy this when it comes out!"" Definitely worth seeing in 3D. We've been pretty disappointed with the 3D offerings in the past few years, most of them just weren't worth it, but this one far surpasses any other. The animation was beautiful and the 3D made it seem like you were in the movie with the snow falling all around you. The characters were so interesting,and very different from what we've grown to expect from Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Sandman and Jack Frost. We're thinking about going back tomorrow to see it again. Don't miss this one!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Original and exciting, this is a Fine, Festive Flick!","Dreamworks' 'Rise of the Guardians' is the animation to watch this festive season as the special occasion stereotypes gather together in a bid to tackle dark forces that threaten humanity.When villainous being Pitch (voiced by Jude Law) originated a dangerous attack on Earth and its children, guardians North (Santa, voiced by Alec Baldwin), Tooth (Tooth fairy, voiced by Isla Fisher), Bunny (Easter Bunny, voiced by Hugh Jackman) and the Sandman (no voice). However, they are told by the moon they are unable to defeat Pitch alone - he is too powerful. They are forced to join forces with the mysterious Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine), a being who is known for his mischievousness and for the fact that he cannot be seen by an ordinary human being - unlike the others. As Jack attempts to discover the truth about his past, Pitch looks to gain the upper hand in his villainous scheme of poisoning children's minds with nightmares.The visuals are stunning and certainly on a par with almost any polished off modern day animation; it makes it a thoroughly entertaining and smooth viewing with Jack Frost scenes particularly impressive.Other positives include Alec Baldwin's Santa with a Russian accent and Hugh Jackman's general accent to portray an Aussie Bunny.The negatives are perhaps that it doesn't quite have the emotional punch of a film in the genre such as 'Toy Story 3' for instance.Also, its humour isn't as frequent as you may perceive beforehand. Though funny, it could be a little more humorous although this may detract from the ambiance of the film which isn't too serious nor too ridiculous.As I've stated in my summary - despite its flaws and ease to overlook - 'Rise of the Guardians' is a fine, festive flick!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Film!!,"This film was truly enjoyable. Peter Ramsey who is known mostly for his story boarding work did a fantastic job with this film. I think that of all the guardians, the one that I really understood first as a child was the Sandman. In Germany when the sandman came on television, it was time to go to bed. There was no discussion to be had. You simply got up, kissed your parents good night and went to bed. How much simpler life would be for parents of young children if the sandman was still around. The story pretty much centers around Pitch Black or the Boogie Man (Jude Law) wanting to take over the minds of little children and making them forget about all the good images in their lives. North or Santa Clause (Alec Baldwin) is the apparent leader of the guardians and must assemble the group in order to fight Pitch. I am not sure why North has a Russian accent, but I think it worked well. Jack Frost (Chris Pine) is a carefree spirit who is all about having fun and playing in the snow and ice. He is reluctantly recruited by the Man in the Moon as the newest addition to the guardian clan. Jack and Bunny (Hugh Jackman) seem to have a tumultuous relationship which adds the charm of this film. Bunny turns out to be from Australia and welds a mean set of boomerangs. Tooth (Isla Fisher) is endearing and is all about dental hygiene. I particularly liked her helpers; especially baby tooth. The additional elements in the film such as the Yetis (only way I can think to describe them) who are responsible for making the toys and the elves who are responsible for seemingly nothing, adds additional comic relief to the film. I think that one of the things that I liked most about this film is that it kind of explains how all the characters make it around the globe in such a short amount of time. I also like the fact that you got to see where all the characters live (not just Santa). I think that kids (and adults) will enjoy this film and definitely leave the theater with a smile on their face. I am not sure if the 3D is really necessary, but for the extra thrills, go ahead an upgrade. I give this film a celebratory green light.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

'Rise of the Guardians' Brings More Great 3-D to Theaters,"Two of our KIDS FIRST! Film Critics reviewed it. See below: Morgan Bertsch - Video review: http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=o28lnEuBM6QI have seen a lot of movies, and this movie had the most amazing graphics and best 3-D I have ever seen. I felt like I was in the same room as the scenes. The snowflakes come right at you and make you feel like it is really snowing on you. The Man in the Moon needs the help of The Guardians to defeat the evil Pitch. The Guardians are amazing. The animators and writers did a stupendous job of creating believable characters.The Guardians consist of Santa, who is from Russia. He is jolly and lives in an amazing castle. He has the cutest elves with jingle bells on their heads. They are very funny and helpful. The Easter Bunny is tough. He's from Australia and has a boomerang. His adorable eggs actually have legs and can run around.The Tooth fairy is very different. She is a bird. She has pink wings and blue and green feathers. Her baby birds that help her are the sweetest little creatures. The Sandman is the one who makes all your dreams come true while you are sleeping. The graphics for his amazing talents were fabulous.Jack Frost was one of my favorites. Everything he touches turn into frost. The animation of the frost covering everything was absolutely beautiful.Pitch wants the world to be dark and sad and to lose all hope. The children keep the world safe by having hope. Santa has a magic globe, which is bright with lights as long as the children believe, but once they stop believing their light goes out.The intricate design of the scenery was the best I have ever seen. Everything, from the smallest detail to the large wandering dinosaurs, is breathtaking.This movie is humorous, adorable and magical. My favorite scenes are when the Easter Bunny goes on a sleigh ride with Santa Clause and also when the baby eggs are running around. The sandman's magic makes your heart glow. The message is to stop and find out what makes you special. You have to find out what it is that you do best and find your center so you know how to make yourself and others happy.I love this movie. It mixes up holidays, so you can watch it year around and get into the mood for the seasons.I recommend this for ages 6 and up. Pitch is frightening. The over-sized Santa might be too much for the little ones because — I am not joking — he looks like you are right next to him.I give this movie five *****out of five twinkling stars.Review by Cheyenne Nguyen - Video review: http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=-PS_XegUGC0This is a magical movie with all the favorite childhood guardians comes together to protect the children. This is another great movie from DreamWorks. Santa Clause (Alec Baldwin), Easter Bunny (Hugh Jack man), Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Sandman and Jack Frost (Chris Pine) are chosen by the man in the moon to guard the children. They make sure that all children have wonderful dreams and faith. The more the children believe in the guardians the more power they have.However, the Boogie man (Jude Law) rise to take over the sweet dreams and create nightmares. Children are beginning to lose faith in the guardians. Without faith or believes, the guardians will disappear and the lights will turn off and the earth will be filled with darkness. This is when the guardians join forces to fight the Boogie man.However, Jack Frost did not join forces to fight. He just wanted to have fun and not worry about anything.There are so many funny lines in this movie. My favorite part of the movie is when the Tooth Fairy looks at the collection of teeth; she knows which one flosses and who it belongs to.The part I did not like is the Boogie man seems so real and I don't want to see him when I sleep.The 3D special effects in this movie are so clear it is unbelievable. When Jack Frost is flying it feels like you flying with him and actually feels the cold air. The rivers of colors are so bright and clear. However, the music is so and so, not very exciting.The lesson in this movie is finding your passion and you will know your purpose in life. The customs are so awesome. Especially the Fairies and Santa and his elves. The message in this movie is joining forces can be more powerful than being by yourself.My favorite character is Jack Frost. He's very fun to be around. I rank this movie 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 3 and up.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Everything but interesting,"This movie is very boring, when I recently rewatched this again, I fell asleep 25 minutes in, the characters are fine, it's original, the villians ok I guess, it's so average, but I have it a good score just because it's original. I don't recommend this movie, even though it was decent.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great animation with well crafted deeper messages,"I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie.Going into it I had fears of it being one of the many hollow and rushed animated movies that often go to theaters.On the contrary, Rise of the Guardians, was clearly a beloved work that the creators put time and thought into. They appeared to truly care that they were creating a nice piece of art, and through that attention to detail, they did!The writing and story is great; the dialogue also surprisingly complex. They do a good job at weaving in quality messages for younger audiences across a variety of themes from things more practical like self-worth, to more fantastical and fun things for kids like belief(in Santa etc). It's very tastefully done and they even add some original amendments to some common North American childhood story traditions that my girlfriend and I loved.The animation looks pretty disappointing at the start of the movie(but this was 2012 to be fair), but it clearly becomes of better and more notable quality as the film goes on, with the exception of a scene or two that appeared to return to this lower budget animation(perhaps last minute additions to the film that they didn't have time to polish). There are many fantastically animated sequences that are very eye catching and pleasing to watch owing to the well choreographed movements on screen and attention to visual detail. The individual characters are well designed and bring their own unique visual and functional aspects to the movie.The voice acting fits in par with the rest of the film. Very glad they pulled together a great cast to do justice to the other fine qualities of this movie.My biggest complaint is probably that some of the smaller plot arcs that take place building up to the main climax, are a bit lack luster and less exciting to me in their nature, but they still managed to create fairly entertaining portions of the movies out of them nonetheless.I would recommend this movie to adults looking to watch a wholesome animation, and would highly recommend it for any younger viewers or families in general.This movie is a very strong 7. I'd give it a 7.5/10 if I could.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Though this wasn't my first choice to watch, I highly enjoyed Rise of the Guardians","Though I'm an animation fan, I wasn't all intent on seeing this movie until a few weeks into December but my movie theatre-working friend had some time off after 5 today and wanted to see something soon after that since he wanted to be home in time for tonight's Saints game against the Atlanta Falcons (I left his house after half time when New Orleans was beaten 17-7). Anyway, I loved this take on the holiday characters with Santa (or North as he's referred here) is depicted as Russian and the Easter Bunny is Austrailian with an attitude (he's the only one I recognized by voice as Hugh Jackman was so familiar to me). And the way the Jack Frost character was initially reluctant before eventually agreeing to join was well handled. Nice mixture of laughs, scariness, and sentiment throughout and me and my friend both highly enjoyed it. So on that note, yes, that's a recommendation of Rise of the Guardians. P.S. It's now a few hours later and I just found out the final score was 23-13, Atlanta.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pure family entertainment,"I was hooked from the moment I saw the trailers with crisp and colourful images, Santa with a Slavic accent and an Easter Bunny voiced by Hugh Jackman. That's a recipe for success and the movie doesn't disappoint. It's very solid film from Dreamworks Animation, losing just slightly to Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon.What I liked the most are the characters. Santa is easily my favourite with his booming voice, his accent, his tattoos and he's workshop full of yetis. But the rest are equally as entertaining, each with their own quirks and personalities. Though personality-wise the character of Sandman is something of a disappointment, mostly because he has no dialogue, and the film fails to convey him through his expressions and little sand images. He has his moments, but he gets lost in the background while the rest of the character talk with each other.The other slight disappointment was the villain, Pitch (Jude Law), who was just so smarmy and clichéd with his drawling speeches and megalomaniac posing. At least he avoids the worst pit fall by having a motivation for his actions against the Guardians. Granted, the motivation isn't the most exciting ever, but it works in a pinch. Still, the character just isn't unique enough to fully satisfy the viewers. Especially when the Guardians, with the exception of Sandman, are such unique versions of their fairytale origins. Santa has tattoos, Easter Bunny is a badass warrior, Tooth Fairy is a hummingbird... while the villain is just a dark man in a cape. You can see the problem here, right?The protagonist, Jack Frost (Chris Pine), isn't quite on par with the rest of the Guardians as far as uniqueness goes, but he is given a lot more backstory, and he's the audience surrogate in any case. While I do think that some of that backstory was slightly clichéd and overly sentimental, I can't deny that it doesn't do its job. Jack is a good character and you sympathize with his problems and can thus understand when he falters and struggles. Plus he's just plain fun to watch.On the technical side of things, this film looks amazing. The textures are amazingly detailed, the backgrounds look awesome, the locations are entertaining to observe and study, the character designs fit the characters' personalities and are equally intriguing. Everything moves with smooth grace, which makes the film very easy to follow and enjoy.As a whole this is a great film from Dreamworks. It isn't their greatest movie to date, but it's up there with the best. It's a good family adventure, while being mature and wise enough to appeal to adults just as well. Entertainment in its greatest form.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Guardians didn't rise or fall, just stay flat in a cool way","Over a year ago Dreamworks make the announcement for this movie. When I saw the cast and the character that they were playing I got very excited about this. Imagine my disappointment when this movie didn't full my expectations.The animation is great. All characters look really cool, especially Bunnybund, Sandman and Jack Frost hear. But I can't understand why ever since 3D gets into the theaters all 3D movies are darker than usual. If you are going to make a movie that take action during night time, why are you making it in 3D when 3D gets better with bright not dark. I will never understand why the hell filmmakers do something like that, buy they do.What really happens with this movie is that even when all characters are cool including Pitch played by Jude Law, the story isn't deep enough. Almost every Pixar movies are powerful dramas on the roots, brought to us in a way that kids will like. Like ""Toy Story"", ""Wall-e"" and ""Up"". Even ""How to Train Your Dragon"", that is also from Dreamworks, work based on a intensive drama (a father that don't accept his own son as he is). But Jack Frost on this move don't have a strong issue. He can't understand WHY he is on this planet or why do people can't see him. But all the answers to that question is something like MEH, we already know it. Even worse, the reason why he is on Earth as a ""ghost"" is something he already does. A protagonist needs to change during the movie. All that Jack do is realize that he was doing it right. It's just dump.Other thing that I hated is the score. I can't understand why Alexandre Desplat has been nominated to 4 Oscar. He might be a good musician, but he doesn't deliver emotion to the scenes. Action scenes need cool fast music that make the audience feel inspired. A sad emotional scene needs a melody that takes the tears out of your eyes just by listening to it. More important, every movie (especially the kids ones), need a theme song. Everybody know the theme song of Toy Story, the 60's melody of Monsters Inc. or the beautiful/Oscar nominated score created for How to Train Your Dragon. What is the theme song of Rise of the Guardians? It doesn't have one, because Desplat fails every time on doing this.If you watch this movie you won't get bored. Kids will love it. I bet is better than Twilight now playing on theaters. But go without expecting something deep and powerful that will make you believe in fairy tales again, because you will go out disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A must see instant classic.,"This great family film can and will be enjoyed by kids and adults. I see it going down as an instant classic. It entertains with a great plot, excellent writing, laughs, and action. It even pulls at the heart strings and is touching at all the right moments. Rush to the theaters to take your children. My 4 year old actually sat still for an entire movie. My 6 year old loved it and was already quoting some cool lines from the movie. My wife and I said, ""We definitely have to buy this one."". The animation was incredible and the creativity of the scenes in which the movie takes place are A +. From the North Pole, to the Tooth Fairies realm, and Bunnies Easter lair. The characters that everyone already knows, are well portrayed in the fabulous story that intertwines these characters together to battle the Boogie man. I am not one to run on about what the movie is about, so I say you just go down to the cinemas and find out what I'm rambling on about. As you can see this a 10 star film in my book and I will enjoy it for many years to come and you will too.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Casey's Movie Mania: RISE OF THE GUARDIANS (2012),"Familiar fairytale mythologies gets a hippie makeover in RISE OF THE GUARDIANS, a holiday-themed animated feature that brilliantly incorporated superhero genre into the fairytale elements (think THE AVENGERS for the kiddies). No doubt it's a killer concept to see such beloved fairytale characters of Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, Jack Frost and Sandman combined together into one movie. The result is imaginative and visually dazzling fairytale adventure that dares to be different.Based on a book ""The Guardians of Childhood"" by William Joyce, the story reimagines a world where fairytale characters such as Santa Claus, named North (voice of Alec Baldwin), Easter Bunny, named Bunnymund (Hugh Jackman), Tooth Fairy, named Tooth (Isla Fisher), and the silent Sandman, named Sandy -- are all exist as the Guardians to protect the children everywhere from darkness and despair. When North is busy preparing all the gifts for the Christmas season in his workshop at the North Pole, something evil is about to happen -- a resident boogeyman named Pitch (Jude Law) is threatened to bring darkness to the world and determined to make all the children lost their beliefs on these Guardians. North quickly assembles his fellow Guardians to help defeat Pitch.However, the Man in the Moon (which functions as a lunar prophecy of sorts) has suddenly reveals that a new Guardian has been chosen to join them in a battle. To their surprise, the new Guardian turns out to be a mischief maker named Jack Frost (Chris Pine), a lonely spirit who possesses a powerful staff capable to freeze everything he touches. Unlike the rest of the Guardians, Jack Frost isn't a popular fairytale figure among the children and because nobody believe in him, he is viewed as an invisible person. Fortunately, those Guardians able to see him. At first, Jack doesn't think himself as a savior. But throughout the course of getting to know the fellow Guardians better, he slowly embraces his newfound destiny and eventually agrees to help them stop Pitch's devious plan once and for all.As a veteran storyboard artist who used to work with some of Hollywood's top-tier filmmakers including Francis Ford Coppola, Barry Sonnenfeld, David Fincher and Steven Spielberg, first-time director Peter Ramsey sure knows how to captivate his viewers with spectacular visual. Aided by acclaimed cinematographer Roger Deakins (who worked as a visual consultant here) and mesmerizing art direction by Max Boas, RISE OF THE GUARDIANS is undeniably a visual feast. The movie is also exceptionally fast-paced, while the action sequences are amazingly fluid and well-staged with all the swooping camera angles (the early scene involving a hair-raising sleigh ride zigzag along the road filled with vehicular traffic is among the prime example here).No doubt the visual have enough ""wow"" factor to capture the viewer's interest. But deep down, the movie falls short in term of its storyline. Adapted by acclaimed playwright and screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire (RABBIT HOLE), the story is perfunctory at best while the movie is surprisingly lack of genuine emotion. At times, it's easy to blame that the movie concerns more about showy entertainment akin to a theme-park attraction than anything else matters. Then there's the unconventional character designs, which are strangely off-putting and might take some time to get used of them.But despite all those unappealing character designs, the movie is lucky enough to bless with strong vocal performances. Chris Pine gives an enthusiastic turn as a rebellious Jack Frost, while Alec Baldwin, whose intimidating Russian accent and playful attitude, is engaging as North. Hugh Jackman delivers a whole lot of attitude and fun to his Aussie-accented Easter Bunny and Isla Fisher is wonderful as the Tooth Fairy. But the standout here goes to Jude Law, whose silky-sinister British accent, gives his Pitch character a memorably menacing villain.www.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Not Dreamworks best, but fun nonetheless","¨It is our job to protect the children of the world. For as long as they believe in us, we will guard them with our lives.¨ Rise of the Guardians is the latest animated film brought to us by Dreamworks (the studio that created Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon) and directed by Peter Ramsey. This is Ramsey's first film as a director as he is mostly known for his work as a storyboard artist for films like Fight Club, Men in Black, and Independence Day. Rise of the Guardians is probably not up to par with other Dreamworks projects, but it still manages to be a very entertaining animated film, and one kids will enjoy. The art direction is perhaps the best part of the movie, as the story and characters lack better development. There are a lot of action scenes that the children will enjoy, and plenty of funny moments as well. Rise of the Guardians is a fun movie, it just doesn't reach the same level How to Train Your Dragon or Kung Fu Panda did. The animated film was adapted by David Lindsay-Abaire from William Joyce's book. Children will really love this film because it has well known characters and the movie sort of has a Avengers look to it as these heroes assemble together to protect the Earth from a dangerous villain- Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine) is the main character of the story is a mischievous kid who can turn anything into ice with his stick. The only problem is that no one seems to know he exists. The kids all seem to love North (Alec Baldwin) aka as Santa, Tooth (Isla Fisher) aka the Tooth Fairy, Bunny (Hugh Jackman) aka the Easter Bunny, and Sandman, but they don't know of the existence of Jack Frost. These four guardians protect the children and ensure that their light always shine with amazement and dreams. Jack Frost on the other hand is always fooling around and doesn't seem to have any responsibility whatsoever, but his life will change when the evil Pitch (Jude Law) begins to threaten the children and scare them off with nightmares. The four guardians discover that they will need the help of Jack Frost in order to protect the kids from this evil nemesis. The dreams and happiness of the children around the world are at stake.Rise of the Guardians is a pretty inventive film, using these beloved characters from our childhood and turning them into superheroes that not only bring joy to the children in the holidays, but also protect and guard them from the darkness. I had a fun time with this movie, but I don't think I would want to watch it again. I probably wouldn't enjoy a sequel either, but nonetheless I had a good time with this animated feature. Kids will probably enjoy this more than adults.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable,"Enjoyable. I think most kids would like that premise, and so do I. The characters are cool, and their shenanigans are fun. However, the tooth fairy could have a better design than just a hummingbird costume, but that's more of a personal opinion.

"Outstanding Animation, Great Story, Fun & Awesome Jack Frost","I don't know about everyone else but I immediately was drawn into this movie with the cool but still fun main protagonist ""Jack Frost"". In the past I always viewed him as a very old, frozen, mean blue man that existed to ruin Christmas and burden Santa Claus. When I heard Tale of a movie with ""Jack Frost"" that was an awesome teenage kid styled with shaggy white hair, an awesome sweater, and staff I wanted to watch it immediately. I was not let down at all in fact the movie delivered more than just a good message, plot and characters. It also delivered a little action and made each ""guardian"" (Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, Sandman and Jack Frost) a little ""cooler.""If you have ""FEARS"" about whether or not this movie will be good for you and your family than don't because the boogie-man will ... err... I mean the movie is good, I highly recommend it. If you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about. Very appropriate for children, has a little twist of darkness for adults and a mischievous protagonist named ""Jack Frost"" for the teenagers.

Amazing!,"I wasn't expecting much out of this movie,but wow!just wow. I read somewhere that it's like a kid version of Avengers,and it truly is. The CGI is unbelievable,the director too, visually this movie is stunning, sandman, the tooth fairy,everything is so beautifully done. The story is also really good, with more character depth than I really expected. The personality of each character is very unique and very original, I fell in love with all of them, even with sandman,who doesn't speak at all. The plot itself is really simple, bad guy who tries to ruin everything and is stopped by the good guys, but it really works that way. I don't think you can get bored at any point during this movie, it has a great pace and,again, great visuals.

Tired characters run around,"Had ""The Santa Clause 3"" not recently employed Jack Frost as the antagonist, ""Guardians"" might feel quite as tired as it does. Unfortunately, Martin Short's uncomfortably creepy (seriously little girl, don't go into the snow globe room alone with him!) but admittedly memorable turn does make it tough for this film to feature him not as the heavy. Instead Jack must battle what looks like the minority version of Rene Auberjonious' character in ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" who is trying to make a comeback in a word where kids really are frightened of anything anymore (as noted in ""Monsters, Inc.). Jack's costars aren't much help in building a sense of relatedness. Alec Baldwin sticks a thick Russian accent on Santa Clause. Not to offend our Euroasian, formerly Soviet, brethren but Russia isn't exactly known for being giving and certainly not for being jolly. Hugh Jackman lays the Australian accent on the Easter Bunny equally as thick and between that and his animated twitchiness one wonders how any kid ever sat on his lap. To round out the team, there is a Tooth Fairy drawn in that nebulous region explored by ""30 Rock"" between being too realistic and too unrealistic so that the effect just comes out hard to look at. There's also the Sandman who speaks in icons and has putting people to sleep as his one easily replicated (see ""The Whitney Show"") superpower. All of the shopworn characters spend the moving running around in quick cut Technicolor trying to restore the dreams of children or some such other plot cribbed from Rankin Bass. In short, wait for Christmas and then watch ""The Year without Santa Clause"" instead (the Cold Miser could kick Jack's frosty ass).",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Dare to Believe?,"When you hear the name DreamWorks, most likely you think animated fun? With films like Madagascar, How to Train your Dragon, and Shrek, the animation squad seems to have plenty of life in their studios to continue pumping these CGI hits out. This week, DreamWorks dived into the world of mythological gift givers in their film Rise Of The Guardians. When this trailer premiered about a year ago, I was happy with the promise this film offered. However, as we've seen happen plenty of times, I always have the worry that the trailer designers have fooled me once again. What's my verdict on their latest movie? Please read on to find out.Rise of The Guardians focuses on the big four protectors of children: Santa Clause aka North (Alec Baldwin), Sandman, Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), and the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman). These four are in charge of bringing happiness to the world in their own way, though most of the attempts through bribery in some shape or form. Yet when the happiness of children is threatened by the Boogie Man, now named Pitch Black (Jude Law), the four must call on another to help them face their challenge. This new contender is Jack Frost (Chris Pine) a spirit in charge of snow days who has a case of amnesia. What will this spirit who has a big case of ADHD be able to contribute, and what will he gain as a reward for his services? I can't tell you that.What I can tell you though are some of the qualities about this movie that made it a fun afternoon. The biggest compliment I have for the film is the animation. Once again DreamWorks staff has done their homework, finding ways to capture the movement of humans, animals, and mythological in a way that is fluid and smooth. Whether they are sliding down tunnels, flying magic sleighs, or fighting off the dark sands of Pitch, the characters don't lag, glitch, or fail to impress this reviewer. However, the characters design is also well done as it mirrored the personality of each Guardian yet gave them an edge over their classic renditions. In particular Santa's Lumberjack meets biker look was a welcome change, alongside the colorful display of feathers and scales that made up the Tooth Fairy. This edgy style was a welcome change and should be entertaining to both kids and adults alike. Yet what's an animated movie without good voice work to help add more character to this cast. Baldwin might have taken my vote for the best voice work, using his talents to give North a variety of emotions. At times he was cheerful and upbeat making some funny jokes and raising the audience spirits, while other times he dropped to a more serious and hard tone used to express the direness of the situation. The others of course did a great job with Fisher's bubbly air syncing with the Tooth Fairy, while Law's charming English voice darkened the already nightmare infused Pitch. As for Sandy, well despite lacking any real dialog, the little guy has a lot pizazz to his character. Of all the guardians he might be my favorite character.Aside from the animation though, there were some other things about this movie worth mentioning. The story, although fairly simple, is very entertaining and cute to both kids and adults. There are a few twists in the movie that keep it fun, mostly pertaining to Jack, but for the most part the story is linear and easy to follow, which is good for a kid's movie. While it lacks the jokes that Shrek has, Rise of The Guardians has other qualities that make up for it. The magic for instance is brilliantly brought to life in an array of flashy colors, bright lights, and clever shapes that are sure to wow the audience. Rather than just showing off though, the magic was integrated into both bringing happiness and fighting off Pitch's dark sands. Although somewhat limited, the action in this film was still enjoyable and suspenseful. North's blade wielding, Bunny's boomerang throwing, and Sandman's manipulation magic, will surely have you laughing, smiling, or at least a little applause from the well edited scenes. Action aside though, there are numerous points in the movie where the inner child from within is awaken once again. Rise of the Guardians strongest emotion is the power to believe, something that many have lost as they grew up. Those who long ago forgot the feelings of excitement wonder, and believing in magic may find themselves once again feeling the spirit reviving in them. There were a couple of times I felt my heart melt at the speeches the guardians gave. Yet if you never really got into the believing spirit, your heart might melt at some of the cuter aspects of this movie. The tooth fairies helpers and elves in particular are sure to make some squeal in delight, or at least say awwwwww.Rise Of The Guardians is another successful chapter in the DreamWorks animation studio book. With a nice balance of action, some fun comedic lines, great voice work, and some decent character development, this movie has just about everything for most fans. My only suggestions are to add some more action in the next installment, and continue to develop the other characters as well; whose pasts still remain a mystery. Even if you're not a fan of the story, or have never gotten into the holiday thing, at least go see it for the fantastic animation the team has put together. Is it worth a trip to the theater? I say yes. Is it worth a 3-D, I can't say, but the 2-D showing was pretty good. Should you decide not to go the theater though, definitely check this film out on Netflix.

Refreshing.... Kids will love it... equally pleasant for adults,"I watched the movie after reading the reviews posted in IMDb. Well, the movie is really good. Though an adult I enjoyed it a lot. Will recommend to both kids and adults. The kids watching were enjoying thoroughly. For an adult, it has everything that will help connect to childhood memories.A simple light feel movie that will help rejuvenate for sure!! The characters have been introduced very well, story woven without any complexity. Its a simple movie so don't want to give out the story, but would recommend to leave all your worries and go and watch the movie now! I am planning to watch it again already!Cheers!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Solid story, awesome characters and amazing animation","I feel like this is such an underrated movie! The idea and concept is really awesome with having Santa Claus, the Easter bunny, the tooth fairy and the Sandman be some sort of Avengers-like team.

Mix of Little Good and More Bad,"I liked some things about the movie but overall i am disappointed. I like animated movies but this one just failed to impress. It seems to me that the movie could have been much better. It has a good plot but the characters were a let down.It has the same old concept of Good vs Evil. But it is not the bad part of the movie.Santa is just weird. He fights with swords and has a some kinda European accent. Also the other characters, none of them is funny or likable.Biggest problem with this movie is that it lacks funny part of animation movies. It hardly succeeds at making you just smile couple of times. If it had some good laughs it would have been a much better movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A family flick.,"Do you believe in fairy tales? In creeps and ghouls and ghosts and boogymen? Do you believe in hope? And joy and love and other things, like children do? If you say no, you will love The rise of the guardians. If you say yes, you will definitely love The rise of the guardians.Dreamworks has pulled out all the stops with this super adorable animated film. It has a great cast voicing the characters but that is not enough is it? So guess what, the film has an awesome story line and some well done graphics as well.For an hour and thirty seven minutes the film twists and turns through fear, sorrow, magic, joy and hope. There is not a single boring minute and for once, for what seems like after a really long time, I found a film completely unpredictable until the very end.Bringing in a concept of what is sadly true, the fact that childhood is dying and with it is hope and faith and childlike belief of whimsical characters like Santa and the Easter Bunny, the Rise of the Guardians gets one thinking about the metaphorical fears and dangers threatening mankind, showcased throughout the entire film.Animation lovers will especially enjoy the final few minutes of the film where there is an obvious interpretation from a scene in The Lion King staring Scar (Let me know if you can find the correlation just like I did ).Bottomline - A must watch for children and adults of all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Utterly beautiful, flawless masterpiece","I've always been a massive fan of Shrek, Ice Age and Toy Story, and now this is right up there with them. I cannot fault this film at all, it's perfect. I cried on more than one occasion, not a single tear, but proper sobbing. The emotion is incredible. I also laughed out loud numerous times, mainly at Santa and Bunny, they were hilarious. The Boogeyman was also great, menacing and scary. The movie has a lovely and heartwarming message, it's great for kids and adults alike. The younger ones may be a little scared of the Boogeyman and his henchmen (or hench- horses!) but older kids who are still young enough to appreciate these magical legends will love it!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wasted Opportunities and Plot Holes,"Let me preface this by saying the 4 might be a bit of an overreaction because I just got done watching the movie so emotions are running high.That being said I believe the writers for this had a really good general idea for a story, and then mucked it all up. I love the main story but I felt there were so many plot holes and the dialogue was hit or miss (more hit than miss but for a big movie there shouldn't be many misses). In getting in the spirit to write a kids movies the writers clearly thought like a child when writing the characters, and as such the characters make awful decisions most of the time and ignore obvious signs of things. There was also a massively wasted opportunity towards the end that could have been used to teach a GREAT lesson but they chose a more basic and less inspiring ending in my opinion.This movie had amazing execution, great animation, great voice acting, great general idea, but I just could not get past the stupidity of all the characters in their decisions, the constant plot holes, and the big wasted opportunity at the end.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Great Movie for All Ages,"This is a perfect movie to watch as a family. Everyone will find something they enjoy. I went to go see this movie in the theaters with my eleven year old cousin and we absolutely loved it.There was a good story line. You can't help but love the characters, (or in Pitch's case, hate them.) There are also plenty of cute and funny little moments scattered through the film. Santa's elves are great comic relief characters, as they are always getting into some type of mischief! I also loved the development of Jack Frost's character as he meets the guardians, battles Pitch Black, and finally understand what it means to be a guardian. All together, It makes a great family movie, full of laughs, great characters, and maybe a few life lessons as well.It doesn't matter how old or you are, you will definitely find something to enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

You should go see it before it gets out of theaters, as not enough people have seen it for it to get as much as it costs in the box office yet. This movie hasn't been recognized and is a great movie for people of all ages.I give it a strong 10/10.

"Utterly Disappointing Movie, BORING as hell!","I saw this movie hoping to see a good animation flick after so many positive reviews on IMDb. I went with 3 of my mates, we had planned to see another movie & were late to see it so we ended up seeing this movie. My bad luck that I saw this movie opening in 10 minutes so I thought this one has good reviews lets go see this one.Long story short, it was a really boring snooze-fest, we came out half way through (although we were seeing it in 3D). It was really childish. The kids in the hall were enjoying it for sure. I didn't think before going in that maximum age limit to enjoy this movie is 10. From the that day onward, my friends mock me everyday that 'WHY' did you tell us watch Rise of the Guardians. It was a waste of time & money. Not a bit interesting. There was only one Action sequence in the whole movie and it was only for 5 minutes, other than a really boring movie. All the reviewers that are saying it moved me or the characters were very interesting.... blah blah.... are totally lying.Please don't waste your money. Go watch something else. Even the new Nicolas cage movie was more fun than Rise of the Guardians.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Really good, but just missing a couple of things","There's so many other great reviews here, but I'd just like to add couple of things I didn't read.We bought this film and have played it many times much to our 3 year old's delight, and like many animated features there's plenty here for adults to like as well. I love this type of film, it takes everyone's favorite childhood characters and puts them together in a thrilling story of goodies vs baddies.But I felt it was missing a couple of things. First of all, the dialogue is pretty weak in places - children won't care, but adults would enjoy it more if the dialogue was just a bit slicker. And secondly the animation was a little under par by today's standards. At first I wondered if it was a style choice, but more than likely it was a budget thing. Textures and fine details (like hair movement etc) look more programmatic than animatic.But all of the other good things mentioned in the 10 out of 10 reviews still apply though, my score is an 8, because I think some of those finer details are what makes a really good film really great.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Flawed, yet enjoyable experience","A rock solid animated flick that will have kids wildly entertained, but there is also some great action, whip-fast writing and incredible animation there for an older audience to enjoy, granted that they're willing to sift through the more cliché ""kids-movie"" tropes.Firstly of note is the stellar voice work. Chris Pine leads, while Hugh Jackman and Alec Baldwin accompanies him in this wild adventure while he fights Pitch, played by Jude Law. Pine is extraordinarily refreshing, contrasting the annoying and whiny voices of most animated movies today with a deep and mature voice. The characters are all pretty familiar, but have their own creative and amusing spin put on them. Santa is a Russian, spouting exclamations like ""Korsakov!"" and ""Shostakovich!"" (which is fairly amusing, me being a music guy and all) and Bunny is an Australian boomerang wielding boss (no doubt a play on his voice actor Jackman) are among the better of the cast. It's an undoubtedly strong voice crew, and it truly shows.The animation is stellar, featuring some beautiful effects and sharp details that bring the world alive. It's too bad though, that it's so short, because just an extra 30 minutes would've really allowed the audience to more deeply explore and absorb the goofy yet enjoyable world of the Guardians. Alexandre Desplat also composes yet another enjoyable score for RotG. The guy can churn out score after score, he's becoming the new John Williams!The pacing is crazy fast, to say the least, but it manages to get the story across well enough. Speaking of which, the Rise of the Guardian's biggest strength and weakness is its story. It begins so mysteriously, which really hooked me at the beginning. When the inevitable twist comes along it's clever, but after that the film loses that mysterious and magical quality that made the first half of the film so great in favor for a simple second half. The end is cute and fun, but it's to ""Yeah! Yay!"" happy-cheery, which proves that Rise of the Guardians has a classic case of identity crisis, where one section is strong, dark, and even mature while the other is childish, simple, and cliché. It's too bad, because the majority of the film is original, enticing and incredibly entertaining.Rise of the Guardians has great characters, music, and animation and an awesome first half to boot, but it ends up ending too fast and plays it too safe. It's still an entertaining ride with some spectacular action and interesting creativity on display, so let's hope they use their obvious creative ability throughout the whole film instead of opting out for a casual ending for the inevitable sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
great film for all the family,"i watched rise of the guardians for the first time and i was glued to it from start to finish the storyline was great also enjoyable too. i liked the idea of Santa clause and the easter bunny etc being super heroes. sand man was my favourite, but i also kinda thought the boogie man was cool for a baddie.i love it my kids loved it too. i would say that this is one of the best animated movie I've seen in along time as a lot of films do let you down, only showing the good bits in adverts then letting you down with the story. i would like to see a rise of the guardians 2 fingers crossed they make a sequel. this film is is a MUST SEE! great film for all the family. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Much better than the trailer lets on! Fast paced but also moving.,"I was not impressed with the trailers for The Guardians, so I thought the movie was nothing special. I only went to see it because a friend and her daughter invited my daughter and I. I'm happy to say, I'm very glad we went! It had everything I ask for in a family film; an interesting story, good character development, emotion, action, a mystery, some scary parts, several funny parts, and a happy ending. My daughter loved it and so did I. It was not the pinnacle for kids films, but it was really good and definitely worth catching in the theater. The animation was very good, the characters all had very distinct and charming personalities, I thought the cast was great and was actually moved to tears a couple times. If I had to compare it to other movies, I would say it's sits in between Polar Express and Toy Story, but a little scarier. NOTE: It may be disturbing or too intense for younger children. The villain's horses are quite spooky and threatening. Even I was tense a few times (okay, I'm easy to scare, I'll admit it!). I rarely right reviews, but I don't know if this movie is getting the buzz it deserves, and so I thought I'd share my thoughts, since I was so pleasantly surprised.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

When you first look at it, you probably think it's just some new kid movie. But it's NOT. Rise of the Guardians, not only a great story and plot, also was done to have people of all ages find something in it they can enjoy. All the characters were done in interesting and enticing ways, and the whole movie warms your heart and has you cheering on for the characters. People who think this is a child's movie are wrong.

The anti-DreamWorks film in a good way,"I've watched around 25 DreamWorks films and this feels the least like one. This is a really fast-paced film in a similar way to HTTYD where it immediately moves to the next scene and a lot happens here but the thing is, it wasn't a messy plot and there is so much to love here.The animation style is awesome, It's something completely different but I just adore this style, wish there were more films with this style telling more storiesMost DreamWorks movies, even good ones have some grouchy humor but no, this film is completely devoid of any childish humor and I really value that, its clearly indicated this is for all ages.The plot was pretty clever, jack frost constantly struggles through self-worth but by the plot's previous scene's he is changingThe characters were something completely new. Santa is the energetic guy, the fairy is an enthusiastic fairy that cares a lot about her fairies, and Bunny is a conservative guy.

"Rise Of The Guardians- visually inventive, heartwarming, action-packed and funny","I didn't see this in theatres when it first came out, I actually got it as a gift from my aunt in March 2013. When I watched it, I was stunned! I found myself engaged by the action scenes, charmed by Jack Frost's backstory, laughing at the jokes, and dazzled by the animation. Although occasionally the story relies too much on action and it can be predictable at times, this film rocks! The elves, yetis and fairies are cute and funny, as well as Hugh Jackman's hilarious performance as the Easter Bunny. Whenever Jack Frost and Bunny argue, it's priceless. Jack's backstory is fully fleshed-out and develops his character entirely. The visual effects and character animation are downright beautiful. Also, I have this on Blu-ray 3D and the 3D effects are some of the best I've seen in an animated film. Rise Of The Guardians is an underrated masterpiece that should've been seen by more people, given it's known as a box office disappointment.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Words cannot do this film justice,"This is a beautiful film. First of all, it was made for an executive producer's late daughter, Mary Katherine Joyce, who wrote a book series called ""Guardians of Childhood"", based off of stories her father would tell her. That alone is incredible.The voice acting is astounding, the plot encapsulating, and the animation holds up to today's. The tension is actual tension! And I rarely feel for characters in films. The diversity in character design and personality helps to give each character their own, well, character! I love this movie and probably always will. It's my number one film, that's for sure. It holds everything a child could ever want, so many kinds of magic are explored and discussed.Words cannot do this film justice, and this review doesn't hold a torch to how strongly I love this masterpiece.10 stars.

I agree with the rave reviews posted here, and am unsure how the average rating is only 7.3, when the vast majority of reviews are 8-10. It's visually stunning, with unique and highly innovative interpretations of age-old children's holiday icons. With some interesting new character quirks, they are totally fresh and endearing, except the villain, who though not lovable, is excellently executed. I agree with another reviewer who said all of the voices were brilliantly cast. This movie conveys the magical wonder that comes naturally to children and will remind adults what youthful awe felt like.

"An action-packed film with great, well-known characters and stunning visuals.","While the idea of the holidays being connected isn't a new idea (see The Nightmare Before Chrismas (1993) for another take on it), there is something intrinsically interesting with making the respective figureheads of their representative mythos come together in an Avenger-esque fashion against a common enemy. Rise of the Guardians (2012) certainly does a good job of this, even if only two of its characters have anything to do with holidays at all. In its essence, the fanciful characters from our childhood banding together to fight evil personified is based on the belief that we all have something to believe in.What I particularly like about Rise of the Guardians is the surprising depth of the characters chosen to fight for the belief of all children around the world. From a Russian-themed Santa Claus to the Australian Easter Bunny (expertly voiced by Alec Baldwin and Hugh Jackman, respectively), these added details to beloved childhood figures just adds to their personalities. Even the Boogeyman's ability to hide and utilize shadows merely emphasizes that each of these characters has abilities and strengths commensurate to their basic attributes, thus fleshing them out into well-rounded characters instead of just 2-dimensional bedtime stories.Because of these colorful and unique characters, their interactions in this interesting plot were merely accentuated by the imaginative artistic style that Dreamworks animators have used for years. That being said, the human children characters looked quite ugly, so I can't completely give the team full marks for their effort. Still, the visuals of the main characters were used to create a fanciful and fun world which was expertly contrasted by the ""under the bed"" realm of the Boogeyman. And while this film might not necessarily be a ""Christmas"" film (it's events actually take place closer to Easter), I think it's a good counterpoint to other ""cold"" animated films like ""Frozen"", especially for the young boys who might not be interested in Disney princesses.An action-packed film with great, well-known characters and stunning visuals, I give Rise of the Guardians 4.5 stars out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Chix Chat on Film Review: Jack Frost has got it going on!,"Rise of the Guardians is the story of legendary characters identified with various Holidays and events working together against a common foe who wants to perpetuate fear. There are four Guardians starting with Santa Claus, who is certainly a Santa for a new generation, with tattoos and a thumb ring North (Alec Baldwin) is an OG (original gangsta) Santa. This story was great PR for Jack Frost (Chris Pine) who has been chosen as the newest Guardian recruit, but he has an issue with belief in him. All that should change as a result of this gem of a tale, and just in time for winter. Of course Jack is a reluctant hero, but those make the best kind. This is now my favorite Jack Frost film and it is much more fun than that live action characterization of him in the Santa Clause 3, which kind of sucked and don't even get me started with that crazy Jack Frost reincarnated fallen father snowman flick, I digress. It was amusing to watch the friendly rivalry between Jack and the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), the Tooth (Isla Fisher) Fairy was a bit freaky looking, and everybody was more interesting than the Sand Man, which rounds out the crew. That brings me to their nemesis, Pitch Black (Jude Law) who was a not so scary at all Boogey Man. I snickered a bit every time his name was mentioned because sometimes it sounded like a 'B' rather than a 'P' so it was like ""Don't make me slap a Pitch"" or That Pitch needs to chillax."" ROTG was one of the most action packed films that I've seen all year, you don't really keep in mind that it is animated as the pace and the intensity heightens. Speaking of the animation it was so delightful with imagery so colorful that small children will love the look of it even if they did not completely grasp the depth of the story with the Guardians fighting for hope, wonder, fund memories and fun. This is a great story of the battle of good versus evil with an iconic team working together to prevent fear from taking hold in the hearts of children, oh and in 3D. There were so many magical moments in this film that I could think of only one thing that would have made the experience better for me and that is if I had seen it with my awesome grandsons, Three and Aries. I give this remarkable film a bright green light.Note: I was really digging Jack's platinum blond do.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Even the word amazing does not do this film justice!,"What a great film. Films these days are either terrible, bad, good or really good. Most these days are nothing special. Well this one is an exception to the rule, it is GREAT AND SPECIAL. What a wonderful and spectacular film. If ever there was a film that was magical, it would be this one.The animation is above the level of every animation last year and better than most if not all i have ever seen. It is mystifying! A really excellent job done. Great characters, an absolutely lovable and tear inducing lead. He was awesome (Jack Frost). The other characters, great as well.SPOILER AHEAD: When Jaimie saw Jack for the first time, i cried. And Jacks back story is tear inducing i am telling you.It had me crying like a baby in certain parts and in stitches in many. It was the perfect blend of emotional, hilarious and thrilling. PERFECT! A festive treat destined to become a classic. I will have to get it on DVD.It may have not done really well at the box office but that is no indicator of how good it is. So many movies don't leave a mark at the box office but they still are some of the best movies ever made. Twilight which is TERRIBLE did well so obviously bad movies do well at the box office. Don't judge this movie by box office performance because if you do, then you are missing a real treat. Take my word and those of the bulk of reviewers here and go watch it, it is amazing, well beyond that even.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Guardians and kids,"My age is 15 years and I love this movie because this is funny, emotional and is outstanding. The way how the guardians bring joy to kids is very awesome. The end of the movie is emotional and interesting and the whole movie is just awesome the way kids help the guardians to get their powers back is awesome. The death of sandman and the returning of sandman is very exciting. The end of Pitch is also exciting. The new guardian Jack Frost is very interesting and naughty. I am a fan of animated movies and this one is one of the best animated movies. The acting of Santa is really amazing. And the Tooth fairy is also very beautiful and the baby tooth are really cute. The easter bunny is a bit rude but from inside he is very polite. The powers of sandman are awesome.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best films I have ever watched :):):):):):):),"Absolutely brilliant!!!!!! The animation is amazing but its the characters what make this movie amazing. The story line is really good and is quite sad in some parts but it is uplifted by its humour. The only downside to this fantastic masterpiece is the length of the film. It could of been a lot longer with a lot more fights and a bit more story. But putting that aside its amazing. This is also on my list of best animated films of all time.... I placed it 2nd. Just behind a bugs life and one ahead of toy story. If I didn't make the list of best films of all time before this. This would be on their along with my favourites kill bill 1&2, alien, a bugs life and requiem for a dream. Probably even higher than those. If I was you I would buy this film.

"We want a sequel, now!","This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever watched and is way up there with How to Train Your Dragon. Besides the breath-taking scenery, heart-warming moments and brilliant humour, the characters (especially Jack Frost) are extremely easy on the eyes and can absolutely appeal to everyone from the age of 0 to 300. We need a sequel, now! Unfortunately, the production company had to do a write-down of 83 million and lay off 350 workers due to the lack of admissions (viewers) and as such, the chances of a sequel are slim. It would be such a waste if such a lovely animation were to be a one-off due to this issue so I do hope more people will give this movie a try and fall in love with it, as I literally did.

A breathtaking and magical work of art,"WOW! What a spectacular piece of cinematic art. Great characters, an extremely touching and emotional storyline and breathtaking animation. That basically sums this epic adventure up. It is something kids and adults of all ages are likely to enjoy. It takes you back to your childhood when you believed, the age of innocence. This film manages to stir up very many emotions and tugs at your heartstrings. Its simple and yet beautiful messages really made this a fantastic film. The animation was very stunning, very well executed. Kudos go to Dreamworks Studios for this outstanding film. If such high caliber films are to be expected from Dreamworks in the future, then all i can say is that Pixar had better look out. The lead character, Jack Frost, his journey and internal struggles, depth and personality really made him an outstanding lead. And the action packed Avengersesque scenes were marvelous. The movie had many of us in the cinema, self included, in tears at various parts and bursting with laughter at others.

This is the best animated feature ever for children (and adults who have not been introduced to  or would like to remember these  magical Guardians again...,"I have seen almost every animated movie for the last 50 years from Disney to Hayao Miyazaki, but this movie tops them all in every aspect of screenplay, storyline, script, character animation and score.

Ending soon in theaters. We can't wait for the DVD to be out later this year, but watching it on the big screen ( just look at Sandman.. Awesome) makes a difference especially when we don't have mega televisions at home. Hey Oscars, there should be at least one nomination for the Guardians - best animated feature for 2013!

A wonderful movie!,"When I went to see this movie, I was not sure what to expect. I had only seen a movie poster and some images of Jack Frost and I really liked his character design. I decided to go see it out of the blue one night, a few days after it came out. I was completely blown away at the beauty of this film. Its surely one of my favorites now.Rise of the Guardians is definitely a movie for all ages. Whether you are 5 or 50, this movie will give you something to smile and laugh about. As a 17 year old male, I enjoyed this movie for its beautiful animation and the fantastic character designs. I felt like a little kid again watching this, and even though this is technically a ""kid's movie"", it got deep.It's very sad that such a beautiful movie is doing so poorly in the box office, when really it deserves so much more attention. Encourage all your family and friends to see this film. I have seen 3 times already with my sister and it doesn't get old.

Believe!,"Fear is the opposite of faith, and ""Rise of the Guardians"" is a perfect example of this. We get so caught up in the what-ifs of life that are scary. We spend so much energy choosing to be afraid. I appreciate how this movie shows the concept of belief in such a revealing way. ""Rise of the Guardians"" should have been nominated for an Academy Award. The good news though, is, it won many Annie awards as well as others.The voice acting was emotionally diverse, the characters were multi-dimensional, and the animation was top notch.Some images could be scary for very small children, but it is a wonderful springboard for discussion with older children (and adults for that matter).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Wonderful!,"This movie looked fine to me at the start. When first hearing what it was about, I was in. Not totally excited, but it had some promise. However, when I saw the first trailer, it seemed too....dark and boring. I didn't understand the significance of Pitch. However, once I saw the movie, I realized he played a role in children's lives just as the Guardians did; he gives them nightmares. That was my only quarrel with the film previous to seeing it. Now onto the good stuff! The characters are great, not just their personalities, but their extremely new and creative designs. They take a children's dreamland to a whole new level, and it's wonderful to watch. I always like a good balance between fun and drama, and, while this was a little more on the drama side, it did end up being a good balance.

"Fun fact, it doesn't pass the Bechdel test. But still an amazing movie.","I recently rewatched this movie as I had fond memories of it and at the second watch it did not disappoint.

It did not pass! I can't believe it ahahah.But other than that I stand by my first sentence, this movie is preciously animated and filled with wonder and marvel. Visually striking in so many scenes, you can tell they put a lot of effort in and that there were some high quality creatives in the production.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Jack Frost melts hearts,"From its first moments The Rise of The Guardians is clearly something special. The birth of a super-hero is exquisitely rendered; Jack Frost's introduction is a truly poignant moment.This animated feature begins brilliantly and then struggles a little in trying to keep the younger audience members hooked while establishing its characters and story. In the first half there are times when the pace is somewhat frenetic although it remains constantly enjoyable, but in the second half it pulls out all the stops to confirm itself as a heartbreakingly wonderful film about faith, hope and friendship.What sets Guardians apart from other movies of its genre is the depth and originality present in the story-telling and characters. The emotions are tender and everything seems personal and real; close to the bone and human.Watching Guardians you realize how even the best family entertainment relies on manipulative and predictable story-telling. Guardians is a breath of fresh air, you can watch with fresh eyes like a child unpolluted by expected dramatic cues sign-posted as they arrive. It is also often like going on a roller-coaster ride, visually the 3D is used to best effect without feeling like a gimmick. The shots supervised by the great Roger Deakins are out of this world. Music by Alexandre Desplat, brilliant as ever. The animation state-of-the-art, serving the story perfectly.A great movie which pays off marvelously.

Dreamworks deliver Avengers-esque tale for all the family,"The premise here is that four legendary characters - Santa Claus, the Sandman, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny - are a team of 'Guardians' protecting the world's children. We learn that they were brought together by the Man in the Moon, and it is he who introduces a fifth member in the form of Jack Frost to help them when the Boogeyman attacks. This is based on William Joyce's ongoing ""Guardians of Childhood"" book series, apparently inspired by his six year old daughter when she asked if Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny knew each other. The setup has a lot of obvious parallels with the Avengers, though aimed at a broader/younger audience.The movie characters are clever re-imaginings of the traditional personae, with Bunny being a tough Australian more kangaroo than a rabbit and Santa (""Nicholas St. North"") a tattooed smart leader for the group. Jack is the outsider protagonist, and Pitch Black is the spurned Boogeyman, and the similarity in their motives adds an extra plot layer that works well. The voices are great too without exception, though Alec Baldwin was especially good as North.The animation is brilliant, the best quality I've seen in a while, especially the sand as it morphs into different shapes, objects, and animals. This was well worth seeing on the big screen in 3D as some of the effects are really impressive; the kids actually let out a few involuntary ooohs at the snowflakes floating off the screen.I can imagine this spawning a sequel or two, and I think the characters are strong enough to carry it too.All in all a great family movie for Christmas, or Easter, or any time really!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Magical troughout!!,"This movie has been out for 6 years and despite hearing about it here and there, it never crossed my mind to go watch it. I honestly thought it was some lame ass attempt to make superheroes out of Santa and the Easter bunny. Boy was I wrong!Every single scene is riddled with emotion and there was something every minute that left me in awe. I don't think I have seen many movies where every single character - and i mean every one- even if they are an extra that is in frame for 2 seconds - has a such an expressive, charismatic appearance. It made me feel all the feels and more! 
Messages about hope, facing your fears, magic, believing in yourself and in miracles are brought to you in a way that hits home. I'm a sucker for animated movies with a lot of heart and this one wrapped my heart in a warm cuddly blanket. There are so many moments that make you go ""awww"" and the first half of the movie is so incredible endearing and charming, while the second half gets more serious and really engaging. 
The villian here - the Boogyman - is protrayed like a real devil. Sly, charming, cunning, dark but intriguing. You even think at one point that his reasons for doing his evil are justified. He's not a 100% villian, he tries to get on your gullible good side, and that is exactly what a devil does. Outstanding character in every way!
Making Santa a big, tough Russian cuddle-tank was a daring move but it worked like a charm. His facial expressions can speak novels within a single shot.... the animation department gave full attention to the characters' emotions and they nailed it!

A hidden gem,I remember watching this movie countless times when I was younger and I still watch it with a passion today.The character designs and personalities are strokes of pure genius examples being Bunny being a hard faced Australian with boomerangs instead of a soft white bunny and North being a big muscular Russian man with swords instead of a plump jolly man. The villain is probably one of the best animated villains I've seen in a while and I absolutely love what they did with Sand Man.My only problem with this movie is that it completely and utterly flopped. So I doubt DreamWorks will ever touch this film again even though it has heaps of potential for a sequel.But I can still confidently say that this is my second favourite DreamWorks fill right behind The Wild Robot.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Magical,"My kiddo is 18 now, but we still watch this movie every year (at least), but especially over the holidays.

My only lament is that there was never a part II (and this from someone who doesn't think most movies *need* follow-ups, but I'd legit follow these characters to the moon and back). And, it totally holds up! Highly recommend to parents with children of all ages - IMO, we could all use a little more magic these days!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Unique Reimagining of All the Holiday Icons,"A refreshingly creative interpretation of all of our favorite holiday icons. The new designs imaginative & original, but admittedly a bit hit-or-miss at times. The landscape visuals and fast-paced action was exciting with great textures. There is a solid celebrity voice cast. I love all of the cute visual gags with how Sandman communicates with sand, since he can't talk. I dig the rough & adventurous Russian Santa Claus and Aussie Easter Bunny. Tooth Fairy is cute, hyper, & precious despite her bizarre design. Jack Frost looks like Justin Bieber, but is played well by Chris Pine. I really enjoyed his identity crisis with a genuinely sad backstory. However, there is definitely a strong uncanny valley with the human and elf characters. It was also a bit unnerving when Jack Frost almost killed a kid with his sledding adventure even if the movie plays it off as exciting. The Boogey Man villain has a boring design & feels a bit miscast with Jude Law, but he raises the stakes exponentially and has a good contrast to Jack Frost with their different ways of coping with being forgotten and unseen. Cool imagery with his dark sand as a foil for Sandman. I also like the funny way that the yetis talk. I do wish the ending climax was less rushed (the movie as a whole is very entertaining with its fast pace, but can be a bit rushed at times). Despite my nitpicks, it's a surprisingly charming movie and really underrated as both a DreamWorks movie and a Christmas movie, with some really exciting worldbuilding that's just begging to be expanded upon in a sequel that never came to be.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I've grown up with a few of these characters, and seeing them in a different way, like a Russian Santa or an Australian Easter Bunny, was really great and I got to learn about other characters that I didn't know about( Jack Frost and the Sandman) and to see them interact with each other and being happy and seeing them kick butt and I loved them all. The vocal actors were amazing and brought more joy to the movie ( Chris Pine, Hugh Jackman, Jude Law to name a few). The animation was beautiful and so detailed. I loved Jacks backstory and his playful personality. I laughed and cried. I would recommend this to anyone and to anyone with kids,if they believe in Santa or not.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Little Jack Frost, don't get lost!","Rise Of The Guardians (2012) -Awesome!There has always been some debate in my family as to whether this was a Christmas or Easter film, it may have been released at the end of November and feature Father Christmas (Alec Baldwin), but it was set at Easter and had the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman) too.I don't care either way as it just means that I can watch it all year around and class it as a general film to get away with it, because after all the Sandman comes every day and the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher) whenever she feels like it. And that's great, because I really like this one and not just because it's another example of my fancying a cartoon character. There was just something about Jack Frost (And obviously Chris Pine). I thought that it might have been his impish nature that still showed a vulnerable side. It's okay by the way, I looked it up and he was at least seventeen.I've never really been bothered with Easter and the Sandman has never largely featured as a part of my life, but I still get disgruntled when the Tooth Fairy doesn't visit (The most recent extraction was painful and worth at least £20.00, I got nothing), but I look forward to Father Christmas coming from one Christmas Day to the next. I also have very in depth issues regarding the Bogey Man (Jude Law). So a film that combined them all was just fantastic for me. Add Jack in to the mix and my belief system had a lot of extra work to do, as I have looked out at the frosted cars and thought about that cute little guy spreading a crisp glistening on the rooves of cars and making the grass crunch.Whilst I was watching this for the umpteenth time, I was looking up the writer and the books by William Joyce have already become regular gifts for my Mother who also adores this film. What a great idea of Mr. Joyce to study these wonderful characters origins and how they have worked together. I had no idea for instance that the Easter Bunny had been around since 1682 and originated in Germany. Some of these fantastic legends have seen very little coverage, so his explorations are fairly unique.This was a great film for all the family, my Mother gets upset if it's not recorded every time it's on (Maybe I should buy it for her on DVD?) and even my grumpy twenty something Niece and Nephew don't mind watching it along with the other Grumpy 17 year old Nephew.It also had a moral value and the characters were great, voiced by some superb actors and thoughtfully created by the story boarders and artists.There were some great funny moments and it was easy to watch. I was really surprised to hear that it didn't do well in the Box Office. I say watch it.956.23/1000.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the best movies ever,"I wanted so see Rise of the Guardians since I saw the trailer two months before the release. Generally when you have so hight expectations about a film at the end it never reaches them. But Rise of the Guardians was magnificent since the beginning to the end.The characters are endearing, the story line quite original and it's very funny (with jokes that often are aimed for adults more than children) It makes you laugh, cry, and believe in magic.But the most brilliant is the visual part and the characters design. All the typical mythological characters that we ever imagined were modified to surprise even the most boring of watchers. It changes your perception forever.However, the most impressive part of the movie is the quality. To see it in the cinema is an experience like any other. The colours are vivid, the textures are almost touchable, and the amount of detail.... you can see every grain of the DreamMaker's sand, every feather and every snowflake.The best animated film of the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant Idea with Brilliant Storytelling,"This movie does something that other Holiday movies don't do, while it is fiction, it feels so real at the same time.

The film gives you the joy of believing in a concept quite beautiful and magical at the same time.The personalities for santa, easter bunny, tooth fairy, jack frost, sandman, are all interesting and new.

Great animated film for everybody,"First of all, the animation in this film is stunning. The animators of this film worked really hard to make everything in this film to look realistic and it worked. All the voice actors were perfectly cast for their respected roles. The main standouts though for me were Chirs Pine and Jude Law. They both brought so much depth to their characters in a great way. Chris Pine made Jack Frost seem vulnerable at some points and a strong-willed character the next. While Jude Law made an already terrifying character even more terrifying. The cinematography in this film was stunning in each and every shot. They used the lighting in this film to help show each of the different areas and how they contrast each other. The music in this film, scored by Alexandre Desplat, was spectacular. Every song in this film was well fit for each situation that you see the characters in. Mainly during the climax do you get to hear how amazing the music is in this film. Finally, the pacing in this film is surprisingly great. Like none of the scenes felt to drag out or cut too short. Everything in this film was well paced from people just talking to the action shots in this film. On that note don't do walking into this movie thinking it'll be a massively funny movie when there are a few jokes here and there but it's mainly an action movie with heart to it. In the end Rise of the Guardians is a well-paced animated action movie that you should definitely check out.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Guardians,"This is a film that brings many of your favorite legendary figures together. Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Sandman, Tooth Fairy, and even Jack Frost. This is a film that delves a lot into the theme of belief. Stuff is more magical when you believe. With Jack Frost and Santa, it could be a good film for Christmas. It does take place around Easter time and has the Easter Bunny, so it is also a good film for Easter as well. I feel like all these figures aren't always seen together. The Santa Clause 2 and 3 have another team of legendary figures. They don't have the Easter Bunny but have Father Time, Mother Nature, and Cupid. Santa Clause 3 has Jack Frost in an antagonistic role. It's good that they added more coverage of Jack Frost in the media. There is definitely more coverage of Santa and it would be good if Jack Frost gets some more coverage. This has potential for sequels. 12 years and we haven't got one.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Most underrated anamated movie ever.,"This is why I love DreamWorks. They make incredible movies that somehow aren't taken seriously. And I see how many think it goes to fast, but I'm still going to give it all the credit it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of my favorite movies,"I love this movie. I can quote it by heart. I love the animation; it's so life like. The plot is good. I learned more about the characters and plot after reading the book series the movie was based off of. (The Guardians of Childhood by William Joyce.) Overall, it's a wonderful movie. You can watch it any time of the year in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Makes you feel like a child,"I watched this movie with my 3 girls when they were little. Every Christmas they ask me to watch Rise of the Guardians.12 years later and they still love it. It's a shame it didn't get a sequel. I read all the books and they could've taken the story in so many directions. The animation is beautiful, the story telling is captivating. Jack Frost is such a beloved character. The music in the film evokes emotion. The artistry of each character is so accurate to the books. I recommend this movie to anyone with kids or tweens. My oldest daughter is now 20 and she still loves this film. It's such a well done movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fresh and exciting, Loved it!","I went to see this with my husband, my daughter and her two friends.Im a big fan of these newer animated movies (brave, toy story 3 etc.) and this didn't let me down! The typical characters are freshly done, with a modern or different twist.Santa is called North (Baldwin), has tattoos, an accent and doesn't seem quiet so jolly when he is holding two swords! He is the leader, and not quiet as ho- ho as you would expect for a kids movie.The Easter bunny is 6 feet tall, can open portals with a tap of his foot, carries boomerangs on him at all times. Oh and he has an Australian accent (finally, a movie i get to hear Hugh Jackmans true accent in). Oh and he gets competitive with North.The tooth fairy appears to be a humming bird with a strange fixation on teeth, blood and gums. I thought the back story as to why she collects teeth was well thought out.Jack frost appears to be a kid, even though he was voiced by Chris pine who is 30 or something like that, it didn't detract, and it was a well done job. (the girls LOVED him ahem ahem). Deep, troubled, and self doubting, but with a good heart, its not hard to see why, My favorite was Sand man, whose power is way cool to watch.Pitch the main evil bad guy in this was done by Jude Law. Very well done as well.This movie has all sorts of messages; don't give up, believe in yourself, and that sometimes adults need help too.it also shows what happens between 2 people with similar feelings, and how if you don't get them under control, you can turn bad.The kids were totally enamored. I was too. It didn't feel long, it was the perfect length.Masterfully told, action packed and super cute moments as well. I love the yeti's!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Visually beautiful, heartwarming characters, and fast paced action fun!","I went to see this movie the first time because I think Chris Pine is an amazingly versatile actor, even if it was only his voice I was going to hear. I must admit that I did not get the movie at all that first viewing. But I decided to see it again and the second time I absolutely loved everything about it. The characters were warm, delightfully charming and I was able to follow the story better. The message of love, hope, and believing and having faith in the guardians and each other was precious. Jude Law was appropriately scary and yet turned out to be a rather sympathetic bad guy. Jack was both a 'bad boy' ala young Jim Kirk, and sweetly vulnerable and very much someone children and adults can identify with. Pitch and Jack Frost had a lot in common but chose clearly different paths. Anyway, for all those who like me sometimes need to see a movie a second time to 'get it' I hope you will take the time to see this movie again, especially if you didn't have a favorable impression the first time. I'm actually going to see it in 3-D tonight for my 3rd viewing. I am not a fan of 3-D for live films; it's more a distraction than an enhancement of the story experience, but I think since the movie is visually stunning that I will enjoy the 3-D in this one. I hope this movie wins lots of awards. Happy Holiday Season everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The magical movie.,"The film tells the story of immortal guards who protect the clarity, belief of but the child from evil.This is a movie that is not suitable for children.

Wonderful!,"Truly amazing animated adventure, that takes the beloved iconic characters and puts a new spin on them and almost turns them into superheroes(in a good way)! The animation is very good and character designs are great, voice cast is also top notch. The story is full of wonder and magic and is quite moving. One of the movies that grownups can enjoy as much as the children, if not even more. Very cool premise turned into a great movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Be fearless and believe in Divine.""","Today I watched Dreamworks Rise of the Guardians. Well, to be honest when I read(or came to know) about this movie then I imagined a similar kinda story of Legends of Guardians (The Owl's version, 2010) movie, which was a terrible flop(though It's effects were awesome). But after watching' it I seriously make myself to admit as a big fool and a fast (but false) decision maker. This movie indeed is one of the best animated movies I've seen so far. Before just come to the storyline, I'd make it sure to count this movie as my all-time favorite Disney type classical (may be!) animated feature film with mind blowing special effects but more greatly heart touching story(Here, I'll praise for ""Wreck It Ralph"" as well). As far as concerned to its story, This movie is based on An 'After Life' of a boy named Jack Frost (Who died at a young age) and becomes an (Ignorant) Guardian with some special powers and a mysterious past. When an ignorant, beasty and lofty ""Boogieman"" comes back with his evil powers to make Children's dreams a nightmare and to take his revenge from all the great four (existed) Guardians, then who'd come up as a beam of hope (with an ice stick) but Jack Frost. Basically, if I ignore it's all fantasy characters then this story tells a Moral of "" Be fearless and believe in divine."" I myself hate to watch Kiddish fantasy movies based upon senseless traditional rumors & fake stories but this movie, with such a great storyline and appreciable special effects make me wrong as a (so-called) Gentleman thinker.I'll rate this movie 9/10. Which I think is digestible, though background music was just OK and screenplay was not so impressive (Mind you! That's not a Drama movie). So overall It's a must watch movie if not for all time then at least on Christmas. And Yeah, It's a bit inspired from ""Harry Potter"" series, like fight b/w Evil & Truth. But I like it and hope so would you.Abhi S.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I love this movie!,"I've watched this movie so many times & it's a film I never get tired of; because it touches me emotionally.
It's a bit too dark for the younger viewers, but I love animated movies due to their often double depth stories.
The Rise of the Guardians deserves more credit than it got when it premiered. It is a Beauty to the eye, a Touch to the heart & an homage to childish (yet lovely) beliefs.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A wonderful animated film.,"What a ride this movie was. I honestly didn't know what to expect and I ended up quite surprised at how good it was. So, we got all these childhood icons thrown into an beautifully animated movie, filled with emotion that reaches epic proportions. I still feel this film as somewhat underrated; yet it has plenty of well-rounded characters purposefully adapted to the film's tone. Santa Claus (North) is portrayed as a badass Russian fellow, a reimagination which serves the movie pretty well in my opinion.The plot is thoroughly entertaining, reaching a wonderful climax that will satisfy the viewer's appetite for great stories with happy endings. You may say it's a bit predictable, but what is entertaining is the ride, not the destination in itself alone. Seriously, this one is not to be missed! The plot, the characters, the visuals, the beautiful score all construct this truly enjoyable animated piece.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

It is official now! DreamWorks has completely blown me away and has ensured that I don't give up on new animation movies,"Since the release of 'Cars 2' Pixar has really lost and seems that they will lose it in 2013 with Monsters University. Pixar being the king of animations, I had for a while given up on new animation movies but this wonderful little gem ensures that I will check out as many animation films in 2013 as possible! 2012 has being a rather brilliant year for me in movies with the releases of Django Unchained, Dark Knight Rises, 007, The Hobbit, Life of Pi, Wreck it Ralph, ParaNorman and now....Rise of the Guardians 'Rise of the Guardians' elegentally and magically tells us the story of a group of fairy tale characters such as Santa Claus, Jack Frost (being the central focus of the story) Sandman, the Tooth Fairy and the evil Pitch. As Pitch gains control and power over the world, The Moon re-unites these fairy tale characters and together they must bring down Pitch.There is every right reason for me to just love this movie: The animations look amazing; just amazing! Every single shot has such beauty and is so elegant and is simply a treat to the eye. The voice acting is just superb by everyone, the way the characters were written is superb, the amount of back story and emotion given to Jack Frost is amazing! The directing in the movie is great and the pacing is superb, no scene feeling too long and no part of the movie feeling a bit tedious.The story is told extremely well in just a way that makes you wish you were a kid. Dazzling visual animations, characters and story along with some hilarious moments make this truly an experience worth watching and a golden movie of 2012.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Set my Bar High and it Rose Above it,"I am a very hard person to impress when it comes to movies. Sure, I may enjoy them and laugh once in a while, but I rarely come to a movie where I actually have fun.Rise of the Guardians is that movie. Before, I saw nothing of it except for a few pictures online and I knew I wanted to see it. After seeing the trailer I had my expectations set very high. I'm writing this less than an hour after seeing it and I'm still smiling like a silly child.Everything about this movie is glorious, the story, characters, animation, music, voices, moral, just everything is magical and adorably lovable. Never before have I encountered a movie, let alone an animated film, that entered not only my top 10 favorite movies, but my top 5 favorites in under 20 minutes.I recommend this to anyone and everyone. Big or small, even the Grinch would love this movie. I almost think adults and older kids will enjoy it more, and that's great! We all need to be reminded of that kid inside us. Rise of the Guardians is a beautiful piece of art that needs to be seen by the world. I only wish I could do more to spread the word. Believe in it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best cartoons I've ever seen,"It is only quite recently that I've watched Rise Of The Guardians, and it just knocked me off my feet. First of all, this movie is very beautiful. The special effects are fantastic: the golden dream sand, Jack Frost's freezing magic. The action is spread over different countries, and the movie shows off so many different emotions. All the characters are great, and the voice acting is very good too - the voices suit the characters just fine, you always hear the characters rather than the actors. The villain fascinates me the most - his laugh is maybe the best evil laugh I've ever heard, and the animators managed to make him really scary at times. The plot seems perfect to me. While watching this movie for the first time, I was so afraid it will take some corny turn, but it didn't! There are many powerful, breathtaking moments in this movie, when good confronts evil. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who didn't see it. It is bright, warm, fascinating and full of wonder.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Rise Of The Guardians succeeds massively here.Brilliant story idea really well executed.The other essentials parts were spot on too: cute characters were cute, funny bits were funny, the baddie was very creepy and the dark scary scenes added great contrast.Will definitely watch again.A satisfying 9 out of 10 for me",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Love, hope, and faith","Peter Ramsey's sweet and heartwarming creation reminds us that miracles exist, even if we can't always see or touch them. This tale, sprinkled with light humor, vivid visuals, and kindness in its gentlest form, also features the delightful and selfless Jack Frost. The film is perfect not only for children, as is often the case in contemporary Western cinema, but for adults as well. After watching it, you're left with a warm, sparkling feeling that a miracle is bound to happen. It even made me want to write a letter to Santa Claus and wait for a reply-more than I ever did as a child.As is typical in such stories, the forces of evil are, of course, defeated, and the sun and moon shine once again. What I especially loved about this film is that evil isn't just embodied by a sorcerer or an evil guardian, but by fear itself-because it is fear that binds us more than anything else. Fear makes us weak and vulnerable, and overcoming it is incredibly difficult, no matter the age. However, the victory over fear instills hope: if little children can open their hearts to miracles, believe in an invisible world of magic and kindness, perhaps adults can do the same.In addition to the film's vividness and joy, I'd like to highlight its sincerity, love, hope, and faith, which it conveys to viewers regardless of age.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's an absolute delight. An imaginative holiday treat I look forward to watching again.,"Happy Holidays, everybody! Well, it won't be long until Christmas day finally comes, and boy, am I excited! One of my favorite traditions this time of year is the numerous Christmas movies and specials that come out leading up to the day itself. With that in mind, one movie that I decided to lend my attention to was Dreamworks Animation's Rise of the Guardians. Does it meet the high standards of How to Train Your Dragon, or, even worse, does it prove to be just as boring and stale as Madagascar 3? I'm leaning towards the former, because this holiday treat brought me nothing but enjoyment.Sort of an Avengers for childhood icons, the movie mixes together Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), The Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), and the Sandman all together as guardians, those who protect the youth of the world from fear. However, fear is about to fight back, as the menacing Boogeyman Pitch (Jude Law) wages war against the four, tired of no one acknowledging his existence. They need extra help. That comes from newly appointed guardian, the mischievous Jack Frost (Chris Pine), who resents the idea of joining their ranks, but is eventually convinced to do it, hoping he'll find answers to his past life along the way.The main talking points I want to bring up will be divided into four sections.1. The eclectic voice cast assembled for these characters is just wonderful. All of them give just the right amount of what their characters need, fleshing them out as authentic and fully dimensional. Pine is energetic and sincere, Baldwin is virtually unrecognizable, Jackman is tough and hilarious, Fisher is sweet and funny, and Law brings just the right amount of underlying terror. As for the Sandman, he doesn't speak, but his simple expressions do all the acting he needs. I honestly love how character driven it feels.2. The way this movie looks is nothing if not breathtaking. Say what you will about the majority of Dreamworks movies, but their animation is always a highlight. The design, color palettes, and surrounding ambiance of the visited cities, and the individual worlds of the Guardians, rival some of the best production designs of any live action feature. And don't get me started on the beautiful glowing textures of the dreamsand.3. The sound is also done quite well. The sound design and mix, though not that fantastic, is professionally done, as you'd expect, but now we get to the movie's best aspect. The music heard in this movie is not only Alexandre Desplat's best score of 2012 (and one of the best scores of the year), it may very well be the best score he's ever done, plain and simple. The themes, moods, and varied orchestral flavors he brings to the table is unique all in its own.4. The story in this movie may not be anything that special, and it has been done better, but at least they manage to put a creative new spin on it. There is simply so much passion, so much creativity, and so much imagination in this movie, and considering it comes from the mind of William Joyce, such a thing shouldn't surprise me. I really admire the issues of lost identity, the longing of purpose, and of faith that the movie explores, the latter of which draws comparisons to aspects of Christianity. The balance between the action, humor, heart, and development may not always be smooth, but it does the job well enough, and it's beautifully paced.All I know is that I'd recommend this movie to anyone in a heartbeat. While it may not be Dreamworks' best movie, it's certainly one of their finest films, and one of the best animated films of the year.****1/2 / *****",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Guardians of Beliefs,"Ride of the Guardians is an enjoyable movie that adapts the mythical guardians into an action packed movie. At first, the plot can be predictable at times. But that can't stop this from having great action, nicely handled characters that share the materials of what mythical characters they are, and beautifully crafted animation. While it may not be a perfect film, I think it will be worth a watch for either Christmas or Easter if you want to watch those type of movies with the action direction. Do I consider this as the best DreamWorks movie? Not really. But I do consider this a pretty good movie for the holidays, Christmas and Easter alike.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
