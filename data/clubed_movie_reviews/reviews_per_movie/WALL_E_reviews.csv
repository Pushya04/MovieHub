Simply amazing!,"I heard mixed reviews on WALL-E, there were those who said it was magical, and those who said it was one of the most overrated movies ever. I will say I loved this movie, it is a truly beautiful movie. It could have done with being a tad longer perhaps, but essentially this is more than a movie with A List vocal talents, WALL-E has genuine heart and will definitely enchant children and any Pixar fan. All I will say is that I am sorry it took me such a long time to see it, I will admit I was differing whether I should see it or not. But I am glad I did. The animation is simply incredible, the whole film is wonderful to look at. The whole movie is done in a very sophisticated visual style, and the bright colours and sublime backgrounds were a delight to the eyes. The music is stunning, the orchestral themes are gorgeous but the song from Hello Dolly! was great and fitted in with the story well. Speaking of the story, it may seem thin to some, but it is a very simple heart warming one all the same with depth and poignancy. There are some very imaginative moments, such as the zero-gravity dance and the ride through space. The voice cast that includes Fred Willard, Sigourney Weaver and Pixar regular John Ratzenburger did an exceptional job, and all the characters were endearing. What made the movie was WALL-E himself, he has to be one of the most lovable and in-depth Pixar characters ever, and the writers create a very haunting atmosphere in the early scenes to match our little hero's isolation. All in all, brilliant, quite possibly one of the best films of 2008. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The People At PIXAR are geniuses....,"Just got back from a special sneak peek/advance screening of this movie, and I must say, Pixar continues to amaze. They just can't seem to make a bad move. Heck, they can't even make a mediocre movie. Now, I will admit, there have been a couple that I would classify as my ""least favorite"" of theirs, but even they were actually very, very good. This one, though...it just may take the cake. Ranks up there with the absolute best they have produced. Hysterical, emotional, meaningful -- this movie succeeds on every front! I am not going to get into spoilers or specific plot aspects, but I will say that I am almost definitely going to see this one again in the theater..and it will be worth every dime. Come Friday, be in line to see Wall-E. You don't want to miss it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A timeless masterpiece,"Personal Rating: 10/10 (Outstanding)I still remember just how impactful this movie was on me when I saw it as a child. The visuals, storytelling, how it made you think. And 12 years later it still stands as one of the best movies Pixar has ever made, and truly a hallmark of animated films.The start of this movie. I could watch on an indefinite loop. The emotions you feel, the bond that grows between you and a robot in the introductory minutes, is storytelling at it's finest. No words have to be spoken and yet this movie world builds better than most 2-hour-long fantasy movies where the characters don't shut up.The visuals. The visuals in this movie are stunning, the way they direct the eye, immerse you in the world, make you laugh and make you cry, a huge credit to the artists who worked on this film. And also interestingly enough, to Roger Deakins, who contributed to the first 20 minutes of the film and to the animating team, as he consulted on how to light scenes, he's quoted saying ""the natural world that we live in just isn't as well-lit as your typical animated world."" So by darkening scenes, adding shadow and cutting the number of lights used, they added a huge layer of realism to WALL-E.The story, how you learn and feel about the characters (who the majority of are robots), the music, it's all superbly done. I can't think of anything I would change. But all this alone isn't what earns it the 10/10 rating, it's the themes, the tones, the way this ""for children"" movie makes you think, that earns my full respect.For the most part, humans choose what's convenient, sacrificing privacy, health, well being, relationships and the like for that. WALL-E showed that exact point like never before. It takes effort to overcome the norm, to work towards a goal, even when it's not rainbows and peaches when one is determined they can do amazing things. Which is why the ending of this movie isn't bleak, it's inspiring. (spoilers) Humans come back to earth because of one lonesome plant. But it's enough to give them hope, and determination, to work on transforming the planet. And that was just one of the themes explored beautifully. I already know I'll be watching this movie again, and again.Thanks for reading my review.""I didn't know we had a pool!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Who says popular films can't be art? ""WALL·E"" is magical","Who says popular films are not and cannot be art? If anything is proof that popular films can be of a stunningly high quality, the beauty of the animation, writing, music, and sound design in ""WALL·E"" is it. ""WALL·E"" eclipses even Andrew Stanton's ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" in the Pixar pantheon, is perhaps Pixar's best film to date and, call me crazy as I've just seen it, a contender for the title of best animated film, period.""WALL·E"" is everything we've come to expect from Pixar and more- colorful, vibrant, imaginative, exciting, involving, beautiful, and most importantly a film with interesting, involving characters. Sure, WALL·E is adorable, and as much credit as the animators get for that, this film would be nothing without Stanton's screenplay, which features very little dialogue but is still notably intelligent and surprisingly subtle, making a refreshing change from the 'go green' campaigns we're all so used to. Does ""WALL·E"" have a message? Sure, but it's an important message and it is delivered subtly and beautifully.""WALL·E"" operates on two levels (and works spectacularly well on both). It is a majestic science fiction epic like we haven't seen in a couple of decades and it is a genuinely touching and never cheap romance. ""WALL·E"" will never get points for originality but it doesn't exactly need them because the homages to great films and figures of the past- Chaplin, Keaton, Tati, the Marx Brothers, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (this one is particularly spectacular), ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" are actually homages and not ripoffs. ""WALL·E"" is a wonderful tribute to a bygone cinematic tradition (well, two or three of them actually).The social commentary in ""WALL·E"" is sobering because it's never overbearing and most importantly because we see the world through machines, machines who feel more about Earth and life than the humans do. The depiction of humans on the ship could have been incredibly offensive, cheap, and tasteless in concept but the execution here is absolutely perfect.What is most surprising about ""WALL·E"" is how sad it is. Not even in the 'how will they get out of this, oh I feel so sorry for them' way ""Finding Nemo"", a previous Stanton effort, is, but in a truly melancholy sense. The early portion of the film maintains all the playfulness of a Jacques Tati film but also evokes a striking and powerful feeling of loneliness. It's a brilliant introduction to WALL·E, given that the rest of the film is too wacky to bother with long scenes focused entirely on character, and works beautifully with the ugly yet beautifully-rendered future Earth, a barren wasteland filled with nothing but garbage, a seriously resilient cockroach being WALL·E's only companion before EVE shows up, but I won't go into the story- it's best you see it unfold for yourself.From the entertaining shorts shown before the film to the memorable characters, locations, and animation we have come to expect, Pixar films are now event cinema, and they have outdone themselves with ""WALL·E"". This film is spectacular, majestic, touching, involving, and achingly beautiful. Most importantly, however, it is perfect entertainment. I may be saying this too soon, but I don't think I have ever seen an animated film that has satisfied me more than ""WALL·E"", and 2008 is going to have to work hard to keep this from being the top film of the year, which it most certainly is at the moment.9.5/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar does it again!,"I just returned from an advanced benefit screening of WALL*E, and I want to be careful not to spill too much regarding the movie. I had the added privilege of watching the film at Pixar, which in and of itself, was amazing.This picture is not a cartoon; it is a film. In fact, it even has the LOOK of film. One of my complaints of more recent 3-D/CG animated films (not from Pixar) is that they all seem to look the same... clean lines, crisp colors, and very ""virtual"", for lack of a better term. WALL*E transcends the typical look of CG animation, and has a true to life ""grit."" The creators at Pixar are true artists, and are indeed masters of their craft. Not only are they masters of the technology, they are masters of telling a story. WALL*E is no exception.The best way to describe the film is as a science fiction, comedy, dramatic love story. WALL*E, as a character, has dimension, personality, and heart... pretty impressive given that he is essentially a trash compactor. It is true that there is little dialogue in this feature, but I personally did not feel it detracted from the story at all.WALL*E is very much a different Pixar film from it's previous features. I will be curious to see how it is received by others, but in my opinion, I think Pixar has stayed true to itself, demonstrating a commitment to telling great stories and pushing the edge of technology to leave your jaw dropping! My most sincere compliments to Andrew Stanton, Jim Morris, John Lasseter, Ben Burtt, and all the creative forces at Pixar. Can't wait to see what the future brings...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar's still producing the best movies out there,"We went to the San Francisco Film Institute's first public screening at their campus in Emeryville. Everyone's sworn to secrecy, but for a film with little dialog, it carries more of an emotional punch and has a richer story than any live-action movie this year. The tone and style of the film is completely different for Pixar, and Disney haven't tried to override the darker thematic elements at all, making the story surprisingly three-dimensional.This will end up being the animated film of the year and I had the same 'wow' feeling as after seeing Ratatouille. Considering that animated films have always played second-fiddle to live-action, and have been aimed at kids, it's ironic that once again Pixar produces a film that rivals any live action on every level. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
An A+ for Wall-E! One of the best movies this century!,"Wall-E is the movie experience I've been looking for. I haven't seen a new film this richly entertaining, thrilling, touching and satisfying since Spider-Man 2. It is truly the finest Pixar or animated CGI film to date. I can discuss it without spoilers easily because it's one of those films, like 2001: A Space Odyssey, that exists more as a pure experience of the heart and the senses than as a collection of events that we're supposed to keep track of intellectually. Wall-E rises above that kind of unnecessary complication into the same kind of space occupied by dreams and the imagination.This film is beautifully animated, of course, to that magical Pixar point where even piles of what should be disgusting trash somehow look breathtakingly gorgeous and even fairly realistic-looking roaches look cute. But much more importantly, the heart, the emotion in this movie is unlike anything I've experienced at the cinema since Forrest Gump. Certainly my tear ducts have not welled up while watching a movie this much since then. I fell in like with the character of Wall-E when I saw the trailer. Watching the movie, I fell in love with him within about 2 minutes. Shortly after that, I fell in love with the idea of Wall-E falling in love.My previous favorite movie romance is Superman and Lois Lane in the original Superman films. The love story, or the love experience of Wall-E and Eve is perhaps the first I've seen since then that operates at and succeeds on that same level. These couples create an uncomplicated, innocent, simple, yet deep and powerful bond. They capture the experience of love at first sight, writ large. They possess an instant chemistry that tells you they belong together from the first time they see one another and makes you root for their relationship throughout the film. Wall-E and Eve share moments together of real cinematic beauty, true hilarity, frightening sadness, frustrating difficulty and delightful satisfaction. It's a testament to the level of genius at which the Pixar storytellers are operating that we feel every beat of this relationship resonate every step of the way despite the fact that the characters are robots that are not modeled off of humans and speak no more than a handful of words throughout the movie (this animated movie is refreshingly free of obvious ""guest star"" voices or any over-the-top stand-up comedians trying to upstage the movie).Just like in the first Superman films, once you care about the characters as individuals and care about their relationship, it's almost impossible for the rest of the movie not to work. You're hooked at hello. Wall-E adds all the expected complications to keep the would-be lovers from getting together most of the time. There is a truly great ""McGuffin"" that keeps the heroes and villains busy for quite a while (the item in question is something outwardly simple that ends up holding the key to something more important than anything in the world). The pacing during most of these adventures is as breakneck as anything out of the Star Wars films and the action is always staged with crystal clarity. There are several scenes of peril for Wall-E that are reminiscent of that oddly powerful sequence in Short Circuit 2 when Johnny 5 is almost killed. The filmmakers pull absolutely no punches when it comes to running your heart through the ringer over characters you care about. It probably helps that you can do a lot more physical damage to a robot character than you can to a human character while keeping a G rating and still getting the audience dramatically worried about their survival.Even on top of the action, the emotion, the visuals and the humor, Wall-E goes the extra mile into thought-provoking thematic territory. The film never hits you over the head with anything preachy and doesn't really even outright tell you what its opinions on the subjects it raises are. It also doesn't explicitly lay out explanations for everything that exists in Wall-E's world (there are no ""talking killer"" scenes and very little verbal exposition). I think the bits of ambiguity work here because they add to the sense of mystery, helplessness and alienation that most of the characters in the movie feel to some degree.There are human characters in this movie too, quite a few. I think that's necessary because if humans aren't shown in a robot world, you have to wonder what purpose were the robots designed to serve? That was a curiosity of the earlier CGI movie, Robots. Most of the humans in Wall-E aren't as developed as the robots, but I think that's because they exist more to represent the whole of humanity rather than particular individuals. We're asked to ponder the consequences of the choices they make as though the whole society was moving in that direction, not just one person. Wall-E and Eve are the heart of this movie but the humans are used to add some intellectual gravity for the audience to chew on.Other choices made in the movie might also leave room for debate, such as the integration of some live-action footage into the film. But because the movie as a whole is so audaciously stimulating and brilliantly satisfying, it's a plus that they left us with a few unresolved or unusual things to think about and question after getting off of the great emotional and visual roller-coaster experience. Wall-E truly serves up everything that I think an audience could want in a movie experience. It will be very easy for me to watch this one over and over again. It is a modern-day classic that I believe should earn a place in cinema history as the ""2001"" of CGI animated films, both of them movies of indisputable brilliance, unyielding imagination and unending entertainment.Footnote: The pre-movie short is an awesome, violent Looney Tunes/Roger Rabbit-esquire toon.

Creative Vision with Predictable Plot = Not Entirely Satisfying,"The stunning virtual world of Wall.E shows Pixar at the top of their creative graphic powers. Going over the beautiful CGI in my head, I'm still in awe of how the designers portrayed Wall.E's integrated world and their attention to detail will serve as a benchmark for years. That said, I'm less impressed by the simple and very predictable plot. Pixar/Disney married state-of-the-art visuals with a worn plot line from an early childhood fairy tale. I'm guessing the target audience for this movie is somewhere around 6th graders.

"Not only great, but a new plateau in animation","I can't say enough about how good this movie, that you probably haven't read, so I'm going to keep this short.This is the best thing out there in theater's right now, and might just be the best animated film of all time, whether you believe that or not, is your own opinion, but what Pixar has done here, can put companies like Dreamworks, Sony, and Blue sky to shame.Wall E also may go down as the most lovable character ever to grace the movie screen, I praise Ben Burtt and Andrew Stanton, and the people at Pixar for what they did, and will continue to do.This is why Pixar is the top studio in the world.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Worth watching, especially for the short!!","I just came back from seeing WALL-E with my 9-year-old son. I walked out of that theatre feeling as though I'd been hit over the head with an anvil. The message is about as subtle as a kick in the crotch, but it needs to be said and I'm just a little tired of some of the diatribes I've read that are masquerading as ""reviews"". People--it's a movie, and meant to be entertaining. If you personally are not entertained, that does not make it a bad movie, just not one that is right for you. And if the message strikes a little close to home and makes you uncomfortable, then maybe it's time to get off your backside and do something constructive about it, hmmmm? I go to the theater about three times a year at most--I end up renting most films from the shop because I don't like being pummeled with the noise that seems necessary on the big screen because people will not stop yakking away at the theatre. I really enjoyed the experience of watching WALL-E, and found myself laughing out loud repeatedly--and I enjoyed it far more than I did either the over-hyped DARK KNIGHT or INDIANA JONES AND THE LATEST PILE OF MONEY, both of which gave me sick headaches by the time I left the theatre.My summary says it all. I just about peed my pants while watching PRESTO, the short. As always, PIXAR is at its best when it's working with cartoon shorts. I haven't laughed so hard since the first time I saw FOR THE BIRDS, the short attached to MONSTERS INC.. It's a great homage to the style of Warner Brothers (you'll understand when you see it; the feel of it is pure Bugs Bunny) and if the only way I'll be able to own it one day is to buy the disc for WALL-E, I consider that a bargain.Oh, and for the record, my son, diagnosed ADHD (and currently not medicated), adored the movie, even the long stretch at the beginning when people's biggest complaint seems to be that ""nothing happens"". He was riveted to the screen the whole time. I'm not jumping on the bandwagon and claiming that this movie is some kind of cinematic masterpiece, but I felt that it was definitely worth the price of admission--and that's saying a great deal these days. Go to enjoy the quality of the animation, to be reminded of HELLO, DOLLY! (I'd forgotten about that movie--I really must rent it soon!), and, yes, to take away a message that perhaps it's time to be just a little more aware of what we're doing to our environment and where this might lead us. Rather than make excuses and attacking the message behind the movie, it might behoove us more to stop and ponder, if only for a moment, where we will be going.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"WALL-E is one of the most cutest, lovable characters Pixar ever invented!!","Not only it's Pixar's best film of all-time but it's the best movie of this year and one of the greatest imaginative, visually, moving & excellent animated films in years and surprisingly, one of the best sci-fi movies since E.T.!! Coming with high expectations, it definitely succeeded mines. It's so beautiful, moving, hilarious & sad at the same time. And for those who has been anticipating Thomas Newman's score for WALL-E, it's certainly one of his best right behind Finding Nemo in which I thought was his best score to date!

Overrated,"So yeah, this is a pretty good movie. It's something that the everyone in the family can enjoy; and is well worth the 9 bucks I paid to see it.However......this movie probably shouldn't be in the top 250, let alone top 25. It's not even Pixar's best. Both of the two Toy Stories, AND Finding Nemo are better movies! They may not surpass WALL-E in animation, but they are better, and more original stories. Even the animation doesn't leave me in awe as it does so many others on IMDb apparently. It is repetitive, and lacks style in a way. An example would be ""scared"" WALL-E (even if you haven't seen the movie, you've seen it in previews). He just shakes! That would be OK, except he does it 3 or 4 times in the movie!

An outstanding animation but boring,"I went to watch this movie with my husband and my little son. I thought this movie would be a real entertainment for me and my boy. But no longer after watching it, I felt disappointed. And my little son had no interest to watch it. The movie animation is of course very good. But the story is very boring and slow. It only tells about the wall-e and how wall-e want to be with eve. Well yes, there is a good hidden message behind this all, that human should start stop dumping too many garbage into the earth because earth would one time reach a very high toxic level that can not be tolerate by human body any more. That's why there is wall-e who has the job to tidy the garbage and make it into a tower of garbage boxes.The sound of eve calling wall-e ... wall-e ... wall-e all the time in this movie is also quite annoying.

A Most Endearing Love Story In Space...And Back,"Over the years I've become quite a sucker for Pixar movies and just love each and every one of them. While there are the states of the art animation and sound effects, the stories have heart. The characters are adorable yet real. It reminds one of those charming movies Disney used to make but Pixar films are very much a unique cinematic experience.'WALL-E' is quite unusual compared to the previous Pixar movies. There's hardly any dialogue between the two protagonists other than saying each other's name. In fact, barely a word is spoken in the entire first half hour but WALL-E and Eve's silent and playful love story is such a joy to watch. Even though of few words, both characters have strong personalities and the character development is wonderfully done.The animation is colourful and vivid. Sound effect is amazing. The robot characters are cute and charming. The score deserve special mention as it's mesmerizing and beautiful. Andrew Stanton has done a terrific job as director and co-writer. The portrayal of WALL-E's loneliness and need for love is very well done and then the change that is brought within after the entrance of Eve and his eventual determination to rescue her is effectively shown. There are many genuinely funny and creative moments and it manages to stay away from being 'just plain silly'. The story is rich with humour, action, drama and adventure.Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight do a fabulous job with the voice acting for WALL-E and Eve. John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy and Sigourney Weaver lend great support. While 'WALL-E' tells a magnificent love story it reminds us that Earth is our home and nothing can replace it. It's a joyous magical experience and another sure winner from Pixar.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
WALL-E: A Wonderful Achievement,"When it comes to animated films, Pixar are masters of the craft. Ever since their feature film debut, the magnificent 'Toy Story', the animation studio have brought us such instant classics as 'Monsters Inc.', 'The Incredibles' and 'Finding Nemo', a film which remains as one of the biggest selling DVDs of all time. Surely it's about time that they delivered us a bad film? Well, sorry to disappoint, but Pixar's 'WALL-E' is among not only their greatest work, but among the greatest animations ever produced.The film opens with some astonishing shots of a desolate, rubbish-laden, polluted Earth; a boldly dark opening for a family oriented feature. It is amidst these dystopian surroundings, however, that our hero - arguably more adorable than a basket full of puppies and kittens - is first introduced to us. WALL-E is a character of genius; combining elements of Johnny 5, Charlie Chaplin and Mr. Bean, Andrew Stanton (Director) and crew have created something that will no doubt go down in history with R2-D2 as one as the screen's most memorable machines.It is the 22nd Century, and mankind have left Earth in giant Space Cruisers waiting for the surface of their planet to finally become habitable again. 700 years have past, and WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), is the last of a group of robots left to clean up the planet. In a disturbing sequence, our hero ventures home through trash heaps laden with 'dead' WALL-E's... another sign that this is not the usually Pixar fare, but something more meaningful, more bold, more... adult in theme. And this is what the first act of the film is. WALL-E, accompanied by his pet cockroach (who, as a testament to Pixar's genius, we grow to care for just as much as the metal man himself), goes about his daily routine. It is in this mostly silent section of the film that we grow to love WALL-E. As he rumages through human garbage, finding interest in things that seem mundane to us, we discover that after all these years, this little robot has developed something that makes him seem more to us than an animated clunk of cogs and rust... a personality. His incredibly curious nature make for some of the most adorable moments depicted in film (including moments such as WALL-E meets car keys and WALL-E meets... bra). We delve further into this intriguing personality when we invited into the little guy's 'house', a storage space for all his collected junk. Whilst WALL-E watches a VCR of the musical 'Hello, Dolly!"", we see from his large, emotional eyes and clasping hands that he is, heartbreakingly, all alone on this immense world.Then, the following day, as WALL-E goes about his trash-cube-making business, something extraordinary, both to us and WALL-E, occurs. A space ship touches down on the surface, holding within it EVE, a futuristic, Ipod-resembling droid here to scout the earth for plant-life... and WALL-E's one true love (aww).This love story eventually leaps from Earth into space and onto The Axiom, an immense Space Ship on which a large number of the American population - depicted as lazy, obese, consumerist slobs - go about the same mundane routine day in, day out. Message heavy, but never preachy. In the end, through WALL-E, everyone learns the true meanings of life: Love and the relationships with those around us. Oh, and to take care of the planet, of course.Beautiful visuals, astonishing characterisation and a sequence with WALL-E and EVE floating through space that is more romantic than anything your likely to see this year, make 'WALL-E' an outstanding achievement that proudly stands among Pixar's finest work. WALL-E is a completely realised character, and one which I am sure we have not seen the last of. Although, some would argue, not as accessible as other films in the genre (some children may grow resteless during the film's earlier, dialogue-free sequences), 'WALL-E' will leave a lasting impression on cinema goers of all ages.And that is the genius of Pixar. The only studio ever to create films that are, truly, 'for all the family'.-Dan Henry, 20th July 2008",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A superb and emotional animation,"After Earth gets overwhelmed by garbage, all humans flee into space aboard the Axiom, waiting for robots to clean up the mess. Among them, Wall-E has developed a small personality, gathering objects of its interest, while doing the job it was programmed for. Meanwhile, a probe from the Axiom arrives, by the name of Eve, and starts looking for evidence of life. Together, they're about to change the fate of humanity, without even knowing the consequences of their actions.It's a movie which tries to send a message about pollution and ultimately, its effects in the upcoming future, and it does it with style. By telling the story of the two cute robots, which is without any doubt very emotional and catchy, it draws the viewer into its world, making him care about the main characters and willing or unwillingly, about the fate of future humans who inevitably decayed into human-like vegetables. It's beautifully animated, written and presented, making it an animation with class which will stay on top for many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A Nutshell Review:,"In some strange twist of Fate, the local release of recent Pixar movies always had us here twiddling our thumbs wondering when it'll finally make its way to the screens, while we hear the accolades ring from the rest of the world in marvelling at the quality that Pixar continually churns out. It's likely that the distributors want to coincide the release with the local school holidays, but frankly, the money also comes from the adult crowd, as testament to this full house in one of the largest screens downtown during a late night screening with nary a noisy kid in tow.And I may sound like a broken record, but Pixar has done it again. Quality stories with quality animation, and it kept the run time to a manageable under 100 minutes, compared to the previous offering Ratatouille, which clocked near 120 minutes (or actually felt that long). I never expected WALL·E to pack in such a strong emotional punch, not that Pixar has never animated non-living objects before (such as Cars), but there's a certain child like innocence appeal that WALL·E possesses, that makes him very charming, and very endearing to the audience.As a Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth-Class, Isaac Asimov's Robot directives has him firmly and dutifully carrying out his duties of compacting Earth's rubbish, as the last of its class on Earth to clean up the mess. Humans have now polluted the world so much that they took to Space in Star Trek inspired ship designs, to live out there while WALL·Es take over to do some massive spring cleaning. Until of course, our WALL·E becomes like The Last Man, erm, Robot on Earth with a cockroach companion, acting and emoting superbly that puts Will Smith to shame.The fantastic thing about WALL·E is that it can tell so much by so little. The first few minutes establish everything we need to know about the current world, and paints a very humanistic, soulful value to the dusty, dirty and rickety robot. He (see what I mean?) has a lot of eccentricities, and in performing his duties, develops quirks and becomes a collector (of junk) of sorts, which allows the creators to pump in plenty of sight gags and inside jokes ranging from sound effects (I swear my Apple is now a WALL·E pre-cursor) to paying homage to movies such as 2001: A Space Odessey.In essence, WALL·E is a love story in human terms, where the boy tries hard to get the girl, only to have her spurn his advances. EVE (which stands for Extraterrestial Vegetation Evaluator) is WALL·E's object of affection, who got sent to Earth as a probe for life. And my, she's a difficult one to handle, being state of the art, as well as packing a mean self-defense mechanism that makes breaking the ice really difficult. Not to mention as well, a fiery temper to boot. Which means our guy has to really try, and try hard, to break that wall down. Poor thing really, because all he wanted to do, was to hold her hand. The Beatles would have been proud.But of course you'll have to throw in tougher adversary and events to make it all the more worthwhile in WALL·E's pursuit of EVE, which spans lightyears and a plant that becomes the catalyst for their romance. A lot of the movie takes place on board The Axiom, the human ship where a vision of the future is presented, which metaphorically holds a mirror up to ourselves in our over reliance in technology that we're beginning to grow sideways, and not noticing the things that nature has in store for us, human to human communication, and the things that matter. It also has an soft environmental message and stance thrown in, but done so subtly that you wouldn't feel that it's being preachy and a turn off.I hate to admit it too that the movie turned me into a big softie, especially its clichéd finale, where you know what will happen, but yet want to second guess if the filmmakers could be so heartless with an ending that I thought would really make me shed a tear. However, it's Disney after all, and when you think of merchandise opportunities, then business sense prevails.WALL·E deserves every acclaim that it's got, and let me contribute mine too. If you have time to only watch one animated movie this year, or want to bring your kids to one, then make no mistake, WALL·E is the perfect choice, without a doubt, hands down. It makes it to my books as contender for the top 10 movies of the year. Highly recommended stuff, and the leads don't even speak much save to call out to each other!Oh, do put your bum on the seat early too, as with all Pixar features, there's always a short that preluded it, and Presto is nothing short of hilarious, and a crowd pleaser to rouse the audience into a frenzy before the main act takes over. I guess it's high time I purchase the collection of Pixar shorts available on DVD as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One of the greatest love stories ever,Simply one of the best movies ever. The love story between 2 robots is more than anything twilight has.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Heart-warming and wholesome,"Pixar's ""Wall-E"" follows the lonely robot Wall-E, destined to roam the Earth for eternity, cleaning up the mess humans left behind. Everything changes when he meets a new friend and embarks on an adventure to save mankind.Wall-E is a wholesome animated story filled with comedy and themes of loneliness, friendship, and love. It has great potential to both create a lovable, funny, entertaining, feel-good movie for the younger audience and a deeper, interesting, and analyzable movie with a deeper meaning for the older audience. I think Wall-E capitalizes on this potential to a certain extent, but not fully. After about 30-40 minutes I believe the movie loses track of the latter and fully transforms into the animated children's movie that it is advertised to be. Fair enough, maybe that is all it wants to be, but with losing track of that it also loses out on its remaining potential and loses out on a chance to achieve real greatness.In short, despite its flaws, Wall-E is a good film filled with funny moments. It is a very wholesome experience that I would recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Give Tommy Newman an Oscar!,"Another one of the Pixar greats. I didn't love this movie as a kid, mostly because of the lack of dialogue and my short attention span. As an adult, this film is breathtaking. As always with Pixar, the animation is gorgeous, the message is beautiful and the non-human characters feel the most human.While it's not the most exciting or funny film, WALL-E delivers on its premise. In an odd way it has become a comfort film and can easily put me to sleep in minutes (not in a bad way)

"Wall-E is flawless in every way. There is a strong and relevant message to be transmitted, combined with a visual of great impact and with absurdly captivating characters","The film starts in the year 2700, having as main scenario our planet, basically uninhabited. It presents itself as a large garbage dump, in which the main character of the film, Wall-e (Waste Allocation Load Lifters - Earth), works to compact and organize all this rubble, alone, since his professional companions are already spoiled. So he and his pet cockroach are the only inhabitants of that gray planet.Wall-e, like other robots, were sent to Earth by the company BNL to perform this service. Meanwhile, human beings protect themselves from all the toxicity of our planet on the Axiom space station. The plan was that they would only stay there for five years, waiting for the completion of such work to return to our planet; but they end up staying for about 700 years. To check if the Earth is already habitable, the company sends robots there, one of which is Eva (Alien Vegetation Examiner), who will fall in love with the main character (and vice versa).It takes almost 40 minutes to appear the first human called normal, in 3D animation, and what you see is that the biped race is accommodated, all obese, sitting, being served by machines, hostages of technology and the inherent vices to be always connected. Behavioral criticism is evident, and all paranoia of humans with possibilities of contamination due to the planet or even Wall E is the simple and best example of how stuck the routine of doing nothing they are. There are two demarcations that demonstrate the criticism of Stanton's script, Jim Reardon based on the argument of the director himself and Pete Docter, who is the beginning of the film, showing the planet taken from plastic, paper and dirt in general, and also the super screens that entertains and distracts obese men, who do nothing but eat and spend their time shopping or watching some silly and futile show.WALL · E has one of the most critical messages to society made in a Pixar film, perhaps on par with Up - Altas Aventuras. With a script of minimal dialogues and quite dense concepts such as ideology, axiom (which is the name of the ship), mass culture and alienation, especially in favor of the media + machines, the film puts humanity at a limit that does not seem to us like so impossible, distant, unreal. If we take away the great scope of futuristic technology that marks the feature, including in its visual and conceptual references to films of the genre such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Plant of the Apes (1968), it is possible to see its raw material in our time, from the rampant and irresponsible production of garbage, as well as pollution, fires and other environmental disasters caused by human action; from the criticism of the criticism of the media to a complete alienation through a screen or an information bulletin; unhealthy inactivity; growing consumption; the distance between generations; the greater difficulty in making and maintaining human ties.The film discreetly criticizes the methods of advertising and the impact it has on people, who begin to buy products without the slightest need. Another reflection that the film exhibits is the issue of individualism. Individualism can be considered a way to avoid the problems experienced in this period, but it causes the distance between people and generations. Today, we can see some similarities, can't we? The space between people is getting bigger and bigger. In the past, the forms of interaction were more intense. The distance is the result of the accelerated growth of cities, of mass communication vehicles that dictate rules of consumption and the use of new technologies in an unbridled way. Wall-E shows us that it is necessary to relearn how to use technology and to know how to manage time efficiently and intelligently, without leaving it dependent on us and slaves, providing more and more new spoiled generations who are more and more accustomed to having ""everything in the hand with a simple snap of the fingers, guided by immediacy and by giving more value to digital relationships than face-to-face ones.Pixar's already famous self-references and full approximation with creations from our world, such as Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics that all robots in the film obey; Stephen Hawking's voice as a building parameter for AUTO; basic models of Spanish architecture Santiago Calatrava; NASA projects and numerous references to Apple (Steve Jobs was involved in the beginning of the project and is credited with the thanks for the feature) make WALL·E a whole ocean of creativity, one of those movies that you watch with great pleasure and end the session definitely more passionate about life and cinema. There are few scientific fictions that have such a tender history and such a great civilizing greatness - starting from a text with a small number of words -, starting at a point without hope and beginning to rebuild a world; the resumption of humanity, spoiled by itself, generations before. The question that doesn't stop is: are we following the same path?And all of this becomes even more impressive when we realize that Wall-E is almost a silent film. Its first part, with harmonious and romantic photography, is marked only by the noises and sounds of a polluted and uninhabited environment. The second part, already in the Axiom nave with its strong contrast photography (in various color palettes) but predominantly sterile, has some computer voices and few human voices, but never to the point of becoming strongly relevant in the story, which is sustained by friendliness of the two protagonist robots.Director Andrew Stanton has always said in interviews that the central theme of WALL · E is love and his ability to win everything, including programming. Try to see that statement as widely as possible. From love to a romantic couple to the love of life. From robotics programming to ideological programming, both broken by the encounter of something so powerful that it can only be fully explained, in the film, by scenes from the musical Hello, Dolly! (1969), a moment of joy, love, music and dance amid loneliness and abandonment. The humanized details of WALL · E's ""home"", his pet cockroach, the little plant inside his boot and the collection of human objects such as cutlery, magic cube, K7 tape (reproducing Put On Your Sunday Clothes, It Only Takes a Moment and La Vie en Rose) among many others, amplify the contrast between the two moments of the film, from its sentimental load to its lesson in citizenship and humanitarianism. Showing some scenes with real actors - a novelty among Pixar's productions - and maintaining the very high graphic quality of its animations, the ship's division with different configuration, details, lighting and colors (simulating small spaces in Las Vegas, Shanghai, Dubai and conceptual arts made for Tomorrowland) until taken from space and Earth, the film brings us so much to pay attention, observe and absorb that only one session is not possible to check it as it should.There are several scenes that impress, especially those located in space. One in particular deserves to be highlighted: the ballet of Wall-E and Eva, when they have fun flying outside the ship. It is a magical scene, due to the precise combination of visual and emotional beauty. At this point the film has already changed its history a lot, bringing to light what happened to the humans who left the Earth. And here comes another great idea from Pixar, with a critical analysis of modern society. Again, surprising. If Wall-E could be defined with just one word, perhaps the ideal would be grace. And if the ending sounds a bit obvious and predictable, we're already sufficiently captivated by this character and his universe to come to the happy conclusion that sometimes the obvious well done is exactly what we want. And if that's not enough, then there's that beautiful sequence of end credits, a real art history class, starting with cave paintings and moving on to Atari-style digital graphics. Geniuses.Can you imagine a story capable of provoking the most varied range of reactions possible in the viewer? Well then, so is Wall-E. At the beginning the scenario causes melancholy, then arouses curiosity, then comes interest, grace, laughter, sadness, tension, magic, suspense, fear, danger, regret, surprise, humor. , passion, tears, satisfaction, guilt, remorse, enthusiasm, excitement, love. Everything is there, mixed and arranged according to the precision of the gaze of those who observe here, knowing that that second chance may be something that we ourselves are not entitled to if we continue to ignore the universe around us.Wall-E is flawless in every way. There is a strong and relevant message to be transmitted, combined with a visual of great impact and with absurdly captivating characters - Wall-E and Eva are, from now on, the best couple in modern cinema! No matter what you read, this is a story that will always provoke new reflection. First-rate entertainment, respect for our intelligence and a product that can go beyond the obvious, by dealing with simple topics with wisdom and competence. There are films that bring about changes in society, raise questions and cause controversy. This, on the other hand, takes a step forward.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
I must have been tired,"Watched Wall-E this weekend with my five year old son, an avid movie watcher. With all the hype it is hard not to go into this movie with high expectations. Yet after the first half hour of the film I did feel this was not living up to these high hopes. For me, I love the work of Brad Bird, I think it's physical and very human and clicks along at a fair pace, and although they don't make you think deeper about your life, you still have a great time watching them. As with all Pixar movies the visual work is excellent and earthy tones used on Earth are beautiful. The problem really is with the pacing and the pretty obvious plot of the story. Even my son half way through asked how long to go, and this seemed to be the general state of many of the children in the audience. I don't want to add spoilers because you're figure it out pretty quickly anyway. For me this is a date movie or even a 'chick flick' so beware parents it may be a bumpy ride. But I could have been tired!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Great,"Powerful message, great story, beautiful story, great animation. Pixar's magnum opus right with Up, Toy Story 3, and Ratatouille. Great for kids, and a nice comfort watch for adults. The characters have little dialog but that's part of the charm. It tells us about how we treat our earth and why we can't give up on our planet. The semi romance between Eve and Wall-E was really cute which is a word I hate using. Half the time in movies romance feels forced but the connection between the two makes you wish they had more of a real romance. Funny, lighthearted, feel good, and just an all around great watch for the whole family. Definitely recommended for Pixar/Animation lovers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wall E,"Wall E, originated, directed & written by Andrew Stanton & Peter Docter, was easily one of Pixar's best! Andrew Stanton shows once again that he is one of the best directors in the Pixar family, yet again making another instant CLASSIC! He incorporated so many magnificent shots, utilizing the perfect balance of slow, wide, and close up shots.The story was well told, being an innocent, yet complex rom-com, while having some great sentimental notes. Don't be fooled, even though this is technically a children's movie, there is so much adult entertainment, that the whole family will do nothing but fall in love with this film! The first act is one of the most enjoyable first acts Pixar has offered yet. Stanton & Docter started off building this grimmy world, set about 700 years from now, incorporating these two polar opposite, but super charming and enjoyable robots in Wall E & EVE. Their chemistry and charm is what drove this film! With the first half started off with a bang, come the second half, it gets taken to a whole other level! This is where Wall E & EVE get their defining moments, with greatly placed action.Wall E, voiced by Ben Burtt was one of Pixar's most lovable protagonist, though having this rusty, ruggid look, and not having much to say. His humanized traits, curiosity, and pure charm is what made his character so lovable. EVE, voiced by Elissa Knight, was a very intelligent robot solider, that turns out to have great character development. She basically steals the main protagonist label from Wall E, though sharing the wealth very generously. Stanton & Docter somewhat refrained from giving us true back stories to our main characters, but in return, they gave us good information to be able to infer where they comes from.The screenplay didn't have much importance in the first thirty-five minutes or so, but come the second, and mainly the third act, Pete Docter & Andrew Stanton put together a well thought-out, passionate script, incorporating a lot of heart.The cinematography and animation was absolutely GORGEOUS! The back drops were so deatiled and vibrant, really mashing well with the vibrant colors, and color contrast. The animations were stunning as always, with realistic detail in the metals, dirt, rocks, and everything in between.The score by the very popular Thomas Newman, was very dramatic, and created this great connection between the audience and the characters. The music was a pretty good touch, really coming alive in the third act.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"The Lion king is to Disney, as Wall-E is to Pixar! Amazing film!","I highly recommend people to watch this film. It doesn't matter what your age is. This film is appropriate for everyone. It is a cute,enjoyable,fun movie. It is just great. Many people can relate to this film. Because WALL-E is kind of like an underdog, we all cheer for him. :) This movie shows us very important advice to never give up! The music in this movie was very sad. Overall I love this movie, it has so much going for it. You won''t be disappointed. So I had to give this movie a 10/10, I liked this movie more than other previous Animated movies like the Lion King. For kids, this movie is enjoyable and cute. For adults/teens it is much more than that! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"No dialogue, No big name actors, no modern music","No problem! Finally an animated movie that dares to be.... animated! Pixar has set a new standard in digital animation. I say digital, because I'd still like to see more traditional hand drawn films. You don't need recognizable voices coming out of animals that resemble them. You don't need cheesy jokes or failed one liners. No musical cues to band either. I don't think I'll be able to watch a computer animated movie for a long time, I'll compare to this for a while. Pixar was not in this for the cheap quick cash in, they made a movie, that I think, will stand the test of time. I can tell people will be watching this for years and years, like Fantasia.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Thank you, Pixar!!","DO NOT listen to those who say this is a bad movie because there's hardly any dialog. Everything in this movie is so perfect, it doesn't NEED dialog!! The animation was so REAL. Everything was perfect!! The landscapes were beautiful, the technology was creative, smooth, and incredibly flawless, the robots were great! I thought it was interesting how real humans were used in small parts of the movie, and the humans in the future were animated, shown as really large, lazy people we may become in the future, if we're not careful. As soon as the movie started, I fell in love with Wall-e. He was possible the most adorable thing I have ever seen! His character was so deep, you could forget he's not human. Wall-e has the biggest heart of any of the characters I've seen. You have to be insane to not love Wall-e. I really enjoyed seeing the chemistry develop between EVE and Wall-e. They are so different, EVE being a fast, powerful, advanced robot, and Wall-e being a sweet, simple, rusty little trash-compacting robot, and they work together PERFECTLY!!! They are the cutest couple in Pixar history. The messages in the story were very well-presented. It showed what could happen to our planet if we trashed it and took it for granted and what could happen if we all get too lazy. The perfect combination of humor, CGI, heart, and lessons to be learned, this is truly a Pixar triumph.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar fan with a mixed review,"It must be said I'm a big fan of Pixar films...and this film has all the elements you'd expect from their films including Amazing 3D animation and effects and high quality production values.From the beginning scenes you are transported to the film world they create. There's humor, intrigue, anticipation...and for children no doubt...some moments that may be a bit scary.The story is cute...but it doesn't contain many surprises.The characters designs were Pixar's biggest roadblock to giving a heart to this film. For example, the title character has virtually no facial expression except for movement to it's eyes. The animators were able to put some expression into Wall-E's ""body"" movements...but again this was very limited by Wall-E's mechanical, metal body. Wall-E speaks in a ""computerized"" voice that even further limits his expression.EVE, the other lead character, is even more limited, with expression mostly conveyed though very simple LED eyes and no other facial features. Her body is somewhat rigid and her arms are joint less and she has no legs...so most of her personality comes through her computerized voice.Wall-E has an insect companion...again with no facial expression so again all of its ""expression"" is conveyed through its body language and movement.This design concept is repeated with all the other mechanical characters in the film.The 3D human characters, especially later in the film, are identical clones of each other with very little differences allowing you to tell one character from another. At this point, except for one, they all even wear the same clothes.If Pixar was trying to tie its own hands...and make it as difficult to create endearing characters for an audience to connect to...they did an excellent job.The children sitting behind me sat quietly through-out the film and at the end they lightly applauded.So while this film is up to Pixar's usual impeccable production and animation standards...the story and characters held it down for me.Pixar's short feature before the film was very enjoyable with lots of heart and laughs...and may make this a DVD worth adding to my collection some day.Sorry Pixar...I'd still work for you any day!!!! : )",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Seriously, Pixar can do no wrong","In the distant future, the Earth has been an inhabitable wasteland and humans are now living in artificial environments in space and left to clean the trash are waste disposal robots named WALL·E. Almost 700 years later - 2815 to be exact - only one WALL·E (voice created by the film's sound designer Ben Burtt) remains functional and it begins to show signs of sentience and emotions, longing for someone to share a romantic touch with.Enter EVE (Elissa Knight), a feminine-like probing unit sent to Earth by Axiom, one of the human cargoes in space. WALL·E falls in love with Eve, and this sets for an adventure in space.Much has been said about how the film lacks dialog for the first hour and relies solely on gestures and emotions shown by the robots. It's also grimmer than previous Pixar films and save for a cockroach, WALL·E does a Will Smith in the first few minutes of the film, interacting with no one but his environment. Sounds like a turnoff especially for the little ones but director Andrew Stanton shows enough resourcefulness to use what's on screen to produce a more emotionally resonant and believable spark (pardon the pun) between the two robots than most real-life actors could ever dream of grasping.Serving also as some sort of a cautionary tale about human's role in preserving our environment, the film does so in a subtle and amusing manner without resorting to the mawkish approach that's prevalent in other otherwise well-meaning-ed films. As usual of Pixar, the quality of animation is superb, which is, really, just a cherry on top of the cake.Inasmuch as I hate to sound like a fanboy who will throw superlatives on just about anything Pixar churns out, I have to say that the geniuses behind the animation studio have done it again - create a movie that's not only magnificent to look at, but with a soul as well to back it up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Very Disappointing,"I don't know if I would have liked this movie better if my expectations weren't so high.I agree with those critics who say the first half hour, which contained so little dialogue, was excellent. However, in the remainder of the movie, the animation got in the way of the story. The animation was stunning, but it was also distracting. In Ratatouille and Toy Story 2, the story drove the movie, and although the animation was great, it wasn't so overwhelming that it interfered.I recently took my granddaughter to see Kung Fu Panda, which was not as well animated but overall was much more enjoyable. The greatness of the animation can detract from the greatness of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"A wonderful, WONDERFUL movie.","I just returned from a midnight showing of WALL-E, and all I can say is 'amazing'. Pixar have clearly outdone themselves, producing what is sure to be one of their best films ever. All the characters have personality, and there are no throwaway characters. Every character that is introduced in the story has their own unique personality, and it really shows how hard Pixar worked on the movie.The movie serves as both a sci-fi futuristic love comedy, and also a warning to humanity. We've got to take care of our planet now, because as charming as the movie was, I personally would not like to see those events transpire here, 700 years in the future or any other time.I would give this movie an 11 if I could. It is an absolutely brilliant piece of cinema and one that should not be missed. If you're a parent, take your kids. Even if you don't have kids, go see this movie, it's fun and lighthearted and will make you laugh out loud several times over.A+ Pixar, I can't wait to see what they cock up next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Not 100% Perfect, But One of The Best Films I Have Ever Seen","I join the gushing majority and say this is one amazingly done, very touching and important film.1. A Masterpiece of Computer Graphics & Story TellingWhen computers were still in training pants 25 years ago, I studied, worked with and taught computer graphics. I've often watched an animated film (or live film with injected animation) with knowing appreciation at some use of or advance in computer graphics technology.I have a friend who had been involved managing computer graphics projects for some of the previous Star Wars movies. We have previously discussed the ""state of the art"" and where it's going. The surprise to me in this film wasn't that they could do graphics of this quality now. It was amazement at the scope, effort, skill and creative genius I know it takes to make something so beautiful and moving.Watching the film, my feelings went from astonishment at the graphics to deep empathy and feeling for the main characters. The people around me gasped and say ""wow"" just the same. You don't need experience or friends like mine to tell you that nothing else has come this close to looking so real and gorgeous, to feel so visceral and well-crafted.The use of modern live-action cinematic effects is stunning beyond words. The film's reliance on the intelligence of children and adults to understand the serious thoughts and complex emotions being conveyed, well, is just simply an amazing and reassuring experience. And I thought the closing credit art (using different styles of famous artists) was very cool too.2. Some Small Nitpicks:Most of the time I felt I was watching an exceptionally crafted film with a tight story and a serious message about the current problems of and future prospects for Earth. An then something would happen in the film that would be, like, ""Huh? That doesn't quite make sense or follow, but it's just animation"". I found 2-3 moments where I was shifted from sobering reality to forgivable fantasy, and it was a bit jarring and distracting But these moments can be easily forgotten with the continuation of the next amazing scene.It looks like the quality (time, money, computer horse-power)spent on the main characters is much more than what was spent on depicting the humans. Heck, even the garbage get's more realistic treatment than the people. And then there is the live video of Scott Willard as the ""Executive in Chief"" talking to the planet....The styles don't mesh well for me. I appreciate the thought-line that the humans look more cartoon because of the surreal and clueless nature of their existence on the ship, as well as our inept and greedy custodianship of the planet. I can imagine that the live video is meant to help connect children with the cartoon-nature of certain government officials and the patronizing policies they always on display these days on the evening news. Maybe this is all true, but it's probably also a way to rationalize a limited budget and time schedule. The bottom-line for me that the discrepancies between the treatments didn't work that well for me.Most of the time the characters are so extremely cute and lovable, it's a complement to their creators. But sometimes the cultural cliché's and visual slapstick are a bit much. Overall, it all adds up to a very sweet and moving film, but just a little less ""shtick"" would have been fine by me.Some thoughts on other reviews I've read here:Is the Message Too Heavy-Handed? I don't think so. It's mainly aimed at small kids. They get it, and they take it to heart. Maybe the question should be ""is the message loud enough?"" We earthlings still don't seem to be getting the message. Last I checked, we were still busy polluting the air, water, soil and every life form on the planet...oh, and ruining our climate also. We are feeding our families and enjoying ourselves, but sorry we are each helping to destroy the planet along the way. ""Oh well. It's not like I can make a difference"". Let's just leave the problem for the kids. Good luck kids! Do you think mom and dad are making ""good choices?""It's a moment of truth for us. Are we up to it? Are we truly awake yet and smelling the rising levels of toxicity in our environment? Maybe the message was said softer people would get it more?Regarding those people who have posted negatively, that they couldn't connect, and even thought of walking out...everyone is absolutely entitled to their opinion and to state it. But, gosh, If this film didn't make them gasp at beauty, smile warmly, laugh knowingly...if it didn't put a lump in your throat or make an eye or two teary, then...that's just sad, and even a bit scary.If you haven't seen this film yet, run and see it on the big screen while you can. I think you will enjoy taking some kids. You will see them enthralled and fully-attuned to the message. It's a good thing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Persoanlly romantic picturesque picture,"The cleaning of earth has been left to sentimental robot Wall-E and when EVE visits the planet looking for plant life Wall-E's love takes him into space where mankind live.Described as Pixar's 'biggest gamble' this 2008 animation showcases a near speechless adventure in time and space, being both constantly humorous and breathtaking in its approach to get a message of human destruction across.Any viewer of any age or gender will find their own interpretation of exploration and personal meaning in this picture which, nominated for numerous Oscars, inevitably winning best animated picture, has countless reasons to view.For uniqueness this is one hat proudly sits on top of the pile. An animation showcasing humans destroying themselves and earth this has a strong encoded message specifically designed to shock other animations.Apart from Warner Brothers terribly awkward Happy Feet there has been little in animation genre to say a great deal about the earth's natural wellbeing. Even that paper thin plot crammed it in to the last twenty minutes whereas here everything is thought of and built around. The shot as the spaceship takes off from earth into the rubble surrounding it is brilliant. The nature of Wall-e himself is to clean up earth's wastage. The point of EVE is to salvage a rescue attempt. Bearing in mind this film has so little dialogue this is a remarkable achievement to get across. It is told through movements through actions and the saying ""actions speak louder than words"" is more than recognizable in this picture.Wall-e a lovable appearing robot becomes infatuated with EVE when she arrives on earth and the time the two spend together is heart-warmingly sentimental. When EVE goes into sleep mode that actions Wall-e takes to revive her are adorable, and not in a cheesy way. His holding the umbrella, the sunset picturesque montage, the trip in the boat all demonstrate a kindness and typically romantic conceptual motives for a character who has been alone for such a long time.The character development of the central protagonist plays a pivotal role in the emotional core of this film. Wall-e, a robot, has over the years developed a human personality, collecting items that mean something, caring for insects and greeting people and machines and becoming friends. And the contradictory in humans is remarkable. Like today's modern stereotype, we are obsessed with technology and food, which in this picture leads to our demise, sitting in chairs and having everything on a plate for us.The score for this picture is truly excellent also, having intertextuality from 2001 and Hello Dolly allow us to be brought into the moment and dare I say such a claim, the finest score Pixar have generated? Pixar get better with every outing and Up! was a marvellous showcase of adventure and love which just topped his outing and yet this is still one of the finest animations you will ever see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
PIXAR does it again,"The world is one giant garbage heap. Humanity under BnL Corp has taken off on giant cruise spaceships for a 5 year tour but they have been gone for much longer. Meanwhile they have left garbage collecting robots like WALL·E to clean up the earth. It spends it's days packing garbage into cubes. Then one day, an advanced robot EVE is dropped off to do reconnaissance. EVE collects samples and blasts everything that moves. When WALL-E shows EVE a plant, her mission is complete and she is retrieved by a spaceship. WALL-E follows EVE and grabs a ride back to cruise ship. It finds the human race are now chubby blobs who are always eating and sitting on their floating chairs.This is a cute movie. There is no dialog with the robots. The use of robotic beeps and tones create their voices. It's as much fun as any of the best silent movies staring Chaplin or Keaton. Most of the movie takes place without human dialog. It is imaginative and original. It is another one of the amazing offerings from PIXAR.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"WALL-E:  Turning Hearts To Liquid, Bursting Preconceptions To Dust","My reaction to the early TV trailers for WALL-E was ""ok, another Pixar movie. No biggie."" Consider, though I've seen almost every Pixar movie (girlfriend renting them on DVD) my reactions ranged from ""mildly amused"" to ""cute, but mostly CGI eye-candy"". Of course, as a thirty-something male, I never assumed Pixar movies were targeted to my demographic in the first place. ""Pixar is for kids"", after all, right? Then one day a 5-minute sneak peak was shown on TV featuring WALL-E and Eve (scene where he gets stuck in space capsule with plant). During those 5 minutes, the essence of WALL-E's character took hold and never let go. My girlfriend and I decided we wouldn't be able to wait any longer than opening day to see it. Embarrassing to admit, but I go the theater twice in a year at most, and yet I actually bought our WALL-E tickets 2 weeks in advance.Having seen the movie today, he's honestly no less than the most adorable and brilliant animated character of all time. His personality and mannerisms spread themselves like sunlight - turning even the coldest of hearts to liquid, and bursting preconceptions to dust. Until now, no character (fictional or otherwise) ever managed to awaken the kid in me with the old notion ""I wish this character was real so I could take it home with me"".The way this movie ends is the same way it begins: at the core it's all about WALL-E and the things we recognize in him as inherently human: his funny personality, his compulsion toward the good, his child-like curiosity and naivety, his sense of loneliness that he tries (and fails) at anesthetizing with psychological comforts and companion place-holders. All of the film's characters other than WALL-E are really just props, like arrows pointing your attention back at him, and always when it's the last thing he would want. His plant also seems symbolic of him (and that will make sense after you've seen the movie).All that aside, the graphics are brilliant, especially the WALL-E character, in that it looks like a real physical robot shot on film. Great care was taken on subtleties like focus/defocus and depth perception to make him look real-world, all *within* a real-world (especially the scenes during which he's alone on earth).I wish it would've been longer, but only because like all great rides, it went by fast and eventually had to have an end. Can't wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Brilliant beginning somewhat spoiled by the reality it alludes to,"I was ready to be wowed by this film and the first 20 minutes or so were ecstatic for me. Sometimes I think there's no comparison between Japanese anime and the stuff Hollywood puts out, but this was clearly inspired and ingenious film making that can hold its own against Japan's best. But then the film has trouble dealing with the problems it poses, not unlike how we're failing to deal with the REAL problems of over consumption and the mindless accumulation of waste that it alludes to. The setting changes and the story takes a rather depressing turn into frenetic activity that made me anxious to see it over. It's not that the film's point is misguided or even over sold. It's just that it's a different issue and not necessarily a consequence of the first more successfully contrived part. That second issue is our becoming overly serviced by robots in a blind pursuit of entertainment and sensation. Still, the creation of a robot with a completely engaging personality is so brilliant and indelible that no one should miss this somewhat mixed film. Clearly the people who made this have their head's on straight and have a better vision of what could result from our culture than some of our most highly respected leaders.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Destined to be a classic,"The odd title is actually an acronym: Waste Allocation Lift Loader, Earth-Class. This little robot unit is the last of a series originally intended to clean up a massively polluted Earth while humankind left the planet for a temporary five years which, after the failure of the project, has resulted in an absence of 700 years. The pacing and atmosphere of the movie would be remarkable for any work, let alone one of animation, with a long opening scene with little action and no dialogue. Even when another robot EVE arrives from outer space and a technical romance ensues, the dialogue is minimalist but the action accelerates at a exciting and satisfying pace.Pixar have here given us outstanding work and Andrew Stanton, who conceived the story and directed the film, deserves special praise. The film is entertaining with action, humour and great visuals, but its is also subtly instructive with clear messages about the damage to the planet and to our bodies from our adoration of consumerism, making it appealing to children and adults alike. Many science fiction classics - from ""2001"" to ""Silent Running"" - are referenced, but the treatment is so original that ""WALL·E"" itself is destined to be a classic.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Expected more - don't believe the hype!!,"As an analogy, this is a TV dinner.You know what you're getting, you know that it will - to a point - satisfy you, yet - just like a TV dinner you'll feel ripped off, hungry for more yet with a sense of regret. You'll come away wishing that you saved up for steak instead.Make no mistake - this isn't a ""Toy Story"" - this isn't a ""Nemo"". The first hour of the movie with little story, few comical moments and NOT A SINGLE LINE OF SPOKEN DIALOGUE, will no doubt leave you questioning the target audience of the movie.Whereas other Pixar/Dreamworks movies will always claim a $15-$20 DVD purchase fee I suspect that Wall-E will sadly eventually become a budget offering in the bargain bin. It has little content for the younger generation and the curdling environmental message leaves little desire to put myself through it's agonizing 90 minutes ever again.What started off as an original offering soon ended up being a ""wannabe classic"" - they tried too hard, or maybe they didn't even try at all.. either way, it just simply doesn't work.Disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
They did it again,"Apart from Cars (which as I heard will get a sequel, surprisingly for me at least), every movie Pixar made until this point in time, was at least excellent, imho. And even Cars, was still pretty good, just never hit as high, as the other ones did. WALL-E is proof yet again, that there is only one true animation champ!Yes there are other good, funny animated movies, from other studios, but only Pixar has a strong enough story to mix with all the little jokes. Only they can appeal to a young audience and a mature one. Wall-E seems like a strange idea. Something that might not get you emotional involved (the main characters are derived of many facial expressions, due to the fact, that they are robots and are lacking some facial similarity to a human being. Yes there are the eyes, but many other things are absent. Not that you would want to have it any other way. The movie is pretty silent (especially in the first part of the movie), but you still get attached to this robot being.There are many in-jokes for the mature audience, a message delivered with the right notes and many other funny things, that makes WALL-E one of the best movies. Not only in 2008, but overall.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
overrated,"This is a decent movie, a fun watch for the whole family but it is vastly overrated. I have not seen anything so original about it, it is full of clichés and it is very predictable. It is not fun as other Pixar movies, it is supposed to be ""deep"" instead, but I just don't buy it. The love of Wall-e for the female robot feels unnatural and unreal. The producers' effort to depict a ""cute speechless love"" was largely successful for most of the people, but I find it pretentious. Well, that is me, though. There is a good chance you will like this movie a lot.Still, this is the best animated movie ever? According to IMDb Top 250 it is. No, freaking way! It might barely make Top 20.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Thoughtful and Kind,"I was skeptical when I heard that this was a movie about machines falling in love. This kind of thing has been done before and has left me cold. This movie, however, takes a character who has endured in his lot, a romantic robot at that, and gives him a chance to realize his dreams. He has learned about love from watching a dull old Disney-like musical. One of those forgettable things that children hated, but were frequently brought to by their parents. He has established himself a sentient being with a loving soul. One day a slick rocket ship drops a probe into his garbage infested landscape. It is a porcelain-like, egg shaped beauty with deadly capabilities needed for self-preservation. This critter is egg shaped, unlike Wall-e's dumpy presence. He falls in love with her (she is definitely quite feminine. Like all desperate males, he does what he can to impress her, almost at the expense of his existence. The other interesting aspect of this film is the human element. Humanity has devolved into fat, slovenly lumps, with no thoughts or ambitions. When Wall-e shows up in their spaceship, he throws a wrench into the works. This little commentary is inadequate. Mainly, I found the whole thing quite charming and the evolving love affair believable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Absolutely Stunning B-D Visuals & Audio,"Boy, the visuals were as stunning as I had read they were; absolutely spectacular. I hate to use this cliché, but this is a ""must"" for Blu-Ray fans. You have to see - and hear - this film in HD because it is a great treat for your senses. The surround sounds are everywhere while the colors and artwork are something to behold! And, yes - it's still very pretty on a regular DVD, too.The story is ""cute,"" but nowhere near the visuals and audio. It's okay, subtlety humorous, dramatic and romantic parts. It gets a tiny bit preachy with the usual environmental digs and a comment about how fat we humans can get by lying around too much, but otherwise just plays it for comedy and cool-looking characters. Everyone and everything in this film is pretty amazing-looking.It's kind of a strange story, with much of it taking place on a big space ship. My favorite parts were in the beginning on Earth with the little robot WALL-E and his cockroach friend.There is so much to see in this film, it makes multiple viewings all the more attractive but, I'll assume, you're always going to catch some things you didn't see the first few times. Overall, not a super story but yet an amazing film, one that is one you want to show off your Blu-Ray DVD player to friends.

The Certainty of Seeing,"You can read elsewhere the ordinary stuff  about how wonderful this is; about how it exploits cinematic characterization, and even how conservative bloggers have decided to criticize it supposedly leftist premise. (Jees)I did enjoy it. Its an amazing experience. But while watching it, I also was admiring the minds behind it.There are sometimes intelligent movies being made, and a surprising number of them are from Hollywood. I believe though that in most cases, it is because there is a critical mass of intelligent writers, filmmakers and decisionmakers that are working at the fringe of the establishment. Not so with Pixar. I've been constantly surprised at each project how they encapsulate essays in the advance of the cinematic vocabulary.Its a bit like French new wave films made by film theorists, the films being more about what can be done than doing it in the service of effect that matters. (Their retort would be that it DOES matter if it changes the vehicle.)But this Pixar business is a different model. Folks can come and be entertained without having to dip into vats of self-reference. Oh, there's plenty of superficial self-reference, but its all in the service of jokes, and they are all in the service of the narrative.But other folks  like me and perhaps you  can also see that they are doing a few things that no one else is in quite the same advanced way, and they mark them so that you can read it as a sort of metanarrative. Jobs does the same thing with Apple. They make products that people use and like. But they also are in the business of defining what it is to be cool. They manufacture cool like they manufacture electronic products. You get both, and even in the products there's a reference to leadership, because being cool is all in who defines cool.So when I saw this, I saw self-conscious art, and stories about the future of cinema. We've always gotten that with Pixar. Usually, it has to do with space, and what you can do with this new medium that is impossible with ""real"" cameras and places.This last movie, ""Ratatouie"" added in the notion of control. Pulling the strings. I'm sure many have noticed that the shorts that Pixar creates to play before these features are a sort of synopsis of the reflective ideas they will use in the film. Last time the short and film were about control at a distance, with both the puppetmaster and puppet being featured, but the star was the puppetmaster. You can almost see how the whole story could have been generated by this idea: chef, French (who claim to have invented folded cinema of the reflexive kind), and rat. Secret recipes. Love always.This time around, the cinematic sensibilities are profoundly deeper. A deep certainty. You have to know about 2001 as a start. Kubric's interest there was the warring narrator. Whose world is telling the story, man, machine or god. There is a story, but it hardly matters. Its all about who is telling the story, whose chair you sit in as the viewer. Its a masterful work.Here, its bent only a little: mankind, machine and nature, but its folded back on the story  which here has effect. Wall-e is natural, machine in form, but more human than the humans we see. But watch how they fold it again. Its a movie about the truth in movies, how the power of cinema can reach into the real world. A handholding there and here is a handhold between the worlds.And also watch how they built movies in. This isn't accidental. When they put a movie within a movie like this, the intent is to have the watcher of the outer movie join the world of the watcher of the inner movie. Its a reliable trick to get us to invest in what we see. But they go further. When we see the humans  who are supposed to be like us but clearly aren't  we note that THEY are hypnotized by the movies in front of them and cannot see the larger world beyond, and we can.It happens to also spill over into the great narrative about how some of us can see that the planet is being destroyed and other blithely putter on. That business about saving image- laden artifacts as a memory storehouse... All these layers  yes they are engineered by what is now the most intelligent and adventuresome narrative engineering lab in a studio.All this extra introspection is used not as dry thesis, but in the service of the love story. It made it deeper, and more true. Knowing makes love true. So yes, it is effective, and fun, and deep.To compensate, the camera and space manipulation is less radical than usual.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wow !!!,"Pixar and Disney have done it again! This is an historic piece of film-making and an example of what can happen when a studio like Pixar continually refuses to compromise making the best film possible....every time...and we're talking nine times now in a row!!! This movie works as kid's movie, a science fiction film, a romantic comedy, and for much of it...a silent film. It had a great message but was not preachy. It had stunning visuals throughout. My expectations were so high for this film...and yet they were far exceeded by the geniuses at Pixar...I don't know how they do it.

The most charming cartoon I've ever seen.  Nearly perfect in every way!,"My favorite animated movie was, and still is The Nightmare Before Christmas, but Wall-E comes in at close second. Pixar outdid themselves in every possible way, and it seems that though they've done that with each of their films, this one stands above the others. It's cute, without those lame sappy moments that cause you to uncomfortably stare at the floor. It's emotional, with some scenes even leaving a lump in my throat. The animation is amazing and the story is both inventive and original (for the most part). Wall-E is the quintessential Pixar film...no, it's the quintessential animated movie.Wall-E (or Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth class) is a lonely robot on futuristic Earth. The year is around 2800 and all the humans have ""temporarily"" been taken off of Earth into a space cruise where they are awaiting Earth to be cleaned up. Wall-E's only friend is a cockroach, and he lives in a little storage shelter where he keeps interesting items he finds in the trash he compacts. One day a spaceship drops off another robot, this one named EVE. Her mission is to find plant life on Earth, which would signal that the humans can return. Wall-E is fascinated by EVE, and more than anything just wants to hold her hand, like in his favorite musical, Hello Dolly. EVE sees a plant that Wall-E had previously found, and they both end up being taken up into space on the space cruise ship. All the humans on board have lost track of reality, don't walk or do any exercise, and they are all morbidly obese. Wall-E and EVE end up having to save the plant life they brought up to show to the ship's captain so they can go back to Earth, but the ship computer doesn't like that idea.I have no critiques for this film. As I've said, this is about as close to perfect as you can come, I'll just explain what I really liked. I enjoyed the romance between Wall-E and EVE, which was so sweet, sort of sad at times, and more real than the typical teen comedy romance. The human characters were great. Jeff Garlin plays the ship captain and does an excellent job. One of the best scenes in the movie has the captain studying up on Earth wide eyed, learning all the things humans (now adays) have known since we were infants. John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy voice two humans who face reality before the others and get off their fat rears to have some fun and take a moment to notice the stars. The animation is the best Pixar's ever done, and even with the cartoonish designs of the characters, sometimes I'd forget I was watching a cartoon. Wall-E, as a character, was an amazing lead. Amazing in that he carried the movie flawlessly, and made me truly feel for the poor guy, and amazing in that the only thing that he says in the movie, along with some grunts and squeals, is ""EVE-a!"". I have no clue how Pixar molds these likable characters, but they did a fantastic job. I'd see it 10 more times in the theaters, and I hope it makes a billion at the box office.Pixar's done it again! They hit gold, more so than any of their other pictures, and Wall-E ranks up there with one of the best animated pictures of all time. It was the first film in months to leave me 100% satisfied. I loved it!My rating: **** out of ****. 100 mins. Rated G.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Not nearly as good as the ratings say,"i went to go see the movie after logging on to IMDb and seeing a 9+ rating, but was very disappointed with the actual movie. The movie started out slow and didn't pick up till nearly half an hour in and even then it still wasn't very good. It didn't get reasonably descent till about halfway into it+. I thought the story was very common and the only real modification to it was that it was set 700 years in the future and the main characters were robots. However i will say that the animations were spectacular and at times you forget that it is in fact animation. not a horrible conclusion, but it is definitely not a 9+ movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Film making at it's best,It is a extremely rare thing to see true beauty in movie. When it does occur only a foolish person would fail to delight in the pure joy of the moment. That Wall-E contains several such moments is a testament to the continuing brilliance of Pixar.The story is a simple one but the execution is breathtaking. It is ironic that the most genuine characters to emerge from a movie in years are in fact computer generated robots. Without saying more than two words to each other WALL-E and EVE convey subject and emotion with a subtlety that only serves to enhance the meaning.Watch this movie and revel in its majesty.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A few notches below earlier Pixars,"I wish I could say that this movie was on par with earlier Pixar movies, but I just can't. The animation isn't bad, it's just that unlike the undersea world in Finding Memo or the toy chest in Toy Story, there's just nothing pretty to look at for large chunks of time. And because the main characters are robots who don't exactly speak English well, the movie depends rather heavily on two things: the visual landscape and the nonlinguistic communication of the metal duo. As a result, the movie isn't quite as charming or self-effacing as its predecessors, but it's still amiable and heartwarming when it needs to be.WALL-E is the last remaining robot on Earth. See, the place got so polluted that everyone had to zoom off to ships in outer space just to survive; the plan is to let the WALL-E units compact and store all the garbage, and when life can be sustainable again, the humans will return. This was 700 years ago. And every day, WALL-E compacts trash (all the other units have broken down), blissfully un-self-aware. The humans send down probes to determine if life can return to the planet, and that's when our WALL-E meets EVE, who's quite a bit more advanced and intelligent than WALL-E.WALL-E is adorable. He looks quite a bit like Johnny 5 from the Short Circuit films, and he's about as smart and curious. As he collects and compacts trash, he grabs various items that seem interesting to him and stores them in his storage crate. But although he's been at it for centuries, his world's turned upside down when Eve the probe arrives on Earth in search of plant life. Wouldn't you know it, our inquisitive little toaster falls in love at first sight with the sleek Eve, who looks sort of like a giant toe (her visor would be the toe nail - try to stay with me on this).On Earth, although the atmosphere is lighthearted and full of hope, the scenery (and hence the overall look and feel of the movie) is downbeat and gloomy; everything's washed out in a sea of brown and gray. The planet's a wasteland, you see, along the lines of the postapocalyptic horror of Mad Max.But once we leave the planet and land on the ship Avion, things perk up. Here, everything's red or blue (the colors in the BuyNLarge logo - that's the conglomerate that owned, like, everything on the planet and that now owns and operates the deep-space ships. You should see these places - the whole idea is that the humans will never have to lift a finger. Robots wake them up. They're dumped onto these motorized recliners that whisk them everywhere. They shop and drink milkshakes from their recliners. They literally never move. So of course they're all tremendously overweight.Can WALL-E and Eve help bring life back to Earth? It's a Disney/Pixar film, so you probably already know the answer, and if you thought about it for a second, you could probably map out how the movie would shake out. But one thing you might not realize is that for a G-rated movie, there's a lot of tense, scary-toned scenes. There are several moments when you're led to believe something incredibly awful has happened to WALL-E, and unlike in its cartoon progenitors there's a perceptible delay before it's revealed he's okay - long enough for you to wonder if, indeed, he is.So I was a little surprised to find out this was a G-rated movie. Aside from the desolate, acrid, lifeless landscape of Earth, there are plenty of robot-in-peril scenes, sequences that seem more action-movie-like than cartoonish. This is partly because Pixar's animation is so advanced now that WALL-E looks and behaves exactly as you'd expect a robot in real life would. Which brought me to this question: Why even make an animated movie about robots? It's not as if you're giving human qualities to, say, a fish or a stuffed animal; you're anthropomorphizing something that's already been given human qualities.In short, WALL-E lacked the amazing, imaginative premise and theme that earlier classics had. I wasn't bowled over by the animation, and I just wasn't terribly impressed with the execution. WALL-E is not a bad movie by any means, but it suffers by comparison with its own ancestors. In the end, it's done in by its subject matter (not conducive to gorgeous animation), its setting (vast, colorless), and its penchant for robot-in-peril scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
We almost walked out,"We attended as a middle age couple and our teenage son. None of us enjoyed the movie much at all and we probably would have walked out if we had communicated better in the theater about how hard it was to sit through.Unlike previous Pixar films, which we have all enjoyed immensely, this was an extremely linear and slow moving story. There was little of the two levels of story for young and old that you see in other Pixar stories.The small children all around us in the theater seemed as bored by it all as we were.Particularly distracting was the one human character. It offended my animation sensibility for him to appear when that was totally unnecessary.Oh well, I've got to get back to my cupcake in a cup.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wall-E is A-dorable,"I saw Wall-E at a special sneak preview. I'm not a Pixar fanboy. I've enjoyed a number of their movies, but this is first I've seen at the theater.Wall*e was an enjoyable diversion. The titular character is robot that has spent his many days performing his task in isolation. All the other robots have worn out over time. Wall*e is different in that he is a survivor. In the many years he has worked, he has evolved a sense of self. Unfortunately, that involves a feeling of loneliness. After a significant event, it is resolving this loneliness that becomes his quest.The stars of the shows are the various robots. Their emotions are inferred through their actions, grunts, clicks and the occasional verbalization. This however is not a limitation. Pixar has created characters you care about. Wall*e is a hero in the tradition of Danny Kaye. He is a simple guy with simple ambitions that just happen to coincide with the events in the movie. He isn't glory seeking, he just wants companionship in the sappiest Disney tradition. It is this purity of soul that is his most endearing quality.This more of a kid's film that past Pixar efforts and the hand of Disney is firmly felt. There are sweeping scenes that designed to evoke adolescent dreams and emotions. That is not to say adults won't find it enjoyable. Pixar takes shot at a couple of themes; Consumerism, the environment, even some mild political humor. There are even a couple of gags relating to cockroaches and Twinkies which have oft been repeated. However, it lacks some of the sly adult wit that some of the previous films had.There little highbrow comedy here. Most of the gags come from slapstick pratfalls and such. However, the gags are executed with such precision, and the characters are so compelling that they were very effective. The rest of the humor consists of sight gags. Most not rising to the point past a chuckle, but taken as whole weaves a rich tapestry of the world that Wall-E lives in.Adults will find it enjoyable. Kids will love it beyond words and you're going to have to buy them Wall-E dolls for Christmas.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"adorable and haunting, delightful, joyous, and ultimately funny","I never thought I'd say this but... WALL*E is better than Toy Story. This might not seem like such a high claim given how many other wonderful movies from PIXAR have come out over the past 13 years, particularly the ones by Brad Bird (Incredibles and Ratatouille). But since Toy Story blew open the front door for CGI animation, and stood as the pinnacle of awesome, great entertainment and film-making, I wasn't sure if anything could top it. WALL*E does by far, and then some; I'd even say that this is probably the best Disney movie that, technically, they never made. For years Disney, the studio joined at the hip (and now, practically, submissive to whatever PIXAR wants in animation), didn't want to do WALL*E, as it was a somewhat bleak science fiction movie with 3/4 of the movie not featuring any distinct human dialog at all. And, no cute animals talking either; the closest we get here is a cockroach, and, thankfully, we only get cute chirps and squees of joy.It was a risk, but after waiting for so long to make it, Andrew Stanton has what critics have been dubbing the ""M"" word: masterpiece. It works on the levels that satisfy simply for the levels of a comedy. WALL*E the character is one of those classic character straight out of Disney movies that you don't see ever done this well, or at least this purely: he's wholesome, innocent, curious, lovable and loving to the robot that comes to earth, Eva, looking for any signs of life, and we want to cheer for him every step of the way. It's a quasi-Chaplin character, if Chaplin were obsessed with a video of an old 1950s musical (somehow, in the post-apocalyptic world of 2700, still intact), and only wants to hold Eva's darling hand, despite getting into mishap after mishap and eventually leading to his trip out into space. No quirk of behavior, no amazingly adorable physical bit of comedy is unturned, and every one works, even ones that you don't see coming.At the same time, it also works as a science fiction parable, one that works splendidly for our times without pushing it down our throats. Its message is one that is general, which is why when poised around satirical overtones on the AXIOM ship- where WALL*E finds Eva bringing a plant to the ship's captain and then stopped by a HAL-9000 type of computer- it's enriched by a context we all know very well. Taking care of the planet and taking care of ourselves physically are points that are put forth without being preachy, and there's lots of good humor to go with that too (the moment when the pudgy captain finally walks, put to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, is one of the funniest damn things I've ever seen). AND, it's also an incredibly touching love story to boot; two robots who can't quite seem to get together until one sees how much the other cares for the other. The simplicity here, too, is awe-inspiring, and like a silent film brings on the tear-ducts in the final moments of suspense.So, it's a superb comedy, a fully-realized and somewhat original science fiction story (then again what is original entirely), and the best date movie of the summer. On top of this, director Andrew Stanton and the vast PIXAR team have gone once again another leap forward with their technological skills for all use in telling the story. I don't care who you are, adult, child, old dude in a wheelchair, this is top-notch film-making, some of the finest one will see in this new decade of the 21st century. While points ahead to the future of animated movies, it doesn't stop or go corrupt in basic film-making. For those who would be wary of a movie with very little dialog, don't fret: there's enough ""pure"" cinema here to suffice. It left me speechless, in-between laughing and crying and whatnot.

My admiration for the greatest animation,"I have seen a series of Pixar animation, such as Toy Store and Monsters Incorporation, and all have especially good effects and elaborate drafting. Besides, every animation has a unique and interesting story that fascinates children as well as adults a lot. I can't help but watch it again and again. I just imagine me as a character in the movie, and then I will thoroughly enjoy it.I'll bet that WALL-E is the best Pixar animation I have ever seen. The movie's background is something significant for our human beings. The story starts after 800 years and the earth becomes unsuitable for people's living because of the pollution we make. And there's only a robot, called WALL-E, remained to sweep and to allocate the waste. This kind of story reminds us of the consequences if we keep wasting. In addition, I notice another point—obesity. Human beings who living in a space ship, called Axiom, more rely on machines and even don't need to walk eventually. It's too lazy. I'm sure this is not a good phenomenon for us. No one would like to be like that.Refer to the part I most like, it is definitely the friendship between WALL-E and Eve. Although they're robots, they do have the same emotions as humans do. There are no more words but spirits' meet. When Eve can't recognize who WALL-E is, WALL-E reveals a feeling of sorrow but never gives up arousing her. At that scene, I am heartbroken and dropping tears. Nevertheless robots are made of iron and look emotionless, their true love can be so sincere and touching. It speaks to my heart even more.To sum up, the animation has some characteristics, like romantic story and significant parts, which I love. I only have a sentence,"" the director really did a good job! """,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Pixar, I failed you","I think I've failed ""WALL-E"". It seemed like there's a great movie in there somewhere. I just wasn't able to focus on it for long enough to detect it. I don't know why. The movie just barely held my attention. It's true that my attention span sucks. But if anything would be easy to focus on for its whole length, it'd be a movie from Pixar, the Disney of CGI animation.So what went wrong? I don't know. This was a re-watch: I thought I might get more out of ""WALL-E"" a second time. I was wrong.I understood the basic premise of the movie, ie. A lone robot tasked with cleaning up Earth falls in love with an extra-terrestrial robot sent to find signs of sustainability.After that, though, it lost me, and I just wasn't able to concentrate on it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Ignore the haters. The best movie of the year, and maybe Pixar's best ever","Let's start with this: This movie made me care about a rolling trash compactor. Out of all the Pixar characters over the years, I've never felt a closer connection than I did with Wall-E. Just a simple, loyal, dutiful little 'bot and I was with him every step of the way. The emotional ties were every bit as real and moving as Jessie's ""When she loved me"" song in TS2, or Mr. & Mrs. Incredible fighting to save their family.One of the greatest tributes I have to this movie is that it kept a theater of young children ENTHRALLED. They followed everything, and paid rapt attention. Even thru the credits!This may also be the purest sci-fi film to hit the screen in ages. By all rights, it shouldn't work. Can you imagine the pitch session: ""Yeah, our hero is an electronic garbage man on a desolate, abandoned Earth, and there's almost no dialog."" If it wasn't Pixar, this movie would have never seen the light of day. But it did, and it's magic.And do ignore the clones screaming about ""thinly disguised environmental propaganda."" ""Wall-E"" is like all good fairy tales: a story that teaches us something about the angels (loyalty, sacrifice, love) and devils (gluttony, apathy) of our nature.In some aspects, Wall-E reminded me of Spirited Away. A slow-moving tale at times, but appropriately so. A family film to make you sit back and say, yeah, there's something more important than gag-a-minute writing, and bodily function humor. As others have said, this is the family film as art.Wall-E brought tears to these 44-year-old male eyes. And it made me laugh uproariously. Somewhere, Charlie Chaplin is smiling, because The Little Tramp has been reincarnated, and now he's solar-powered.Pixar has gone nine-for-nine. And just for chuckles, PRESTO, the short that precedes Wall-E, just might be the out-and-out funniest thing Pixar has ever made.Wall-E is brilliant. If you're not moved by it, check your basement. There's probably a large pod there right now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Very well animated drivel pathetic mellifluous storytelling,"It is undeniable that Pixar make pretty pictures. The animation is amazing but this story is mellifluous mindless drivel and spectacularly boring.The vote results have again confirmed for me that the majority of IMDb users have no appreciation of film culture or history. I have no issues with mindless entertainment but giving this forgettable summer fare a score of over 9 and having it rank higher than ""The Godfather"" and just about every other true cinematic masterpiece ever produced is a reminder of how the American general public are pathetically devoid of film culture. I remember when IMDb was at least a good barometer of the cinematic value of American films now it is just a good resource to get quick access to showtimes.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One of the Best Movies Out There,"I have kept my review ""non-spoiler"" for those who haven't seen the movie.I thought that this was a great movie, possibly my favorite. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as did the two hundred in my theater.The first thing I must add is the reviews of this movie. I cannot believe the utter lack of comprehension in the one to five star reviews. Most if not all of the reviews for this movie in that category are by people tired of being told the same message, and there's only one way to stop that message from being told. I am talking about the Save The Planet message by the way. Some other of the people who reviewed in that category either thought the movie was boring, which meant they couldn't sit for at least ninety minutes and listen to music while watching beautiful art, it's hard isn't it? Or they thought the movie was recycling the same art of past predecessors and doesn't deserve to be in the top 250.That being said, those very eccentric people gave it a one, even though they clearly said it didn't deserve it. Now, I would like to talk about the movie, which some people have clearly avoided in some reviews and what I don't want to do here. The first half was absolutely magnificent, with little dialog, Pixar had to rely on their art and character depth, yes there is depth in the characters. Try to look past the screen sometimes, or at least think.When EVE arrives, at about the fifteen minute mark, WALL-E finds himself in love with the plant searching robot. after that, they embark through space to the Axiom, the ship where all of the fat humans live in a industry controlling anarchy. By the way 'jim pyke'(IMDb user, review for WALL-E on the third page of Best I believe, which is about how fat people will react to the movie), the humans are fat because of the lack of gravity, which deteriorates at bone marrow overtime, and is passed through genes.I don't want to give anymore away that has not already been publicly advertised. If you go see this movie, and want to give an opinion here, do so respectfully and thoughtfully.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A little too childish for Pixar standards,"Don't get me wrong, Wall-E is a good movie that has also important messages like the care of our planet, the importance of an healthy lifestyle and a conscious use of the technology. It has also a brave opening for an animated movie because of the lack of dialogues in the first 20-30 minutes. But then as the setting changes I feel that the movie becomes a little too childish. Clearly this movie is intended for children but in other Pixar films this aspect was more balanced. Except for that the Wall-E is very enjoyable and it has also some references to very important pictures like 2001: Space Odissey and Star Wars and I'm sure I've missed some other more.
In conclusion Wall-E is a fine watch for everyone who like the animated genre but it can be hard to see for those who doesn't like some childish elements.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One Little Robot with One Gigantic Heart,"Mesmerizing.This little film about a little robot has one of the biggest hearts I've ever seen in a movie, and its message, about the responsibility humans must accept in changing their own lives and the life of their planet for the better, is perhaps the single most important message film as an art form can be communicating right now.""Wall-E"" did for me what so few films are able to do: it transported me to a place where, for the hour and a half that I was watching it, nothing existed for me but this movie. It made me feel like a kid again, and recreated the feelings I had watching ""Star Wars"" or ""E.T."" for the very first time, which would account for the countless scenes that made me tear up for vaguely nostalgic reasons.Despite the fact that we spend most of our time with mechanical robots, a love of humanity and of the earth pulses from every frame of ""Wall-E"". Movies, television and the news media spend so much time trying to convince us that the world is a terrible place to live, that one rickety little robot with big eyes telling us otherwise comes as a revelation.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Nice, but disposable. Skip it if you can!","Never before has computer animation been so great. It is just a darn shame that they didn't spend anything on the writers.The picture is beautiful; the detail and work is astonishing. Why then, did the story have nothing of interest? This is really quite a shame (and hopefully not an example of what we can expect from Pixar/Disney going forward).However, adults held captive by their spawn in the theaters will manage to give up a few yucks, but very few. The lacking story is helped along by many wonderful sight-gags, too bad that the writers were plainly absent during the development and production of this movie.Wait until the DVD.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Not just one of the best animated films, but one of the best films of all time","As the film starts in space with a song from Hello Dolly, you wonder just quite what you're getting yourself into. A few moments later we are transported to Earth, up-to-it's eyeballs in garbage, however help is at hand, in the cuboid shape of WALL-E, a waste allocation load lifter, Earth-class. Once WALL-E was part of a huge herd of robotic trash compactors built to help the human race get out of the mess it had made, while they stayed in space, waiting for everything to be sorted. However, it's 700 years later and only one WALL-E is left and on his own he has become a tad eccentric. With only a cockroach as a friend he spends his time doing his job and trying to learn more about the people who once inhabited this little world. Of course if that was the entire film it wouldn't be very good and shortly after it starts WALL-E is joined by EVE, a far more advanced model whose mission is a secret.This is Pixar's most ambitious film to date. From the moment the title appears and the music really kicks in we feel this is different to the cutesy world of superheroes and talking cars and animals that have gone before. This is a film that has elements that are grim, unsettling and ask difficult questions about what we are doing as custodian's of the planet. The script and story are an absolute triumph as the skill's of the animator's to make those hundred's of pixels perform in such charming, heart-warming ways is a joy to watch.The pacing of the film, unlike Nemo, The Incredibles and Cars is flawless and you get the feeling that a lot was sacrificed to keep that running time as tight and precise as it is. There is not a frame wasted, nor one shot too many. However, the thing that gets me most about this film, no matter how many times I watch this film I see something new that I haven't seen before. The lighting looks like a real film, the pauses and reactions from the robot performers are exquisite with more than a nod being shown to the silent pioneers at the turn of the last century who started this thing called cinema off. After watching this I think they'd be proud to see how far their medium has come.There's a saying that you can't polish a turd, and sadly in the media these days hundreds of millions of dollars are spent polishing so many expensive summer turds (Dark Knight anyone?) This was a joy to watch and discover that in spite of the stupidity of this business of show, there are still worlds full of sparkle, Barnaby! A Masterpiece of the medium.Nuff said.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"WALL-E, the most innovative animated film in years...","Animation is a key element in the lives of children but somewhere around adolescence, a young person feels they're ""too mature"" or ""too cool"" to be watching ""cartoons."" Then a change occurs in adulthood, which the same young person misses something from their childhood and a film they watched while playing with Lego's brings them back to that. As of late, animated films have tried to be something their not, perhaps lost their spark. In the new millennium, I haven't really experienced the Bambi, The Lion King, or The Fox and the Hound of our time. Finding Nemo and The Incredibles raised the bar but still hadn't been the perfect dose of entertainment, writing, and emotion. WALL-E, has achieved where its predecessors failed.WALL-E is the most touching, real, emotionally moving film this year so far. The film is about a little robot named WALL-E, (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) who has become exceptionally lonely on the desolate planet of Earth, that has become a wasteland of filth, debris, and pollution. Life has ceased to exist on the once populated planet until a rocket lands and drops off a ""surprise,"" to say the least. Enters our heroin, which might be an understatement, EVE, a robot with an edge, that is searching for ""something"" that might be the key to life's existence. But alas, WALL-E falls in love with her charm, wit, and blaster gun and when circumstances force her to be picked up, WALL-E will travel across the galaxy to find his love.WALL-E makes a statement loud and clear about today's political factors, from pollution to exercise, love, life, it speaks of it all in volumes without any words; it uses images to baffle the viewer as we are thrust through the film. Writer and Director Andrew Stanton creates wonderful details as we are engulfed into WALL-E's world and within seconds of the film starting, fall in completely in love with the robot.The film doesn't pretend to be something it's not and Stanton isn't afraid to let the film be both for the mature and the innocence of our youth. With limited dialogue, Stanton takes a chance of losing his viewers but rest assured, there is never a dull moment and while the film does lose a little flavor from the start, resonance of childhood and contentment fill the viewer in images of awe and splendor.As the already declared by many, Animated Film frontrunner of the Academy Awards, the film studio Pixar may have a winner on its hands to make a strong push for Best Picture. Not since Beauty and the Beast has an animated film been nominated for Best Picture and we've had some potential candidates over the years. But with the induction of the Best Animated Feature category, voters feel there's no need to validate the films twice so to speak. WALL-E is technically beautiful which makes it a contender in the Sound and Editing categories, and Stanton is more than just the writer of the film as he directs the film with power and precise. I'd go so far as to say this is the best directed animated film I've ever seen. That is where Stanton's magic is, his direction, but writing is definitely a strong suit for the film as well. We'll have to wait for the upcoming awards season to see how it plays out.But go and catch WALL-E on the big screen, and enjoy the masterpiece for what it is and the wonderful short film at the beginning of the film which is a treat for all.***½/****",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Beautifully crafted and charming film that appeals to adults and children without having two films in one but by making it all work for both,"It took me a minute to get round to seeing this film, mainly due to letting the kids clear out of the cinema and the hype / pester power effect on the audience demographic settle down some. Finally getting to see it for myself I was pleased to find that it is the probably the most accomplished Pixar film since, well, since the last one. Of course the most obvious way that things has stepped up yet again is technically as the film is beautifully animated with even convincing dust hanging in the atmosphere and even the humans ""real"" (well, real in the context of the Pixar universe anyway). The level of detail is not only technically impressive but also impressive in the imagination and creativity in making this world and characters. However its in the characters where the film is most impressive. Without a great deal of dialogue to speak of it is amazing that the film manages to create characters that are not only cute and funny but also that the audience care about and for, and this is what the film achieves, making Wall-E an ET for this generation. The plot operates on two levels and the characters are most important for the simple, very human, love story between Wall-E and Eve. This thread is charmingly delivered throughout and it is hard not to feel for Wall-E as he seeks out the simple feelings and gestures that he has watched nightly for hundreds of years.Operating above this is a plot that owes a debt to Silent Running in the same way as Wall-E himself owes something to Huey and Dewey. With a heavier hand at the wheel, this would have been a very preachy and obvious eco-message but with Stanton it is actually pretty smart and manages to reach children without being clumsy and obvious for adults. Actually this also applies to the humour as well because there is not so much of a duality where aspects of the film are divided  so the character falling over is for kids but the one-liner that follows is for adults; instead Wall-E pretty much pitches everything to the benefit of the film and story. OK so we still get the references but they are not put in so much as woven in  hard to explain perhaps but if you watch this versus, for example, Shrek, you'll see what I mean  Wall-E is not some pop-culture reference-driven film that will be old in a few years once people forget who the celebs were that year. This strengths the film further by just feeling like an all-round engaging and enjoyable film  OK the level or depth that you watch it to will vary between adults and children, but it is this that is different  not WHAT they are watching so much as how.The ""cast"" of the film are really the animators because, aside from a nice touch of casting in Weaver, the majority of work is done by them. As such Wall-E and Eve are very expressive considering what they are. It is all in tiny movements on the ""faces"" and in the body language  actors struggle to always do it without dialogue so how much harder is it to get it right when you are creating it on a computer? The answer I guess would be ""much harder"" which is why it is so impressive that with barely a word spoken we manage to care so much for these robots.Wall-E will almost certainly win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature but, for probably the first time, Pixar have a film that genuinely deserves consideration for Best Feature  it is that engaging, well crafted and charming and manages to do that for all sections of the audience without resorting to the oft-used (and mostly fun) ""one for me, one for you"" style of some of these films.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

It had to happen... an average Pixar movie.,"Childish, overstated, looks impressive.6 out of 10 is still worth seeing. It's pretty good entertainment, but not brilliant or outstanding.Recurring themes are repeatedly forced, like how we're told that Wall-e has a crush on the other robot. OK, we get it. But just in case we missed it, here's another scene showing just how much Wall-e likes the robot. It gets tedious.Even the bigger eco-humanity message is clumsy, a saturating swipe across the story. No subtle interwoven story details here, this is bowling ball sized plot elements coming straight for us.In Wall-e, the plot holes are quite big. Enough said about plot holes.The bottom line is it looks polished. Cinematography is impressive. But there's too much of one robot calling out the name of the other robot, and in the end it struggles to stand next to the other Pixars on the same level.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
OMG,"This is how you write a masterpiece of a story. Adventure, Love, Comedy, Sci -Fi , Romance, Villain and reality. This movie has got every single thing.It's strange how a movie meant for kids can carry a weight so heavy it mirrors the burdens of life. I didn't expect much when I watched Wall-E. Just another animated flick, I thought. But somewhere between the silence of a desolate Earth and the tenderness of two robots reaching for each other, I found myself deeply affected.Maybe it's because I, too, know what it's like to love and to lose. To pour yourself into someone so deeply that when they're gone, you're left wandering like a ghost, collecting scraps of what used to be. That's Wall-E: a tiny robot on a barren Earth, keeping pieces of a forgotten past because they're all he has left. His days are monotonous, filled with work no one cares about anymore. Watching him, I couldn't help but feel like I was staring into a mirror.Wall-E isn't flashy. He doesn't say much. His life is as quiet as the Earth he roams, abandoned and left to decay. But in his solitude, there's a kind of hope. His fascination with little trinkets-a Rubik's cube, a lighter, an old VHS of Hello, Dolly!-is both heartbreaking and beautiful. It's the way we hold onto memories, isn't it? The way I still keep that necklace she gave me, even though she's long gone.And then EVE comes into Wall-E's life. She's sleek, confident, and utterly unlike him. Where Wall-E is clunky and outdated, she's futuristic and perfect. Watching them together, I was reminded of my own love story. How I, too, fell for someone who seemed so far out of my league. Like Wall-E, I was nervous, awkward, unsure if I deserved her. But Wall-E? He doesn't question it. He just loves her, boldly and without hesitation.The scenes between Wall-E and EVE are the most moving parts of the movie. There's a simplicity in how they interact-small gestures, the way they say each other's names. ""Wall-E."" ""Eve-a."" It's pure, untainted by the complexities that humans bring to love. Watching them, I found myself crying, not because I was sad, but because I missed what we had. The way she'd smile at me for no reason. The way we'd hold hands in silence, perfectly content just to exist next to each other.When EVE shuts down temporarily, and Wall-E refuses to leave her side, I felt my heart break all over again. That's what love is, isn't it? Staying, even when it feels like the other person isn't there anymore. Even when it hurts. Wall-E protects her, shelters her, and never gives up hope that she'll wake up.As the movie shifts to the humans aboard the Axiom, the tone changes. It becomes a story about humanity's disconnection-from each other, from the Earth, from themselves. It's a powerful message, no doubt, but I found myself distracted. My mind kept drifting back to Wall-E and EVE. Their love was the core of the story for me, a reminder of what it means to truly care for someone.In the end, Wall-E sacrifices everything for EVE. He loses parts of himself, quite literally, just to make sure she's safe. When he shuts down, I felt a heaviness in my chest that I hadn't felt in years. It was too familiar. The way love can take and take until there's nothing left. But when EVE brings him back, when she gives him a gentle kiss and his eyes light up again, I found myself smiling through tears.I think that's what Wall-E is really about. Not just love, but resilience. The idea that even when everything is broken-our world, our relationships, ourselves-there's always a chance to rebuild. I don't know if I'll ever find that again. Maybe my story isn't meant to have a happy ending like Wall-E and EVE's. But for a moment, this movie made me believe it was possible.So, if you've ever loved and lost, Wall-E is more than a movie. It's a reminder of what it means to feel, to care, to hope. And maybe, just maybe, to heal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Best sci-fi movie for kids,"Walle is a piece of art, I can't put it in other worlds apart of that, Pixar ,here, has created a new classic suited for our world ,who is based on scientific advancement, fears about the environment and how the future will be after wards.To add to that Walle is one of the cutest characters I have ever seen and his movie more than deserves the high rating it has.

The decision of making the playback videos without animation is something I tend to wonder, it in kind of a way established a better connection to the viewer but almost is something that I think for some could break the 3rd wall.In recent days Pixar seems to have become a money cow and the more recent movies don't have the simple backstory and powerful characters we once seen.

""Wall-E"" depicts a dead, life-deprived world of the near future, machines in control of people, and portrays all people as fat, stupid, and irresponsible with no idea of outside issues. It has a very unpatriotic theme designed toward creating an atmosphere of despair, fear, and uncertainty. Pixar should remember that it is a family-geared entertainment company. This film openly and shamelessly presents the desire to be politically correct and passes it off as appropriate entertainment for children.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"Short,Sweet and Beautifully Animated,","WALL-E is a great movie with another very well-developed and heartwarming storyline from Pixar and a very lovable title character.However,I do find this movie to be very overrated,it largely considered to be one of the greatest Pixar movies,it's probably one of my least favourites,I didn't find the characters as lovable as Toy Story,Monsters Inc,Incredibles,etc.It is a really great family film,but I definitely don't think it's Pixar's best and I feel the story gets a bit too serious for a children's film at times.I also didn't like how they put so much live-action bits in this movie,the musical's WALL-E watches didn't really bother me,but they should have made Fred Willard's character animated,it was just creepy seeing him in an animated movie.WALL-E is a great movie that the whole family will enjoy and it's also educational,but it's not the most entertaining Pixar movie there is.A small robot stuck alone on Earth ends up on a spaceship where the remaining population of the world are and causes a lot of drama when a plant he brings is discovered.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
An innocent little robot begins to have feelings for a robot named EVE.,"It's not unusual for Pixar to make a movie that is unforgettable.This film proves that humans aren't the only things with feelings, and it shows it in an awesome way. The movie has barely a word spoken in the first 30 minutes, but tells a story so touching and so innocent it leaves you breathless. The first half is transcendent.Although WALL-E is a robot composed of assorted metals, he is anything but lifeless.I was really surprised at the quality and depth of the movie. This is not your ordinary children's cartoon by any stretch of the imagination.I can not say that I highly recommend it, but it is worth watching once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Done to death,"i found this like many pixar movies....One or more lovable protagonists have existed for some time in a stable but fundamentally flawed routine, which is shaken up by the introduction of a foreign entity, usually another character, around whom attitudes are initially hostile. Attempts to deal with this character eventually lead to the protagonist(s) discovering a new, unfamiliar world, and in doing so discover the nature of the fundamental flaw in their routine. Villains are usually introduced or only become truly villainous from around the mid-point or quite late into the film. Along the way the heroes enlist the help of various lesser characters with clearly definable quirks and at one point reluctantly enter a high-speed chase. The villain is generally finally defeated with surprising ease, and everything concludes in an emotionally manipulative ending in which routine is restored with the fundamental flaw excised.this has been done to death Pixar please find a different formula",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wall-E: Beautiful in its Implementation,"The ninth film from animation kingpins Pixar, Wall-E comes with a considerable reputation. Boasting awards aplenty and an almost entirely positive critical reception, it adds much to the already significant commendations received by the studio.The film, a future parable, focuses on the eponymous robot and his single handed efforts to clean the world up after humanity has abandoned it, and their rubbish. We soon learn that mankind is orbiting in space, floating about in dozens of gigantic ships, awaiting the time when they may return to an again healthy world. We see the arrival of Eve, a scanner robot sent to Earth to detect signs of life. Wall-E, alone in the world with nothing but a cockroach and an old copy of ""Hello Dolly!"", sees in her a chance to know something other than loneliness.Wall-E provides an emotional depth rarely achieved by live action films. The animation of the main character is astounding, the realisation of this originally perfunctory machine as a fully rounded personality a stunning achievement. Through the simplest of motions, we are from the start able to connect with the robot and understand the poignant loneliness of 700 years. It is difficult to believe just how involving, engrossing and spellbinding the character is, and all that without any form of dialogue. Amazing. Once the plot gets kicking, we are treated to humour aplenty, a perfectly entertaining story, and an appropriate underlying message. The laughs come in equal measure as the tears; Wall-E's clumsiness as effectively brilliant as his hopeless romanticism. The running motif of his desire to hold Eve's hand is wonderfully moving, as beautiful in its implementation as the emotional scope of his eyes.Incredible animation, an emotional depth unparalleled by its rivals, a perfectly fine plot, and an important message. Wall-E is a great, great film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Reviews of Wall E,"Wall-e a small robot has been gathering rubbishes for 700 years and truing to have a simple life and uses every rubbish that is still useful. Listening to love songs causes he doesn't forget how lonely he is. Then ,when a spaceship is send to earth from human with robot to search in through the earth and find vital sights on it. Wall-e was of female robot named Eve which stand for extraterrestrial vegetation evaluator is super advanced robot that still doesn't know much about love ,dance and useful rubbishes and she is on a mission to find vital sources too. Wall-e that has found a small green planet , showed it to the Eve and she kept it with herself automatically and turned off.

It also won the Oscar for best animated and Oscar nomination : best original screenplay of the year , best original music year , best editor sound , and best original sound. The Wall-e animation, even though it represented a harsh truth and an end of the world concept. It also delivered a sweet and hopeful outcome that captivates the audience. In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the most interesting thing is how it demonstrates the story line without the use of words to show all the emotions that the characters go through. In the second part it demonstrate show the technology has effect the humanity and how their selfish and wasteful behavior has doomed their lives on earth to the point that they had to take refuge in spaceship. The citizens in this so called ''Space Station'' are so dependent to the technology that even their most basic activities are being done for them by machines. If you think about it , this is somehow similar to the life style we have today. As we evolution our god gets, our daily activities become easier and there for we don't have to work as hard. It has been quite some time that Pixar has changed its perspective on making animations. Their image has changed from making fairy tales to delivering more realistic story. Wall-e cannot be considered as just an entertainment for the children because adults can relate to its audience. It shows love, drama, action, humor and so an... You can't just consider Wall-e as good animation to me it's a masterpiece that could remains as an inspirational story that would last for many years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

It Only Takes a Moment to Be Loved a Whole Life Long!,"Wall-E is one of my absolute favorites. I know a lot of people don't like the lack of dialogue; however, I would argue that that is part of what makes the film so charming! Wall-E and Eve (though they do make some verbal communication) express their feelings through facial expression and physical reaction. This is a true credit to the animation of the film - we know exactly how Wall-E is feeling at every moment and we are drawn to empathize with him. Early moments like his ""taking off his shoes at the door"" (hanging up his treads), his groggily needing his energy boost in the morning, his packed lunch box, his appreciation for quirky items and dancing, and his desire to have someone in his life make Wall-E so humanly relatable despite his being a robot. The relationship between him and Eve, whose ""Type-A"" and somewhat aggressive personality is the antithesis of the tender, charming Wall-E, is both hilarious and heartwarming (and in my relationship, relatable :D ). Wall-E shows Eve how to enjoy the little things in life and that being with the one you love is more important than any other ""directive"". Like all Pixar films, the movie is studded with clever Easter eggs you don't always pick up on during the first watch. Finally, the fact the story is set alongside the music from Hello, Dolly! Always puts a smile on my face. Wall-E's constant playback of the musical's recordings demonstrates that even when the state of the world seems to be at its worst, solace can be found in music. At its core, the film is a love story, but it creates equally uplifting moments as we see how the character of Wall-E makes an impact on the lives of everyone (both human and robot) he encounters throughout his journey to be with Eve. It may lack dialogue, it may be slightly heavy-handed in its warning against one's carbon footprint and submission to automation, but damn, it is a genuine and sweet story of romance, adventure, and ""how it only takes a moment to be loved our whole life long"". <3 I can watch this film over and over and it never ceases to make me smile!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Beautiful...,"""WALL·E"" is an Animation - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch the story follows a lone robot, WALL·E, in a dystopian future where Earth has been abandoned due to pollution and waste, who spends his days cleaning up the mess left behind by humanity.I enjoyed this movie because it had a nice and interesting plot while there was a beautiful meaning behind all that. This movie is so memorable because of its unique ability to tell a powerful story with minimal dialogue. The expressive animation was simply amazing and allowed the characters to convey so much emotion without words, creating a strong connection between them and the audience. The visuals were also stunning, with the movie's vibrant colors and detailed animation bringing the decaying Earth and distant future to life, something that was both beautiful and heartbreaking. In conclusion, I have to say that ""WALL·E"" is a beautiful, thoughtful and visually spectacular movie that everyone needs to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
an overrated film with memorable scenes but no solid story,"Every summer lately has its big animated hit, and sometimes more than one. 'Wall-E' will certainly be the big one of the summer of 2008 and will make a lot of money in the process. I do not share the enthusiasm of the crowds on this one however.There are a few remarkable things in 'Wall-E'. The principal character is cute and nicely drawn, with an E.T. like silhouette. His romantic interest is however deprived of any charm, exception the way she voices 'Wall-Eeeeeee' and we hardly share his enthusiasm for her. The love dance in the starry night is a beautiful piece of animation. The visions of Earth reduced to a garbage dump and the one of the humanity turned into sacks of junk food are haunting, although a little too ideologically explicit. But then between all these we do expect a movie line and a story, and those are not missing but so simplistic and naive that they lack any interest for the adult viewer, and by this I mean anybody older than nine. Graphics are OK but I have seen better from Pixar.When the first viewers enthusiasm will fade out this film will slowly decrease in rating (it has by now a stellar 8.9 in IMDb, and is a neighbor of Lord of the Rings and Usual Suspects) and will melt out from Top 250. We will be left with an animated movie of a few memorable quotes but no real story to connect between them.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
All adults must see this!,"This film is not an animation targeting at children, nor teenagers, but a great film all generations all over the world should see. It is not simply funny but fascinating, impressive, moving, and also instructive. Each character has its personality, and each scene is well considered and finely structured. Wall-E is not only cute but also full of spirit of love and dedication. Captain McCrea has not lost the human spirit in spite of his lazy days and his degenerated fat body.The film also presents environmental issue the human being is facing much ahead of the US Government, still it has a great optimism on future human nature.I watched this film with my teenage kids, and we laughed, commented with each other and were moved together.

Amazing for kids and adults,"A wonderful cartoon for children, but also for adults. Still relevant in its subject matter and the message it sends us. There is no dialogue for the first half hour or so, but that's why those scenes are strong, emotional, and maybe even more powerful than those containing words (e.g. When Wall E initially finds certain things among the trash). I found links to the 2001 Odyssey that were deliberately placed like the first half hour of a movie, the main robot in a spaceship, or music near the end. Not only is this a great cartoon for kids but it is also a great SF that adults can enjoy as well. It didn't lose anything when I watched it again, in fact it may be even better. I would dare say one of the best cartoons of the last 20 years, if not all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The beauty of romance amongst the ugly aspects of life.,"I like to think of this film as a documentation,although animated,of just how lazy we are getting as a society.We are working ourselves to a point of just not even having to get out of bed in the morning.The man on the hover chair who fell out of it and just laid there like he didn't know what to do to get himself up is an example of that..It's ironic,really.We are trying so hard to take all of the work out of life because we think it makes it easier,but the truth is,we're killing ourselves slowly.Just my opinion.I love our little robotic hero and the romance story that evolves in the middle of all of the ugliness that surrounds them.Worthy of a place on the DVD shelf.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Heavy-handed message; clichéd characters; 100 minutes of pantomime,"This was one of the uncommon situations when I saw a movie without knowing anything about it beforehand. I tend to believe that in such situations one's reactions are most genuine, without a trace of foreign influence.It turned out that WALL.E was quite a disappointment. For brevity, I'll list only three reasons.(1) First, the movie's message: it's heavy-handed, to say the least. And it gets rather thick towards the end. I leave it at that, for fear of spoiling.(2) Animation is about characters. The character of WALL.E is very predictable. It's completely human/childish (and clichéd, at that!). It seems the challenge for the creators/animators was simply ""how do we convey this emotion, given the mechanical constraints"", ""how do we relate this trait, given the expressive limitations"", etc.(3) Being essentially a silent movie (question: how come a rather sophisticated robot -- watching TV, making plans, and all -- has such rudimentary speech skills -- he can barely utter a syllable or two?), it strongly resembles a pantomime: For 100 minutes, the audience is asked to guess what the character is attempting to do. After a while, it gets tiresome.BTW: I noticed that it's much easier to praise a popular movie than criticize it. Somehow, many readers get upset when reading a review with which they don't agree. This being a 9.3 movie at the time of writing, I expect the worst :-)",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Heartwarming,"This movie, about a small waste-collecting robot who inadvertently embarks on a space journey that will ultimately decide the fate of mankind, is a good family movie!At first glance it's surreal to see our planet this poisonous that contains cities of trash with only robots and small creatures moving around without a single human being. It's strange to see the Earth that unlivable, and the worst of all: it's scientifically possible, and we are on our way for it.Anyway, the robot WALL-E was one of the last remaining waste-collecting WALL-Es on Earth due to the lack of battery access, but this WALL-E knew his tricks. He had his own personality, preferences and techniques, and he had a nice life among his collections. This created such a good-feeling opening of this movie, and you can't take your eyes off from this innocent fella.The story is interesting, but personally, it can get a little slow. There are only a few highlights that give major impact on the story, and it often rather focuses on small details for just entertainment. But at the same time, some of those scenes have a surprising amount of depth and can melt anyone's heart, and that's what making this movie shine.When it comes to the technical aspects, it's truly a joy, both visually and sonically. The animation is top-notch, and the sound design and the soundtrack are worthy additions to this movie. It's a well made family movie, and all kinds of audiences are welcome to enjoy this ride.Overall, this is a heartwarming and well-made family movie with a surprising amount of depth. The story is engaging and the characters are lovable, and the technical aspects are top-notch. The movie can be slow at times, but it is ultimately a rewarding experience that will leave you thinking about the future of our planet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The best animated film I've ever seen,It's extremely rare an animated film touches you in so many ways. Wall-E leaves you with many things to think about. What is love? What is our purpose on Earth?

Sor-e,"An almost intelligent robot (WALL-E) goes about his business of cleaning the earth up after an apparently devastating war. Humans are far, far away on a luxury space ship until the earth is ready to receive them again. In the meantime WALL-E encounters a female probe, EVE and is smitten.OK, let's get this out of the way: WALL-E is Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth Class.The last full length cartoon I watched was The Jungle Book and it had class, good lines and a good story. I suppose there are other good ones out there since The Jungle Book, but .. This animation cartoon had possibilities to say many things, but failed to do so, and it wasn't funny. Clever, yes, but not hilarious as some have postulated.The humans on the luxury ship were not eager to get back to earth, only the Captain was the eager one. They were happy doing what they were doing because for hundreds of years in space they knew nothing else. And, if you saw the over portly humans there would be the tendency to blame them for their physical condition, but the rigors of space did all that to them. So we are not surprised to see there were none of the reasons expounded upon to never let this happen to earth again, no more war etc etc. For hundreds of years in space they knew nothing about war and seemed to have forgotten all about living on earth. They knew nothing else. But, the Captain had an inkling.WALL-E's flight to stay with EVE as she reported back to the mother ship showed us the human condition on the luxury ship. And, that is how it all happened, boys and girls.What would have made this more interesting was to have WALL-E actually speak besides his repeating his name over and over and over and over again. He had artificial intelligence. His speaking would have gone a long way to making this a more fun movie. What made the robot in Short Circuit (great movie) so endearing was his ability to speak, exclaim, wonder, ask questions, be surprised etc. Yes, that was not WALL-E's purpose but it could have been built in by the humans so to speak, and I would have given this a better review than a mere C. I would have laughed, cried until it became a part of me. Didn't happen.Yes, the kids will like it but would have liked it better if WALL-E actually spoke. Listen to the kids if there is a sequel.Visually, this is excellent and deserves an A. Some want to put this up for an Oscar: Best Picture. Give me a break. A ""C"" doesn't beget an Oscar. Give it the Oscar for Visual Effects. Are we done now?Violence: Yes, in a cartoon kind of way. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No, although the humans almost went there",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
wall-e,"A love letter to science-fiction films of old with a modern environmentalist message, WALL-E is another winning confection from Pixar, the folks who have made an art out of wrapping adult themes in childish whimsy and coming out with movies that please both elements. Starring a box shaped little robot with more than a passing resemblance to E.T., WALL-E is quite possibly the cutest Pixar hero ever, despite the fact that he's a trash compactor with eyes. A story centering on a wordless robot could be cold and uninviting, but not in Pixar's capable hands. Never has a robot been this compassionate: WALL-E's got heart.The story of the film is deceptively simple. WALL-E (Waste Allocator Load Lifter - Earth Class) is the last of his kind, a robot created by the Buy-N-Large Corporation to clean up the piles of trash left on Earth by the conspicuous consumption of human beings. The humans themselves have evacuated the now-lexically trashed Earth for a Eden-like spaceship habitat called the Axiom (also created by BNL corp.), where they spend their days sipping meals out a cup and reclining on floating easy chairs. Though all his robotic compatriots have long since compacted their last, WALL-E continues plugging away at his job in an endearingly human way. He wakes up each day to the chime of a Macintosh starting up (score for the folks! Thanks Steve!) and heads out for another day among the trash heaps. He brings a battered coolie along with him to save the things he likes: a ping-ping paddle, a plastic dinosaur toy, a light bulb, a small seedling saved in an old boot. He ends each day in his home, watching an old video tape of Hello Dolly! - an important motif throughout the film.Things change drastically for WALL-E the day EVE shows up. She is slick and futuristic and quite obviously a girl; WALL-E falls in love almost immediately. It turns out EVE has been sent from the Axiom to scan the earth for signs of habitable life. Their convincing courtship is done completely without dialog, quite a feat for sound designer Ben Burtt who found a way to make ambient noise into recognizable words for WALL- E. Trying to impress the coolly modern EVE, WALL-E shows her the seedling he found, at which point EVE goes into a hibernation state and awaits the return of her spaceship. WALL-E, of course, cannot abide by his beloved EVE's status and hitches a ride into space to save her.A bit disturbingly, all the humans on the Axiom have regressed to babyhood (enormously fat, with chubby extremities and little bone density) after 700 years of living up in space and drinking their meals through a straw. It seems that this may have been the aim of the BNL Corporation, who have instructed the ship's Computer Auto (Sigourney Weaver) to never let the humans return to Earth, even if it is found to be habitable once again. Though WALL-E's only aim on the Axiom is to find his beloved EVE, he finds himself wrapped up in a race to save the seedling he collected on earth from the treacherous tentacles of Auto. Along the way he meets a variety of robots, each with their own supposed job, all of which are related to cleaning up. It becomes clear that human consumption is what has trashed the earth and is now trashing Outer Space as well.Though he is tiny and relegated to the dirtiest of the dirty jobs, WALL- E truly understands how to find value in sullied things and how to create magic out of useless objects. He is more human than the humans in that way and slowly, without preaching (he can't even talk), WALL-E begins to show them how to regain what they have lost through sloth and over reliance on technology. It's an environmentalist film, but also a poignant homage to simple joys in this era of pods and digital everything.Half of what is so enchanting about watching WALL-E, as in all Pixar films, is seeing how the filmmakers have created a working universe in which to play. There is no skimping here, no visible shortcuts. WALL-E himself has a million ways to express his emotions, from compacting into a box when he feels shy to wiggling his binocular-like eyes in awe when he first beholds EVE, all of which are related to physical, realistic components. That allegiance to authenticity allows the film to send its narrative to fantastic heights without seeming over the top or phony.Like all previous Pixar films, the meaning of WALL-E is deeper and more profound than the merchandising opportunities found therein. It's a love story, yes, but it's also a story about staying true to your own heart in the blandly evil face of authority. It's a tale about saving the small things and cherishing the world you live in, no matter how imperfect its surface might seem. Andrew Stanton, who won an Oscar in 2004 for Finding Nemo, has certainly earned his place in the pantheon of animation pioneers, but with WALL-E, he has taken not only the art of animation, but the art of storytelling to new, unimaginable heights.As a bonus, Pixar have affixed a Looney Tune-y short about an arrogant magician and his hungry rabbit to beginning of the WALL-E. Presto! is pure Looney Tunes and a fitting appetizer to the lovely film to follow.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
WALL-E: Amazing,"WALL-E is hands down one of the most visually stunning, thought-provoking, and all-around kick-ass movies I've ever had the pleasure of watching. It's like if Michelangelo and Stanley Kubrick had a baby and then raised it on a steady diet of robot love and environmentalism. The animation is top-notch, the story is heartwarming, and the characters are some of the most lovable robots to grace the silver screen. But let's be real, the true star of this film is the clever and subtle social commentary woven throughout. It's a film that manages to be both entertaining and thought-provoking, a rare feat indeed. And let's not forget the incredible soundtrack, which perfectly captures the film's themes of love, hope, and the importance of taking care of our planet.

CLASSIC!!!!,"Pixar's ""WALL-E"" is an enthralling animated film, a visual wonderment and a decent science-fiction story. It works largely without spoken dialogue, making it easy to cross language barriers and tell a planetary story. It is also a film that can easily cross language barriers, as it tells a planetary story. WALL-E is a solar-powered robot that is the last of the functioning solar-powered robots. He scoops up trash, shovels it into his belly, compresses it into a square, and climbs on his tractor treads to the top of his latest skyscraper to place it neatly on the pile. The skyscrapers are constructed out of garbage, compacted into squares or bales and piled on top of one another. WALL-E's age-old routine is shattered when a sleek spaceship appears in his world. He is scooped up by the ship and returned to the orbiting spaceship Axiom, along with his most recent discovery: a tiny, perfect green plant, which he transplanted to an old shoe. The movie has a wonderful look, with a color palette that is bright and cheerful, but not too pushy, and a tiny bit realistic at the same time. The drawing style is Comic Book Cool, perfected in the funny comics more than in the superhero books. The design of WALL-E, for whom I felt a curious affection, is rusty and hard-working and plucky, and expresses his personality with body language and (mostly) with the binocular-like video cameras that serve as his eyes. The movie draws on a tradition going back to the earliest days of Walt Disney, who reduced human expressions to their broadest components and found ways to translate them to animals, birds, bees, flowers, trains and everything else. The film ""Finding Nemo"" is directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton, who wrote and directed ""Finding Nemo"". It involves ideas, not mindless scenarios, and involves a little work on the part of the audience and thought. It could be especially stimulating to younger viewers, and could have been a great science-fiction film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Pixar's WALL-E best animation,"The movie has a wonderful look.

Another Pixar Gem!,"Wall-E is a tender tale of a hardworking robot named Wall-E, named for the company that created him. He works with a single-minded purpose every day, sorting through a virtual city of trash, most of which he dutifully compacts and piles into neat stacks that resemble buildings. Some of the junk he chooses to save, with the thought that it might someday be useful: A light bulb, hubcap, Rubik cube – they all becomes a part of his home, decorated with strings of bright holiday lights. At the end of a long and monotonous day, our hero replays a scene from the 1969 movie, ""Hello Dolly"", enthralled by Michael Crawford and Marianne McAndrew, holding hands and singing a tender love song.One day Wall-E and his cockroach sidekick Hal, witness a spaceship depositing a sleek little hover craft, designed to collect data and soil samples from the surrounding environment. Wall-E clings for dear life, hitching a ride on the spaceship that snatches up Eva after she collects a sample of plant life. Eva's life consists of living in a vast space center, where the human population is virtually waited on hand and foot.My daughter's snoring interrupted my amazement at a new plot twist.

The animation and sound were incredible as usual, but the story was boring and uninspired. I wanted to like it, but it was just too silly and pointless.It was also hard to ignore the fact that the movie was so much of a social commentary and I really don't like to see stuff like that ingrained in children's movies.Maybe it was just me, but I never really with connected with the characters and I was really disappointed with the movie as a whole.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
I guess the kids like it,My granddaughters received this movie for Christmas. My husband and I watched it with them and right away I'm turned off because Wall-e looks a lot like No. 5 from the movie Short Circuit. No originality in creating a different looking robot. I could only watch the first half hour and then had to leave the room and let the kids watch it. I have read all the good and excellent reviews about it and I just don't get it. I haven't seen any good animated films over past few years and I think it's because the animation is being done by computers. The Looney Tune type (drawn) cartoons were and will always be the best type. I would not recommend the purchase of this movie. Just save your money and wait for it to come on cable.,3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
First droid love story,"It is very rare that I award a movie a 10 out of 10 on one of these reviews, but WALL-E fits the bill for that rating for sure. To earn the rating, you have to do something completely brilliant, something that really has not been done before. WALL-E does just that.The secret is the characters, and actually the trajectory of the artistic idea starts with the film to which WALL-E is most indebted, 2001: A Space Odyssey. In that movie, Stanley Kubrick decided it was time for a computer to be a real movie villain. The computer becomes a character, and actually turns malevolent. The idea touched a nerve that spawned an incredible number of spin-offs, most notably the Terminator movies, in which the idea is inverted (after the first movie), and the computer (machine) actually becomes a hero.In WALL-E, what happens is we get the first love story between two pieces of technology, and the question is seriously raised about the meaning of love and humanity. The possibility of full-bodied in-love droids that actually strive to save humanity make a very clever point that technology is not necessarily evil, it only becomes evil with careless use or lack of control. The love story is incredibly touching because it occurs between objects that are the product of human creation. The whole idea is really original.Add to this all of standard technical brilliance that we know of Pixar--awesome animation, music, etc., and WALL-E simply outdoes anything that Disney has done recently. It is rare to encounter a movie that is simply mind-boggling because of its originality.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Brilliant animated science-fiction film with a strong message,"There's not much I can add after almost a thousand reviews. I agree with the collective wisdom of IMDb users. This is a wonderfully written and beautifully animated science-fiction movie with lovable, human-like robot characters.Yes, I suppose children might enjoy this film, but it is also aimed directly at adults. None of the characters in this movie are children (of the human, animal or robot kind). As charming and cartoonish as it is, ""Wall-E"" is a rather intelligent, harsh indictment of American consumer culture. One of the themes is environmentalism; another is humanity's growing dependence on its machines.A huge amount of work must have gone into inventing and creating this film's version of the future Earth, and also the world of ""Axiom"". The way the creators were able to anthropomorphise the robots was remarkably creative. The movie reflects our own ambivalence: we love these little bots, but at the same time we see the danger. Can we ever live without them?Six years after release, this film still delights and amazes. It's difficult to think of a single thing to criticize about it.I can't say that I am a die-hard Pixar fan per se. Many of their films (eg Cars) don't work for me at all. This is one of the best of the bunch, right up there beside ""Finding Nemo"". Kudos to Andrew Stanton.After seeing it three times now, I'm tempted to give it 10, but 9 will do for now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
So cute!,"I can watch this over and over again. It's just the most adorable film I've ever seen.Even without substantial dialogue, you can really sense the emotions throughout these two robotic creatures.

Pixar's Masterpiece in Animation and Storytelling,"Wall-E isn't just a movie; it's a triumph of animation and storytelling that cements Pixar's status as a true master of cinematic magic. Released in 2008, Wall-E took audiences on an unforgettable journey to the stars, blending environmental caution with an endearing love story, all without much dialogue. It's incredible how Pixar managed to create such a powerful emotional experience with a robot that barely speaks. Wall-E doesn't just entertain; it leaves you moved and, somehow, feeling a little more connected to humanity.The film begins on an abandoned Earth covered in waste, where we meet Wall-E, a lone trash-compacting robot with a heart of gold. Pixar's animation brings Wall-E's desolate world to life with stunning detail, showing Earth as a haunting landscape filled with towering piles of garbage. But the real magic happens when Wall-E ventures into space, following EVE, a sleek probe droid sent to find signs of life. The animators outdid themselves here, creating breathtaking visuals of space from distant galaxies to shimmering stardust that make it feel as vast and mysterious as it should be.Pixar's ability to make Wall-E and EVE so expressive and relatable is nothing short of genius. Their interactions, though often wordless, are filled with more heart than most live-action romances. You feel Wall-E's loneliness, his hope, his wonder, and his love. The animators infused so much personality into their designs and movements that you're drawn in by their simple, pure connection-proof of Pixar's talent for bringing inanimate objects to life with soul.The themes in Wall-E are just as impactful. It's an eye-opening vision of a future where Earth has been discarded, and humanity's survival depends on finding a way back. But the film balances its warnings with optimism and hope, showing how even the smallest acts of care and connection can revive something that was thought lost forever.With Wall-E, Pixar didn't just raise the bar-they launched it into orbit. This is a movie that appeals to all ages and reminds us of the beauty of our world, the power of love, and the importance of taking care of what we have. It's a visual and emotional masterpiece that remains one of the greatest achievements in animation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The best film for this time,"This movie seems to get more and more relevant every year. Definitely, there is something to think about for everyone who looks at it. This movie should be shown to children. Inteesny, funny, and of course for thought.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Essentially a sweet and very involving robot love story where the two robots have the task of getting humans back to Earth that they've left behind temporarily,"First things first  to be accurate, the film's pronounced 'Woll.Ee' not 'Wally', like the red-and-white stripy shirt boy and his dog that you were endlessly searching for on your telly screen and in the books as a kid in primary schoolThe voice acting is really good. Wall.E, himself isn't completely silent  he does vocalise some few words(like 'Eve-a!'), while others are bleeps. EVE( a vegetation evaluator), who he loves, talks in a computerised robot voice which sounds really effective. The Captain on board the ship, and some other humans the little robot meets all have natural delivery in terms of their voices.Pacing/Plot: Quite simply the plot is: Earth's been overtaken by our own produced rubbish that's piled up really tall over the years, so all humans have fled to space but they've left behind the title robot to clear up after humankind have abandoned the planet  and he's only got a cockroach for company. He's later joined and falls for a female shiny white robot then tries to rescue her when she's taken back into space on board a vast space cruise line. It seems inspired by old sci-fi films when Wall.E later ends up in space on board the vast cruiseliner and the film here turns softly but effectively satirical. Maybe quite anti-consumerist I'd say, especially when you get to see the appearance of the humans in space. Yes, it has a green message but it's not of the preachy heavy-handed kind Happy Feet had towards it's ending, in my opinion, and it's set in a realistic context for the film  700 years in the future! It constantly engages by scenes with even just with the lonely Wall.E and his cockroach being funny and sweet, due to his clumsiness, so there's a fair bit of slapstick and clever sight gags. Adventure, romance and a critique on our society and lifestyle all blend together well.Animation: Wow! Wonderfully realised visually  standout scenes for me is when Wall.E's followed into space and we see Saturn's rings and the Sun, goodness! The character design of our robot hero isn't original as it's a lot like Short Circuit's Johnny Five meets a robotic E.T. but even so he's still lovable all the same. EVE's egg-shape and general shiny white design is very good. Backgrounds are also detailed and I like the subtle way their personalities are shown just by their nuances in movement.Music: I love the score and the use of songs from Wall.E's favourite film in his lair: Hello Dolly.Overall: A dazzling animated story with a welcome subtlety done green message at it's core, and a lovably sweet robot. What sets this apart from loads of other CGI films released from other companies is it feels as if a lot of passion and inspiration created this and the film truly has a heart too, as big as it's own binoculars-head hero. This matches or even surpasses Pixar's own high standard laid down by the studio since their 90s output, in my opinion. I also loved the hilariously funny Presto short with the Magician and his rabbit before the film.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"One Of A Kind, To Be Sure","Some movies are good because they take a tried and true formula and add a unique twist. Others are good because they do something completely different and unexpected. ""Wall-E"" falls squarely into the latter category.The story is simple: In a post-apocalyptic world, a trash-collecting robot (WALL-E) wanders the desolate terrain. One day, a visitor (EVE) descends from the heavens and involves WALL-E in a wild adventure to once more bring life to the barren planet.This entire film is so different from anything Disney/Pixar had produced to that point, yet the overall quality is still top-notch. The story is simple (yet charming), the characters are innocent (halfway in you'll forget that you're essentially watching robots), and the visuals are both unique and spectacular at the same time.Perhaps the hallmark of this fun little film, however, are the numerous sights gags it perpetuates. The Disney/Pixar team knew that since the fare was robots, the ""goofiness"" factor could be upped for this effort. On multiple occasions, whether you're four or forty-four, you'll find yourself chuckling at something that just transpired on-screen.Thus, I highly recommend watching this film with the kiddie of your choice. It toes the line between the intellectual humor of Toy Story and the slapstick of Finding Nemo, all the while providing genuine laughs and heart along the way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The worst from Pixar - a very disappointed fan,"When I read the reviews stating that Wall-E was the best movie from Pixar yet, ""a masterpiece"", I got really anxious to see it! How could they beat ""Monsters Inc"" story, or ""The Incredibles"" graphics, or ""Findind Nemo""'s magic? Well... they didn't. I really started watching this movie with an open mind, but from the tedious intro, to the completely forced romance, the boring non-existent story and up to the stupid final I was utterly and completely disappointed. I think the rave reviews come from the kind of people for whom whatever's new is the best thing ever.Wall-e falls in love in a second, with a robot the audience has never seen. Whenever I see this kind of romance in a live movie, I know I'm watching a bad romance.All the humans are extremely fat. All of them. They can't even walk. Men and women. So that means no one is having sex? It's just not realistic. Sex is a basic need. At least for men it is! ;)--- SPOILER ALERT ---Read the following sentence only if you've already seen the movie... When the humans get back to earth, at the end of this drivel, they are happy to find that earth is a complete dump?! There's no way to survive like this!

Good Disney film,"Good film. One can empathize with WALL-E, as he has been alone for what seems like the greater part of 700 years, toiling away at work with nothing but the comforts of his makeshift home to give him some small pleasures and distractions in life (although his morning sluggishness is due to his depleted power, we can't help but relate with those mornings WALL-E finds hard to get out of bed). When he sees the sleek, powerful EVE, it's quite understandable that he is captivated by her. EVE, on the other hand, is completely focused on work (her ""directive""). While we can see her personality come through when she enjoys the freedom of flying around upon her arrival, she is determined to fulfill her mission.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

And humans have degenerated into fat people who are completely dependent on the help of computers even for basic necessities like eating, drinking, using the toilet, etc. Moreover, from childhood, they have been educated by computers to consume, consume and consume even faster. Although this world is not as gloomy as that in ""The Matrix"", it's actually not much different. Fortunately, humans haven't lost their nature; they've just ""forgotten"" it.

Stars,"This movie is so nice. And heart-touching. I've understood the whole film, even if there are just actions and no dialogue. This is the first ever robot movie that made me cry so much. I loved the part where I got to have many realizations in my life as well. I realized that we all have different natures in life. One can say that she's living her life even if she's just on a chair, having her comfiest comfort, watching a movie, and eating snacks. One says she's having the best life when she's exploring something new. I realized that it's different depending on one's perspective. It's different that for some, they realize that they want or have the best life when they reach something like a goal that is beyond their comfort zone. Just like Wall E and the one who became lovers. I have realized that life is really great because there are more things to explore in it. As long as you have money, well, in making money, your journey to it will experience different explorations, and that is great. I, as a person, believe that we are not the problem, but the environment of where we are. We don't feel much of our value if we are in the wrong environment. But because of this movie, I have realized that it's not solely because of the environment; we can become a contributing factor to its change too. We can contribute something for its betterment, for it to become what we want to be for the people and for ourselves. Yes, it is hard at first, and I deeply admire those people who fight for change-the right change. One step can become a significant step, and a ripple effect will follow. Lastly, I have realized I need to contribute more to our 17 sustainable development goals. Gosh, I have never realized that I will cry because of a robot movie. This is a very cute movie.

A mysterious new robot comes to earth and a fantastic love story ensues. The story itself AND the way it's told are flawless. Perfect.

One of the sweetest pleasures in cinema,"Wall-EI have mixed feelings about the Pixar-Disney films, on the plus side they can be very creative on some aspects, on the negative they can be terribly bland. Devotees of 'The Lion King' will surely know what I mean. I will confess of having avoided these kiddie flicks on recent years, mostly due to the fact they are, well, kiddie stuff. The film Robots is a clear testament to film-making that centers on laughs, famous names, and drenches itself in morals to try and justify it all. The Incredibles was a success for me, but even Matt Goering needed the help of some 007-style action scenes and Samuel L. Jackson. Wall-E is a winner, and he did it by himself. This feature includes a clever element omitted from most animated films; borrowing themes familiar to those fans of sci-fi literature, such as myself. Reading between the junk-collecting title character's daily routine, and frequently amusing anecdotes; his exploration through space and encounter with a distant human colony - there is satire, and a message about taking care of the world, and of ourselves. However, the film avoids being moral, something that would otherwise have made me cringe. They are instead presented subtly, allowing the focus to be on what Disney movies should be about - adventure. The story begins hundreds of years into the future, where earth has been polluted beyond repair, and the humans have fled into an outer-space, seemly utopian civilization on board a space-craft. But as the humans fled, they had forgotten to switch the off button on one poor robot, WALL-E (It's not really worth mentioning that Wall-E is not a given name, but is a type of robot). And throughout the centuries, where he continues the job he's been programmed to do - squashing rubbish into cubes, and stacking them - the Artificial Intelligent piece of metal had learned to develop feelings, namely, loneliness. Then comes along Eve, a reconnaissance robot sent by the humans - a robot who also develops emotions - and chemistry develops. The main drive for the remainder of the story, is driven by the curiously believable romance between these two machines. Perhaps it is the pet-like traits of these robots, or maybe its just they are so cute. The romantic relationship takes the limelight of the film, whilst it is side-lined in just about every other similar movie. There is a sweetness about these characters who barely shares any dialogue. As an audience, we witness the birth of love, without it having to be explained to us. The journey itself is, also, a cut above most of the recent animations. I was worried that the slow-paced, dialogue-less opening could lose the attention of children, but I for one loved it. Few characters in have won over audiences without dialogue. Eve was then an appropriate counter-part: she is white, new and shiny, whilst he is rusty and breaking apart. He likes to build things out of his junk collection, whilst she does not hesitate to destroy things with a plasma gun. A girl that's way out of your league - ha-ha. But what is touching was that he doesn't give into the fear of being obliterated, and one moment when he tries to approach her whilst shaking all over, was by far our hero's greatest act of courage. The later scenes where he fights evil robots are nothing in comparison. Yes, there was the essential slapstick battle sequence demanded by the little audience members, yet it was not milked - in fact, it was cut short. Perhaps the director was conscious of the dumbing-down consequence that non-serious fight scenes can produce. Nonetheless, the second half is a lot less interesting - partly Hollywood demanding action, and partly Pixar following its usual guidelines. I forgot to mention one thing - Wall-E has a pet cockroach. An interesting touch, isn't it? Even a disease-infested bug can be cute in the Disney-Pixar world. Not the best animated movie ever made, but a noble effort. Its part sci-fi, part family fair, but I received it best as a romance, and so my advice is take your girlfriend. So that's enough hugger-mugger from me, so I'll conclude this with some inspired sentimentality: with everything going on, the future looks to be grim. However, there is only one real thing we really need, love. Love is something that humans can often be too clever, or too sophisticated, or too lazy to remember. But if in this great big universe, one tiny little machine can learn love, perhaps it could teach us, or at least remind us. So, remember love one another - it's not rocket science.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Jam-packed with plot and viewer-friendly ecology-minded messages...perhaps too jammed,"Disney/Pixar animation at its most beautiful, but also at its most annoying. In Earth's distant future, trash and refuse has replaced all life on the planet; a waste-reclamation robot (with human emotions and feelings) has a daily routine of condensing and piling up the junk-cubes into skyscrapers made of garbage. WALL·E is an amusing, resourceful, lovable hunk of metal and rubber who is also something of a happy hoarder (his collection includes Christmas lights, utensils, a cigarette lighter, a video-cassette of ""Hello, Dolly!"" and, most importantly, a small plant still encased in dirt). Director Andrew Stanton also co-wrote the screenplay with Jim Reardon (based on Stanton and Pete Docter's idea), and they have fashioned a mind-blowing, heart-tugging first act. WALL·E, whose only friend is a winsome little cockroach (!), is visited one day by EVE, an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, who inadvertently leads (and lifts) WALL·E off the Earth and into the galaxy (the film's peak moment) where he discovers obese, computer and soda-addicted humans living on a space station. This is arguably the moment where the movie begins losing some of its heart; Stanton shoots-up on the imaginative possibilities of the circumstance, revving the pace and sending the editing into overdrive (possibly to compensate?). There's a revolt of man-serving machines, a Captains' mutiny with the main power source, comedic elements derived from various popular films, and WALL·E's desire to be reunited with EVE (which is all we really care about). The film goes out of its way to engage younger viewers by immersing itself in cute behavior, cute responses and one-liners, and manic action-action-action. Cuteness is a prerequisite for Disney/Pixar, of course, but Stanton really lays it on thick delivering several false endings, all manipulated for that ultimate sentimental sock. Pixar Goes Green! And that's fine, if not especially amusing. The wondrous, wonderful first half-hour was still far more engaging. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar's 'Inconvenient Truth'?,"Good flick. Nicely done from an art/production design standpoint as expected, with nods to 2001/Star Wars/Silent Running, etc. Sweet moments with just music and barely any dialogue, which made this feel a lot like a Pixar short sometimes. The Spork bit is one of the best moments in the movie...and sound designer Ben Burtt even sneaks some of his old R2-D2 effects into Wall*E's vocabulary.Not sure, however, that I jive with some reviewers out there who are calling it 'an instant classic' and 'epic', etc. Maybe they see WALL*E as a pro-environment, anti-big-corporation message? They could be forgiven for doing so. It's a great movie, but I wonder whether some people out there are perceiving it as an affirmation of an agenda and are aggrandizing the movie for the wrong reasons.Don't get me wrong. I appreciate the movie's message that Americans need to get off their asses, unplug from the screens and ear buds and associated inputs, and go out for a walk, plant a garden, or fall in love. And yes, some of our landfills might encroach on our cities someday soon (fed in no small measure by Happy Meal toys from Pixar movie tie-ins). WALL*E comes just short of getting unbearably preachy about all this, but I worry that many reviewers will pick up the preachy ball and run with it, and will laud WALL*E as ""Pixar's Inconvenient Truth"".Maybe I'm over-thinking things too much. At the very least, Advocates of Morbidly Obese Individuals or the 'Gravity Challenged' (are they a group yet? If not, they will be) are gonna be boycotting this flick.

I think it just highlighted how wasteful we are and how fat, lazy and complacent we have become as humans. I honestly think Pixar had an ulterior motive in this one and figured a lot of parents would be seeing this with their kids. The kids would see cute robots but ultimately the parents would see what slobs we are. This is just my opinion....don't hate me.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
addressing our probable outcome,"WALL-E is just a sweet movie, which deals on the loneliness and determination of a singular robot that developed sentience while watching videos of human interaction and listening to music. WALL-E was the only one of his kind left on Earth and he kept at his job even though others like him have been unable to keep up and have become rust and parts for WALL-E to use to carry his singular assignment as a cleaner of the earth, along with him is a friend, a cockroach which WALL-E adores.WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth Class) developed a romantic endeavor with another robot named EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), a romance that Andrew Stanton (a Christian) the writer/director came up with, as he viewed WALL-E's loneliness like that of Adam in the Bible and how God gave him Eve as a companion, so the name of WALL-E's companion was named EVE in reference to the Eve in the Bible.With Stanton wanting WALL-E as a box with no mouth or nose and EVE as an egg with no mouth or nose the animators watched a series of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin movies for almost a year to be able to learn how to create emotions silently.WALL-E's plot is about a singular robot that in 2805 was still cleaning the earth after the humans were evacuated in 2105 to starliners.As the Earth was becoming a waste land humans had to be taken out of it so that it can be cleaned so when all human were gone, left behind were trash compactor Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth Class (WALL-E) robots, to clean the Earth but as the years passed all other robots broke down leaving except one, so this singular WALL-E robot carried on with the earth cleaning task.One day a beautiful robot named EVE came to Earth, and WALL-E fell for her; although she was a hard nut to crack, WALL-E triumphed but when her task was trying to set them apart, WALL-E followed her to a starliner where humans were, there we come across other plots and subplots concerning the humans if there are to go back to earth or not.WALL-E deals with a lot of major issues that we are either facing or going to face in the nearest future, the problem of waste management, laziness, obesity, consumerism and environmental problems that the world will be facing if we don't sit up.WALL-E won numerous accolades, including an Oscar for Best Animated feature, it was also ranked number movie in the 2010 Times magazine movie of the decade. It currently holds a 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 8.5/10. It was also a commercial success.WALL-E is one of those movies, which just stick with you, the nostalgia feeling it delivers, the innocence of love, and the determination of a singular robot, WALL-E is a movie that will always stand as one of the best Disney/Pixar has to offer.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

The Best Pixar Film,"When I first heard that there would be little to no actual dialogue in the first 40 minutes of Wall-E, I was skeptical. But then I remembered what is considered the greatest Science Fiction movie of all time (and as a matter of fact, AFI just named it that), 2001: A Space Odyssey. That also had almost no dialogue for the first 40 minutes. So my opinion changed and my view of the movie changed. I thought that Pixar was going to take a risk by doing this, and leave behind the typical kids movie. And the movie itself is not a typical kids movie. It passes as a very good Science Fiction movie as well as an animation movie because it gives us a scary look into the future, but done in a humorous way. Buy n' Large, which is obviously supposed to be Wal-Mart, takes over Earth in every way, economy and government. Soon, because they pollute the Earth so much, they have to send the human race out to space, and they'll have robots clean it up. Enter the title character. Wall-E is the last of his kind, and because he's been alone for so long, he develops a personality, collecting the trash and bringing them to his home. Soon Eve comes, and becomes Wall-E's love interest. When she discovers a plant, it's off to space. Again, Wall-E comments on society of today by showing how lazy we are coming and then at one point, all humans know how to do is sit in a hover chair and watch T.V., and drink meals from a cup. Wall-E of course brings light to not only the captain of the ship Axiom, but to a few passengers as well, who even though have lived their entire life upon the ship, failed to recognized they had a pool. But in the end, Wall-E isn't about trying to warn us about the future and what we will become. Above all, it is a love story, as most Disney movies are. But this one is one of the best, right up there with Beauty and the Beast, because it is a universal love story. The robots Wall-E and Eve don't necessarily speak a certain language, it is through their attitude and movements that they tell their love story. And of course being Pixar, it is an incredibly fun ride, with great funny moments (like the captain researching Earth). A truly great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Amazing Pixar film! a Must see.,"Let me first say i saw the midnight showing, so hopefully i can retain the beauty of this film. Also this is my first review, so hopefully you find out what you wanted to here. Its surprising how much emotion can be conveyed with two simple words. And from the few words, Pixar captures the audience to have more emotion for the two robots, than any of the humans. It was so easy to relax, enjoy and to suck in all of the wonders of the film.This movie is a pleasure to watch as the animation is fluid and just excellent. The film is riddle with irony, symbolism, and parallelism, which many will enjoy, whether or not you catch on to them. But what makes this movie is characterization and the connection you will feel with a robot.This is an instant classic, in which i am planning on getting the DVD.

It did not look like a typical animated film at all, and seemed like a huge undertaking, even for as big a giant as Pixar is in the realm of animation. But imagination and originality is something Pixar has always been known for (as well as making great movies aimed at all ages), and this film is no exception.WALL-E tells the story of a robot who seems to be one of the last inhabitants living on Earth. He spends his days collecting immense amounts of trash, and then compacts it into smaller squares of garbage that he ends up building into large structures. He collects specific items that he categorizes in his pseudo-trailer home, and watches Hello Dolly! at night, hoping for some sort of interaction with something other than a cockroach. And as anyone can predict, his prayers are answered in the form of the female robot EVE who lands on Earth to carry out a classified mission. And getting to know her is only the start of this robot's adventure.I had my doubts, but Pixar have really outdone themselves with this one.Without a shadow of a doubt in my mind, WALL-E is one of the most original pieces of cinema I have ever encountered. While not necessarily a silent film, the film features very little talking, and mainly features characters who speak to each other through machine noises and the use of their name (and WALL-E and EVE are not the only two kinds of robots featured in the film). But one would be hard-set to notice the lack of dialogue because of how enthralling the film is. From the mere first glance at WALL-E, the film draws the audience into this little robot's role in life, and his inevitable adventure. This could have easily been made into a gimmicky film, but Pixar never lets it stray too far from the epic scope it set out for the film from the opening shot onwards.The story, without ruining it, is very simplistic. But not in a way that will make people easily write it off. Rather, it is simplistic in how very uncomplicated it is. The characters of WALL-E and EVE can only show so much depth, and for that reason, there is not a whole lot to their story. Yes, there are some genuinely moving scenes I thought impossible to see coming from CGI-animated robots, but this film manages to make a whole group of robots emote in all kinds of ways. There is a bit of social satire thrown in for good measure as well, which helps deepen the spiritual conscience of the film, and helps flesh out a few of the key points WALL-E's chosen career and lifestyle seem to nod at. But as said, the film never gets too ahead of itself, and never once bites off more than it can chew. It knows what it wants to accomplish, and it manages to do it very easily.But with it being a Pixar film, there is a certain assumption that the animation will be pristine and nearly perfect. WALL-E, although released a mere year after the visually stunning Ratatouille, could be the best any of their films have ever looked. The vast landscapes (both on Earth and through space), diverse range of characters and the breathtaking amount of action taking on place are all nearly jaw dropping. Watching the scene with WALL-E flying through space is a marvel all on its own, if only for the brilliant usage of so many colours. The animation is so detailed that you can see the ingrained dirt and patches of rust that cover WALL-E's body. Pixar just keeps upping their ante in how marvellous their animation is, and I can only imagine it is going to get better as the years go on.What truly sets this film apart from others, is that it does not try to be different. It feels just like any other Pixar film, and despite the lack of dialogue, is just as funny and charming as the rest of them. Somehow, director/writer Andrew Stanton has realized that the simplicity of the film can only help build up its charm and real world wit. The film is crafted in a way that makes it nearly impossible not to fall in love with and hang on every moment that passes. WALL-E wants to be seen on the same level as other animated flicks, and it looks like the filmmakers spent an immense amount of time making the film accessible to anyone, dialogue plagued or not.The film is not perfect however. The ending seems a little forced, and a touch silly (especially based on what the audience learns over the course of the film up to that point), but the genuine sense of adventure is enough to not make a big deal out of it. As well, even though the movie practically flies through its running time, there is still a bit of dull weight in certain scenes. They accomplish what they are set out to do, but there was more than a few instances where specific scenes could have been cut, and the film would have turned out the same way.But even through its imperfections, the film sucks you into its naive and adorable world where our hero is a robot who makes robot noises and says his own name a lot. It speaks absolute volumes that this film can be made and not make anyone at Pixar or Disney break a sweat. WALL-E is one of the most original and heartfelt films of this or any other year, and skipping it would be a disservice to the animation genre. It is one hell of a cute and funny movie, and easily one of the year's best.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
indeed such a touching cinema,"AdamZ. Jan 12, 2009 9 It stuns me to think that there are actually people out there in the world that did not enjoy this movie. What Pixar, Stanton and his team have created is a heart-warming throwback to the core values of what we as humans should be embracing, purity and at the centre of that, love. Stanton has achieved that through a most unlikely but completely enchanting and lovable character in Wall-E. To watch him potter around a once rich and teeming landscape now reduced to a desolate wasteland by the greed and inaction of the human race, casually collecting up trinkets of a lost civilisation along the way and enjoying the 9 to 5 job for which he was created was nothing short of a delight. To watch him develop a sense of his duty to the human race was profound. No mention needs to be made of the films visual qualities - it is as expected. Stanton delivers also on the speed and pace of the movie. You are never left wanting. The movie opens with the unsettling imagery of the earth's landscape in complete disarray. It is familiar and yet disturbing all at once. Earth is a complete mess and has been so for 700 years previous, save for the extraordinary efforts of the little leading robot. You literally love Wall-E at first site and for the more jaded among us, grow to love him as the movie progresses. Wall-E is to modern cinema what Chaplin was to pantomime. This cannot be understated and the significance of Wall-E's on screen presence, by and large, should have every audience member captivated. By and Large? Possibly an acronym for the films corporate villain, BnL? The addition of EVE served to provide the audience with the perfect foil for Wall-E's doting eccentrics and the perfect partner it seemed for Wall-E himself. A classic example of the lady and the tramp, a lovable charming lout, rough around the edges, trying to and succeeding in, gaining the affections of the upper class lady. The two fit perfectly despite coming from obviously different environmental backgrounds. The scenes involving EVE and Wall-E are pure cinematic genius. You find yourself asking if its possible to actually ""love"" a robot but in Wall-E it is actually possible. It is initially an alien notion but you find yourself warming to him when you gradually discover you indeed share many of the same affections and traits. His dance routine with the hubcap, the way he tried on the bra, keeping the box and throwing the diamond ring away and the way he grasped at his metallic appendages while watching the old VHS being notable examples. Scenes involving Wall-E's complete selflessness are tear jerking and you cant help but feel for the little guy when, having been rescued from deep space ejection, he crawls, mangled and critically damaged, to retrieve the plant that the future of the human race depends on. Handing it to EVE, he says ""Dirrr...ect..ive"" and at that moment the only ""directive"" in your subconscious is to burst out crying. Even more upsetting was the sad realisation that having been repaired and rebooted by EVE upon return to earth, Wall-E seemed never to be himself again, his memory apparently having been erased. An electronic kiss from EVE restores his memory and finally we, on screen cast included, all breathe a sigh of relief. Without drawbacks as such to comment on, the only ""drawback"" I can see is that there are actually people out there who didn't love this film to bits. Those in this category need to ask themselves some very hard questions indeed!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Difficult to review,"I am torn about how I felt about this movie. On the one hand, I really liked how the filmmakers were able to get you to sympathize with an animated robot and really root for him. This was very well done, and much of the animation was stunning. In many ways, this was a very impressive effort.However, I also found the film to be excruciatingly slow at certain points. It seemed as if the filmmaker felt that the audience was too stupid to make inferences about the characters unless he drew scenes out for a very long time and beat them over the head with it. I found myself becoming increasingly bored as the movie wore on. If it had been edited down 30 minutes, it would have been a much better movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Best Pixar/Animted Movie Ever Made,"I just got home from seeing this and all i have to say is amazing. This movie didn't have much talking in it but you could just see b the way the characters moved and there facial expressions exactly what was going on.Everything in this movie was well done, the storyline, the animation, the scenery, and of course all of the emotions the characters showed.There is no way that this movie could be done any better. Pixar has done it again but with a different formula for success. Instead of using certain actors for personality traits the characters had the traits in the way they were created. All i have to say is:AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Confusing...,"I went to this movie with another adult and 6 grandchildren expecting to have a thoroughly enjoyable experience. It didn't happen that way. The children were 3 yrs to 13 yrs, 4 girls and 2 boys. All of them very movie-oriented. NONE of them thought it was good; it was just OK. In my case, I thought at first that I was just too tired to follow the story; then the other adult that attended with me asked if there was a plot, so that confirmed to me that I wasn't too far off.The positives: Great computerized graphics and sound effects.My favorite part of the movie was the clip from ""Hello Dolly"" and Wall-E's sentimental feelings towards it.My real favorite part of the whole experience was the intro cartoon. I laughed so much through it I expected to move right into a great movie. Was disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One of the best of the year!,"First of all, how come there are so many people that think a new movie can't be an instant classic, nor can it surpass other great movies made in the past? Half of the '1' comments report that the movie was good, but they just voted low to bring down the rank. I feel that eventually, there will be a film that portrays enough to be better than some of the best. Whether Wall-E is it, is questionable. However, I don't think people should vote a 1 just to bring down the ranking of this film - the ultimate flaw of this site. Too many people are afraid of their favorite movie being taken over by something else. Vote on the movie, not on its ranking. People also need to stop complaining about the ""green"" material in the movie. Seriously, get over it.That said, this movie is a glorious achievement. Nothing has been characterized so much by using so little, especially in animation. The CGI is second to none, and I fell in love with the characters from the start. It's one of those movies that has a little bit of everything: laughs, cries, surprises, drama. The storyline is seamless, and I didn't get bored at all. I walked out truly mesmerized.The downfall of the movie, if any, is the target audience. Being an animation and made by Pixar, many children are expected to see the movie. However, I don't think children have the mind-set for this film. It is so much more than animation; more than silly humor with silly cartoon actions. It is a drama, with meaning behind everything - something a child can't yet recognize. It may be difficult for a child to watch without lots of dialogue, so you shouldn't be surprised if your child falls asleep while watching.An Oscar for best animated film is without a doubt. Bravo.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Possibly Pixar's Best,"PIXAR has made a long string of good movies. With the weakest being CARS, witch still was a good movie (just not perfection/near perfection like the rest) could there reputation hold up to the next movie.Do we need oxygen to live? I can't think of a bad part in this movie. There are some scientific errors beyond basic sci-fi, but the movie is good enough to look past them. The little dialog beyond some robot designating things such as ""Target"" or ""Foreign substance"" and a few commercials. One particular thing I enjoyed was when a space craft was passing the moon, you could see the Armstrong landing sight. Next to it was an add for a BUY-N-LARGE superstore.The animation was flawless. If I was looking at the images minus the people and some robots (not all however)I would swear it was live action.The sounds are going to win an Oscar. The music will be nominated (though I doubt it will win) I really doubt any movie will beat this for best animated feature film 2008. I wouldn't be surprised if it got nominated for best screenplay. I will defiantly by the DVD. So I have to wait till about November/December.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
I cant believe anyone human could've conceived this,"This film is just the animation i've been waiting to see, one that's as artistic visually as it is mentally, one that leaves you in running for tissues at the end and makes you think about the way you live your life or can send a message to the new generation.The short film at the beginning was perhaps even funnier than lifted, i wont spoil it for you but they should really have more of these before any animated film.I was starting to go that way where I thought Pixar was just all hype, their last two movies ratatouille and cars were extremely anticipated and I had problems with both, but with Rat i saw Pixar moving away from their usual ""Kiddie Flicks"" and started doing something with a little more edge.And here comes Wall-E, a film that even made me cry reading about it, and after i watched it I opened the floodgates that where my eyes.I thought the future was portrayed brilliantly, it was believable and made me a little scared of what we might become, I guess I don't really have anything else to say but this.If you don't cry at the end, whether it's over the environmental message, the vision of how technology could undo us all or the sensationally warm love story between two robots, then you weren't born with a heart inside you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Brilliant and Powerful,"My son wanted to see this, and so I looked it up on IMDb.com just to see what it was about. There was a lot of debate about it on the forum. A lot of people hated it and said they walked out; some were offended. This made me actually want to go see it. My favorite movies are written and directed by David Lynch, and so many people hate those movies. Sometimes I think that people just need their sh*t handed to them on a silver platter - they don't like to actually have to THINK about the plot. ...Not that Wall-E is hard to follow, but it takes a certain caliber of intelligence to appreciate a film that doesn't have any dialogue for the first 40 minutes. In my opinion, to pull off getting your audience to connect to a character so intensely without him saying a word of dialogue is just pure brilliance. This doesn't sound like a kid movie at all, does it? In fact, I do not think that young children could understand the true meaning of the movie.It's 700 years from now and we have Wall-E, a little trash compactor robot, whose only job is to clean the mess that the earth has become after humans have turned it into a giant landfill and abandoned it for another planet. There is no life on earth, no grass, nothing - just garbage. He spends his days doing this along with one cockroach who has also survived this ""apocalypse."" Occasionally Wall-E finds a piece of garbage he wants to keep, and he has his own little area which he made for himself where he keeps his collections. One day he finds a small plant growing in from the dirt and is amazed by it as he has never seen vegetation or life of any kind. He scoops it up and puts it in an old boot with some dirt and adds it to his collection. Wall-E realizes he is lonely when he finds a video tape and watches the humans dancing happily, holding hands and laughing. He sees that his ""hand"" (claw) is very similar to a human's hand, and wonders why he has to be alone.After a spaceship landing to deliver another robot sent to clean up the mess (EVE), Wall-E and EVE become friends and Wall-E shows her all of his collections, but when he shows her the plant, her ""body"" opens up, captures the plant, and then she shuts down completely. The spaceship returns to get her but Wall-E, determined not to lose his friend, holds onto the spaceship and flies into outer space.The destination is the other planet ""Axiom"" that the humans now live on. Everywhere you look is bright flashing lights and signs for food and shopping. The humans are all grotesquely overweight and travel around in hovering chairs. They are brainwashed and memorized by flashing screens in front of their faces - which from what I gathered seemed to be a combination TV/phone/ordering service. Consumerism is out of control as everyone is eating and shopping and glued to their TV screens. Up until now, there was no dialogue in the movie. The humans never get up from their chairs, and they never have to, because of the technology. There are robots everywhere doing all the work so humans are free to do whatever they want; however, all they want is to shop, eat, and watch TV. They are also obviously a lot less intelligent. At one point even, the captain of the ship needs to look at some sort of manual, and doesn't know how to read or even open the book - nor has he ever even heard of a book.Once they find out there is life on earth again, they are disappointed because they'll have to go back to rebuild it and give up their lifestyles.Throughout all of this the sub-plot is about the connection that Wall-E and EVE have, which is definitely more picked up by the kids. They get separated, and back together, one is in trouble and the other one helps ...etc. Sounds kind of cheesy when I describe, but was also extremely powerful in the ways in which it was conveyed. I won't write anymore, in the event that someone is still reading this and actually wants to see it. But seriously - go see it. ;-)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Great beginning, but disappointing","The first 30 minutes of this movie are brilliant: grim, funny, touching, wonderful visual style, and the wordless creation of a truly lovable character.Unfortunately, it's not only downhill from there, the last ten minutes completely undermine all that was brilliant in a desperate attempt to tack on a ""Hollywood ending."" The director, artists, and screenwriters hauntingly create a believable planet full of garbage, toxic dust storms so devastating that even the indestructible WALLE has to take shelter when they come up. WALLE's loneliness, his breaking heart, his consolation in an old artifact of a dead civilization, and his love for EVE are all heartbreaking, endearing, and carry their message lightly. I was swept away, and until WALLE left earth, I was ready to call this the second greatest animated film ever (after SPIRITED AWAY).But then it turns into a pretty standard quest film (see WIZARD OF OZ, FINDING NEMO, etc.). Worse yet, when AUTO very sensibly tries to stop the humans from returning to an uninhabitable planet, AUTO is suddenly the bad guy and the authors steal SHAMELESSLY from 2001.In the end, the humans win out, because if they do in Kubrick, they sure as hell HAVE TO in Disney. Our descendants go back to Earth, and GUESS WHAT! The brilliant opening of the film? Gosh, the filmmakers were just kidding, folks! The earth was habitable after all. All the pathetic roly-poly humans have to do is plant a few geraniums and the sun comes out! The earth turns green! The toxic storms disappear!I don't insist on popular entertainment being relentlessly down. But my message to the filmmakers: if you want the upbeat ending, then tone down the opening. If you want the grim opening, then the ending is a patent lie. Make up your minds.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
I was struggling to hold in my tears the entire time,"This is simply put a masterpiece. No other Pixar film comes close to this one. From the beginning of the film to the end I felt everything was so deliciously perfect, I was struggling hold in my tears. When something is as outstanding as this film turned out to be, I tend to be a crybaby. I just can't help it. When something so ingenious finds its way to the silver screen, I see it as a big victory. Having to live with all the garbage that's being produced in Hollywood, it's almost worth it, when something so beautiful contrasts to it and makes you think about what storytelling is all about. This movie had a strong influence on me, one that I've not felt since I saw the Mexican film, Voces Inocentes (which I highly recommend by the way). Why was it that good? Well, imagine pure eye candy for 98 minutes straight, a tear jerking love story with amazing characters and a rewarding plot.Loved it... Absolutely loved it. 10/10 Only downside is.. Pixar has raised the bar. It'll have to try and do equally as good films from now on or better and that's no easy task. But having seen this wonderful film, I'm full of hope and belief. Unless your heart's made out of stone, you can't help falling in love with this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
What's happening to Pixar?,"I loved Pixar. I grew up with Pixar. Both the Toy Stories, Finding Nemo, Incredibles, Cars, Monster's Inc. But since last year, there's been plenty of room for improvement. Ratatouille was so-so, 7.5/10. It had some good elements. I'm not sure if Pixar's growing down or if I'm growing up, but this movie was pretty dull. The short film at the beginning is wonderful, 10/10. But the movie itself was not. There were quite a few laugh out loud scenes. (Like when WALLE and EVE kiss with their foreheads and he floats away, or when he continually scratches M-Os floor.) But most of it was not entertaining. Keep in mind I'm almost 14, but I've been the biggest Pixar fan ever my whole life. So maybe this review isn't perfect for a 12-15 year old. It may be very well suited to a 5-8 year old.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Directed by AL GORE!,"While I enjoyed the movies score, animation and the inventiveness of the movie, WALL-E is hurt by the fact that the filmmakers shove the environmental message down our throats and the film succeeds in becoming a propaganda movie that will indoctrinate our children to the ""green"" cause. Humans in the movie, despite what the writer tries to tell us in a 10 second explanation for our girth, are depicted as obese, slovenly destroyers of the Earth and machines, with infant minds capable of learning, are the saviors for all mankind. Change the topic and set the movie in 1930s Germany and you the perfect goose-step movie. On a side note, I would be curious to know why the directors chose the movie ""Hello Dolly"" to be the inspiration for much of the main characters behavior. That movie seems a bit remote of a reference for the young children in the audience.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"An Almost Unbelievable Film... Yes, it's That Good","Not only do I find this to be one of the best films of all time, not only do I believe that it's the greatest Disney/Pixar film ever made, but I think it's a candidate for the best animated film in the history of movies.

Everyone needs to see this movie, there are no exceptions!The story is probably the most amazing part of the film.

An Adventure Beyond the Ordinar-E,"Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Ratatouille. It would be a bit of an understatement to say that Pixar has had its fair share of successes both critically and commercially. So its comes as no surprise then that their latest WALLE manages to not only outdo all of Pixar's previous attempts but it also manages top spot on 2008 score board. So effortlessly brilliant that it manages to captivate its audience even when no words are being spoken. Both WALLE and EVE will, undoubtedly go down in history as two of the most charming and influential characters of all time.Sure there is a dip in quality when both robots leave earth to board the mother ship but even with this dip it still manages to soar avoid all previous attempts at creating what I perceive as the perfect animated film only really out shone by Princess Mononoke 11 years before. For this generation at least WALLE manages to be the greatest animated film, filled with warmth and wonder and so brilliantly original. Miss this and your missing 08's very best.Disney and Pixar join forces for this computer-animated tale about a wide-eyed robot who travels to the deepest reaches of outer space in search of a newfound friend. The year is 2700, and planet Earth has long been uninhabitable.For hundreds of years, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) has been taking out the trash, and collecting precious knick-knacks in order to stave off the boredom of his dreary routine. Little does WALL-E realize that he has recently stumbled onto a secret that could save planet Earth, and once again make the ravaged planet safe for all humankind.When highly advanced search robot EVE makes friends with WALL-E and realizes the value of his remarkable discovery, she excitedly races back to let the humans know that there's hope for their home planet after all. But after centuries alone in space, WALL-E can't stand the thought of losing the only friend he's ever known, and eagerly follows her into the deepest reaches of space on the adventure of a lifetime. Along the way, the friendly trash-collecting robot who has always known what he was made for gradually begins to understand what he was meant for. Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton returns to the helm for this family-friendly sci-fi adventure featuring the voices of Fred Willard, Jeff Garlin, and Ben Burtt.The main credit deserves to go to mastermind director Andrew Stanton who so confidently glides these characters round their fully believable world. What with this being his third feature film there's no doubt he knows his movies. The cramped sub-section is quite easily forgiven thanks to WALLE powerful presence. Trust me this is a stunning film.VERDICT: Pixar are no strangers to success. With each film being stunningly entertaining. WALLE is no exception. The film is soaked in character with both WALLE and EVE being flawlessly charming. 2008 best film by far bold, beautiful achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Hugely entertaining with lots of messages,"As usual, WALL-E is a hugely entertaining animation movie brought to you by Disney/Pixar; however, I think WALL-E is much more than that: it has more messages than an average kid can get hold of. It deals with matters such as consumerism, people's reliance on technology and, of course, environmental protection.The film also embraces a number of classic objects (e.g. the Rubik's Cube) and movies (its reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey and its use of Hello, Dolly!). For the main story, I particularly like the romance between WALL-E and EVE: it's quite rare to have a love relationship between two robots being so adorable!I really, really enjoy WALL-E and would recommend it even to those who don't normally like sci- fi/animation movies!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Definitely did it for me! - An Instant Classic from Pixar,"After Finding Nemo I thought Pixar will never make another movie that will touch me as much as Marvin and Dory duo did. Wall-e is their successor, no question. Neither Incredibles, Cars or Ratatouille did it for me, but this year Wall-e has make a huge impact, not only for their amazing ""out of this world"" animation skills but also for the subtle but yet well made environmental message and the great ability of telling a meaningful story with few words.As soon as you see Wall-e on the screen, you can't help your self of being all cheering and caring for this little fellow. Great work developing this character and giving a heart and soul to a metal rubbish carrier. Just amazing!. The interaction Wall-e/ Eve was very cute and sad at the same time and the whole story keeps you laughing and entertained the whole 98 minutes.One of the great things about Finding Nemo which I think was the key of their success, was the fact that you actually care for the characters (especially no being humans) and that chemistry between the 2 very different main characters transcend beyond a clichéd romance. This is the case of Wall-e, a lonely character that for the first time in his robotic life he finally found a true friend. A simple but very profound story that works perfectly and is attractive, not only to kids but adults too.Wall-e is certainly a big triumph for Pixar and easily an instant classic of animation. I can see a season full of awards for Disney this year ahead.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"A highly entertaining, delightful science-fiction film that should not be dismissed as childish animation","I had heard about this film since quite a long time. My first thought was that could an ""Animation"" film supposedly created for kids work as a science-fiction movie for me ? After realizing the positive reception that this film had garnered, I decided to watch this. It would be a first for me in the sense that this was the first animated feature film that I would be viewing. And now, after having done that, I'm glad that I stepped into the territory of animation. WALL·E is not just a fun-filled animation movie meant for kids. It is at par with any feature film featuring big stars, sets and budgets ever made and is much better than most of them.The story is mainly told through visuals (although quite a bit of dialog creeps in during the last hour) and is best deciphered by the viewers themselves instead of being explained in such a review. It's set about 700-800 years into the future when Earth is in a mess, mankind has settled into space and the only moving thing left on Earth is a robot named WALL·E - this should more than suffice. Although there are no dialogs for a major portion of the film, it is much simpler to understand yet gets more complex as you start analyzing it in detail. This kind of treatment comes across as far more effective (at least for me) than say the one in 2001: A Space Odyssey which relies heavily on visuals leaving almost all of the deciphering to the viewer. As such, WALL·E is as simple or complex as you perceive it to be (although for the most part, it is the former).Despite having a short running time, the film packs in much more than many 2+ hour extravaganzas and credit for this must go to the writing, direction and editing - all absolutely first rate. The screenplay is packed in with twists and turns that rarely do we come across moments where nothing happens on screen. Some people have criticized as the opening minutes of the film boring - WALL·E apparently simply goes about doing his stuff. But according to me, those sequences do exactly what they're meant to do - they not only provide us with a glimpse of the everyday life of WALL·E (which is boring and mundane) but also gives an insight into WALL·E's loneliness as also the fact that he longs for companionship. The editing is flawless and one scene just flows into the next (many scenes spring up a surprise or two as well).Technically the film looks polished and the first twenty minutes will leave you wondering whether you're indeed watching an animation film or a shot live-action one. It's only when the humans enter the picture that you realize that its animation. The lighting in the future earth sequences is so live-action Esq, it makes those sequences all the more appealing. Just looking at the principal characters, you can see that it has taken a lot of effort.The main reason that the film works (for me at least) on such a huge level is (besides the story and treatment) is the main character WALL·E. He is simply put the perfect representation of an endearing, hard-working, polite yet cute robot representing humility and empathy. And his eyes are probably his best feature - they are so expressive that WALL·E doesn't need the mouth, shoulders, or even words to communicate or express the emotions that he goes through - the eyes say it all. In short he is the star of the film.WALL·E works on any and every level you want it to. What then is disappointing about this film ? Not much except that I was really looking forward to the music in the trailers being a part of the film and was heartbroken to find out that it wasn't. Also, the future humans could have been a bit better - they look far too cartoonish especially when compared to the film's look in the earth sequences. I guess I've become used to complaining which is what makes me feel as if something's missing from a movie. On the positive side, I believe this prevents me from rating a movie 10/10 at the drop of a hat. Nevertheless, these complaints do not take away from the fact that WALL·E is, in almost all aspects, a superior film and should not just be dismissed as an animation film meant for kids - it has a good message hidden inside it. And yes, this film has allowed me to open the doors of my mind to a new genre of movies - animated films. For me, Toy Story's next.Score: 8.7/10 (Rounded off to 9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Pixar's deepest, realistic, and most original masterpiece","Wall E is set far in the future... 800 years into the future. By that time, Earth would have been so full of mess that life could not be sustained on it. So, all the Earth's citizens left Earth on a spaceship cruise and left behind thousands of robots known as Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class. The robots are supposed to clean up the Earth, and once evidence of life is found everyone can return. But the program was forgotten, and there's only one sole remaining Wall-E.I've seen all of Pixar's work, and I can say very confidently that the first half hour of Wall-E is full of the darkest and deepest scenes Pixar has ever created. The story opens in a ghost city, revealing the life of Wall-E. His ultimate job is to... compress garbage. However, while rummaging through the garbage, Wall-E adds certain items he finds while rummaging through the garbage to his personal collection. Wall-E breaths life and personality and remains a lovable character while still being a robot. Throughout the story, Wall-E encounters Eve, a robot sent to search for life on Earth, and he falls in love (any further about the plot, and I'd be spoiling the film). But Wall-E has the personality, while Eve is... a robot. She's cold, cruel, and insensitive.What makes Wall-E untraditional to most cinematic masterpieces is its lack of dialog. The robots feelings are shown through a compilation of sound effects, body language, and expressions. Wall-E's emotions can always be detected by his binocular-eyes alone. The story is still told without much dialog between the main characters, and told rather effectively. Hey, I understood it much easier than Ocean's Thirteen, so the lack of dialog can't be that bad.Wall-E is among one of the few Disney-related Science Fiction movies, and the only one with an (mostly) ecologic theme. The ecologic theme is secondary to the love one, so it's not overwhelming (especially for children). The depiction of life in the far future is however depicted to be incredibly twisted, so some kids could get hung up on ""drinking"" lunch instead of enjoying the film. In a world controlled by computers, the human effort stands above all, and if kids end up watching this movie, they would realize it as well.All in all, Wall-E isn't an adventure anyone should miss. The movie isn't restricted to kids or to adults, which is a key label associated with Pixar. The movie is without error, and Pixar once again stole the big screen. I want this movie on DVD as soon as possible.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Nice kids movie, but not _that_ great","I feel compelled to write a review to balance out some of the hyperbole on these messages.This is a fine children's movie: humorous, with a good morality message. The animation is outstanding, at least as good as The Incredibles or Nemo.However, it is not a classic picture for most adults, for several reasons: The plot focuses mostly on robots, which makes it hard for many to really get engaged. The humans in the movie are portrayed as clichéd caricatures, so extreme that it distracted me (where are the ""normal"" people ... no population is _that_ homogeneous?). The plot is very predictable and simplistic: a genuine classic movie would have a genuinely creative and interesting ending. The movie contains several ""car chase"" scenes that are very Hollywood heart-rate-increase boilerplate. The tear-jerking scenes are a dime a dozen.In summary: the movie has outstanding animation, and is a great kids tale, but this movie doesn't rank up there with 2001 or even ""The Incredibles"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
By far the best Pixar movie!,"Upon hearing, initially with shock, that Wall-E had been added to the Criterion Collection - I decided to rewatch this masterpiece. I am old enough that I saw the film in theaters but not old enough to properly appreciate it at that time. To be honest, I don't really know if I enjoyed it that much as a youngster. A lot of its deeper themes were lost on me.As an adult though, it was amazing! It full deserves being added to Criterion and I look forward to watching it again in the future. It has the biting commentary that is missing in many kid's films, particularly on obesity, purpose and the dangers of overconsumption and capitalism, that I found really refreshing. It's also got one of the best romance arcs I've ever seen. Would recommend for kids of all ages, or just us jaded adults that need a movie that just makes us smile, happy viewing!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Another fine movie from Pixar,"Pixar broke the mould with Toy Story by creating animated movies that are equally as enjoyable for adults as children. They have a craft for making their films enjoyable on both levels. I can only vouch for WALL-E from and adult perspective, but judging by the kids at the cinema they also thoroughly enjoyed the movie.WALL-E is somewhat different from many of the other Pixar movies in that it is much larger in scale. Whereas most of the other movies have been very much individual 'character' based movies this has bigger themes. It concerns a world which mankind have left due to pollution. WALL-E is seemingly the only robot that is left which is busily cleaning up the mess we've left behind. The humans have become grossly lazy on their spacecraft and send down robots to check on the state of the earth to see whether it is inhabitable again. They have been away for 700 years and are waiting for the environment to recover. Some of the images are quite thought provoking and portray a rather bleak version of the future.The main thread of the movie concerns the romance between WALL-E and EVE who has been sent to look whether plant life has returned to earth. As with most of the Pixar movies it's totally engrossing and you really care about the characters by the end of the movie. A very enjoyable movie and as usual with the Pixar movies the short beforehand (Presto) is superb as well. There's nothing to see during the end credits though this time although the end credits are very well done.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wall E A Much Better Than Expected Pixar Movie,"Wall E was a much better than expected pixar movie writer/director Andrew Stanton who has done a great job in making this movie about a lonely robot left on Earth to clean up the waste left by humans in the distant future. The cast of relatively unknowns proving their voices for the character except for Sigourney Weaver are excellent. At the heart of this film is a love story between Wall-E and a more advanced robot named Eve. The writers did a great job of fleshing out the character of Wall-E whose in it for the majority of the movie. You care about the lonely robot because all he wants more than anything is a friend. This movie has a little something in it for everyone humor, some action, drama, character development, and a touching love story. I was very impressed with this film and I can see why after seeing Wall-E why may critics and audiences mostly kids really liked this one. The film was a little slow in the beginning but the rest made up for it's one flaw. Overall Wall-E has humor, some action, great special effects, romance, and well developed characters you come to care about. So if you're looking for a good movie to watch with your kids. You can go wrong with this one. Much better than expected.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"A refreshing, limitless landmark","WALL-E is perhaps one of the most subversive films by Pixar Animation Studios and one of the most significant animated films in many years. The film is comprised of little dialog, breathtakingly clear, but often dirty visuals that contradict the bubbly, colorful palette of colors we're used to seeing in contemporary animation, and can be seen as a showcase for several motifs and deep themes.We open in the year 2805, where Earth has become a haven for mass amounts of garbage thanks to extreme levels of consumerism perpetuated by a massive corporation called ""Buy N Large."" Earth's population was evacuated in the early 2100's to reside in certain ships in space. Left behind were ""WALL-E"" robots, small trash-compactors that would make identical cubic blocks out of the trash left behind by humans before stacking them into gigantic skyscrapers. Eventually, all the bots died off, except for one, who is still mindlessly operating and compacting trash day-after-day.WALL-E lives in a storage truck, kept cozy by pieces from human civilization that bring him comfort. One day, he is brought more comfort by discovering EVE, a much-more advanced robot who is deployed from the Buy N Large spaceship to track down vegetation on Earth. WALL-E meets and is attracted by EVE, and the two form a bond, communicating through ambiguous sounds and the occasional disjointed line of robotic dialog.There is hardly any dialog during the first act of the film; the second act is populated by a bit more than the first and the third is largely devoted to speaking because our focus has shifted from the dilapidated Earth to the more populous Axiom spaceship. Much of the film is largely focused on showcasing the variety of sounds WALL-E and EVE make, leaving the viewer to utilize those little bits of sound as the main point of reference when it comes to trying to define the emotion and the feelings the characters are currently going through. The sound design was largely conducted by Ben Burtt, the so-called ""godfather of sound"" for the film industry, and his meticulous craft shows. A viewing of the making of WALL-E reminds - or perhaps informs us - that when animation is made, nothing has a sound. Animated character movements are, by default, silent and every sound, down to the footsteps, must be done in real life before being uploaded to the film itself. The meticulous craft of Burtt and the entire sound team is an act of devotion and perfection that may go noticed by an inattentive viewer.Returning to my point made about WALL-E being the most thematically heavy film Pixar has ever made, such themes are technological advances, mass-consumerism, Christianity, love, corporation-takeover, and conformity. Consider the Buy N Large, the massive store in the sky that caters to an obese population of men and women that ride around in hovering seats, consuming food and drinks out of a cup, and wearing whatever the loudspeaker tells faithful shoppers what to where. The scene exploring the Buy N Large warehouse is a fascinating but poignant look at the effects of mass consumerism in America. It shows the kind of thing we'd like to believe we're immune to as humans but, unfortunately, are not and can be manipulated and directed in ways we never truly thought possible.The film was directed by Andrew Stanton, who largely led the team in creating Finding Nemo, one of Pixar's most renowned pictures for its emotionally touching story and beautiful animation. Finding Nemo featured some of the best animation, I believe, the CGI world has ever seen, and WALL-E's grittier, darker animation is not to be dismissed either. Stanton and the team of animators capture the vast landscapes of Earth and its desolate state, as well as space and its limited state. The animation is put to an incredible effect and Stanton proves to be worthy of operating with the animation company.WALL-E, too, shows a future where conformity is incredible. Everyone wears the same thing, possesses the same features, operates with little individualism, and function in the way where laziness appears to be something of an achievement. This is a frightening feature in a kids film; one that I don't see many young children picking up instantly. This isn't just the part of the film that keeps adults awake but keeps adults questioning the future we may be in for.Furthermore, the film works beautifully as a tone-piece and an amazingly made film in terms of grandiose animation and sound design. Ben Burtt's sound design and meticulous craft in pairing each obscure movement with a practical sound is easily the strongest thing in the film. Despite the lack of dialog, the film never fails to engage a viewer by showing them an unconventional love story that is made unpredictable because the way that Wall-E and EVE communicate is nonlinear and often ambiguous. These ingredients make WALL-E a truly stunning piece of animated art.Directed by: Andrew Stanton.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Thoroughly enjoyable,"Despite having lead characters made out of metal and shiny plastic, this film has got heart & guts & balls. The visual detail is breathtaking and the animation damn near flawless. Just five minutes into the movie you already feel for WALL-E. No small feat, given that there are no supporting characters, except for a cockroach, and there is no dialogue, no voice-over. Then you realize that not only are you sympathizing with a robot - you are sympathizing with a robot that exists only as bits in a rendering farm. The level of craftsmanship here is amazing.Trigger happy EVE is one of the strongest female characters in film since Ripley in Alien. Note to film makers: strength is about being being independent. It is not about striking awkward martial arts poses in spandex or form-fitting leather outfits.It would have been so easy for the movie to portray humans as dumb and callous. But Pixar pulls it off with warmth and feeling. After 700 years on a never-ending cruise to nowhere, humans have grown fat and complacent, but they haven't lost their humanity.Certainly not for everyone and a bit sappy at times, this is a gorgeous film that shows even robots, nay, render farms can churn out compelling cinema with an emotional core (here's looking at you, George Lucas).",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Just magical.....this movie is pure art. I don't know why it hasn't seen more awards cause it is a masterpiece,"I feel like tearing up just writing this review. It is one of the best things I have ever seen on the big screen, probably is the best thing I have ever seen in cinema. Period. I saw this when I was 10 years old, and I have never forgotten how absolutely amazed I was by it. And my love and appreciation for this film has only grown over the years. When I have kids of my own, this will be one of the first movies I show them. Animation is art, and I will forever cherish this movie.Some people may say this movie is a bit preachy, but I think it tells a very important message. One that couldn't be more important today. Planet Earth is our home, and we should take care of it. Topped off with a cute robot love story, this movie is pure perfection. I love this movie so much. It's a shame it didn't gross more at the box office......",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
This is what movie making is all about!,"This is so far my favorite Pixar film. It expresses so much in its running time. It is truly a film for all ages and audiences that dazzles the eye and takes your breath away. The attention to detail is awesome which makes the slower pace of the first act of the film absolutely mesmerizing. And that is the key to Wall-E. While the storyline is trimmed down to razor tight telling (that is, not wasting time on what is not essential to the story and themes), it feels open and relaxing. Some of the best moments come when Eve and Wall-e simply fly together or gaze on the stars. The conflict in the movie grabs ahold of you and pulls at your heart strings while leaving a sense of wonder in you. That's because there is a sense of hope and love that permeates the story; exactly what you expect from a film primarily targeted for children. But adults will relate to because of the depth of the storytelling. Andrew Stanton and crew should feel great about what they have made here. It is not only good sci-fi and good animation, but it rejuvenates you while you watch it. My 4 and 3 year old absolutely love this movie and so do my wife and I.

Even mechanical hearts can love,"""WALL-E"" represents the perfect mix between innovation and tradition. Pixar, the supreme leader in computer animation, has conceived a feature film which expands animation to a technical level which had never been reached before while treating it with very simple narrative concepts, which we could recall from old silent movies from the era of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.The director of ""WALL-E"", Andrew Stanton, treats his movie as a huge tribute to science fiction, by inserting many different themes and concepts, such as robotics, interstellar travel, the apocalyptic concept of a desert Earth, mega-corporations and space colonization.""WALL-E"" is a family movie, but that doesn't necessarily mean that audiences have to content themselves with simple themes and ideas. And it's fine. But the fact that the movie works so well is intrinsically linked to the genius of Pixar's screenwriters. Those guys have effectively created a complex story with an extremely simple narrative structure.The story opens around year 2800. The first shot opens on a spatial background with planets and galaxies and the camera then moves to reveal the Earth. But is that really the Earth? A first look seems to show our planet enveloped in a yellowish atmosphere, contrasting with the ocean blue to which we're so accustomed. When the camera then zooms upon the Earth, our initial fears are confirmed: the whole planet is a huge desert, complete with totally empty cities and huge towers of garbage compacted in cubes. That sight fills the entire landscape.Those garbage towers are the work of WALL-E, the hero of the movie. For the last 700 years, his workdays are exactly the same: he picks up the garbage he finds (and he's far from lacking of work on that level), transforms it in huge cubes and organizes them in towers. But he keeps in his shelter a few objects which catch his attention and which he doesn't dare to sacrifice.And then one day, a huge rocket arrives from the sky. From it appears EVE, a female robot whose primary function is to inspect the Earth in order to determine if it can sustain life once again. The timid WALL-E makes contact with EVE and shows her his artifacts, among them is a small plant, an ordinary discovery for WALL-E, but a rather significant one for EVE.In less time that it takes to say it, the two robots find themselves aboard the giant spaceship Axiom, where human beings, now ridiculously obese, gelatinous and lazy, live in an Utopian lifestyle, courtesy of the Buy 'n Large mega-corporation.WALL-E and EVE live an extraordinary and thrilling adventure during which they will fall in love. Yes, you read that well. Not only do the robots in this movie have a well-defined gender, they are also able to express emotions as strong as love.Even if some of the robots in this movie have a language and a vocabulary as developed as humans, most of them communicate with only a few words, often pronounced in a slow and detached way. WALL-E, for example, reminded me of R2-D2, since he primarily communicates and expresses himself with electronic sounds rather than with syllables. And I think it's way better that way, because it makes him more innocent, more charming and more attractive than if he'd expressed himself with more words.The way that these robots express their state of mind lies mostly in specific movements, body language and facial expressions. For example, when WALL-E curls up his mechanical limbs towards his body while lowering his tremendous ""eyes"" (actually cameras), you don't need words to explain what he's feeling. That's the same situation for EVE. She has some kind of video screen instead of a face, where luminous blue spots light up to simulate eyes. When those blue spots are arranged in her face in such or such pattern, a very precise feeling is expressed.What a fusion! I had never seen such a convincing mix of technology and emotion in a film before. Even in ""A.I."", where a robot designed to look like a boy is programmed to express love.This masterstroke is due to the animators at Pixar, who clearly demonstrates once again who is the master in the domain of computer animation. Not only character animation is exceptional, but the presentation of an apocalyptic desert world is also breathtaking. The realism of the opening scenes is mystifying for an animated movie. There are some moments in which you could forget that you're watching an animated film.""WALL-E"" is an excellent science fiction movie, but it's also an excellent tribute to science fiction movies. Andrew Stanton has inserted in his film a lot of references to pictures such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Star Wars"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Idiocracy"" and ""I Am Legend"". And in the great tradition of Disney movies, important life lessons are learned in ""WALL-E"", and their importance is as capital as it can be, considering the state of the Earth after humans have decided that it was easier for them to forget those precious life lessons.However, I found very ironic the fact that a Disney picture would carry a message against mega-corporations and against the concept of brand loyalty.Overall, ""WALL-E"" is an absolutely extraordinary movie. Fans of animation and science fiction will surely appreciate it for its technical and narrative qualities, but families and kids will definitely fall under the charm of those two robots and their heart-melting love story. A must-see!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Loved it!,"I didn't care much for The Incredibles, Cars or Ratatouille but Wall-E is just precious.The first half hour or so is near perfect. There is no plot line, there is nothing really happening, it's just Wall-E. And it's just too cute. This movie is connecting emotionally. Some people complain about that and the lack of, let's call it, ""solid stuff"" but hey, this is an animation film, if you expected ""The Deer Hunter"" with robots you are probably just stupid.Unfortunately (for me) Pixar too felt they needed to squeeze in a real story somewhere and they did. It's not really bad (although a bit too contemporary) and it's rather well executed but it totally contrasts the first half hour and I feel it would've done much better without it.But nonetheless, it's still a 9/10. It's safe to say that people who thought ""Boo"" was the best thing about Monters Inc. will love Wall-E, everybody who thought that movie had a great and enticing plot probably won't.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"A beautiful, beautiful film, 10/10 all the way!!  + it is very (X 200) cute!!","I was sure this film would be good, but there were a few surprises...1. I did not realize that the love between Wall.E and Eve would be so strong.2. I did not realize how much the humans in this film have changed from the ones now.3. I did not realize that there would be some sudden points in this film and some scary points in the film.4. I did not realize there would be a baddie.These surprises did not totally distract me from the best parts of the film, which are the very beginning and when Wall.E and Eve are in love. They are two robots, Wall.E has been on earth for 700 years, cleaning up earth which is covered in rubbish. Every day Wall.E puts the rubbish into bricks and builds towers of it. Anything that he finds interesting, he takes it back to his little ""house"". In the first fifteen minutes or so of the film, Wall.E meets a little cockroach, one of the first living creatures he has seen, then he finds a plant, which he has never seen before. He takes this into his house.Later, a robot named Eve, from space, where every human now lives, comes down to earth to search for signs of life. Wall.E falls in love with her and after some misunderstanding between them, Wall.E manages to show Eve his little house, some of his things and the plant. Eve is programmed to now be taken back to space, to show this plant to the humans, so that they can return to earth. Wall.E is so lonely on earth, that he decides to come with her...I love this film because of the beautiful Pixar graphics, Wall.E, Eve and the way they love each other. The environmental message shown in this film is very good and if everyone who watches this film pays attention to that message, the world could start becoming a better place. Unfortunately, I have a feeling people are not understanding this message and so, are still not taking action.I recommend this film to anyone who likes Pixar graphics, who do not mind films that are a little bit slow and like Wall.E! Enjoy ""Wall.E""!! :-) :-)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Another stunning work of art from Pixar,"That Pixar manages to stay at the top in the animation field no matter what is a well known fact. That it improves on its own standards with each new movie is also common knowledge, as well as a bit of a miracle. Still, after a creativity peak like the magnificent Ratatouille, their best movie to this day, what could they possibly do to top that? They came up with their boldest picture ever, a philosophical ""kids' movie"" that doesn't quite beat Ratatouille, but still stands out as the grand animated achievement of 2008.With WALL-E, the Pixar guys have made their first science-fiction: the setting is Earth, several centuries from now. The planet has been deemed impossible to live on, and so all of mankind is on an intergalactic cruise where everyone, including the ship's captain (Jeff Garlin) gets to relax all day long. Yeah, okay, but what about good old Earth? Well, an emergency plan was set in motion, with thousands of robots left to clean up our mess. Too bad that after all these years none of those machines actually work anymore. Only one keeps operating: Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class, aka WALL-E (""voice"" provided by renowned sound designer Ben Burtt), a cute little thing that keeps piling up garbage and organizing it in neat little cubes.WALL-E isn't just good at his job, he's also incredibly curious, which is why he occasionally keeps ""weird"" objects he finds while on duty (bras, batteries, etc) and stores them in his home, where he spends his days watching Hello, Dolly! and pining after some company. It isn't hard to imagine, then, how happy he gets when another robot, Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, or EVE (Elissa Knight), lands on the planet. Though initially unresponsive to WALL-E's attentions (she is there on a mission, after all), EVE eventually bonds with the little robot (frankly, what else can you do?) and takes him with her on a journey unlike anything else he's ever experienced.Why is this Pixar's boldest movie? Well, for starters, the first real line of dialogue isn't spoken until 40 minutes into the film, a fact most children might not be fully prepared to embrace. Fortunately, writer/director Andrew Stanton, who gave us the wonderful Finding Nemo, knows exactly how to win everyone over: for one thing, he's got the best Pixar character ever as the lead; for another, those first 40 minutes, which rely more on sound and sight than actual plot, are easily the most beautiful thing ever done in an American animated feature. Such is the breathtaking seductiveness of the future imagined by Stanton and his creative partners.Then there's the blatant ecological subtext: it couldn't have a greener message if Al Gore showed up for a cameo (he already did that in Futurama). That too could be too much for a younger viewer, so how do the filmmakers get around it? Why, the Pixar way, of course: smart writing, great humor, heartfelt romance (bit of a paradox, given we're talking about two robots, but who cares?), clever in-jokes (Sigourney Weaver voicing a computer) and the indispensable John Ratzenberger on vocal duties (this time, he plays a character named... John), all together for a ride few people will be able to forget.WALL-E is part of that rare breed of movie that's unlike anything that's come before it, yet strangely familiar. It's intelligent but not preachy, brave but not extremely so, moving but not schmaltzy. Translation: a must-see sample of cinematic magic, 100% Pixar.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Quite possibly one of the most beautiful love stories and most visually animated film ever.,"The average person's appreciation for animated features have grown immensely in the past seventy years since the release of Walt Disney's groundbreaking Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. However, they still retain the unfortunate tendency of being referred to as a ""children's film."" Even the most mature works from directors like Brad Bird and Hayao Miyasaki have falling into this degrading trapping. Hopefully, Andrew Stanton's follow-up to the magical Finding Nemo will dispel any idea that animation is simply made for a young audience. Wall-E is a masterpiece of epic proportion combining the talents of Andrew Stanton, the skill of Pixar's animation team and a story that feels like a collaboration between master filmmakers Charles Chaplin, Woody Allen and Stanley Kubrick. What Stanton has created with Wall-E is not simply a motion picture, it's an experience and a story that will live as long as Homer's The Odyssey, William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet and J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. Wall-E will transcend generations and become beloved for its love story, its cautionary tale of the future and incredibly charming and relatable characters.At the start of Wall-E, The Planet Earth has been abandoned for seven hundred years as the humans await for it to be cleaned up and livable again. However, one robot is left to clean up the rubble and left-behind rubbish, a unit called Wall-E. For some many years, he has been doing the same task over and over again, accompanied only by a little cockroach. In those seven-hundred years, he has developed a personality and a curiosity for collecting various old objects. The one thing he longs for, though, is another robot to hold hands with. One day, a giant space craft lands and out of it comes a shiny new robot named Eve. Wall-E is immediately smitten with Eve and as she starts to get know him, Eve starts to grow fond of the little trash compactor. After Eve takes off again into space, Wall-E follows his dream girl-bot into space and truth about the human race is revealed.That is what happens in the first thirty minutes of the film, which is completely devoid of any human dialogue whatsoever. Wall-E and Eve communicate only in speaks and whistles, created by renowned sound designer Ben Burtt, most notably known for doing the beeps on R2-D2 from Star Wars. However, while George Lucas's creation may simply be a tin can on wheels, Stanton and Burtt have created two likable personalities with Wall-E and Eve, whose love story is the main reason for the film's success. I can say, without a doubt, that Wall-E is quite possibly the most touching and beautiful love story ever told. We feel for these characters and care for them, so whenever they're in mortal danger, we're always worried whether they will survive. I will even admit I was almost teary-eyed while watching this film. That is how powerful Wall-E is as a motion picture. The film is also very funny and touching at the same time, giving off a very Chaplin-esquire quality. The whole film definitely gives off a very City Lights vibe and I would not be surprised if Stanton was heavily influenced by that masterpiece. The most beautiful scene of the film in which Wall-E and Eve ""dance"" in space together is one that will be hard to top in any lifetime by any film released after now. The score by Thomas Newman is so incredibly superb that it almost feels like a separate character in the film and adds to how powerful the whole piece is.The social commentary is also effective and definitely makes you think more than any so-called ""intellectual Sundance release."" I would not be surprised if (at the rate people are going) Earth does end up looking the way it does in the film. China itself is already slowly heading in that direction. The humans in the film are made to look like large and cartoon-like, so as to resemble babies. What the film is saying is that humans are evolving backwards, rather than forwards. Everything needs to be done for us, much like a mother caring for her newborn and in this case, the robots are the mothers (as shown by the robot teacher in the baby school). There already are robotic vacuum cleaners where you just need to press the button and that is it. The Pixar animators and storytellers have not gone on auto-drive for Wall-E, but are putting themselves in control in where the story leads and thus why the film succeeds more than hypocritical schlock like Pokemon: The First Movie and Alvin and the Chipmunks posing as family entertainment these days. When the humans realise they must do something, they start to wake up from their bedtime naps and walk much like how babies take their first steps. I wouldn't say Wall-E is being manipulative or offensive as the film is putting a mirror up to the people, so that they understand that they do need to change their habits quickly. This film is teaching people a lesson and giving people something that your average toy advertisement will not.The Pixar team has pulled out all the stops and in effect have created their greatest achievement yet. Stanton succeeds because he puts story and characters before all else, while still providing some breathtaking animation and terrific entertainment in the process. And it is films like Wall-E that prove even more that animation is capable of anything: any genre, any emotion, any laugh.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Another Disney Movie.....with an underlying theme,"As soon as I left the theater I said to my friends and family......eh it was pretty good. WALL-E had its moments of comedy and drama, yet I felt very......bored throughout the middle and parts of the end of the movie.WALL-E as in every Disney movie since the late 90s has an underlying theme. Recently, all their themes have been the same.....SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT!!!! Frankly I get enough of that crap on television and I hear peers talking about it that I really don't want to hear it in movies I see.So overall...all I can say about WALL-E is that it's OK. It's definitely not a Beauty and the Beast or a Mulan....but it's OK for a Disney movie.My rating:B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
I don't want to survive. I want to live.,"I am not a fan of animated movies in any form. The only one I recall that was worth watch was Fritz the Cat back in the 70s. That one was X-Rated (NC-17 today).Of course, I had to watch this, not because it won Best Animated Feature Film at the Academy Awards, but because there was a push to get it nominated for Best Picture period. It did win a couple of Best Picture awards from film critics, but the Academy wasn't buying it.I feel that it did meet the requirements for consideration as Best Picture, as it presented a story that was interesting and credible, and just had animated robots instead of humans. Of course, nominating it for Best Picture means someone would be left out, and I can't see that as there were other films that had a better claim to be included.It was charming, tender, funny, and exciting. A film that is worth watching over and over.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Very Cute, Lots of Fun, But Feels So Empty","I love Disney/Pixar movies. In fact, there isn't a single one I don't like. But this one isn't the ""hit"" I thought it would be.Wall-E is another prime example of why Pixar rules the digital cartoon world; fantastic character animation and landscape vistas. The rings of Saturn scene, in particular, was great! So the problem here is obviously the writing.For the first time at a D/P film, my children were bored at some points in the movie, and so was I. There's nothing wrong with the story in and of itself that I can see. And I honestly can't put my finger on it directly. But something is missing from this movie that many of the others have; a certain charm if you will. I will say it kind of nags at me that he looks so much like Johnny-5 from Short Circuit. I'm not sure why they didn't use a different design.This is a good movie none-the-less, and tons of people will love it. But for me personally, it's not in the ranking with Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, or The Incredibles, but more in the A Bugs Life, Toy Story 2, and Cars list.

What a cartoon!,"I have never thought that a cartoon , done in a classic ,e.g.-Disneyan way, by using the armada of talented artists and their drawing ,sketching etc. hand skills ,or , all these on the rows of computers , could be more humanistic that a non-animated product , a feature film , but , what Disney - the Pixar geniuses have achieved with this , is simply, beyond words ,and I have to reiterate here that what stands out is the basic building block of any work of art , that is the need to tell , describe , warn ,where talent simply lashes out ,and as is the case with Wall-E ,where the story carries everything, and the perfect digital animation ,voice characterization ( the main computer's voice is no other than Madame S.Weaver's ,and the same goes for her as for Mr . C.Eastwood , namely , the 'older' she is ,the better she is !), musical scenes are all fused into this cinematic evergreen ! Yes, as an adult and a sort of a movie buff , I simply cannot believe what kind of satisfaction and personal hopes of a better world in the middle of an interpersonal , financial and moral crisis this cartoon has reignited in me , again stressing the most basic cosmic and religious rule that love is possible ,that a better world is possible , that peace is possible !

Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton will absolutely love WALL-E.,"My Take: One of the very best films of the year. An instant classic.The late TV film critic Gene Siskel once said that you can say a lot about a certain character through looking at their eyes. Well, Mr. Siskel would have loved WALL-E, Pixar's latest creation whose head is all binocular-like eyes. Yet they elicit enough emotions to make him almost human. When he's either happy, sad, serious or whatever else, this cute little robot just moves his eyes a bit and leaves the cinematic magic to his creators to give him more emotions than the Tin Man. But enough solely talking about this films lead character, almost everything about WALL-E sums up one of the best films of the year (if only I had seen it on theaters earlier to complete the experience!).WALL-E didn't just charm me, it moved me in mysterious ways. It's beautifully done, crisply animated, yet it's also charming, topical, breezy and breathtakingly soaring. The storyline is beyond anything I've seen in years (try R2-D2 in a holiday-off from STAR WARS to give you an idea about what WALL-E is about). But beyond that, there's something else really special about WALL-E. Because, sometime throughout the film, I started to see myself in the character. Few films are capable of making you see yourself in the character, and just for the films first hour, WALL-E is already movie magic.The first hour of the film is definitely the best, which looks and feels like a silent comedy, introducing us to the film's adorable little robot of the title. ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth-class"" aka Wall-E (voiced with various beeps and hums courtesy of Ben Burtt), the earth's last-functional stuck to his duties to clean up the world's waste while everyone on earth has already evacuated. But after years (better add a few more zeros to a million years) of cleaning up, Wall-E has developed a certain something: curiosity and personality. With no one on earth to keep him company, he takes pleasure in everyday objects like old cassette tapes, a Rubik's cube, a light bulb and a little cockroach who keeps him company. But he's prayers are answered (if robots can pray!) when a ship drops a little probot called EVE, whom he immediately falls in love with... even with those laser weapons at hand. But when EVE is carried away back from her source, the love-struck Wall-E tags along and ends up fighting to resurrect and recolonize earth.The first half, clearly the best part in this movie is a marvelous display of creativity, while the second half is filled with excitement and startling little revelations, and that moving love story between Wall-E and EVE. But the sum of both parts creates the finest animated adventure in a long time. Now sign yourself and your family up for a cruise with WALL-E and have an intergalactic adventure unlike anything in this or any galaxy!Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"A tragic, heartwarming animated sci-fi fable.  Genius.","There seems to be little possible direction to take when creating an animated film. Of course the setting can be changed along the situations and characters, but I am hinting more towards the target audience. Firstly, there is the option to skew the demographic strongly towards the fledgling crowd with films like Curious George and The Wild. Close behind are those films targeted at a younger, but not greatly adolescent audience, which are embodied in films like Madagascar and Horton Hears a Who! The detrimental aspect of films like these, are that they are for the most part strictly kid-fare, and may put off the unwilling parents, especially after DVD combusts after overuse. Next there is the more risky segment of animated films, in which the creators strive to link the generational gorge and give pleasure on a surplus level. Films like Shrek, The Incredibles and Finding Nemo have been successful at this, but a greater number like Happy Feat, Igor, Barnyard, Monster House and Open Season have been less so. Finally, there lies the risk at the other end of the spectrum, in creating films that may be too mature for less seasoned patrons to understand or keep interested in, such as Ratatouille and The Iron Giant.Then along comes a film like WALL∙E. A film that is so breathtaking and above any level of animation ever before conceived, that will likely thrill older audience members as much as any other movie they view this year, so insightful and profound and complex in it's entirety and absorbing in its tenderness and emotional resonance that everything is whole again. And the best part, your child who may have been bewildered by the mature themes at play, will grow to love, if at least not appreciate, WALL∙E more with each passing year.It would be a lie to claim that WALL∙E is my favourite animated film, or even my favourite conceived through the use of computers, but that is in no way a degrading comment as it is the best animated film in almost five years and still one of the best of all time. If there was ever a year at the Academy Awards to repeat the best picture nomination of The Beauty and the Beast, this would certainly be the one. The cumulative wonder of this feature lies throughout multiple veins of its construction. Setting new lofty standards for animated features to come, the quality of the design achieves a detail and vividness that will astound and consume anyone who gazes upon it. The effects of the terrain, to the details of the robot stars is so impeccable, one is hard pressed to clearly decipher it as animation and not as reality. Yet this is only the icing on the cake, with the foundation spawned from the genius of the story telling itself, without which would demote WALL∙E to eye candy and nothing more. The opening forty-or-so minutes is sans dialog and the ability to keep the level of intrigue at such an engrossing level is a true testament to all those involved, especially veteran Pixar director Andrew Stanton.Meet WALL∙E. Or for those who dislike acronyms, a solitary Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth Class, who spends his days compacting, and neatly stacking towering peaks of garbage on the now barren wasteland that was once Earth. Driven to spend their remaining days on a series of space shuttles by the waste spawned by overconsumption and the greed of a conglomerate, aptly named Buy N Large, mankind has all but forgotten Earth. Not the same can be said for WALL∙E, who was inexplicably skipped after a widespread deactivation of his robot compadres, who, aside from his monotonous task, a loving fascination with the forgotten treasures (or garbage to us) of Earth past, has no greater purpose in life. That is until EVE (Extraterrestial Vegetation Evaluator); a deadly ivory robot sent to search for any signs of life on Earth arrives, and immediately steals the admiration of the little droid. The latter portions of WALL∙E are in the truest sense, a love story, and are comprised of our hero searching for his love after EVE returns to her extraterrestrial home. All acts of this film mesh flawlessly and build upon each other into a sometimes tragic, yet ultimately heart-warming sci-fi fable.While not in the typical sense, WALL∙E is the perfect family film, with its endearing characters and monumental art direction, it may not win over all ages simultaneously but will capture the hearts and imagination of those who let it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Damn good.,"For something with little in the way of dialog, this movie is good for just about anyone, honestly. Humorous, touching, and enough metaphorical meat to keep artsy folks satisfied, I found it quite enjoyable.I have no kids, but was suckered into seeing it with my wife. I wasn't disappointed, and a little ashamed I didn't see it in the theater.Pixar, in my mind, sets standards for animated films now a days, and lives up the awesome legacy set out by Disney's original animation studio (Yes, I know they are a separate company). Much like Bioware in the realm of computer games, Pixar has never made a bad movie. That means it's one of the few brands you can trust.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Good movie but not as good as what others have rated.,"OK, first, this movie has some amazing animation. It looks real some of the time. Wall-e is definitely one of the cutest characters which appears to be based off of short circuit's johnny 5. All around it's a good movie... but a 9 on a 10 scale seems a little high to me. As i said when I came out, A cute movie that I'll probably not want to see again. Kids will like it, adults will think wow, thats how animation is these days. It goes a little long. When i come out of a great movie, which is what I consider an 8 or higher, It zips by. You know when the movie is almost over and you say to yourself, "" Wow! It's over already"" Yeah, that did not happen to me in this film although I liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Disney's Look At The Future,"In many ways this is a pretty typical piece of Disney/Pixar animation - except in this, instead of cute, adorable animals we have cute, adorable robots. Set about 700 years in the future, the story begins on an earth that is now uninhabitable because of the mounds of garbage that have accumulated. Humans are extinct (on earth at least) and the star of the movie is a little robot called WALL-E, programmed apparently to collect, sort and dispose of garbage. He continues his job long after the humans have disappeared, his only companion being a cockroach (they really can survive anything) - and WALL-E is lonely. Suddenly an alien robot named Eva drops in from space, and WALL-E falls head over heels, eventually accompanying her (somewhat against his will) to her spaceship. Once aboard the spaceship I thought the movie started to take on a bit of a ""Battlestar Galactica"" feel, as the descendants of the humans who had escaped earth find themselves struggling for control of the ship against a group of rogue robots.A lot here was very good. The animation was brilliant. WALL-E especially seemed almost real rather than animated. The relationship between WALL-E and Eva was developed nicely, and I felt a great deal of empathy for WALL-E as he battled his loneliness. The writers also managed the difficult task of telling us a story with very little dialogue (neither WALL-E nor Eva talk, except to stammer out each other's name.) There's a rather obvious political message in this, warning us about the environmental damage we're causing to the planet. On the down side, the story was rather predictable, and I'm not too sure that this movie would get a great reception among children, since the lack of dialogue and somewhat complex storyline might make it difficult especially for younger ones to follow. As its rating suggests, this animated feature might have more impact on adults than on children.On balance, I liked it, although I'm not inclined to add it to a collection so I could watch it over and over. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wall-E is boring,"You know, this movie had a chance to be avant-garde till half way then it got to be annoying.what was the point of having live action then later show the humans in that ship as cartoony people? why would a robot whose sole purpose is to clean junk have a faculty for feeling love? Why? if the future of robotics is like wall-e then i see toasters falling in love. Doing something they're not designed to do. Wall-E should have just cleaned junk, that's it.That's what he was designed to do. Wall-E is an acronym for ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth Class""It was a bit avant-garde because of the whole idea, the story, the look, but it fell flat because of little things that defied logic.now i hear that this movie is one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time.

Pretty much a masterpiece,"I honestly want to throw every superlative I can think of at this movie. I'm an unabashed Pixar fan, and have been since Toy Story 2, but I was a little disappointed in their last two films, Cars and Ratatouille. Both were good, very good at times, but I don't think they hit the level of what came before. To me, WALL-E is a return to form. No, that's too weak. It's their peak. No, that's wrong, too. A ""peak"" implies that they're about to go down. I doubt that's true, although it's going to be hard to beat this one. WALL-E is my favorite of the Pixar films so far because I think it goes past the point of merely fantastic to that of being transcendent. It's a truly visionary film, one that inspired my jaw to drop over and over again. And it's intimate, too. It's hard to believe, but you're going to fall in love with a couple of robots when you watch the movie. And it's incredibly smart, too. Pixar has actually had this vein in most if not all of their movies, where they deliver moral lessons without any pandering whatsoever. The movie also contains deft social commentary. It's a pure joy to watch, and, without a doubt, one of the all-time great animated movies. Thank God for Pixar.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"I'm an 18 year old male, and i thought this was a great movie.","I went into this movie having pretty high expectations, many of which came from the ratings on this site as well as those of critics. The movie works so well simply because the creators made you care so much about the characters, especially Wall-e and they do this without Wall-e having the ability to talk, which is a remarkable feat. The problem people seem to have when going to see a movie like this ( i am one of them, but i put it to the side for this one) is that they think, oh this is animated and rated G, its a kid's movie. Maybe some of them are, but this one surely was not. In fact, i'd say someone would have to be at least 14-15 years old to understand the concept the movie is going for. I know my 12 year old sister liked the movie, but did not understand the true purpose behind the plot. But because i did, i thoroughly enjoyed it until the end. Does Wall-e deserve to be in the top 20? At first i didn't agree, but after thinking about it a little bit, maybe it does. Not because this movie was groundbreaking, it wasn't. But because this movie did so many things, and it never faltered. It could have failed in so many ways, and yet it did not. It passed as a love story, sci fi story, and a story about modern day society and where we are heading. It 's the fact that it did all of this, and did it so well, that maybe it does deserve to be in the top 20. In conclusion, the movie does have some aspects for kids, but this is not a kid's movie and to deny yourself a chance at viewing an amazing movie like this on that basis alone would be stupid. This is a great movie, and the only thing that amazes me, is just how damn good pixar actually is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar's propensity for profound productions,"In short, WALL-E is perhaps just shy of Iron Man in terms of sheer coolness for the summer movie season. Pixar is unabated in their effort to control all that is animated and adorable in this world or the next. WALL-E is the pinnacle of animation, successfully steamrolling lesser animations in its path, ahem, take THAT kung fu panda. Capitalizing not on sheer star-power like every Dreamworks animation preceding it, instead, Pixar utilizes brilliant animation and wonderful storytelling to unfold a tale of love featuring the loneliest of characters, WALL-E. WALL-E's story has environmentalist overtones not unlike a decidedly far inferior movie this summer, but it's never brought to the forefront of the movie as it is, again, a love story. WALL-E captivates us with his human-like curiosity, and his very vibrant yet glassy eyes will reduce you to a swooning 12 year-old girl. I promise. The robots chirp, purr, and beep all in their own very cute dialect, but the absence of dialog, especially for the first twenty minutes, does not hinder the progression of the story. We see, for all of WALL-E's robotness, he is far more human, and like any human, he does not want to be alone. Highly, highly, highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Great science fiction, great storyline, just great overall","The movie Wall-E is a touching work of science fiction that manages to bridge the gap between child and adult. Wall-E is left abandoned on a decrepit planet Earth, with the directive of compacting and organizing the leftover trash. Having been alone for a great amount of time, his entire reality and purpose going to change.Bringing into perspective moral conflicts of consumerism and big business, the film displays an ominous conclusion for the Earth we live in today. All this stands in stark contrast to the robot himself, who demonstrates a loving personality and emotions such as curiosity, empathy, and loneliness. It is hard not to be drawn in to Wall-E's charm.Viewers will undoubtedly be taken by the stunning graphics, amazingly detailed scenery, and creative characters. But for those looking for more, you will find a thought-provoking story that brings into question our behavior and responsibility on this planet.

The King Of 2008.,"I was lucky enough to see this film last week at a cinema in Spain on my holiday, it's not even released until Friday 18th July in the UK. However, on Friday, I will be sitting in the front row of a cinema watching this film again.'Wall-E' is quite possible one of the best films to be made in the last 10 years. With such a simple plot, classic jokes and a script that contains minimal dialogue, this is the summer blockbuster of 2008, without a doubt. I didn't want this film to end, that's how much I loved it. It's got the widest audience appeal, infants, teens, adults and the elderly will adore this masterpiece. Disney/Pixar seem to never really fail us as viewers, there films are always original, quirky and are quite possibly the most beautiful creations to be shown on the big screen. Andrew Stanton, director of 'Finding Nemo' and co-writer/director of 'Toy Story' has written and directed one of the greatest animation films of all time.'Wall-E' is also painfully intelligent for what most people would call a 'Children's/Family' feature. With obvious references to Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, '2001: A Space Odyssey', parents will find themselves giggling when the kids are sitting silently. This film pays close detail to life, it shows us how to appreciate the better things we have, not the material goods. The character of Wall-E wants to find love, to never be lonely again, something that everybody can understand and relate to.I honestly believe 2007 and 2008 has helped save some of the importance of cinema and why we, as a nation enjoy the flicks so much. Films like 'Wall-E', 'Juno' and 'No Country For Old Men' have proved to the world that films can still be about passion and not about money. Sure, this is a summer blockbuster and sure, it's got one of the biggest budgets since 'Titanic' but the main principles of film-making are easily apparent.This is the film I've been waiting for. One that sucks in it's audience properly and holds them tight, one that shows true cinematic creativity and passion and one that shows just how much film is important to us.'Wall-E' should be your choice of summer film this year and I'm sure it will be. This isn't just a fantastic film, it's a spectacle of genius and greatness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Give me a break, when I really want a humanities message in a kids show I will give Steven Segal a call. Yeah, we have trashed the planet and killed off a bunch of the animal life. And we have gotten lazy but not up to what WALL-E portrays. Kung Fu Panda beat this movie out in almost every category. KFP has better humor, storyline, acting (better actors gave more feeling in citing their lines). Better graphics by Pixar but that doesn't make rating the film a ten. There are some awe inspiring space scenes for about five minutes of the film. So if you want to see a kids show that rates a 10 go see KFP as it is funnier, no preaching, and had my kids coming out of the show trying to be Kung Fu masters.

Where have all the perceptive robots gone?,"It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity. -Albert EinsteinWhile reading on certain criticism drawn by the underlying social and ecological commentary in Disney Pixar's recent WALL-E, I cannot help but believe that these alleged displays of irresponsibility shown through the movie are inferred only through the critics' total lack of perception and their completely missing the point.The post-apocalyptic climate is not a staggering, clumsy accusation against the imminent outcome of big business or consumerism. Indeed, the city-sized shopping centres laid to waste, the spectacular sky-scrapers of garbage awaiting disposal, all shockingly remind us of true dilemmas of our time, but the movie does not stop at such a simplistic accusation (and instead, goes on to make a much more complicated one?). No, once one sees the human u(dys)topia far off in a mind-bogglingly gigantic space vacation resort, it is obvious that big business has not only rid us of a garbage-ridden existence, but supplied us with a perfectly sanitised, convenient, comfortable, effortless hedonism.It is this hedonism that the movie attempts to unveil, I consider, as the true antagonism of mankind. In our world, while pollution, energy, and quality of life each make up an intimidating problematic in themselves, there is an underlying human tendency, a techno-crazed, comfort-fueled desire like a ghost, which is shockingly mirrored in WALL-E's world. In this world, humans are saturated with information, over-connected through their internet devices, yet entirely unattached to themselves, each other, and the world around them. A lack of variety bores them, but this same lacking deprives them of the imagination and ambition to act differently, so that when a couple of characters have their devices accidentally de-activated, they discover pleasures in activities completely unbeknownst to them.But technology in itself is in no way to blame. The robots in WALL-E's world are only built to service our needs, to keep us clean, fed, comfortable, and (for the most part) informed. In truth, it seems we have created a robot-infested heaven. Robot labour in this movie has given solution to poverty, healthcare, pollution, but has done nothing to aid our humanity. In fact, it has, to an appalling degree, served to isolate humanity into innocuous, septic, uneventful lives.It is no surprise then, that Andrew Stanton takes this Albert Einstein quote to a literal dimension when creating his character: the more human-than-human last Waste Allocation robot on the face of the Earth. He embodies ""mankind's"" lost satisfaction of physical achievement, the satisfaction of doing, of working, of purpose. WALL-E reminds the public that creating a humane personality takes time, exploration, solitude, adversity, and a never-ending spirit of curiosity. And love, and the fascination, hurt, pain, and sacrifice that entail it, all those conditions that mankind in WALL-E's world pushed away and forgot while protecting their lives of perfect comfort.Like Einstein, I can only hope for the day when our technology will aid our conscience, our humanity, and help us make more incredibly perceptive movies such as this. ;)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
An American classic and the best movie in 26 years,"Adjectives really can't do justice to how special WALL-E is, so I'll just say this: the last time I was moved this much in a movie theater was 1982, when I saw E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. I have seen many outstanding motion pictures since then, but none have ever captured the pure sweetness, joy and magic of that film. And to be honest with you, I always figured that no movie ever could.I'm delighted to report that I was wrong.Seeing WALL-E on opening night, in a packed theater in which every single person in the auditorium applauded at the end for close to 5 minutes...well, let's just say I have a little more faith in humanity than I did before.(I would also like to add that this is a PERFECT date movie...)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The Family Film: An Artistic Statement?,"The past decade of films have seen its fair share of fads; from big-budget fantasy movies and comic book adaptations to a multitude indie films, this era of cinema is rife with them.However, maybe the biggest current one is the computer-animated movie. And as the undisputed king of this, Pixar constantly pushes the envelope for this young genre. Yet, even after stating this, no one could have expected what they did with their newest film.They created art.Pixar's 2008 contribution is ""WALL-E,"" a fish out of water story about a cute and cuddly robot who finds himself in love, and unknowingly, carrying the torch for humanity's future. Sounds generic.Well, that's why plot synopses never do the film justice! This is the case with ""WALL-E."" The plot's purpose is to bring us to a beautiful, yet ugly, world where humanity has lost its way. The film tackles such subjects as consumerism, environmentalism, America's fast-food culture, and our increasing dependence on technology. With this list of themes, I might as well be talking about an Oliver Stone movie.Thank God I am not; Oliver Stone could never produce something as good as ""WALL-E"" (""Platoon,"" you don't stand a chance). Man, this catapults the kids movie into art. There are so many beautiful images, like WALL-E scraping Saturn's rings as if they were water or WALL-E and his mate flying in space locked in a romantic helix.Furthermore, even the structure is somewhat unconventional. There is little dialog, especially in the first part. And there are really no overt villains, as the film tries to point out that humanity is really its own worst enemy (it's not cheesy like ""Dawn of the Dead""'s take on this concept). Sure, there is a happy ending, and clichés show up once in awhile, but the movie is so awe-inspiring in its execution and its message that it doesn't matter.If I told you my least favorite genre in moviedom, I might tell you that kids' movies are at the top of my list. ""WALL-E"" doesn't change my mind on this, but it does give me hope that the genre will actually try to become more than poor dialog, unbearable storytelling, and most of all, flagrant bathroom humor. Pixar's new outing not only gives one hope for the family film, but for all movies in general.A pop film can be art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"WALL-E, Best Pixar Film Ever?","I knew Pixar would pull off something new and original,and I knew it'd be classic Pixar, and thus at least good. What I got I didn't expect. Near perfection. This movie blows you away, with one heck of a dramatic opening. This could very well be one of the best openings you'll ever see, not only in animation, but perhaps in all of movie history. The tone set, and the characterization built encompasses so much in such little time you instantly fall in love with the character. Moving on from the 1st act you move into the 2nd act, where the absolute visuals and stunning emotional buildup slow a bit, following a few absurd moments you move into the even more quirky third act. While the movie moves away from the perfection of the first act, the remaining acts hold up very well, and you eventually settle into a train of thought like ""Well you can't really make it all perfect."" It's still very entertaining, and still very good. Just a touch slower and less dramatic then the first act. Oddly enough this may not be a great movie for the youngest ones to see. Most of the humor is complex, and I find that adults will get more of the jokes then the kids. While the kids will still have a great time, I think adults will really understand this movie, and will find it to be one of the best Pixar films ever made, kids may prefer the humor of Finding Nemo over the humor of Wall-e. Speaking of Wall-E, and his various companions, you will find yourself questioning some of the voice tactics at first, but they will grow on you, and you'll eventually find yourself saying that there is no better way to do it. The sound of the movie was utterly fantastic, and will keep you hooked just trying to figure out what original way they are going to express the world ""hello"". You will become attached, quite emotionally, to these characters, and there's even a touch of progression of AI technology as the new robots seem to have far more complex personalities, while Wall-E has a simpler yet more attachable personality. In short, this is a fantastic movie, with great music, and fantastic visuals that will blow you away. Watch it! Go!I say this can easily be nominated for Academy Awards in: -Best Original Screenplay -Best Art Direction and of course -Best Animated Feature",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
WALL-E has great heart,"""WALL-E"" accomplishes nearly the impossible. During the first half of the movie ""WALL-E"" charms and mesmerizes without any vestige of human dialog. WALL-E is a refuse collecting robot, basically a box with two round camera eyes, left behind on Earth in the distant future. That would be 750 years in the future. Undeniably WALL-E (brilliantly voiced by Ben Bartt) is becoming sentient. In fact the cute robot is a passionate fan of the classic movie ""Hello, Dolly"". Clearly and touchingly, our hero WALL-E is profoundly lonely, and yearns for companionshipperhaps, even love. Perhaps this is a leap of faith beyond mere disbelief, and the distinct beauty of Director and Writer Andrew Stanton's amazing animated feature ""WALL-E"" from Pixar.Pixar is now something like 10 for 10 in making movies that capture and connect with the audience. The CGI and animation are like nothing seen before. In fact the sequences with WALL-E on the desolate Earth wasteland look like live action film. Andrew Stanton's weird and wonderful robot love story also delivers humorously biting commentary on the sedentary direction of our society; as well as punctuates the consequences of not being ""green"". ""WALL-E"" is brilliantly whimsical, hysterical, and surprisingly touching. ""WALL-E"" like its hero has a big heart. ""WALL-E"" tells its story on a vast visually stunning canvas: The CGI and animation are beyond amazing.As we first observe WALL-E, he is doing his programmed deal of collecting and compacting trash in one of Earth's barren metropolises. WALL-E discovers a living plant in the midst of all the garbage. Perhaps this newfound plant indicates that the Earth may again have a viable ecosystem, after over 750 years. A gargantuan space ship arrives, carrying with it a scouting robot, sleek new age Eve (charmingly voiced by Elissa Knight). Apparently, Eve is searching for any signs of life on the long vacated Earth. Obviously, more technologically advanced and powerful Eve appears formidable. However, WALL-E sees in Eve the love of his lifeat least for a robot. Robot hi-jinx ensues. Inevitably WALL-E ends up accompanying Eve back to the displaced human civilization, albeit unintentionally. Ironically WALL-E may be the savior of all of mankind. WALL-E and Eve's adventure becomes a hysterical and ultimately touching journey. ""WALL-E"" is high on cute and fun.Director Stanton creates and navigates contrasting worlds of ""WALL-E"" with ease and confidence. Granted the visuals awe and amaze; however, his storytelling yields ""WALL-E"" its big heart. The fact that the main characters are robots with virtually monosyllabic vocabularies is even more stunning an accomplishment. You really pull for the happy ending for WALL-E and Eve. And they are robots! Okay, this is a Disney and Pixar movie, so you need not worry too much. ""WALL-E"" is sentimental, very sweet, with enough of a quirky edge to keep you guessing. ""WALL-E"" is a great movie, well worth seeing. Pixar has done it, again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A film filled with wonder,"I cannot say enough about how beautiful and surprising Wall-E is in both its conception as, essentially, a love story between a trash compacter and a robot, and its execution as one of the most moving, wondrous films about mankind and space since 2001: A Space Odyssey, to which it is clearly a loving homage.Our almost-four-year-old son rarely sees films because we follow the Waldorf/Steiner approach to life for young children, which excludes TV and computers (which hasn't stopped him from becoming extremely proficient in the latter simply, it seems, by instinct), but in the past week he has watched Cars two or three times, because he had a summer cold, and then Wall-E in the movie theater.Seeing Cars again reminded me of how warm and rich Pixar's films are: the debt they owe to the best of classic Disney animation (and the classic Disney animators who worked with them to teach them what they knew) is apparent, but more than that, the Pixar storytellers and animators use computer technology not simply as a tool, but to create a rich palette of both stunning visuals and emotional warmth and honesty.Wall-E goes farther than even the beauty of Finding Nemo in taking three-dimensional animation to new spheres...quite literally when Wall-E and Eva, his robot companion, dance through space. I won't say too much about Wall-E's retro taste in movies (on videocassette, no less, which is a technology that intrigues our son because he has only ever seen a VHS tape in its case, never an actual player) because it is such a touching surprise, but the fact that the yearning between two supposedly inanimate (in the original sense) objects can move you to tears is a testament to director Andrew Stanton and his story team and animation team's mastery and originality.This is a film that gently arouses your thoughts and emotions about humankind and is never clumsy in doing so. It is funny, incredibly dark and gritty for a mainstream ""family"" movie, and yet also soars to amazing heights of wonder and beauty.When Wall-E, the movie and the trash compacter, take their audience through space with all the excitement and grace, but way more humor, that Stanley Kubrick did roughly forty years ago, the most appropriate word is the grossly overused but for once totally accurate: AWESOME!!!!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
An OK pixar movie,"Let me start off by saying Wall-E is not a bad movie, in fact its a very cute movie with a handful of laughs at Wall-E's curiosity and awkwardness. Kids will eat it up. The sound was excellent since there is hardly any dialogue at all until halfway through the movie. There is a good message behind the film and all, but to be honest I got bored. Sure the animation was top notch and visually may be one of the best pixar movies to date, but the story lacked in my opinion and failed to keep me interested. The best part of this film was the short film before the movie started. ""Presto"" is by far the best pixar short I've ever seen, it was worth my $7.50 just to see it. In conclusion, it's not a bad movie to go see on a rainy day or if your kids are dying to go to the pictures, but if I were you I'd wait and rent it when it comes out on DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Out of this World,"To be animated can mean a number of things. While it obviously refers to the artistic process in which still images are strewn together in sequences to appear as though they are moving, it can also mean to bring someone or something to life. Pixar Animation Studios are masters of both of these animated meanings and their genius lies in their seemingly effortless ability to accomplish both of these feats simultaneously. In the studio's history, they have managed to make toys playful when no one else was looking, the plight of a bunch of ants seem monumental and rats in the kitchen somehow not only normal but entirely justifiable. Despite all of these milestones, Pixar has outdone themselves with their ninth feature, WALLE. It might be unfair to suggest that no other company could accomplish this but there is certainly no other company that could have done as good a job. WALLE is short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class and the character himself is a collapsible box with curiously wide eyes that gets around on tank treads and solar power. He may be made up of nothing but rusting metal and parts that need frequent replacing but he is also the most endearing, romantic dreamer that Pixar has ever crafted. You just want to squeeze the little guy. Trust me; the tetanus shot you'd need after that would be totally worth it.WALLE takes place about 700 or so years from now. Taking an abnormally critical stance on humanity's penchant to waste without fear of consequence, three-time Pixar director, Andrew Stanton (A BUG'S LIFE, FINDING NEMO), paints the future earth as being uninhabitable. It seems that somewhere around the year 2100, there will be so much garbage on the planet that not only will we need to stack it as high as the highest skyscrapers but we will also need to vacate the planet until the mess is brought under control. Enter WALLE. Hundreds of similar units will work over the next six or seven centuries on a job that was only meant to last five years. The humans who once fled have inevitably all passed on but their future generations continue to float through space on giant cruise ships, oblivious to their history and unaware of their present selves. After so much time has passed, humanity has succumbed to its laziest impulses. We no longer require the need to think for ourselves when we have a multi-conglomerate doing it for us or the need to walk from here to there when we have a ""hoverchair"" to bypass this menial task. Earth is practically a forgotten memory for all but it is still there. Despite being covered in smog and dust and despite also a failed mission to clean up the mess, one WALLE unit remains to keep the pursuit of love, happiness and hope alive.WALLE is an unfortunate loner and even though his closest companion is loyal cockroach, he never loses faith. He presses on every day in his near impossible mission to make earth inhabitable again without discouragement and with a nagging sensation that there is more to life than this. Considering he isn't actually alive, that's pretty impressive. When another robot, EVE, arrives on earth to search for signs of sustainable life, WALLE finally gets the chance to see and understand what that greater meaning might be. Aside from being an eco-friendly science fiction piece, WALLE is also a moving romance that is unexpected and unmatched by most recent films featuring actual human beings. When WALLE first sees EVE, he knows it is love at first sight. He proceeds to follow her around everywhere she goes, shyly inching closer towards her whenever he feels the moment might be right. He is like a teenager in love for the first time. He doesn't know how to make his move, just that he always wants to be around her. There is no desperation born out of ages of loneliness, just a certainty in what is in the air. The courtship of WALLE and EVE is so innocent and simple that it seems almost silly that we as humans should have such trouble getting it right.WALLE's ride is pretty smooth, full of laughs, touching moments and inspired cinematography (under the meticulous guidance of contemporary visionary, Roger Deakins) but all of this is expected from the Pixar peeps. There is a misguided attempt to incorporate live-action into the mix that adds a slight level of confusion but can do nothing to take away from the deeply satisfying whole. It is quite an extensive journey and it rests on the shoulders of one little waste management robot. WALLE is unforgettable. His curiosity is matched only by his appreciation for everything in life that humanity has left behind. He may be goofy and clumsy but he is always open to possibility and hope. He is more alive than I am most of the time and the bewilderment and awe that fill his optical devices opened my eyes to things I had stopped seeing altogether. How can so much yearning and wonder come from one little robot, let alone one that is not actually made of real metal but rather drawn that way? WALLE is simply a marvel to behold and the pinnacle of Pixar's progressive mission to redefine what it means to animate.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Masterpiece for the Ages,"Some time ago, I stumbled across the new rumblings of Pixar's next film, 'Wall-E'. And as I read through a story detailing a planet that could no longer sustain human life, and a cute little robot who held the weight of the world on his shoulders, a thought dawned on me. That if Pixar did good on their initial proposal, they could open a door of epic opportunity. That if they took a chance and held nothing back, they could make a film that wouldn't simply entertain audiences, but instill change.Pixar has now released their brainchild for the world to see and judge, and the film that I hoped would carry a thoroughly spine-chilling message has done more than just deliver an environmentally friendly message. Many times I sat in awe, choking back tears as I watched a monumentally beautiful story unfold before my eyes. Change. Hope. That's what 'Wall-E' is. Pixar has created a masterpiece, and I don't say that lightly. Like a swift kick in the gut, 'Wall-E' is not only a revolutionary love story but a wake-up call to a world that may not be too far away the one 'Wall-E' so tragically portrays.Welcome to the future. Welcome to Earth. Welcome to a world where pollution clouds the skies and the landscape is little more than a staggering garbage heap. Welcome to a world where a wholesale retail giant has taken over, its CEO now Earth's global president. A president who at one point utters the now reproachable phrase, 'stay the coarse'. But more importantly, welcome to a world without human life. A world so far gone, human's deserted it for a space station long, long ago. Earth, a memory.'Wall-E' doesn't merely criticize our way of life. It doesn't simply frown on our increasing dependence on technology, our desire to make daily routines as effortless as possible. It doesn't wag a finger at our sky-rocketing obesity rates and a mounting detachment to human interaction and the world around us. No, 'Wall-E' effectively slams our very way of life. 'Wall-E' sums up the future of humanity, and it's one of the most shocking visions of the future to ever touch the screen. It is a film whose implications are severe and utterly devastating, a cry to the world to not just sit around and do nothing, a cry to the world to not simply survive but to live. An urgent message that has to be heard and acted upon.But when all seems to be lost, 'Wall-E' reminds us that hope never dies. And as long as our will power is strong, there is a way. There's no denying Pixar's natural talent, because they've done it again. Through its powerful and vastly important message, 'Wall-E' is a space odyssey for the new millennium, and a love story for the ages. Who else could create such an adorable robot and so effectively grant him human characteristics, and above all else, the ability to love. Perhaps the most basic of human instincts, the desire to love and be loved in return. And as this devastatingly cute trash-compacting robot travels the universe for Eve, the object of his affection, we're witnessing one of the grandest and most eloquent stories ever told.'Wall-E' is a film that may very well be studied for years to come. Parents who take their children to see this may be taken completely off-guard to find that 'Wall-E' isn't just a light piece of kiddie entertainment, it's a sweepingly beautiful and historic film. One can only hope that people who see it will listen, and take with them a new outlook on life and the future of this planet. It's a stinging bite from Pixar, but a timely one. Without a doubt their boldest move yet, and one that will be remembered as long cinema has an audience. A legacy of forever.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pure Cinematic Magic,"I saw this movie and absolutely loved it. Everything about it was purely wonderful. Everything about it is quite wondrous. The story, the characters, the voices, the animation, everything was amazing. WALL-E is a robot who is completely alone on Earth...until humans arrive, taking him on a huge adventure full of excitement, comedy, and romance. I think WALL-E is an amazing movie and may be one of the best movies I have ever seen. WALL-E is pure cinematic magic and should not be missed by any human. I will definitely get this on DVD, and maybe on Blu-ray as well. WALL-E may be Pixar's best movie yet and it's only contender's for a better movie are Toy Story and Ratatouille. WALL-E is great and should not be missed out on.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Dull as the landscape,"I'm sorry to say that this beautifully executed Pixar film is just not quite as good as it could have been. It is a shame that dialogue could not have been introduced properly between all the main characters. There is too much dependence on visual effects, insider jokes and references to fulfil the needs of multi-aged entertainment audience. A bit like going to the ballet - if only there was a little bit of drama and speech... This is not to say the film is without merit - it deserves awards for the animation and ideas alone. Unfortunately, that's all it deserves. A shame because I really wanted to say I loved this film - I didn't. It's OK....oh dear.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"Astonishing Animation, Beautiful, Cute with an unusually powerful message","Wall·E is an animation with a distinct difference. Not only does it contain somewhat slapstick kiddy jokes to obviously appeal to children, it has a deep, dark message that will automatically stand out to all adults alike. Wall·E has been described as 2001:A Space Odyssey for all audiences, I agree. They share many similarities such as the lack of dialogue and the breath taking visuals. Furthermore, the story near the end is resembles the man vs machine storyline that was present in 2001: A Space Odyssey with the HAL situation. Not only that, the AUTO looks EXACTLY like HAL. Pixar wanted to pull off a Kubrick inspired animated masterpiece and they have. Its obvious with their use of Kubrickian classical music and the cold robotic voices for the robots.Anyway, heres the story briefly as in to not ruin it for you. Wall·E is a waste disposal unit who is programmed to clear garbage. He lives on the dystopian earth where mankind is inept due to the heaving amount of rubbish. Wall·E is the only one of his kind and therefore lives a lonely life of waste disposal. Until EVE comes along and builds an ironically romantic relationship with Wall·E. He follows EVE to a strange giant space ship that seems to harbour a new world. Wall·E then finds himself wrapped into a race which could save Mankind.I mention in the title that this film has a powerful message. I think that I can on behalf of many people that this film really is an eye opener. Its a realistic symbol of capitalism gone wrong, Technology gone wrong and finally waste disposal gone wrong. These commercial problems relate perfectly to current world events and Pixar has released this film at a perfect time. Pixar satirise all of these problems. In this odd world, you can buy lunches in a bottle, advertisements are plastered everywhere you can see, robots help every little movement you want to do and of course the inhabitants are disgracefully obese. People are lazy, stupid and unpleasant. The appearance is glossy and shiny yet cold and distant. This city of Pixaristic satire is a grim image indeed. Is this simply a whining attempt of protest from Pixar? No. This is feasible and people should see it as a reality check. Obesity is rising, Technology is becoming increasingly ridiculous and commercialism is ever rising. Ridley Scott's Bladerunner presents a similar commercial future yet Scott's representation is much darker which Pixar simply couldn't implement for a supposed kids movie!.As for Wall·E and EVE's relationship, they are both extremely cute and they're relationship was heart warming and beautiful. Its also somewhat ironic that they built a relationship. Wall·E is a clumsy and rusty looking machine yet EVE is a graceful and beautiful robot. But they have one thing in common, they are both alone. I feel that Pixar reveal another message here, that appearance isn't everything. Not the most predominant message but i saw it.As for the sound, the music used was rhythmic and surprising serious at some times. For example, the opening begins with a rather serious deep tune as the piles of trash on earth is revealed. This is a realisation that this is no kiddys film this is a serious animation beholding serious messages we need to consider. This is what made this so powerful for me. Kids will be watching this but deep down this is not a kids film. Furthermore, the score is consistently exceptional throughout the film and I would some sort of sound based Oscar nomination for Pixar.The animation was absolutely breath-taking. Pixar have wowed us every year ever since the animated triumph of Toy Story. Last year i was astonished by Ratatouille's animation but Wall·E is a step up. The animation is truly unbelievable, a triumphant achievement of technology.Pixar have pulled off a masterpiece, a unique conqueration of animation. This must be considered as a serious sci-fi film because it simply is. Only the greatest sci-fi's are as powerful as Wall·E. Pixar should expect many Oscar nominations, Best Animation, Best Cinematography, Best Sound and maybe even Best Picture. Who Knows? Its deserves it Praise for Pixar as they have pulled it off again with their most powerful yet comical sci-fi adventure film.Well what can i say? Its the best animation I have ever seen so go see it! 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Everything an animated film should be,"Imaginative settings, lovable and memorable characters, well utilized animation, impressive visuals, clever gags (never over-done), and one of the sweetest screen romances in the history of movies: Wall-E has a lot to offer.You can't help pulling for this sympathetic, lonely little guy, a rusty old robot who continues his programming of cleaning up trash in a deteriorating world mysteriously devoid of humans. His curiosity, fascination, and wonder about the odd artifacts he excavates during his job make him the most endearingly innocent and lovable droid since C-3PO and R2-D2. His lone buddy is a cockroach of all things, and even this unique friendship is depicted in a touching way that makes Wall-E's goodness shine through.Rarely is an animated film this intelligent and touching. Other films of its ilk are humorous, often with cultural references, and Wall-E's adventure is too. However, the cultural references aren't just dumped in for a one-note sight gag as in other flicks: they are integral elements of building the story. For example, the jabs at cell phones, TV, credit cards, autos, computer overuse, internet shopping are hilarious, while also painting the woeful future that the movie envisions. I love the Capt. Stubing and Hal 9000 satires (they too are principals in what happens, not just walk-on gags). The character of Eve (right down to her mysterious mission) was wonderfully done.Bravo on this one. A very entertaining film with a lot of heart. Brilliantly done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
enjoyable though it seems to be lacking,"In the distant future, planet Earth has been reduced to an uninhabitable cesspool of garbage and humans have been forced to adapt to life in outer space. All that remains is WALL-E, a lonely but durable and industrious robot who's only companion is a cockroach. One seemingly uneventful day, WALL-E encounters a highly advanced robot named EVE whose mission is to locate any remaining plant life, and together they go on the adventure of a lifetime to try and return the human population to their proper home. The latest concoction from the one and only Pixar Studios has some spectacular animation, a lovable lead character, and plenty of chuckles throughout, but the unintelligible dialogue keeps it distant, and the pace lags heavily early on. Story is too complex for younger audiences, the gags—surprisingly—aren't sophisticated enough for adults, but it's made watchable by a very appealing WALL-E. Some good ideas, but nothing as awe-inspiring as previous studio efforts. **½",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"Not Bad, not that great.","I do not normally have an interest in writing reviews, but when I viewed a couple of them for this movie, there were so misleading as to demand a balance. Overall this is a nicely decent children's movie, but it is not a work of art nor is it at all thought provoking. It has a message and that message is slammed into your face multiple times. It is a good message, I would want my kids to get it and to live by it, but even a very young child doesn't need that many repeats. The plot is predicable. The anthropomorphic robots are somewhat charming. The jokes are cute, not really funny. The graphics are great. The movie steals from so many Sci-Fi movies as to look almost original, but anyone who has seen those movies recognizes them easily. Note: a good thing to do for adults getting bored is to see how many of those steals you can recognize. What I don't get is how many people suggested this is some fantastic effort. It isn't, but it is a pleasant little time waster.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar still does the trick,"Have you also noticed that Pixar still hasn't made one bad movie yet? I've liked all the Pixar movies, and this is the best one yet. It seems weird that people actually make things like this in Maya. Amazing actually. The message that I think was behind this movie was really good as well. A robot left behind and forgotten about cleaning up the Earth for 700 years and the only friend he has is a cockroach. Well I guess that he doesn't have very much else to do anyway.

Extraordinar*E,"i had high expectations with this film, as it is written and directed by Andrew Stanton, who helmed ""Finding Nemo,"" my personal favorite Pixar film. i was not disappointed.who knew an animated film with so little dialogue could keep you so engrossed in the story? you have to hand it to the guys at Pixar, they know what they're doing and they do it well. as always, they are able to imbue the least human of characters with humanity, infusing them with personality, warmth, humor, and empathy. in fact, the robots of this film may be more human than the humans.the animation has never been better, so startling are the visuals, and Thomas Newman delivers yet another incredible score. what makes this film different than the other Pixar movies is that it doesn't only carry the usual life-lesson moral with it, but also proclaims a social message to where we are now as humans and our reliance on technology and material possessions, and our apathy towards what we are doing to the precious planet we live on.the film only misfires a tad when the humans begin to have a bigger part of the plot, but the rest of the film is so great, it mostly makes up for this. this should easily be one of the best films of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Great movie and message(s).,"Wall-e was a 700 year old robot and the last of it's kind on Earth. Since garbage and pollution on Earth rose too fast over the 22nd century because no one was ""green"", the earthlings decided to leave their home planet and live on a massive, technologically advanced ship. Of course with the advancement in technology over the century, some robots can't think for themselves such as the evil ""autopilot"" which turned rogue. But as you can expect, Wall-e is very smart and can be considered a person as he has the basic feelings of loneliness and the need for a companion.What makes this movie amazing is the camera-less cinematography. The computer generated images of the deserted Earth is stunning, and throughout the movie I was just magnetized to the amazing scenery. It was done so well that it really makes you feel for the poor robot and makes you want this piece of metal to succeed.Along with the amazing artwork, this movie is loaded with different messages which can teach morals to the adult and children audiences. Being green and recycling, obesity and loneliness are all very well told, and even though we may already know that pollution is a problem and that exercising is important, this movie really opens our eyes as the story of this one robot's troubles can be related to todays modern society.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Whoa,"It's pretty damn impressive when a film can keep you engrossed for 90 minutes plus with virtually no dialog in it at all.In the distant future Earth is abandoned by everyone for reasons I won't spoil here. Before they leave, everything is turned off, scrapped, or taken with them...except Wall E, a robot who was accidentally left on. Wall E spends his days collecting junk, building amazing towers of cubed garbage, watching old movies, paling around with his cockroach friend(the only other living thing left on Earth) and day dreaming about one day falling in love. His dreams are answered when a girl probe robot gets dropped on Earth in search of organic life. Wall E falls head over heels and follows her home when her ship comes back for her. taking him on the adventure Pixar always promises.Like I said, the two leads barely speak, the only real dialog comes later by other characters after most of the plot has already been well established. But this doesn't encumber the story at all. Wall E tells us everything we need to know with his hands and eyes.

Hello Dolly? It Was Nice While You Were Gone,"First of all, what was with the constant replaying of that horrible song from one of the greatest stinkers of all time? I'm talking about ""Hello Dolly"". This movie was a total bore, and while the animation is superb, it's mostly a lot of whirring machinery, cold and sterile. The plot seemed lifted from elements of William Gibson's novel ""Neuromancer."" The amorphic human blobs are poorly rendered, by the way. My 5 year old granddaughter was bored stiff. This doesn't compare in any way to ""Toy Story"" or ""Finding Nemo."" Wait for the DVD and load up on plenty of coffee beforehand. Probably Pixar's worst yet. But seriously, does anyone have a take on the ""Hello Dolly"" obsession? Is it some sly, gay inside joke or what?",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Descent movie,"Wall-E begins on a deserted earth, where our little robot friend seems to be the last functioning unit of a once giant army of waste disposal machines. Humanity has long left the uninhabitable earth, yet Wall-E is still relentlessly doing his job.But Wall-E is more than just a robot, he has a personality which becomes clear early on as he interacts with his pet roach. He has his own little home where he has a huge collection of items that are either useful (like spare parts for himself) or just seem to be interesting, like a collection of lighters or an old video he regularly watches. However, watching the movie also makes Wall-E feel rather lonely as he realizes that he's all alone on this entire planet (save the roach).However, fate seems to smile upon little Wall-E as some day a giant space ship lands on Earth to drop off a probe (Eve) which seems to be searching something specific. Wall-E immediately falls into robot-love and tries to make contact with Eve which at first isn't as easy as it sounds.When Eve finds what she has been looking for, Wall-E and Eve go on a long trip to where the rest of humanity retreated and it's up to the two of them (with a little help) to save the day.So much for the story. First of all, let me tell you that from a technical point of view, this movie has the best animation you'll find out there. If it wasn't for some characters like the cockroach and the humans who were (purposefully) cartoonish, this movie would look almost real. Especially the first part of the film which takes place on Earth looks completely believable. Also, as always with Pixar, the individual shots are beautifully composed - again, it were especially the scenes on Earth that stood out. The Pixar guys really worked hard to make it look as if this flick was actually shot with a real camera.Still, this time, Pixar didn't blow my socks off. It was daring to make the first half of the movie basically silent, as it is only in the second half when it turns into a talkie. For me, this actually worked pretty well but I don't know how kids with a short attention span would react to that. Still, I was somewhat relieved when humans first came into play and the pace of this film increased.But that relief didn't last very long as the unfolding story really wasn't very intriguing, but rather a frame for a series of gags. Ultimately, the quality of Wall-E is its technical aspect combined with some scenes of comic relief. It is however not as clever or witty as previous Pixar productions.Still an above average film: 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Not as good as they say,"With all due respect, ""WALL-E"" is said to be such a great movie, but for me it isn't as good as they're making it sound. Although I rarely appreciate a CGI film, I had good expectations about this one. But it seems that my expectations were a bit too high. So, it's an overrated movie. I don't use the word ""overrated"" frequently, but this is one of those cases which I think deserves such word.The movie is visually triumphant. For a CGI film, the visuals are excellent, fresh, advanced and obey to high standards of quality. The sceneries look futuristic either, which is no surprising considering that our story takes place in the 22nd century.The movie actually starts very well and promising, with the WALL-E character doing his duty: to clean the garbage and mess of a lost, sad and desert Earth where everything is destroyed and humankind is a rarity now. The first 15 minutes are very good for this and for its sceneries. Speaking of these sceneries, the place itself and all those destroyed buildings made me think of Steven Spielberg's ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"" and also of a Citroen C4 TV commercial, where the car transforms itself into a robot and dances at the sound of the music ""Jacques Your Body"" by Les Rythmes Digitales. The only minor thing that bothers me a bit in the beginning is that WALL-E befriends with a cockroach which is always behind him.The sceneries in space and inside a spaceship (seen later in the movie), on the other hand, made me think a bit of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Star Wars"" and that Pizza Planet place in ""Toy Story"".Anyway, back to the beginning, when WALL-E meets a female robot named EVE, the movie begins to lose some of its original impact. For a story like this, romance was absolutely unnecessary, even more when the story is about robots and machinery. Plus, once the story in the spaceship begins, that's when it loses all its interest. That Captain guy annoyed me and the villains. The Captain and many other human characters are very poorly designed, as usual in most CGI movies. They tend to overdo their proportions. Not to mention that there are many silly moments, the story gets silly and so on.Despite that, the visuals inside the spaceship are very nice and interesting. They show quality and they look very realistic, almost looking like a giant shopping center from the future.One more thing: what was the point of those live-action scenes when the movie is supposed to be animated? And what is the music from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" doing here? As if it wasn't enough inserting that music in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", now they put it in here? I wonder how many more movies will do this in the future.The character WALL-E (an acronym for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class) is likable and interesting. Although he's a robot/vehicle from space, he looks a little like E.T. - besides, his voice sounds a bit like E.T.'s and combines a brilliant robot-like quality. I loved his voice, fits perfectly well for the character.Overall, a nice try, but like most CGI films, it's no match for ""Cars"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Shallow romance covered by tech bling,"Isn't it a standing theme of mainstream US production? Outstandingsd igital animation but poor in the soul department.I bought in on the local reviews. Usually they cut mainstream crap by the ankles so they make good measure for me, but after seeing this movie I felt very disappointed. It's nowhere near Shrek and Toy story 2 which were very witty and funny and are among the best I've seen of US digital animation. Technical prowess does not offset the requirement for an interesting plot, which in this movie is severely lacking and is at a level that probably would feel fresh to a pre-teen.A complete waste of time.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One of the greatest films. Ever!,"Wall-E. Wow. I was quietly hopeful that this film would be good as Pixar normally deliver, but this film is truly exceptional. Just when you think that Pixar surely must have peeked, they raise the bar again. Their brilliance is in the realization that eye candy will only take you so far, it's the characters and the story that will decide whether the audience invests emotionally. That's the measure of this film, there is almost no dialogue between the two main characters, it's all animated, neither are human and yet they manage to articulate their emotions far better than many a living breathing actor. OK so you may not be getting the shades of grey that accompany a gifted actors performance, Daniel Day-Lewis can sleep soundly, but in my opinion Wall-E stands up when compared with the very best that ""real world"" cinema has to offer. This film really has it all, amazing characters, brilliant story, vibrant universe, incredible animation, a message. Wall-E has all the right ingredients to make it an instant classic. I will take up no more of the time you could be spending actually watching this movie. Go see it. Now!I give this film two thumbs up and 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Brilliant storytelling and visualization,"I entered the theaters with high hopes after seeing Pixar's previous efforts. I found The Incredibles and Ratatouille to be exceptional. Under this prejudice I review WALLE:The movie's beginning brings you to a much darker and curious realm than you may be used to from Pixar. Get used to it WALLE is a darker (albeit rated 'G') cinematic experience that I would never describe as a kids' movie. The live action sequences and slight details of character animation and environmental interaction drove the humor in the direction of wit at tastefully waltz-like cadence. Some viewers will not appreciate such an approach to laughs in a world breeding seemingly generic comics, but that's another reason why I think WALLE succeeds in being excellent. Pixar once again breaks the mold and demands with excellence that the industry conforms to their standards.WALLE is one of those experiences your kids will have and then rediscover as adults, only then realizing how much they took for granted. If you're of an age to appreciate intelligent and beautiful cinematography and scripting you will thusly feel right at home.I would recommend WALLE to anyone, regardless of age or movie taste. This movie experience will rock you to your core if you are even slightly inviting to the new.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Wall-E.... Try blue, it's the new red!","Wall-E: 8 out of 10: I was never a big fan of the Short Circuit movies. It was not just the thespian outings of Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg I had issues with; I also hated the freakin robot. In addition, while I have admired some Pixar releases in the past (The Incredibles in particular), I am hardly the biggest fan of the studio and often admire some of their competition (such as DreamWorks’ Shrek) more.Therefore, I did not go into Wall-E with very high hopes. Had I known it featured the music of Hello Dolly I may never have seen it at all. After the first twenty minutes, I was blown away.I will let other reviewers explain the Chaplin style magic of the piece. Suffice it to say wow. When the movie settles into somewhat of a plot it does bog down slightly (There are at least one to many scenes of robots we do not care about chasing other robots we do not care about) but in reality it is simply a different magic.Emotionally satisfying and wonderfully subversive Wall-E is necessary viewing for adults. I am not sure if it necessarily a good film for young people with poor attention spans, but thoughtful kids will get much out of it.Moreover, kudos to Pixar for making one of the most individualistic anti-commercial films I have ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar at its best,"This is a great, great movie. This should be a lesson to the studios and their pre-packaged bilge that verbose and/or run-of-the-mill films should not be made. Put more resources into doing something well, like ""Wall-E"" and you will be rewarded.....to paraphrase from ""Field of Dreams"" - ""if you make it, they will come."" Be willing to take a chance and you might well come up with a gem of a film like this.This is the story of computer Wall-E, set many years in the future, perhaps the last functioning being in the United States after Earthlings have been forced to take refuge in a spaceship run by mega-company Big 'n' Large (think Wal-mart). It would appear that at the time that the ship left Earth, apparently having extracted all value from anything in New York, Big 'n' Large (BNL) was running (at least) New York City. As the film progresses we see messages filmed by the BNL CEO (played wistfully by Fred Willard) around the time New York City became uninhabitable, informing the residents of New York that the BNL ship would be taking off and that it was the best way for them to survive. This provides us with the backstory as to why the residents of the BNL ship are where they are. The film takes place in the 29th century as the last residents of Earth cross the universe in this ship, their lives on-board the ship exceedingly mundane and boring. They criss-cross the massive ship in orderly lines in little pods taking them from one dull thing to another. It seems they spend a lot of time lounging in huge open plazas, choosing and consuming items that can be purchased via individualized interactive headsets. People seem de-sensitized and bored, which is not surprising given they seem to be touring space seemingly without purpose or point. All of this is beautifully rendered by the Pixar artists. The images of the people and machines roaming the ship are gorgeous and imaginative. One of the surest signs that the Pixar artists are at the top of their game is that they render huge assemblies in the finest detail, depicting thousands of little beings in the most realistic manner, with no diminution of quality in spite of the large number of beings they have to depict. These huge meetings are awe-inspiring and remind me of some of the best animation depicting massive assemblies in ""Antz"".Meantime, back on Earth, Wall-E, apparently the last functioning creature in NYC, fulfills his purpose by organizing all of the discarded junk into massive piles. One of the most enjoyable elements of the film to me, was the manner in which Wall-E employed various items of our modern life in his existence. For instance, a videotape of a modern film was operated by an iPod. Also, Wall-E taped things he found interesting, using a cassette player. When his battery got low, the signal that it was re-charged was the ubiquitous Apple chime which one hears when an Apple computer is turned on. Wall-E methodically and systematically organizes piles and piles of junk, making instantly recognizable junk into large columns by which to impose some semblance of order on his environment. His life is quite dull and mundane. However, this changes one day when a robot named Eve from another ship lands on earth, seeking signs of life. Wall-E falls in love with her and when she is ordered back to her ship, he wants to return with her.From this simple premise comes the whole film. There is not much a lot of dialogue in the film, particularly during the first half, and very few actors involved-among them Jeff Garlin of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" as the bored but intrigued captain of the BNL ship, Sigourney Weaver as the Hal-like robot on the BNL, and a few others. In spite of the paucity of dialogue, Wall- E's affection for Eve is communicated very clearly, their determination to communicate convincingly with the Hal-like robot is communicated with ease, and the malaise which seems to afflict the occupants of the BNL is also expressed without much verbal communication. Perhaps most impressively, we get an appreciation of how much Wall-E enjoys and is interested in finding things which we the audience recognize. He makes only perfunctory, mechanical sounds, but the talented people at Pixar, under the direction of Andrew Stanton who also helped write the scripts to ""Toy Story II"", ""Finding Nemo"", and ""Monsters Inc"", are able to convey the full range of emotions which humans-and in the 29th century, apparently robots-feel. This is a joyous, special film in which one is reminded of the reasons why life and all our opportunities should be cherished. The fact that it captures the breadth of expression and feeling which we as humans experience, as well as the pioneering, creative animation, makes it an acceptable film selection for kids and for adults.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"""   Are we all that's left of Man's once promising  future ? ""","For several decades, some of the most brilliant scientists have been warning Earth governments, officials and their populations of the dangers of Global Warming and the consequences of not doing anything to stop it. Yet, Year after year and decade after decade, with a gigantic preponderance of accumulating evidence, our planet Earth is in danger of environmental disaster, yet few officials in any country are doing anything to stop it. They are like President W. Bush, who refuses to acknowledge our guilt, pretending it isn't our responsibility and burying their heads in the sand, hoping it will go away. This movie called "" Wall-E "" (Ben Burtt) is but one dark future ahead of us, if we do nothing. Planet Earth, 700 years into the future, has one remaining robot called Wall-E who is still carrying out it's primary function. It's job is to collect Earth's rubbish and make squares out of it and stack it into sky high column's, creating a replica of Earth distant past. Busy carrying out it's duty, Wall-E is interrupted, by a Earth probe, designed to learn if there is any plant life left on the Earth. The new probe is called Eve (Elissa Knight) and has our hero robot falling for her. The two machines are drawn together in a human-like drama which becomes a heart felt tribute to story-tellers everywhere. Both bring together the human race floating in a deep space vehicle commanded by Captain Jeff Garlin. Realizing the human cargo needs to return to their home planet, before they all sink into total atrophy, the Captain decides to head for home. Their only problem is the ship's computer called MacInTalk or AUTO who has orders to stop them.

Wall - 'A+',"Generally, expecting something bad from a Pixar film is close to impossible due to the fact that Pixar always has remained wonderful in its animation and Disney has backed it with a moving story. Wall-e too comes in this category at it succeeds in breaking the boundaries by enchanting us with the few amount of dialogues and more of a silent movie, which is supposed to be the condition of the cutest robot ever, Wall-e-'silent and painfully lonely'.This movie has unfathomable amount of detail and its animation is path breaking. I did not expect even such good animation from Pixar. Its even better that all their previous ventures and much better than animation of other studios.The movie's best bits are the moments on the earth which are magical.Its probably one of the best parts ever. Even after they leave the space, the movie doesn't drop its pace. Its funny, witty and loads of fun.I just wished that they remained for a longer time of Earth and they could have cut some of the space part instead. I also missed the cockroach who was so delightful that even though I find cockroaches very annoying, this one managed to capture my heart.The characters are just too good. Wall-e is so lonely and in need for company that his character manages to grab one's heart instantly. Eve too is really fine. The fat commander was really likable too. I also found the sweeper robot really funny.Overall, a great film. It surely should win Best Animated Feature of the Year. Kung Fu Panda is much lower on my ratings compared to this. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Is this REALLY the best Disney/Pixar film?,"Let me start off by saying I have grown up with Disney/Pixar movies. The day a brand new D/P movie came out was like Christmas morning for me. And I was never let down. Ever. Toy Story 1 +2, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, and Ratatouille all have amazing aspects to them that make them classics and some of the best family movies ever made. It is hard to pick a best one of these - they are all great in their own ways.That being said, I just finished watching Wall-E, the latest D/P ""masterpiece."" When I first saw the trailer, I was skeptical. It looked pretty stupid to me and I did not end up seeing it in theaters. After reading the rave reviews for it all over the place and the 8.5 rating on IMDb, I thought I would give it a shot.The first 30 minutes or so I was very confused. Some of the few other negative critics have used the word ""uncomfortable."" But, honestly, I thought it was stupid. There. I said it. Not even because it was not physically correct or whatever...or showed Liberal propaganda to children... but because it was just STRANGE. When EVE came it picked up a little bit. But one thing I have to say was that Wall-E annoyed me a little bit. OK - the first couple times he said ""EEEEEVE-uh"" and EVE said ""wwwwwuuualll-EEE"" it was kind of ""cute."" But after the 3 or 4 hundredth time, it started grinding on my nerves. I was not ""swept off my feet"" by the ""adorable"" romance of Wall-E and Eve. Again - a bit strange. I was really disappointed because I REALLY wanted to join the hordes of people who endeared this film, but I just couldn't. First 30 minutes - 3/10 As for the positives, OF COURSE the cinematics, visual effects, animation, art, and technical aspects were stunning. (I will say Wall-E was the best D/P movie in those terms.)A positive turning point came when we met the humans. I particularly liked the Captain for his bumbling, yet heroic aura. It was funny how they satired and exaggerated the American culture and what may become of it. It had a nice ending and an overall good story. I will not go into anymore of the positives, since the have been covered by the 70,000+ who gave this film a 9 or 10. For the rest of the movie I give a 7/10.But please, Wall-E doesn't come CLOSE to other D/P masterpieces such as Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Toy Story, Monsters, Ratatouille, and Cars. And best of animation of the year - Kung Fu Panda and Horton Hears a Who were both better. (OK - Wall-E WAS better than A Bug's Life - and Space Chimps).Again, I enjoyed this film and was thoroughly entertained by it. Also, I agree, it does reach a plateau in computer animation with its visuals. The story was nice. But a lot of it was just bizarre and definitely NOT D/P's best. Again I write these negatives with a heavy heart and I hope maybe if I let it ""digest"" I will be able to comprehend what others have heralded as ""an incredible cinematic achievement."" Overall for Wall-E - 6(sigh)/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Some Good Laughs...But Don't Be Surprised If You're Disappointed!,"I went to this movie with mixed feelings since I went with a friend on opening day. I have really enjoyed all of the other Pixar movies, but this movie had a dark political message behind it that doesn't need to be in what should be a light-hearted kids movie.It was funny in the beginning, but then turned into this movie with political messages all over. I was actually shocked on what Pixar was trying to covey to us. I wanted an enjoyable movie, but instead got just some laughs in the beginning and politics and what I thought was an unnecessary message in a kids film during the second half. Yes, I know what our problems are, but they don't belong in the film.If you spent $9.25 like I did at our brand new theater, wait until DVD or just skip it all together.

Out There! There's a world outside of Yonkers!,"WALL-E as most people have said is an excellent film. It is a work of art, plain and simple. For a mainstream film, a Disney film at that it is unbelievably original. I am a huge fan of many Disney and Pixar films for the sheer good feeling that you get from watching them, but WALL-E is the first to evoke a full range of feelings (Toy Story 1 & 2 are a close 2nd). When watching this movie you'll laugh, cry, think about the world and how it works and so forth. This is one of the recent animated films that actually got me choked up...a lot. For an animated film to not have any speaking for about the first 30 minutes and still captivate the whole world (toddlers to adults) is an amazing thing. This film is an absolute must for any fan of Disney, Pixar or just film in general.

No words can describe how majestic this film is,"Just days after the 2008 Academy Awards announced the winners, I had to see the best animation feature winner ""Wall-E"" in which all of my young cousins and nieces and their parents have seen this film and commented on it being wonderful making me the outcast of the bunch.""Wall-E"" takes place in the distant future where Earth has been destroyed due to the lack of care the people never gave into cleaning the trash making it a pile of ruins. All is left on Earth besides empty stores is a pile of junk rubble made into cubicles and set into buildings while a robot named Wall-E tries to make his ""Earth"" the way it was before the human population became extinct. There are no other creatures or animals with the exception of a cockroach that Wall-E considers a companion where the robot uses an abandon ship as his home filled with various toys and devices; the small robot uses an I-pod to watch a musical in which Wall-E tries to emulate the scene.Later in the film, another robot named EVE enters the absent Earth where Wall-E finds contact of his kind for the first time after years of being isolated that he tries his best to win her heart. Even though their only way of communication is by saying their names to one another along with certain one words, the two robots share a relationship where I had tears and a smile on my face. But what Wall-E doesn't know is that EVE was sent to look for a living organism (a plant) and sent it back to space to show that there is life on Earth. So Wall-E follows EVE to space with their adventure just beginning.""Wall-E"" is something for everybody. It may be a Pixar movie for kids and Disney fans to watch, but there's more to this film than just a kids movie or a Disney film. The film is everything for sci-fi fans to talk about, those who care for the environment (a later subplot in the film), or yet, those who love watching romantic movies where Wall-E and EVE are the first screen couple that aren't human and yet, I really felt an attraction to them as I cried during their scenes.It's that good and so wonderful that it should have deserved the best picture nomination.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Extraordinar-E,"It took me a while to actually watch Wall-E. People told me it was boring, there wasn't much dialogue, etc., etc.So when I caught it at the tail end of its showing here in Manila a few months ago, I came in with the lowest of expectations, perhaps expecting at least the quality of animation I'm so used to seeing from Pixar as its only redeeming value.Turned out, I was wrong. Who would've thought that with little dialogue in the first third of the movie that this would actually turn out to be a richly done animated picture? While it didn't have many laughs like Kung Fu Panda or even Bolt, this picture shows that love and hope can come from anywhere at anytime. Of course, it's balanced, well-paced and it has its share of laughs.Wall-E the protagonist (he reminds me of that Short Circuit robot from the 80's movies with Steve Guttenburg) is a unique robot. He has feelings, he's sentimental, and he's a collector of old memorabilia and interesting stuff. Plus he still does his business taking out the trash and even using the junk to make replicas of buildings. Cool.Visually stunning from beginning to end, Wall-E is a masterpiece of animation and directing. In fact, the movie has a rich detail in the portraying of Earth in the distant future as well as providing an imaginative perspective of how Earthlings could have evolved given a certain path taken. That was very interesting as well.Mostly, the movie portrays a message of hope. It may seem preachy, bringing to mind a similar animated flick in Happy Feet, but it's portrayed in such a way that it's acceptable to hear and you say to yourself, ""yeah... that's right."" It's got a level that can appeal to adults as well, and it's different than many of the things we see and consider as ""entertainment."" There are countless awesome (animated) movies that I've seen through the years, but Wall-E is so different that it's got to be included in my personal collection of worth-collecting DVD's.

"Great piece of film, teaches a lot of great life lessons","Pixar has done it again! I love their films, I can sit and watch any of their films with the kids and I enjoy them just as much as they do. My favorite one is still ""Monsters Inc"".Wall-E teaches us some great life lessons though. Some of it's obvious, with regards to trash for example. It's definitely a good idea to recycle and try not to trash the whole world (or space too in the case of this movie) but there's some great advice in their besides that.Wall-E takes us to a world where technology has made us all extremely lazy to the point where nobody does anything for themselves anymore. Not only that but it has made people anti-social toward other people. The very technology that people are so fascinated with could lead to our own undoing. By immersing ourselves in video games and online chatting all day long, we forget what it's like to just get out and talk to people...imagine that! The film isn't preachy though. It gives out advice and shows that this is one particular path we could all be headed in if we're not careful. It's great fun for the kids too. It's amazing how you start to feel genuine empathy for two robots and a cockroach.Fun for the whole family, I recommend it very highly",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Easily Pixar's best and a whole lot more, ""WALL-E"" is something special.","There's no reason Disney/Pixar's ""WALL-E"" shouldn't be able to compete with 2008's best films just because it's animated. Pixar compacts so much great material into this film, including incredible CGI, that I prefer it to live action. Live action could not tell the incredible story of WALL-E, the most admirable and lovable animated character to grace the screen in what feels like ages. This is truly Pixar's masterpiece: a film that takes everything you know about animated movies and rockets above and beyond it.Almost instantaneously, you fall in love with WALL-E, the only intelligent being left on Earth, which has become a wasteland full of trash, to which WALL-E is assigned to crush and organize in piles. It's remarkable how quickly Andrew Stanton's character connects with you. His love of collecting things we know as everyday objects as artifacts, his love of music and movies--the only of which he has is ""Hello, Dolly!""--and just the way he goes through his day creates something so deeply and essentially human that it's impossible not to like him. He is diligent, curious, a bit of a klutz and he's infatuated with the notion of finding true love. Almost everyone can relate to that.WALL-E's world gets flipped upside down when a spaceship lands and produces EVE, a robot dispatched to Earth by the humans now living off-planet who is responsible for searching for organic life. WALL-E is instantly love-struck and courageously pursues meeting and getting to know EVE. Eventually, he follows her back to the Axiom, a ship which is full of humans but run by robots. This is where ""WALL-E"" goes from being a really creative and well-written film to an amazingly creative, clever and even intelligent film. It does this by painting a grim and horrifying picture of humanity that comes across as deplorable but amusing--a non- threatening but nevertheless negative depiction of a universe where humans over- commercialize and consolidate Earth and end up living their lives in space, sitting in mobile chairs and relying on robots for everything. In this sense the film borrows from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (it even borrows Strauss' music at one comical point as an homage)All throughout this plot line is the love story between WALL-E and EVE, an unusual but very basic plot in the film. Unusual in that it's not covered in drama, but simple in that the two help save each other and that dedication fosters a love and a desire to not be lonely emotionless robots unlike the stoic species that humans in the film have become. The fact that the inventive and lively robots in this film who say barely anything capture our attention gain our approval more than the humans in the film says a lot about the job that Andrew Stanton and Pixar have done with ""WALL-E""Top that off with CGI that convinces you you're not watching CGI at times along with some great action sequences and this is a truly special movie. I haven't felt so moved by an animated film since I was 5 years old watching ""Lady and the Tramp."" Name another Pixar film you love and this one makes it look amateurish. If you have any appreciation for good visual storytelling, you will love this film and easily pardon its lack of dialogue and occasional slow parts because of the piece of art that it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The most . . .,"""With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls, For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do, that dares love attempt."" Shakespeare's Romeo and JulietForget making love (I can't). The new erogenous zone is the hand, specifically holding hands as featured in the new Pixar animation, Wall*E. A futuristic love story between the titular trash collecting robot (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), doing his thing for hundreds of fruitless years, and a beautiful search robot, Eve (appropriately named), who discovers he has collected the answer humans floating in space have hoped for, evidence that they can return to their garbage suffocated planet.Like all love affairs, it's difficult to figure out their attraction, but love it is, and it propels this little gem of a film right into the endearing space of Nemo, Toy Story, and my favRatatouille. Pixar and writer/director Andrew Stanton have the gift of displaying humanity in its flaws and its glories while chastising its destructive side, in this case the neglected environment.While the love story, hand holding and all, is worth the admission, the satire of an indolent, wasteful population accurately disturbs as our population continues to get fatter and more environmentally careless, to the point where we vacate the premises.The animators have drawn heavily and artfully from Star Wars, 2001, Hello Dolly, Seurat, and E.T., among others, but most of all the wizards have revived the simple love storyit shouldn't take animation, science fiction, and post- apocalyptic stories to do so, but heck, I've been looking for love since my second failed marriage a long time ago.Who would have thought? Handholding! Now that's simple and provocative, environmentally safe, and my 3rd grade nun's criticism of me (holding a little girl's hand: ""You dirty thing""). You can imagine how I loved tormenting her and being in love at the same time.

Well....,"I love Pixar...own it all...but Wall-e was just missing something. While I realize the partnership with Disney...this felt a little too Disney-ish for some reason. ""Here's the overly cute character....here's the hysterical sidekick.....here's the love interest....here's the nemesis.....blah blah blah"". Maybe the whole genre is finally too repetitive for me...and its really not Pixar...lol.It was still beautiful in detail. Maybe spinning off Ratatoulle...I was expecting something different. I'll still check everything out that they put out..but this was the first film I didn't want to buy to watch again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A Delight.,"It's several hundred years into the future and grubby little Wall.E is the last remaining robot on Earth, programmed to collect garbage around the world. By now the Earth has become such an unliveable mass of scum and debris that the humans had vacated the planet long ago, shirking responsibility for the mess they made to live it large in space.Wall.E's only company is a little cockroach that follows him about, until one day a spaceship lands in his vicinity, bringing with it Eve, a high-tech, no-nonsense pod robot that has been programmed to search for traces of life on Earth. Wall.E spies on Eve, and he is in turns bewildered and bewitched by her, but the principle emotion he feels toward her is love. So much love, in fact, that when the spaceship comes back to take Eve back, he follows his Goddess onto the 'ship and it takes them to where all the humans have relocated; floated around in Space and with no intention of going home.Any initial doubts I had about whether Pixar could pull off a futuristic robot movie were immediately quashed when we were introduced to the enigmatic robot himself. Wall.E's existence is a mundane one; forcing rubbish into cube after cube, which he piles together to make towers of rubbish, but he finds pleasures in the household items he encounters  a spoon, a light, a bra. Back in his ""home""  an upturned schoolbus he resides in, he gathers together all the items he collects, and falls asleep Hello, Dolly!, from which he becomes particularly fascinated with the act of holding hands, and wishes he has someone to do it with.The romance between Wall.E and Eve is believable (yes, believable!) and poignant; I had tears in my eyes when he was tending to her and holding an umbrella to shield her from the rain, even though it resulted in himself getting electrocuted. Though the film is about robots (humans don't feature until the second half, and even then they are just fat rolls operating electrical chairs, a sad reminder of where our society is headed) and the only words exchanged by the two leads are each others' names, this is one of the must ""humane"" movies I have ever seen, with a lot of soul.Beauty dominates practically every frame. The initial scenes of Wall.E captured the desolate, crumbling state of Earth, but Pixar has found loveliness in the most unexpected of places. This is Pixar's most ambitious movie to date, and the landscapes and details are appropriately cinematic (the planet is captured with such meticulous pans and fade-outs that it feels almost Shawshank Redemptionly, no real surprise when we consider that Roger Deakins worked as a visual consultant on the movie). Another filmmaker who helped make The Shawshank Redemption the masterpiece that it was, Thomas Newman, also contributed to Wall.E, and his score, whilst not matching his personal best of the other Pixar movie he wrote for, Finding Nemo, still ranks as one of his best, particularly in his usage of the harp, which lends an otherworldly feel to the film throughout.(Ahem. Sorry for all the references to The Shawshank Redemption here.) My only qualm with Wall.E is that there isn't enough humour in the movie. In a way, this is Pixar's darkest movie to date; with its messages about society's need to wake up to the problem of global pollution, commercialism, mass obesity and whatnot. The cheeky filmmakers even managed to slip in their own message to Disney; when the president in the old clip says ""stay in the course."" But all this means that, whilst there's the odd visual gag or two, Wall.E is not really all that funny, with no definite belly laughs. With last year's Ratatouille also failing to tickle my funny bones, I worry that Pixar are becoming darker and darker these days, and leaving the comedic roots that served them so well in the past.However, despite the fact that I cried more than I laughed, Wall.E still gets a resouding thumbs up from me. The animation is flawless, the entertainment is countless and for once, I became interested in sci-fi. And the denouement shows that it's not too late; redemption is still available and we can still save the world if we really want to.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wall-E is an instant animated classic!,"Unlike other Pixar films, I went into this one knowing next to nothing about the characters or storyline. I was absolutely floored. The film reminded me of Kubrick's '2001' and Chaplin's 'City Lights' and 'Modern Time' with Wall-E as the cute Chaplinesque robot on a mission of self-discovery and love. Eve is the perfect foil / robot love interest (whose design was allegedly influenced by the iPod). How often can a film, much less an animated film, mesh romantic silent film with sci-fi, consumerist satire, and post-apocalyptic dark comedy all in one? Sure, the ""humans are slobs"" motif is a bit heavy-handed, but I suppose our society deserves the wake-up call, subtle or not. 'Wall-E' is hands-down the greatest animated film ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
...and just when you thought Pixar couldn't get any better.,"Toy Stories, Monsters, Fish, Incredibles, Cars, Cooking Rats - all very good, some brilliant. It seemed like after Ratatouille, the idea of Pixar making another masterpiece seemed outrageous. And it happened. In June they came out with Wall-E, right up there with the best of the best.Wall-E is special because for me because for a good 60% of the movie, there is almost no dialogue. In the beginning of the film, the audience is engaged by the animation, the robots, their mannerisms. Wall-E is such a vivid character that even without words we know exactly what he is thinking and feeling.The story is great, the music is astounding, really just a brilliant, brilliant movie. Another Oscar coming.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar never ceases to amaze me.,"It all started back in 1995. I was only 6 years old, but I was forever changed when I first saw Toy Story. Today, it is one of my favorite movies as well as a breakthrough for all animated movies. Now, 13 years later, Pixar is still going at it. After all these years, I can honestly say they have never made a bad movie, and they have also made some really excellent movies that in the future will be absolute classics (Toy Story, The Incredibles, Ratatouille). Wall-E is undoubtedly the most ambitious task they have undertaken to date with a serious lack of dialogue and a story that has universal appeal. For the first half hour, the only sounds heard are those made by the robots. Yet, the story moves along just fine and it is quite easy to understand what is going on. This is due to the incredible storytelling ability by the Pixar team as well as the extraordinary animation you cannot look away from. Seriously, you will wonder if some shots are shot with a real camera they are so clear and beautiful. With robots being the main characters, it is a bit more difficult for the audience to relate to them, but director Andrew Stanton does a perfect job of personifying them as well as making them very likable. The romance between Wall E and EVE is very cheesy, but so well done you can't help but smile. Be aware, this movie is not just for children. Adults will be amazed by the animation as well as the thought-provoking themes brought up about the future and just how much humans should rely on technology. Elements of 2001 and I Am Legend aside, this is one of the top 5 Pixar movies and definitely one of the best movies of 2008.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar at its finest.,"Pixar is one of the greatest studios ever in moviemaking, period. They strive for ambition and doing things no one has ever done before or even try to attempt. Wall-E was no exception. I remember that I first watched this movie when I was a dumb kid, at the time english was not my primary language so I had a hard time understanding anything about any story. But thats when I watched Wall-E. It still baffles me to this day that how much I understood and felt for the characters despite the main characters only being able to speak 1 or 2 words. That was the ambition of pixar, to create a absolute masterpiece with the main characters never speaking a word (I know there are other stories with main characters not speaking but still non of them are as heartfelt as Wall-E). I recently watch this movie again, and I could not stop crying. Wall-E and Eve are absolutely brilliant, they are two characters that were able to form such a heartwarming relationship without ever speaking their emotions. That is what good storytelling is. I could go on so the TLDR is Wall-E is a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
lovely,"one of greatest animation character of the new millennium. and one of the most impressive animation films. for the delicacy to present each theme. for a love story who determine you to ignore each film from the same genre. for a dark image of future who has the right dose of hope to believe that a solution exists. for the seductive meeting between WALL-E and Eve. for the new perception about technology. and, sure, for the brilliant exercise to remember fundamental importance of small gestures. the poetry is the axis of this lovely story about humanity, robots and Earth. and the science to build, brick by brick, a coherent, wise warning about fate of world. so many themes who easily become boring... .and the magic of an animation to redefine the essence of each theme in a special film about a robot, its mission and its gifts.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Lovable little robot but lost a little interest towards the end,First of all when I saw the trailer for Wall-E I was excited to see another Pixar film. After watching the movie I couldn't help but to wish that the story was more isolated on the two main characters instead.At the beginning of the movie it was a little surprise to me with the subliminal message that they were saying but I was willing to see past that because of the little robot. He had the best characteristics from the beginning to the end of the movie and the fact that he was pretty much alone made it more interesting for me to continue on.By the time I got to the second half of the movie I found that my attention was taken from Wall-E back to the subliminal messages again which seem to linger on. It became a battle for me between caring about the little robot versus caring about the outcome of the human race especially towards the end.Overall I still think its worth seeing just for the production quality alone but be aware it will be a little preachy.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A magnificent piece of technical wizardry and storytelling prowess,"The film is usually preceded by a customary Pixar short; this one is 'Presto', and it revolves around a slight disagreement between a magician and his rabbit. It's excellent slapstick humor, and it certainly gets you into the right mood to appreciate 'WALL·E' all the more.The film starts off with breathtaking views of Space: nebulas, endless starry voids, galaxies, etc., all to the tune of the classic (and surprisingly fitting) 'Put On Your Sunday Clothes', from the 1967 musical 'Hello, Dolly!'. However, the visual beauty is short-lived, as soon we descend through a thick hazy cloud cover and arrive at Earth's surface, circa 2815 AD. The land is nothing more than an endless, barren landfill, with literal mountains of garbage everywhere in sight. The city we arrive in has half its skyscrapers actually made of garbage. The only signs of life in this deserted, strikingly forbidding landscape is a little roving trash compactor named WALL·E (synthetic voice by Ben Burtt), and his one companion, an oddly cute little cockroach.Wall-E is not your typical robot. He's been on this deserted planet doing the same thing for God-knows-how-long, and over time, he's developed a personality: he's very curious and inquisitive, has a sweet and gentle disposition  and is also quite a bit lonely. He lives in an old utility transport truck, which he's filled with random knickknacks of the past Human society (including sporks, a Rubik's cube and bobble-head figurines). Every night before shutting down, he would constantly watch 'Hello, Dolly!' on an old jury-rigged iPod (magnified with a large screen), from which he learned about such things as love, and holding hands (which become patterns throughout the movie).Eventually, this dull monotony is shattered when a mysterious spacecraft suddenly arrives on Earth, and as it leaves, it leaves behind a sleek white probe-bot: EVE (voiced by Elissa Knight). Wall-E is instantly smitten with Eve, yet she hardly even notices him  except when she nearly blasts him to smithereens now and then. She endlessly scans the land for any signs of plant life, yet when she fails at this, she finally takes an interest in Wall-E.However, she does soon find a plant (which was previously found by Wall-E himself, and serves as the movie's MacGuffin), yet instantly deactivates, leaving a confused and lonely Wall-E to try and take care of her inactive body. Yet, just when Wall-E believes she has gone away for good, the mysterious spacecraft returns and retrieves her. However, having had his first taste of company in about seven centuries, Wall-E isn't about to let her go that easy.Already at this point, this story is unfolding and revealing itself as being Pixar's most daring and imaginative tale yet. Not only about the whole 'robots in love' bit, which in itself is quite unique and engaging, but also in the methods used to tell the story. There is very little dialogue through-out the movie, with some sparse lines here and there; the bulk of the movie is conveyed via Chaplin-esquire visual storytelling. This was a critical move on Pixar's part, one that would certainly have spelled certain disaster for so many other companies, yet the masters at Pixar have once again shown that nothing is impossible with the right techniques, skills and talents. The movie doesn't spell it all out for you, and requires a minimum of thought to be understood, yet this never feels imposed or restricting.The technical side to this film is simply flawless. The animation is, in my honest opinion, the single best piece of CGI work in history. The graphics are so photorealistic, so incredibly detailed, so  lifelike, that it's the most engaging visual feast ever created on a computer. The score, from Thomas Newman ('Shawshank Redemption', 'Finding Nemo'), is an eclectic mix of digital sounds and effects with a traditional orchestra, and the result is rich and intriguing. All sound effects are credited to sound wizard Ben Burtt (who also brought us the sounds in the 'Star Wars' films), and he does a fantastic job in bringing sound and feel to Wall-E and his world.The main focus in 'WALL·E' is the blossoming love story between Wall-E and Eve. Directed and mostly written by Andrew Stanton (who also brought us 'Finding Nemo'), it's one of the purest and most touching romances we've seen in a long time; it takes its time to develop, we don't have the characters immediately falling into each other's arms like some robotic version of 'Romeo & Juliet'. The characters are relatable and affable, something that can hardly be said for the vast majority of movie characters out there. There are some truly beautiful scenes, such as a Space-dance between Wall-E and Eve, that haven't been matched in the many movies I've seen before or since in its simple visual and emotional beauty.I completely and utterly lost myself in the experience of 'WALL·E', something that has never happened before or since, and any movie capable of holding my complete and undivided attention for its entire duration has definitely done something right. This film will undoubtedly become a classic in the years to come, and shall make an amazing addition to any real moviegoer's collection.* * * * * For lighting the screens with its magic and pure beauty, and for moving me in ways I deemed were impossible previously, I award 'WALL·E' with 10 delicate little saplings out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Possibly one of the most important children's films of our time,"Stunning animation, charming comedy, cute characters, yeah yeah... yada yada yada... you've heard all that already if you've read through any of this board.But if you look past the groundbreaking animation and the brilliantly-conceived characters, you're left with a film that is drilling some truly important messages into the heads of our children.WALL-E manages to successfully communicate several key themes about the environment, over reliance on technology, and love. It does so on a level that impacts both the adults and the children in the audience. It's an admirable and responsible effort to steer young and impressionable minds onto a decent track. Bravo Pixar. Bravo!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Absolutely magical,"This is by far the BEST movie that Pixar has ever made, hands-down. If WALL-E is a 5-star movie, then all other Pixar movies are 4-star movies in comparison. It is that magical.A big part of the magic comes from the fact that the two main characters, robots Wall-E and Eve, barely speak more than one word at a time. Just about all their lines can be written with just one of these three words: ""Wall-E,"" ""Eve,"" and ""Directive."" Despite that, through excellent animation and wondrous voice direction, the audience is always aware of exactly what those two robots are thinking and feeling every second.Now, I love movies with good dialogue, and we all love witty banters between characters. But by their very nature, language -- especially the witty sort -- requires intellectual interpretation before it can appeal to the audience's emotions. By minimizing the role of language in portraying the relationship between the two robots, Pixar has gone straight to our emotions, and they have succeeded magnificently.Of course, that's not to say that the movie is only about sappy emotions. The movie also makes a lot of satirical fun at everything from global corporation (everything is Buy n Large, and there is no sign of US government, or any government for that matter), environmentally irresponsible consumerism, cellphone- and television-addicted culture, lethargic and obese general public (and commercial billboards that portray fit models), internet generation who don't know what a book is (and think that pizza grows on trees), so on and so forth. Plus, there is also a pretty refreshing gender role/stereotype reversal between Wall-E and Eve, especially near the end.Visually, the movie is breathtaking. Particularly of note are the smoke and particle effects, like the scene early in the movie where Wall-E finds a fire extinguisher. Jawdroppingly beautiful and realistic. It makes you want to pull out all other movies with CG smoke effects and yell ""FAKE!!"" at them. It's amazing how Pixar keeps on finding ways to push the 3D CG envelope.It is not often that a movie exceeds my highest of expectations, and WALL-E did with ease. You can be sure that before the theatrical run is over, I'll be watching this movie at least one more time. And then I'll get it when it's released on Bluray. I do not say this often, but this movie is, without a shred of doubt, a true classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
How do overweight people feel about WALL-E?,"I read one very short thread on the message board for this movie about whether people think that WALL-E is ""anti fat people,"" but I'm interested in thinking and writing more about this topic.Personally, I am not overweight, but I was growing up, so I might have a thinner skin on this subject than some. I could tell that the filmmakers were working hard to be as kind as they could given the facts of the plot and characters that they had created - and given the fact that they were pushing an overall message of individuals taking personal responsibility for some very broad social problems.Of course they weren't able to incorporate a nuanced social critique of the psychology of obesity-as-eating-disorder or some such thing that might be better left to Oprah and Dr. Phil. But it did seem to me that the filmmakers were pushing what I thought was a pretty well-reasoned thesis that people can be led by the profit-motivated logic of capitalism into behaviors that are unhealthy at best and devastating at worst.I also thought it was interesting that the unhealthy behaviors that had lead to their extreme and infantilizing form of obesity were depicted very precisely as de-humanizing (or stated more precisely ""de-adultizing""). As viewers we see that humans at the time of the launching of the AXIOM were indeed human (the use, jarring to some, of the human actor Fred Willard, and other ""live action"" images of humans in the movie), but over the course of 700 years humans had become ""giant babies"" in hovering incubators - their every need indulged by extreme high-tech devices.This progression from human to... something else is underscored when we see the pictures of the series of ship's captains, each of which looks more ""cartoonish"" and infantile that the one before it.I liked the fact that the overweight, de-adultized people were heroic in the movie, but I'm not sure how I feel about the overall message and whether it will come off as just more anti-fat negativity to adults who truly struggle every day with overweight/obesity concerns.I think that perhaps my biggest concern might run somewhere along the lines of this: do people (especially overweight people) think that the anti-overindulgence / pro-personal-responsibility message of WALL-E was delivered with enough real love behind it to actually inspire change in people's lives and in our culture (and I mean US culture, because that is the culture to which this movie's message is clearly pitched)? I hope so, and this is something that I always wonder about when movies come along that seem to genuinely desire to create social change through the power of their artistry.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

The Greatest Pixar Film Yet,"I had high expectations for this movie when I walked into the theater, and all expectations were met beautifully.

The graphics were breathtaking, the plot brilliant & original & the characters very well thought out. The movie kept me fixed at the edge of my seat & all of my emotions expressed (not loudly, though). The film gets a bonus star for the homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey (Autopilot).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Whimsical, humorous and thought provoking. In other words, pure Pixar!","Face it, where would Disney be without Pixar? Not only does the company continually push the boundaries of CGI imagery and craft incredible movies, but they do it on such a continual basis that it defies modern film-making. Surely they must have one bad movie that would merit a Disney license? If Wall-E is any indication, it's not going to happen for a very long time.Now there have been quite a few people complaining that Wall-E's political undertones (or overtones, I can never tell which one) are too blatant or overbearing. To them, I say lighten up. Sure, the fear of corporate control and human's causing their own downfall through waste themes have been covered before. However, none of them were presented in such a unique and approachable way as in this film. In fact, I say the film benefits greatly from these themes because it helps expand the film to an adult audience. This could have easily been a mindless romp with cute robots (much like the miscreant animated films Robots), but the messages beneath give the film brains to match its heart.And boy does heart really mean something here. It still surprises me that Pixar can create such deep and involving stories on simplest of premises. A robot, yearning for companionship, finally finds a chance for romance in the form of a sleek, Macintosh white female robot. That's pretty much all the actual plot is about, despite the political themes. What carries the plot so far is the in depth characterization, effective use of nonverbal communication and a surprising range in emotion. The boys at Pixar follow the philosophy of Walt Disney to the bone hear, matching every laugh with equal amounts of tears. But not tears of sorrow mind you, but tears of joy. There are so many tender moments in this film that its hard not to let out a tear when everything comes to a close. Classic Disney.Really though, Wall-E is all about...well, Wall-E. He is by far one of the most likable lead characters to come out of a Disney film in a very long time. For one thing, he hardly says a word, which is an improvement from the Disney characters that never shut-up. Two, the fact that an artificial being can develop emotions and desires and maintain our sympathies is a triumph to itself. And three, he's just such a little trooper. He faces the cold emptiness of space, menacing robots, malfunctions and all sorts of perils all for the robot he loves. I dare say he's braver than any of the Incredibles. Plus, you just got to love his speech, which is a delightful range of electric boops combined with a sort of garbled Microsoft Speech voice when attempting words.All of Wall-E's characters are equally as deep as the lead. Eve is more than just a typical love interest, expressing moments of short tempered anger as well as compassion. Though it takes her a while to truly respond to Wall-E's advances, the progression of their romance feels natural. And again, there is no sappy dialog to ruin the experience, so the romance feels pure and simple to understand. The human characters, who are all morbidly obese due to their use of hover chairs and almost trance like existence under corporate control, actually stand on their own too. Even As more humans become aware of their existence and past one by one, we are just as sympathetic to their curiosity of what they missed all this time. I chuckled to myself as two ""freed"" people splash happily in a pool they never realized existed, only to realize perhaps this is the first time they have ever truly experienced such a leisure. Perhaps one of my favorite moments is when the captain of the humans' ship begins probing the computer over human history. As hours fly by (or so we assume between the intervals), he innocently continues this quest with a childlike curiosity, fascinated by simple things like pizza, farming, dancing and such. It really made me treasure the simple pleasures of my life so much more.Maybe Wall-E isn't the best movie of all time. Then again, I bet people said that about The Godfather, Lord of the Rings, The Shawshank Redemption and even the first Toy Story. If so, then I will have to say that by Pixar standards, Wall-E is by far their most ambitious, simple and heartfelt outings yet and definitely the best of the year so far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Good Film,"Wall-E (2008)*** (out of 4)Pixar film takes place seven-hundred years in the future when Earth is empty of humans because of all the trash they left behind. Wall-E is a robot system who cleans up the trash but after years of loneliness our hero comes across a new robot who is here to see if humans can return. Soon the two are on a trip through space with the human race up for grabs. I can't say this film knocked me over as much as I was expecting but there's no doubt this is a very strong film. I was mainly attracted to the film after reading interviews with the production team when they said this was very much a silent picture and that's what they were going for. I think that was a great description and they certainly did their homework as the character Wall-E really comes off like a Charles Chaplin type character. I think the film also owes a bit to Spielberg's E.T. but that's certainly not a bad thing. The animation is downright flawless and the imagination behind it is simply mind blowing. The opening thirty-minutes were probably my favorite as we see what appears to be skyscrapers but on closer viewing it's just the trash that Wall-E has been gathering. The visuals in these early scenes are quite remarkable and that includes the house Wall-E lives in with various items that he's collected over time. The stuff on the space ship is just as entertaining with all the references to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The one thing that bothered me about the film were the ""human"" characters. I'm guessing there was a point in having all of them look alike but I never really cared for any of them and whenever they were on screen I kept thinking they were taking away from the real fun, which was the robots.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A would-be great film ruined by the unsubtle sociopolitical sledgehammer message in a G-RATED film,"***Minor spoilers, but nothing crucial***First of all, I'm not a conservative. Far from it. That said, I decided to see this film based on my reaction to the trailer, which piqued my curiosity. It's about a lonely robot in the wasteland that departs for something otherworldly, and that's it.I truly loved the beginning of the film -- at least the first 20 minutes, mostly dialogueless in minimalist style, focused on Wall-E and his discovery of something alien. This was quite audacious for Pixar for reverting to minimalist style considering children might have short attention span because they need cartoon characters that talk and joke in rapid-fire conversations (which I hate in animated films).I almost cried near the ending which was quite an achievement for animated films after Pinocchio, Bambi, Beauty and the Beast and Spirited Away, and I rarely cry at the movies. Personally, I like the first 20 minutes and last five minutes the best. In between the film it's a naked sociopolitical film which is very ill-suited for children and may offend the adults' intelligence, contrary to positive reviews' claim it's a terrific film that will appeal to all ages.A political message disguised as satire was already done and *better* (for lack of expression) in Mike Judge's film Idiocracy. Wall-E may be genuinely offensive to some viewers -- it sums up the message as thusly: that fat and lazy humans are responsible for neglecting and destroying Planet Earth because of mass consumption promoted by irresponsible corporate culture.I find this message profoundly hypocritical, given the fact there is merchandising for Wall-E (go to Toys R' Us or check Amazon or ToyWiz for proof). The recent worst offender in overdone merchandising for movie promotion is Cars, which I never saw and do not intend to because I heard it's the worst Pixar film to date for contrived story.Andrew Stanton and co should leave idiotic politics at home because it won't work well with me, as I'm sure millions will concur with me that Pixar should not be a vehicle to push propaganda while being profoundly hypocritical with the merchandising toys that will end up in the landfills once children and collectors find products of no value. The fact that Andrew Stanton chose to use Wall-E as a vehicle for a soapbox message is nauseating that might actually dilute the emotional and aesthetic impact of the film.WALL-E begs for a fan edit by eliminating and minimalizing the human parts and unnecessary scenes to focus on Wall-E and its love interest to maximize emotional resonance without any pandering political idiocy (environmental or otherwise, because the point is already made by ""Idiocracy"" despite its R rating limiting the audience). Call it ""The Slim & Lean Version"" that runs at only about 45 minutes. A talented editor eliminated and silenced Jar-Jar Binks character in the legendary alternative version of ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" and ""improved"" Episode II by removing 38 minutes of bad materials (The Phantom Edit).I support environmental issues as long as it is sound, but Wall-E was definitely harmed by the non-subliminal politiking in the middle (which makes it tedious in pacing and tone change) that have no reason to be in the gosh-darned G-rated film.Excellent CGI art all around, the best yet in a Pixar film so far, and the most poignant story involving only scenes with Wall-E. It would be a lot better as a short, yet the obnoxious message was forced into the film by petty ""liberal-bent"" politics at Pixar to pad the length. This may translate to less earnings at the box office once the mixed word of mouth propagates with dissatisfied adults taking children to the movies, expecting (to put it simply) ""mindless"" entertainment only to be insulted by the pandering attitude of pompous and moralistically shrill Pixar storytellers.*** out of 4",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Too smart for too many,"I loved this movie. Just loved it. My favorite Pixar film and now one of my favorite films period. So when I went to Yahoo and saw a number of users rating it in the C,D,F range (causing the user aggregate to be a B-) I was perplexed and a bit saddened. The reviewers who didn't like it REALLY hated it for all the reasons I loved the movie: great story (they were bored and thought it preachy), fantastic characters (they were annoyed by the multiple utterences of ""eva"", ""walle""), stunning visuals (they thought was too bleak), perfect direction (again - they were bored. that 1st 20-30min of no dialog should win an Oscar - just brilliant), mesmerizing score (they didn't comment on this, but man I love Thomas Newman's work. and Andrew Stanton's use of the Hello Dolly songs is just genius). I know that nothing, no film, no proposal, nothing will every get 100% approval, that's just how life works - everyone has an opinion, but when I read some of the negative scathing comments it just makes me wonder who these people are and why they are that way. The Pixar folks tell timeless tales using state of the art technology and good old fashioned creativity.

Why are so many people so rhapsodic about WALL-E?,"Can I just ask, what's the big deal here? Why are so many people so rhapsodic about WALL-E? I'm a big fan of science fiction in general and a bigger fan of Pixar, and this is the first Pixar movie I've seen where I found myself glancing at my watch, more than a little bored and anxious to get home.Two big problems for me: #1: the insipid cockroach, which seemed wildly out of place in a movie that was otherwise reasonably intelligent and scientifically sensible.And #2: the machines' voices, which seemed maximized for mechanized silliness. I can accept that WALL-E and EVA machines might exist, but I can't suspend disbelief and accept that anyone would design machines with such goo-goo da-da infantile voices.Without these two concessions to kiddie-flick standards, it would've been a lot easier to be drawn into the story. With these faults, every time we saw the roach or heard the machines' voices I felt like I was taken back to Romper Room, being told a kiddie story by someone who thinks I'm four years old.For all the hype about WALL-E, this wasn't half as good as THE INCREDIBLES, MONSTERS INC, or FINDING NEMO. If it was from somebody else I'd say WALL-E shows promise, but by Pixar standards, sigh ... of their nine feature films so far, I'd put this one in ninth place.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Great characters, but disappointing environmental agenda.","Wall-e is a great character, really cute and all. Same with Eve and M-O. But give me a break.From the very beginning there were piles of trash all on the earth. The premise to the movie is that all humankind had to leave the planet forever because they destroyed it with their trash.The environmentalists will love this movie. It tells kids that humans are ruining the planet and don't even care. It tells them to stop living ""big and large"", stop trying to succeed in business. It tells them they cannot be a success unless they plant trees all day.Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against helping the environment. I don't litter and I do my best to keep stuff clean. But this crap is silly.I went to see a cute movie with a cool character, and all I could think about the whole time was how little kids are getting these wacko ideas shoved into their heads that humans, specifically Americans, are evil.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Perfect in every way, like only Pixar can deliver.","I've been excited for Wall-E ever since I saw the first ""teaser"" preview for it about a year ago. The trailer was about 20 seconds long, and consisted of Wall-E scooting around some piles of garbage, then looking up at the stars and saying his name. So, obviously, my expectations were pretty high - and I'm happy to say that the movie didn't disappoint me in the slightest. It was funny, adorable, touching, meaningful, and basically perfect in the way that no one but Pixar can manage to achieve.Lately I've been seeing a lot of news stories about the fact that there's no actual dialogue for most of the movie - in fact, I don't think there's dialogue for at least a half hour - and that Pixar is taking a big risk by doing that. You shouldn't worry about it at all, though. Words aren't needed - in fact, they probably would've ruined the feel of the movie. You'll fall in love with Wall-E anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A true Pixar classic.,"Well I've just been lucky enough to go to a preview screening of 'Wall-E' and all I can say is its brilliant and simply one of the best films in Pixar's ever expanding cannon. Director Andrew Stanton whose previous film was another Pixar classic 'Finding Nemo' has excelled beyond anything we could have expected and here everything works perfectly. The animation is pristine and I'm sure sharper than the human eye can actually see, the score fits and flows with the story and the sound done by Ben Burtt (think all the weird noises from Star Wars) is crisp, clear and beautiful. Like any good Pixar film and any kids film worth its weight it works on many levels allowing the more grown up amongst us to laugh along with the younger audience and laugh you can as the practically dialogue free film sees Wall-E himself as a kid of robot Chaplin with each slapstick visual timed to a tee. A lot of this relies on the design of Wall-E a kind of cross between 'Short Circuits' Johnny five and 'The Black Holes' V.I.N.C.E.N.T. and the fact that he is so aesthetically pleasing while also being able to be so animated is part of the overall charm. The story a simple boy meets girl or should I say robot meets robot has been done to death but here seems to dazzle with a new lease of life and my only criticism of the movie is that at times the whole moral message of recycling, looking after the planet etc is a little shoved down your throat and I know it's the zeitgeist of the moment but I wanted to be entertained not bummed out. Elsewhere there are great pastiches to '2001' and 'Close encounters', the misfit robots are hilarious and never have fat people been so funny. Wall-E has everything you could want; it looks good, sounds good, is very funny and has all the magic you have come to expect from the boys at Pixar. Not only is Wall-E a great film it is as close to a perfect movie as you could hope to get. A big triumph for a little robot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Pixar has done the impossible and improved their game in every way, and made what will likely be considered one of animation's greats in the process.","It's been a rare occurrence over the past 5 years or so to see an exceptional sci fi film. Most films have fallen flat, disappointed, or never taken off. As we wait for a hopeful resurgence next year with such planned epics as Intersteller, Avatar, Battle Angel, Ender's Game, T4, Star Trek and others, we have on our hands a small masterpiece in the form of Pixar's latest and greatest film Wall E. It's been said many times that Pixar would never outdo the incredible Incredibles, at least until Ratatouille came out last year, which many called an even superior work to Bird's previous masterpiece. I can't say I agree with that, but the latest from Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton has to be up there with the greatest animated films ever created, and indeed, the greatest films in sci-fi cinema's history.The first 20 minutes of the film are almost completely silent save for the hum of Wall E's wheels. In the background the lonely robot listens to a taped rendition of Hello Dolly. He spends his days with his insect friend compacting trash and collecting odd knickknacks which he saves in a collection. His life is changed forever when humanity sends Eve to Earth to look for plant life. While there she and Wall E fall in love and her departure leads Wall E on a journey through space and into the last vestiges of human life.The plot is simple, but it is almost poetic in how delightfully it moves forward, each twist, while expected, gives the viewer joy. It seems strange how in a year full of unromantic romantic comedies, the film that rises above the pack is an animated film about robots. But truly, Wall E has to be one of the most romantic movies since Titanic. The emotions shown by these robots is just staggering, especially considering their single digit word vocabularies. It seems just unreal how two non-talking animated machines can deliver a greater emotional package than real human actors, but such is the case, and such is the magic of the geniuses at Pixar.In addition to love story and slapstick comedy, Wall E is also a stinging message about consumerist society, the dangers of our desire for bigger and larger, and the risks of laziness. Added to this are humorous punches at Apple, sci-fi film-making, and apathy. Indeed this is easily the most adult Pixar film to date, and shows maybe more than any animated film before it that the cartoon can be both a source of entertainment and a springboard for the furtherance of important issues.As Wall E draws to a close you feel that you have experienced something special, a film so extraordinary that it transcends its perceived limitations to create what is easily the best film of the year and truly one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made.Helping with this are the visual masterminds at Pixar. The world of Wall E is an artistic and technical masterpiece. The remnants of Earth deliver a haunting glimpse into our planet's possible future, with the sky covered in brown, trash littering every inch of the landscape and massive stores taking up blocks of city streets. It is easily the most frightening and oddly beautiful post-apocalyptic future shown in American animation, and actually comes close to comparing to the haunting visions of the Japanese post-apocalypse masterpieces like Naussiccaa of the Valley of the Wind, Ghost in the Shell or Akira. When Wall E leaves this planet the audience gets treated to a breathtaking view of outer space only possible in an animated feature. The cruiser that Wall E finds himself on is an inspired masterpiece, feeling more alive, more real, and more immersive than other iconic ships like the Death Star or the Enterprise. Indeed, the ship and its inhabitants possibly more than anything else sent shivers down this viewer's spine. Trust me when I say, if you are bored by the Chaplinesque opening act stay around for part two as things get if anything more disturbing than during the first half.Wall E is essential animation. Pixar has proved for 20 years that it is the leader in computer animated cinema, and Wall E will most likely serve as the height of their illustrious lineage when historians look back upon them. Many said last year that Brad Bird's cooking rat would remain Pixar's most enduring achievement. Well let me say right now, Pixar has done the impossible and improved their game in every way, and made what will likely be considered one of animation's greats in the process.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Amazing,"I can't imagine how demoralizing it must be to work for Dreamworks animation division. They've made some very popular cartoons but they always seem to missing a little something. No matter how good they might get, they somehow always pale in comparison to Disney/Pixar.And then they make Kung Fu Panda. As good a movie as they've ever made. It's charming, heartwarming, beautifully animated with a great story and exciting action. They seem to have finally out ""Pixar-ed"" Pixar.And then comes WALL-E.WALL-E opens in the year 2700. Earth has been abandoned due to an out of control consumer culture. Earth can no longer sustain life due to the enormous amounts of refuse that mankind has created. WALL-E units are used to collect, compact and stack the trash. (WALL-E is an acronym for ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth Class"".) However, Earth has been abandoned for so long that all other WALL-E units have broken downexcept for our main character.WALL-E continues collecting, compacting and stacking. Trash stacks are everywhere and reach as high as skyscrapers. It's a futile task that rivals that of Sisyphus. WALL-E's only friend is a cockroach and a VHS copy of Hello Dolly, which he watches repeatedly.Eventually EVE, a robot probe from the Earthlings in exodus, arrives. WALL-E falls in love with his new robot companion. EVE is also an acronym, but I won't reveal what it stands for as it would be a bit of a spoiler. Upon completing her mission, EVE is retrieved and returned to AXIOM, a floating city-sized (or perhaps even larger) ship where humans have been living for the last 700 years awaiting Earth to regain its life-sustaining ability.AXIOM is completely run by robots that cater to the humans' every whim. Because of rampant obesity and the deterioration of their bones (due to reduced gravity in space), humans no longer walk, they are transported on a device that looks like a hovercraft and a Rascal Scooter had a baby. All humans exist in their own virtual worlds, enraptured with their personal holographic computer screens that are an ever-present fixture in front of them.But we aren't meant to have disdain for these people. What could have come off as mean-spirited is actually treated with compassion. They've lived for generations in an environment like this. It's all they know. They would want something different if only they knew that there was something different.What's amazing about WALL-E is how much could have gone wrong. Here's a short list: It takes place on an Earth that's a post-apocalyptic wasteland.  Mankind is lazy, obese and happy that way.  WALL-E's best friend is a cockroach.  WALL-E plays songs from Hello, Dolly throughout the film.Oh, and this is essentially a silent movie.Yeah, you read that right. There is maybe 15 (non-consecutive) minutes of dialogue in the whole movie.But the beauty of it is nothing went wrong. Not. One. Thing. Everything about this movie works. WALL-E is, quite simply, a masterpiece of storytelling.It is so richly layered and works on so many levels that, even after only one viewing, I feel confident that we will be discovering things in this film for years to come. I can't imagine another studio making this movie. They would have second-guessed it right out of existence.If it wasn't for the fact that Stanley Kubrick has been dead for close to a decade, I would have thought he had created this film under a pseudonym. There are so many Kubrickian flourishes: from the use of classical music to the meditation on mankind's relation to computer technology and artificial intelligence to the role corporations will play in the advancement of said technology. There are some pretty heady themes explored in this film. But it does all this without ceasing to be a film for children. It's a movie that children won't outgrow but grow into.This film has depth, but it never forgets to entertain. It's cute, charming and heartwarming. It's briskly paced AND remarkably detailed. And let's not forget, it is genuinely funny. This is not an ""eat your vegetables"" cinematic experience. This movie works on every conceivable level. Even its closing credits are good.And, as an added bonus, Pixar continues its tradition of including a cartoon short that precedes the film. Titled Presto, the plot involves an adorable, hungry rabbit and his magician owner doing battle over a carrot in front of an oblivious sold-out crowd. Presto is a crowd pleaser. It manages more laughs in five minutes than most feature length cartoons can muster in ninety.On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being Aladdin and 1 being Aladdin 2: Return Of Jafar, WALL-E gets a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Best Pixar Movie yet, and coming dangerously close to perfect.","A robot who picks up garbage on a deserted Earth. Virtually zero dialogue. A message regarding pollution. A true recipe for disaster. But in a move surprising no-one, Pixar has made it work, and work it does. It's truly a brilliant movie, with virtually no issues to bog it down. The plot revolves around Wall-E, a dinky little robot which goes around picking up garbage, from which he salvages a few things. A rubics cube, a spork, a plant; all interesting things which Wall-E finds and keeps. He also watches an old copy of ""Hello, Dolly"" which he finds endlessly amusing, to the point that he reenacts a dance scene with a garbage can. But Wall-E wants someone to love. And thats the true plot that guides this movie. Wall-E falls in love with an apple-ish robot named Eve, and the movie chronicles their time together. I suppose you could go anywhere for informed opinion about how great this film is, but I wanted to go over some of the faults found, namely pacing. Do not let these comments throw you off. This film has virtually no repetitive moments at all, and Wall-E more than makes up for it with its titular main character, who invokes immediate sympathy and trust. Wall-E is so good because of the pain you feel for the little robot, and the fact you can identify with him. He's the everyman whose fallen for the supermodel, and when him and Eve get closer you really feel a connection. Well it's late, but I must urge you to see this movie. It carved itself a hole in the top ten movies of all time (top 5?) for me, and it's very nearly perfect. Hilarious and charming in good measure, Wall-E really is the best time you'll have at the movies all summer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Not as good as everyone claims it to be,"Since all hype and good critic around Wall-E, I thought it was time to see this Pixar/Disney movie. Said and done, I watched it the other night, and the first 10 minutes were pretty good, Wall-E and Eva are lovable characters, no doubt about it. But after that, it went downhill to become just okay, the ""supporting"" characters in Wall-E are just so boring and don't have any personality at all, they aren't likable at all really. And the idea of having the main characters only, communicating with each other by their names and body language didn't make my day at least. No, this certainly wasn't as great as the IMDb users wanted it to be. It's definitely not worth an imdbtop250 place, that's for sure. However, it's an okay/good movie and you'll definitely laugh at Wall-E's wonders, but as for the script goes, I found it to be rather weak.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The return of movie MAGIC,"i love the way i feel moments before walking into the theaters to see a Disney and pixar movie, as i know i'm going to see something spectacular. With that said, i must admit: WALL E is by far the BEST Disney and pixar film yet. the look of the film itself sets it far apart from other DP movies. don't expect to see a cartoon when you see WALLE, it looks so real and really is unbelievable.besides the look of the film, another amazing aspect of WALL E is the sounds. I Guarantee that the guy that came up with all those sounds will win the Oscar next year. people keep saying that this film has little dialouge. a more accurate description would be to say that the dialouge used most in this movie is robot sounds.don't let that distract you though - beeps and blurps make up the most emotional parts of the movie.The last thing i would like to say about this film, and the reason this film deserves an Oscar for best picture is because of the beautiful and intelligent political message WAll E provides. Fortunately, becausee the dialogue is all robot sounds it will universal for every human being and the message will have the chance to get its point across.pay close attention to the music in this movie too, it's particularly beautiful.WALL E is great, please do yourself a favor and go see it. it's not for kids, it's for EVERYONE.oh, and the short film they play before the film is also the best of em all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Definitely a kids' movie,"This movie seems to have everything going for it: a great story, a truly lovable lead character, a plot in the classic sci-fi style, amazing animation, lots of clever little visual jokes and allusions, interesting character development (Eve). The problem is the jokes aren't really that funny, and, most seriously, it's lacking any real drama. The tone is almost always kept on a very bland, non-threatening level. The movie starts out strong, on Earth, where the most accomplished, realistic animation takes place. Also, in the early scenes, the music is actually interesting (Louis Armstrong!) When the movie leaves Earth, though, it becomes more like a cartoon, and the music gets extremely bland. The group I went with were all very disappointed, based on the rave reviews we'd seen. The classic Disney movies like Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Pinocchio had real drama! I guess they're considered too scary for kids nowadays. (By the way, don't expose your kids to any of those scary fairy tales like Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel and Gretel - you'll warp their little minds!) Anyway, I recommend seeing this movie because it's a unique achievement, but lower your expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"boring, boring, boring","This will go down as the most boring movie I have seen this year. It is predictable, shallow, and paceless.Sorry guys, but I walked out of it.My 9-year old nephew had warned me: ""everyone says it's boring, I don't want to watch wall-e, I want to watch Kung Fu panda (a third time)!"" I thought I knew better, having read some IMDb reviews and an impressive 9.0/10 voters' grade (now down to 8.8 and no doubt soon to fall below 8 where it belongs). So I dragged everyone to the theatre, promising them something somewhat deeper and more thought-provoking than Kung-Fu panda. Duh!? yeah,sure, endless piles of rubbish make you think: for instance, why pile it up near the buildings when there are entire areas free of construction...The robots are cute, but no cuter than the robots in Star Wars (whatever their names are), and certainly no smarter. For one, they don't speak, except some kind of gibberish: it does make you wonder, doesn't it? I nearly lost all credibility with the family. I walked out early and booked us some seats for Hellboy2. My nephew loved it and forgave me my earlier mishap. Close one though.I noticed this is Disney production: well that's my explanation right there: Disney paid a bunch of unemployed losers a dollar apiece to vote tirelessly for their boring, boring, boring silly animated skit.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wall-E is more than just a movie,"Wall-E, to me - as an animator - is a lot more than just a movie. I think it represents a turning point in the world of animation. Ever since Disney took a tumble these past couple of years with a lot of misfires, I think people were starting to lose hope in the animation industry.But Pixar has always stood from the crowd. Pushing the boundaries and dodging the conveniences of the 3D, Pixar has treasured the traditions of the old masters of animation and brought them to the new dimension of animation.There's no doubt Wall-E is insanely detailed down to the finest grain. But that's just the icing on the cake to the three things that I think Wall-E will change about animated feature films.First off, Wall-E breaks the stereotype that animated films are just for kids. There's still a strong feeling amongst moviegoers of the opposite. To remedy this, many animated films have simply thrown in a couple cheap innuendos that their parents kids won't get for another five years to get a couple laughs. Wall-E, however, unites audiences of all ages with brilliant staging and acting, and I think it will begin to break the stereotype that animated films are only for children. No matter if you're 9 or 90, the happy and the sad moments were shared by everyone.Secondly, Wall-E proves that you don't need to drop the G rating to make an entertaining film. I don't know if a lot of people do know this, but Wall-E does in fact have a G rating, and I can't remember the last time I've seen a widely released film with one.And lastly, Wall-E demonstrates that acting always triumphs over ridiculously jam-packed and gimmicky scripts. There's hardly any dialogue in this movie, and rightfully so. From every wild action scene to the most delicate detail of animation, not a moment is wasted to convey every range of emotion through acting. And 90% of the characters aren't even humans. I felt more connected to a robot with an eyeball and two fingers than I did with most of the human characters in this film. And that is something that is very precious.If that isn't enough, Wall-E at its roots is simply a ridiculously charming and beautiful film. I recommend it for everyone, and I'd have to say it's my most favorite Pixar film of all time. It's got a great message and is a wonderful escape from a lot of the frantic and often shallow animated features you see today.If you've lost faith in the animation world, let Wall-E bring it back to life.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
the perfect marriage between art and technology.,"An absolute masterpiece. It is that simple. Here's a story about a country boy who falls for a city girl, and follows her back to the city. Oh but they're robots. And it's also about sustainable living. It's Chaplin's City Lights, 2001, Early Disney, Silent Running, anything, everything, something completely new. And that is just it. The people at Pixar love stories so much, love cinema so much, you can see they eat and breath it to no end. Andrew Stanton directs a near countless dedicated, passionate crew of artists and crafts people. Every fiber of their beings went into this, you can see it clear as day up on screen. A film so equally sad, thrilling, joyous as this. It's one of the best love stories ever, one of the best adventure stories ever, one of the best cautionary sci-fi stories ever (you get my drift). Like I said of their Ratatouille last year, WALL * E too is the perfect marriage between art and technology. We talk about symbolism and metaphor in a film, but rarely does it live so effortlessly in the very core of the story and the characters, in every ship design, every robot, apparatus, junk item, action, re-action, no action. Not only did I get teary eyed on an emotional level, but as a storyteller myself, I teared up at the sheer ingenious tapestry the film weaved. Like being there first hand, marveling at the technique, the instinct, the gusto, as Da Vinci painted the last supper or Michaelangelo sculpted David. I know that might sound ridiculous to say, but I don't care. It's no use saying anything more, because I'd have to say everything. I'm just ready to rush out and see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"The Silent, Ecological Pixar Film","In the distant future, a small waste collecting robot inadvertently embarks on a space journey that will ultimately decide the fate of mankind.What makes this film so great is how for most of the film (at least the first half), most of the story is told silently. Or, that is, at least without dialogue. To do that and still hold an audience's attention is a good feat. The artwork is also amazing, quite possibly the best Pixar film up to this point (2014).The ecology theme is nice, but more than a little blunt.

"Good movie from Pixar, but not a 9 out of 10","This was a great movie. I would NOT give it a 9 out of 10. It's a bit short, and other than WALL-E, the rest of the characters are somewhat forgettable. Pixar did an amazing job with WALL-E himself, managing to have him emote all ranges of emotion through his mechanical features. Kudos for a job well done there.WALL-E is very good though, and a cut above the average film, even with the lack of dialog in the beginning of the film. Without that dialog, it gives the film a rather keystone cops sort of appeal which I found very refreshing. I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times at the on-screen antics.Children will love it for the cuteness factor and the slapstick. There is some adult humor in it, although nothing over the top. There's actually less in this one than typical for Pixar films.Lower your expectations from it's current 9.1 IMDb rating and you should do fine.

There were times where I completely stopped paying attention to the movie because I was so captivated by the sheer beauty of the animation.

Wall-E: Rise of the Machines,"I don't make any excuses for it, but I am pretty resilient toward the wave of computer-animated films that has come to dominate our post-millennial cinematic experiencecall me old-fashioned, but I grew up with reruns of Looney Tunes, Saturday-morning cartoons, and theatrical releases done solely via cell animation. Appreciation of animation is a cross-generational phenomenon that has become more diverse with the ushering-in of computer technologyplots contain enough colorful, slapstick humor to entertain the kids, but also a fair share of mature, witty writing to amuse their guardians. Yet still, I have never really gone out of my way to view these CG-rendered productions, and have always relied on the persuasion of others to give this emerging technique a chance.With ""Wall-E,"" I may be sold on computer animation for the first time everthis is the kind of movie that justifies the extra wait in line on a major holiday.Being Pixar, ""Wall-E"" is preceded by a short (entitled ""Presto!"") that is aimed squarely at the 10-and-unders sitting in the audience: the tale of a magician's rabbit going to extreme lengths to get his owner to cough up a carrot. It is five minutes of madcap, frenetic amusement that is funnier in concept than its ultimately overachieving execution. If anything, it only helped raise my guard for the feature presentation.""Wall-E"" begins on a note of stunning minimalismthe image of an abandoned Planet Earth, home only to the robot of the title (think ""Short Circuit"" meets ""E.T."") and his best friend, a chirping (and adorable) cockroach. Wall-E's function? To compact all the leftover trash (and there's a lot of it) into cubes. The opening scenes convey a sense of isolation and awe (literal skyscrapers of junk), and immediately garner sympathy for our likable (if frequently Woody Allen-ish) protagonist, who has a storage unit filled with his own fascinating finds (including a VHS tape of ""Hello Dolly!""). Living a life of routine, Wall-E (whose 'voice' is limited to a few robotic-sounding words) becomes smitten with a mysterious robot named Eve, whose objective may be the key to reviving a planet that, as we're told, has been unoccupied by humanity for 700 years.While ostensibly an animated feature aimed at kids, the surprising thing about ""Wall-E"" is how its wide-ranging mash-up of cinematic genres and films synthesizes into such a fresh, original whole: while Wall-E and Eve may owe a debt to German Expressionism (Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" in particular), their homage to a cinematic era when no spoken dialog was required to move audiences to tears, is remarkably effective and well-rendered (the early courtship scenes even recall classics like ""City Lights""). And additionally, some later moments on a massive spaceship recalls the lunatics-running-the-asylum spirit of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (only with robots). Granted, writer-director Andrew Stanton inserts an incisive (if anvil-heavy) satire on our Wal*Mart-fixated culture of consumption, and keenly wonders if we've lost touch with the very acts that make us human; it only adds to the irony that, amid his attempts to save the world, Wall-E is really just a persistent romantic, looking to snare the woman he loves by any means necessarythe endless pursuit of the blue-collar, working-class male to win over a beautiful woman whose career won't let her slow down for romance.It makes for one of the most moving motion pictures I've seen in a while.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Never has a largely dialogue free flick been so mesmerising.,"In the distant future a garbage compactor robot named Wall-E has his cosy existence changed upon the arrival of another robot seeking evidence of life...A brilliant creation given that the first 30 odd minutes contain practically no dialogue, and that basically a robot and a cockroach share top billing.Wall-E isn't your standard Pixar headliner. He isn't that cute, doesn't have a catchphrase and can only talk in short limited syllables pushed together to make awkward words or short phrases at best. But he is totally dogged and won't be deterred from his task once he decides on what he needs to do.Humans come across as even lazier, fatter and more useless than most of us are. In fact apparently lying on the couch will eventually cause our bones to more or less melt, and we will become giant fleshy beanbags for whom our universe doesn't extend beyond the TV screen in front of us. On second thought maybe this isn't too far away...In truth Wall-E might be the hardest film on this list for a young'un to concentrate on, given that it really is a silent film for long spans, and the plot isn't really spelt out for younger minds.What you hope kids will learn: You don't necessarily have to be alive to have life.What they'll take away: Sometimes I wonder if humans really are the top of the food chain.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Magical... Beautiful... Speechless...,"Great movies don't come along that often. But Pixar apparently has the right recipe for just that. Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Ratatouille and Wall-E to name just a few.I regret having not seen Wall-E in the movie theaters when it came out. I just saw it last week, but it left me stunned. Even though the main characters are robots and there is not much dialog, the words being said are so meaningful.I'm not going so say much about this movie. Partially because it has left me speechless. I can only say it's for all ages and that I highly recommend it.

Looks good but no Incredibles,"Don't get me wrong WALL-E was a good movie, but it wasn't on the same level as The Incredibles or Toy Story/Toy Story2. The story centering around this lonely robot was cute but not the kind of thing that would keep a kid enthralled long enough to sit through it. I also take issues with the humans in the story; they were a little over the top 'stupid'. I don't think we are mindless as robots content to do the same thing as someone else. We are too individual to just follow the leader. The animation was gorgeous but no better than any of the other Pixar films. The images of Earth really were no as mesmerizing as the critics seemed to think they were. So a good effort but not great.

This is a warning to all of us if we don't.......,"This Is A Nice little story, But as my heading states this is a Warning to all of us, who live on this planet.Of how it will end up if we do not look after it. The Film's background colours are brown and grey, with brown skies. Wall-e does clear up and recycle all rubbish, but he will not be there to clear up after us. The colours only brighten up when we are taken aboard the sterile conditions of the Axion spaceship, and we meet the clean bot who says ""Forgien Contaminant"" and cleans it up. Unfortunately all of us, who migrated into space aboard the spaceship, have become fat and lazy. I like Eve and I think that she is sleek and very modern looking, I cannot blame Wall-e for becoming smitten with her! I also think that it was a good idea to reestablish B'N'L at the spaceship, I also do not mind having my meals brought to my chair. If I where on that spaceship, I would help the captain with the controls, instead of that George the auto pilot. I have got the music CD and the tunes are brilliant. I hope that when they release the DVD, they include the sketch with the magician and the hungry rabbit and the trouble he went through to get his carrot. Yes Pepole, this is how the earth will become in 700 years from now, if we do not do anything to keep our rubbish under control.Even the supermarket where I work will become like the BNL on earth seen at the beginning of this film, if we are not care full enough",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Disappointing,"Wall-E - My Review Current mood: warm Category: Movies, TV, CelebritiesLet me start my saying I'm not a big fan of animated movies . That's basically because my kids seem to have them on a constant loop in my house. The reason i have decided to give this the ValleyJohn treatment was the news that Wall-E maybe nominated for best movie , not best animated movie at next years Academy Awards. I wanted to know why?The year is 2700, and planet Earth has long been uninhabitable. For hundreds of years, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) has been taking out the trash, and collecting precious knick-knacks in order to stave off the boredom of his dreary routine. Little does WALL-E realize that he has recently stumbled onto a secret that could save planet Earth, and once again make the ravaged planet safe for all humankind. When highly advanced search robot EVE makes friends with WALL-E and realizes the value of his remarkable discovery, she excitedly races back to let the humans know that there's hope for their home planet after all. But after centuries alone in space, WALL-E can't stand the thought of losing the only friend he's ever known, and eagerly follows her into the deepest reaches of space on the adventure of a lifetime. Along the way, the friendly trash-collecting robot who has always known what he was made for gradually begins to understand what he was meant for.Although , as i previously said i'm not big lover of animation i can appreciate a good film when i see one. If i had to pick my favourites of recent years i would say Toy Story 1 & 2 and Madagascar top the list.Wall-E is undoubtedly up there with some of the best Disney Pixar movies but i couldn't help being disappointed with what i saw.I really enjoyed the first half an hour when Wall-E was doing what he does best and there were some really clever moments but as soon as he clung on to Eva's ship and found the humans holiday paradise in the sky i felt it lost it's way.I also found it slightly depressing. I know it's a love story and a story about hope but what a grim look on the future the makers of the film have. Give me Buzz Light year or Woody anytime over the talking trash can and the fat humans.Wall-E cost 180 million dollars to make and while it certainly looks spectacular I'm baffled as to how it cost that much to make. Not that Disney Pixar care , it made a staggering 500 million dollars world wide.I think it would be be a big mistake if the Acadamy enter this film as best film and not best animated film. It's far more likely to win the latter.Finally the best judge of films like Wall-E are kids themselves and while my two sons enjoyed it , it hasn't been back in the DVD player since they watched it last week while in the meantime Alex and Marty in Madagascar have entertained them for 150th and 151st time. That says it all.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One of Pixar's best,"Pixar, can you just stop making me love you. I mean, the Toy Story trilogy is one of the best trilogies ever made. The incredibles is my favorite superhero movie. Finding Nemo, Up, Monsters Inc, Ratatouille, all great. Even their lesser efforts like A bugs life and Cars seem to have at least more good than bad.Wall-e is the last robot on Earth. Meant to get clean up all the garbage we left behind as we fled to space. One day he meets EVE, a robot who was sent to Earth to find signs of plant life. She does, goes back to the spaceship, and Wall-e hitches a ride.I really loved this movie. I can't believe that two robots could have such chemistry. The animation is absolutely beautiful, easily some of the best I've ever seen. This may sound stupid, but was some of that stuff real? It also has a good message to stop being so lazy, or else you'll just get fat. Although it may hit you a little too hard over the head with it. Wall-e isn't Pixars greatest film, but's it defiantly in my personal top 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Best animated film of all time!,"""WALL-E"" is honestly one of the most enchanting movies I've ever seen. It's got this incredible mix of heart, humor, and a really powerful message. The animation is just next-level; the world-building is so detailed and immersive that you can't help but get lost in it. I mean, who knew a little trash-compacting robot could be so charming?WALL-E's character is super relatable in his loneliness, and watching him navigate his emotions and his relationship with EVE is just so sweet. It's amazing how the film conveys so much without relying heavily on dialogue-like, you really feel for him and his journey. Plus, the visuals are stunning; every frame could be a work of art.I also love how it tackles some pretty serious issues like consumerism and environmental neglect but does it in a way that's accessible and not preachy. It definitely makes you think about our planet and the future, which is super relevant for our generation.Overall, ""WALL-E"" is a film that perfectly blends fun and thought-provoking themes. It's a must-watch for anyone looking for a movie that's both entertaining and meaningful. Seriously, if you haven't seen it yet, you need to!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Friendship, Love and Working Together vs. Consumerism and Corporate Greed","WALL-E is an extremely accessible and emotionally touching family film that tells its story more in accordance with its medium than so many movies most older people would honestly rather see. There is something essential, fundamental, stimulating about a movie without any dialogue for its first half: It is telling its story with, guess what, images! And what magnificent images they are. They have centuries of history to them, centuries in our future. Long, long before the film opens, a megacorporation, perfectly named Buy n Large, assumed every economic use in the world, including the government, as one would think of course inevitable. Filled by unrecycled waste, the planet has been so polluted that for seven hundred years, life has been unsustainable. In an attempt to keep humanity alive, the Buy n Large CEO, played in live action on a 700-year-old city screen by Fred Willard, sponsored a five- year exodus from Earth aboard a fleet of starliners that would support every need with a robot crew. Hundreds of thousands of waste-disposal robots were left behind to clean up the planet by compacting the trash into cubes and stacking them into skyscraper-like towers for easy disposal. However, this plan was rejected when Forthright determined that Earth was too contaminated for return to ever be possible. Now, only one of these robots remains operational. That history alone makes our title character one of the most crushingly tender characters ever to be portrayed in the movies.Centuries of lingering activation have given this individual robot consciousness and a sense of interest in things. He collects centuries-old things, things that in this film's world which is so real we feel are so foreign regardless of our daily familiarity with them. This robot, WALL- E, finds them interesting among the mountains of garbage and waste, pragmatically accumulates spare parts for himself from other inactive WALL-Es, and often watches a VHS of Hello, Dolly!. As he continually watches it at the end of each day, we realize that he is developing emotion, paying particular attention to the doing of holding hands, which he deciphers to be an act of showing love. With no one with whom to hold hands, WALL-E, for the first time in centuries, feels lonely.We love this robot for the same reason we love dogs. And I do not simply mean that he is cute, but there is innocence, nobility and unconditional love projected by the cuteness. His eyes are a luminously brilliant touch: He doesn't really have a head so much as he has two steel-encased lenses upon steel stilts, and these lenses can tilt into an arch, which makes him look adorably pitiful. The little guy can draw his limbs into his body and create a cube when he senses danger or when he is resting. He experiences romance, real and powerful romance, and goes on an adventure, none of which is alluded to us any more than to WALL-E himself.What's more, as such an accessible and emotionally involving movie, it unravels into a hilarious, and quite daring, satire undertaking a direly relevant ecological agenda. There are critics who have said that it does so with a lightness of touch that allows you to accept or ignore the message. This is not true. Besides, if someone ignores the message of the film, it is not because the movie wants them to. Its confrontation with the issues it faces is evidenced by the outrage of Conservatives who have called it partisan propaganda, or that Disney and Pixar have spent millions of dollars on a film to announce an offense to its consumers. There is something noble and vital about the lengths to which society will go to telegraph the topical agenda of environmentalism.The way the movie sees it, after centuries of living in micro-gravity aboard spaceships, humans have lost significant bone mass, causing them to be too obese to stand or move without robotic assistance. Even the ship's commander, voiced by the hilarious Jeff Garlin, has entrusted all his duties to the ship's robotic autopilot, an obvious homage to HAL 9000. The unique behavior the action of the story brings aboard the ship causes the humans to act outside their standard routines, much to their delight. So the filmmakers do not necessarily see humans as inflicting the evil of mankind as some Conservative critics have claimed, but as creatures dangerously prone to routine and subjugation. Having entrusted their existence to a robotic autopilot and robotic servants and assistants of all necessary kinds, they have finally submitted themselves to the dominant power of constantly advancing technology for the sake of their own luxuries. The filmmakers do not necessarily see the toxic excess of waste to be a product of human evil, but of human lack of initiative or awareness, of the training, indoctrinating nature of constant, privileged routine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Minimum dialogs yet maximum emotions,"Well, I have to admit that I haven't watched too many animation flicks as yet. I used to think that these films can't capture human behavior & emotions simply because there are no blood & flesh characters. But after watching this flick, I am convinced that you can portray universal emotions as elegantly with gestures as with dialogs. At the core of Wall E is this sweet love story between two robots that captivates you right from the word go. Wall E's desperate attempts to impress Eve are hilarious enough. The climax is marked by a heart wrenching battle by Eva to save Wall E. The background score works wonders for the movie & beautifully captures the essence of the scenes. On the whole, its a film that would bring a big smile on your face. I am not sure if it stays with you for a long time but nevertheless a very enjoyable watch. I only wished that the finale was not of the sort '& they lived happily ever after'.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
An OK movie with over-hyped reviews,"I'd given up on Pixar movies after The Incredibles, not because I thought they were not going to be any good but because of the deluge of CGI buddy movies from every studio out there, which is the same stuff churned out over and over. But then WALL·E came out and with it came fantastic reviews and nothing but praise which I though meant CGI movies had at last turned a corner and left the usual cliché stories behind. Unfortunately I was wrong and there is nothing new to see here and I think people are getting over emotional about WALL·E because it confronts them with what a lot of us know already about multinational companies and how they really only care about profits and any attempts to be 'green' to help the planet is only worth it when it creates more profit for them. There are some great moments in the movie but it just isn't as fun as the earlier Pixar movies which was evident to me after my 2 children of 6 and 8 who usually love all animated movies asked 'when is it going to finish' every 2 minutes from about half way into the movie. An OK movie but nowhere near as good as the hype and reviews suggest.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A beautiful Social Political Film,"Wall-E was an adorable film, and unarguably a social political film. A lot of people object to that fact saying the movie was far too childish, but need you be reminded it was a kids movie? It is likely that most of the content in this film went far over children's' heads. I know I would have been bored. Not only is there warning and comment made on the well-being of our natural planet, but that of our consumeristic habits, the invasion and dehumanization technology has had on humanity, and the ongoing struggle against ""Big Brother."" Though this film isn't ""inappropriote"" for children, I would suggest that it can only be truly appreciated by an older audience (at LEAST over the age of 10).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Vastly Important.,"WALL.E at first glance is a simple piece but upon further inspection the depth of its character, quality, and integrity are astounding.Animaton has always been one the most under recognized genres. And this can be understandable in a time where quality and quantity are lacking in the genre. Besides Pixar and Hatao Miyazaki, there is not much offerings.WALL.E gets beyond such a problem. It contains quality and quantity of the utmost stature. Not just a children's film but an epic. Spanning galaxies to tell a simple love story. As well as a cautionary tale of the current state of human affairs on our planet.Earth has become a wasteland. Seemingly, a mild-mannered robot WALL.E is the only remaining creature on the planet besides a companion cockroach. WALL.E goes about doing what he was created to do. What he's been doing for over 200 years. Compacting the massive amounts of garbage which are the apparent cause of the disappearance of life. Humans have fled the planet to live in outer space until earth is suitable for life once again. When a scouting robot named EVE shows up WALL.E falls for her. The story tells how he follows her out of the Earth stratosphere to ends of the universe to get her to notice him.There has been few films in recent memory of such caliber. WALL.E should be put up against the most memorable powerhouses of cinema for the past decade. Perhaps the best film of 2008 with out question. A must watch not just as a recent film of such a breath taking scope but also as a bench mark in cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

This animation movie runs for a good 100 minutes with the most minimal dialogues and at the end of it keeps you gasping for more.The movie is about WALL E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) a robot for waste disposal management and how he is instrumental in the restoration of a derelict earth in the year 2815. The earthlings have long abandoned earth however they forgot to switch off one robot. So our WALL E is the only, lets say, living robot on earth. He goes about doing it mundane activity of waste management, while doing so; he identifies unique objects and collects them. WALL  E powers himself with the solar energy. He knows how to mend himself and has spares available. Meanwhile a robot (EVE) is sent to earth for the search of plant life. WALL  E and EVE meet and for WALL  E its love at first sight. From then on, it's his pursuance for love along with the safekeeping of the plant for humans to come back to mother earth which goes through an engrossing inter galactic journey space fights and robotic clashes.It's a silent film of sorts with maximum communication done through non speech sounds and visuals. One does not need speech, or the entire face for a personality, only the eyes are enough and this idea is established in the most amazing manner in the movie. WALL  E exhibits a wide gamut of emotions from loneliness, fear, happiness, shy, love, resolve, pain, despair, blush and ecstasy to many more feelings, with only his eyes. The eyes convey a message in every frame that WALL  E is present. Its one robot you will fall in love at first sight.The movie is commendable for its concept, creativity and execution. There is attention to detail. The animation is very good. The screenplay is awesome. Right from the outset the viewers will relate to what WALL E experiences which are all emoted through his eyes and body language and robotic sound. There is a very intelligent use of the background score and for the space bit; the star trek theme is used. The humour is used subtly in evolving a feeling of hope for earth, even though the concept s apocalyptic in nature. The editing is slick and the pace is well set. All though in some parts one would be reminded of Monsters Inc.It's a must watch and will be long remembered as one of the best animation movies of all time. It is one of the few instances where, an animation movie is visibly forthright in pushing humane issues. The movie has the spirit of a love story and the panache of a science fiction and is not to be missed. Please book your tickets today.And BTW  4.5 on 5",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Why are Pixar so great? My first ever 10,"This film is amazing. Pixar just keep pulling them out a dark nasty piece of me wants to see them fail just once. Yet despite bringing out films about cooking rats and robots that can't speak they seem unable to.PLOT The plot is simple so small children can understand it without having to ask you too many annoying question, yet the underlying story is powerful enough to keep adults hooked. Walle can't really speak but he never actually needs too, there is a little bit of narration through TV screens but the story tells itself.ANIMATION OK it is really great and all done by a super computer. clap clap. But what is really amazing is how much personality is infused into the characters. Also it looks genuinely funny there is a scene near the end where my partner and me were creasing up with laughter.DETAIL There is so much detail in the film it is unbelievable. Look around the edges of the screen and you can see tiny pieces of background and details that you are only consciously aware of if you really hunt for them. The opening sequence is a master piece, I could watch it all day long.I saw it in the cinema all the kids were gripped and laughing, I genuinely felt a bit teary in places and cannot recommend this enough.My first ever 10 goes to a cartoon, who would have guessed?",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

It's alright...,"Very nice graphics and visuals. Wall E was cute.Then not much happened for a long time. None of the 'characters' (most of the 'important' ones didn't even speak) really inspired much emotional response within me. The plot was... not amazing. And why did no one care for the significance of the cockroach?Admittedly I'd seen the trailer and (correctly) thought: How can you make an exciting film about a robot that doesn't speak? But everyone raved about it, and IMDb gave it 8.5. So it had to be good, right? Seems IMDb can be quite off on kids films (like Hugo). Perhaps IMDb could have a special, child friendly voting version so we see what kids think of these 'arthouse' allegedly for children films that are boring.But yeah - the graphics are very nice.

Wall-E(pic),"Over the years, Pixar have brought us some truly amazing films, all of high quality in terms of technology and entertainment. Wall-E, their 2008 feature, is arguably the first of those to undoubtedly certify their ability to create a movie to provide for adults as equally as, if not more than, for children. Youngsters will love the flashy robotic sequences and aesthetics, but Wall-E is wonderfully complex enough to give it the most intriguing plot Pixar have ever shared with us.In a futuristic setting, Wall-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) is the last robot of his kind to still be performing his duty, that is to clean up the widespread waste left behind by a human race who made an exodus from the planet some time ago. On board enormous spaceships, humans take up temporary residence under the care of purpose-specific robots catering to their every need until the world becomes inhabitable again. One of these spaceships, the Axiom, has the task of sending electronic probes to Earth to search for signs of vegetation. It is when one of these probes, EVE (Extra-Terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) finds a small plant recovered by the still active Wall-E that the two robots become involved in events that will shape the future of humanity.The picture's primary strength, in my opinion, is the presence of political themes such as the environment and obesity that are apparent throughout the film only to the point of being suggestive rather than blatant; the viewer can choose to acknowledge or ignore these themes without their decision having a detrimental effect on their viewing experience, and if the audience were to not even notice these plot points, that wouldn't mean the film would be lost on them either. The depiction of Earth, for example, as a wasteland which still closely resembles our own world as it is now, keeps the story relevant without commanding the viewer to make sure they recycle everything they ever throw away. Also notable is the distinct lack of dialogue in Wall-E; the first act in particular sees the title character and EVE communicate through body language and a limited vocabulary, a bold step for the studio, though well executed despite the inevitable risks that come with making art decisions such as these in films hoping to draw a family audience. Children will have plenty to enjoy despite the scarcity of speech - Wall-E himself is a humorous show stealer sure to make them (and you) laugh.Pixar chose two main settings for this film; a piece of land on Earth strewn with the leftovers of human civilization where Wall-E resides and the spaceship where EVE is taken after her mission is completed. Here, Wall-E must unite with EVE and the captain to ensure a return to Earth isn't prevented by the scheming auto-pilot system. The difference between the two settings invites comparison between the first and second act, though thankfully Pixar didn't get carried away with robots and technology and made both parts equally interesting and entertaining, something I wouldn't consider easy when the contrast is so clear between the two.Touching again on the plot, not only have Pixar presented us with an epic story that spans Earth and beyond, but they have also somehow managed to weave in a love story to rival that of any other romance or drama you may have seen. This story arc plays well into the main plot and also conveys itself like a human relationship, which is a true credit to Pixar's characterisation of Wall-E and EVE. Wall-E is that unlucky in love hopeless romantic chasing the girl who's out of his league, except in robot form the clichés are negated and the conclusion is unpredictable. Wall-E has developed a personality during his time alone on Earth, leaving him with an interest in collecting trinkets he finds in his day-to-day rubbish sweep. In a similar manner, EVE makes a steady transition from a directive-driven device to a robot with a soul of her own. It is this character development that makes this love story very touching; weepers beware.From a technological viewpoint the film is visually breathtaking, but surely you expected no less of Pixar by now? Whether you believe them to be the leading animators in cinema or not, they are still deservedly retaining that title with each new release.In conclusion, Wall-E is a beautifully animated film with an epic story of romance, adventure and action - don't let its target audience fool you into thinking that it's not a true piece of cinematic art.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

EXCELLENT! To the full meaning of the word!,"This is one of the most incredible films i saw in the last decade. Art and animation is top level, characters and casting is extraordinary. Beautiful architecture, design, landscape design and exceptional music and sound. Voices and dialogs were a wise choice. This is one of the creations that deserves to be seen in a HD format and i envy those who can see it using HD technology. The story is, for me at least, is not much original, but topic itself had an amazing interpretation. Influence of other films and literature can be seen, which is somewhat expected, but as other influenced, so this film will have a great impact and influence on many future projects, animation or otherwise. Inspiration for the authors probably came from this time and our present and not so impossible or unrealistic future. Which is also one of the disturbing things about this film. At least when Earth is concerned, but space technology as realistic future, not likely. In some ways i am not scared but no one can deny possibilities.I expect other to follow an examples given in this film, we can learn a lot from this. Not just in a field of film-making but also new ways of interpretation of technology and future world. I can see some projects made from this and used correctly we could have ""something wonderful"". This also can serve as a warning, saying ""watch what you doing"". That is why i say ""used correctly"" when mentioning technology and new concepts.The new concept of imagination is kicking in. All fresh screenwriters will have inspiration in this for a long time. Animation will rise and i hope to see a lot animation in the future and when animation studios realize what needs to be done, i see a very good future of film entertainment.It is very difficult, after all, to sum a total experience of this film in one or few words. But, to try, i can. A film that opens a gateway into a new field of dreams and possibilities which can allow us to have really something beautiful or quite a grim image.

Greatest Pixar Film Since Toy Story,"-*- Spoiler Warning -*- Being an avid sci-fi geek, I can't help but be truly moved by this amazing film. WALL-E dabbles in so many different genres, like adventure, romance, drama and action, its hard to confine it to any one title but incredible.On a lifeless Earth, some 700 years in the distant future, a small cleaning robot scours the barren, trash-strewn landscape. The robot, named WALL-E, spends his days compacting the garbage into space-efficient cubes. After a hard days work, WALL-E returns to his home inside an abandoned space freighter. One day, while out working, an enormous ship lands in an empty stretch of land and deposits a small, white robot probe on the ground before shooting back into space. The probes name is EVE. WALL-E befriends EVE, and the ensuing adventures they share alter both of their lives forever.WALL-E is a purely visual film. Dialogue takes a back seat to animation here, so if you're a person who likes a movie with a lot of chatting, WALL-E is not your film. The character designs, for both WALL-E and EVE, are amazingly detailed and give them very humanistic quality.The sound effects in this movie are unique and original to the point where I found myself smiling every time a character spoke. The beeps and buzzes of the work droids, the various alarms of the ship and rocket launch noises bring an uncanny realism to the movie.The main theme of WALL-E is ultimately the most powerful aspect of the entire film. The evolution of machines to the higher emotional level and mankind's overthrow by means of laziness and avarice gives the story a chance to tell itself by letting the characters develop, instead of the movie simply being a series of event after boring event to drive the plot forward.When I went to the theaters with my family, I had to choose between going with my father to see the Dark Knight, and my mother and sister to see WALL-E. Ultimately I saw The Dark Knight (which was very good), and since both my mother and my sister said WALL-E wasn't very good, I was relieved that I had missed it to see DK. When I finally rented WALL-E, I was blown away. Anyone who is a fan of animated movies, science fiction movies, or just plain good movies in general, I highly recommend you see this one. You'll never forget it.My rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One of the best Pixar movies,Animation. A lonely robot's job us to clean up Earth long after all humans have evacuated.Visually stunning and beautifully animated this movie also packs a tonne of emotion. Wall-e is a lovable main character. The script is incredibly inventive and original. The plot isn't perfect but still an excellent movie.,9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

A movie worth getting amazed,"This movie does not have a excellent plot, or super funny characters or dialogues but on the other hand this movie got so many minuscule moments which makes you think.. Man!! this pixar guys are crazy... they have really worked hard, Their creativeness screams from every small detail..The first 15 minutes may appear boring to someone, but thats where the team has done such a great job....i.e. without a dialogue, just with a single character making us sit and watch for some 15 minutes is a pretty heavy task if u ask me, but they managed it well... Like I said, there are lot of great moments in this movie which are also very quick So PLS watch",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Family fun film with a strong point.,"You can't miss this beautiful film, the artwork and characters are full of love and fun.This is a great family film that has very important points about our own future for planet Earth.Watch, listen and learn from what this film shows you.WALL-E is so lovable and has so much life in his voice, movements and cheeky games that he plays. The love you will feel for WALL-E is heartbreaking yet seeing a new life come into his own. He builds and he wants to find love. Does he find these, maybe and you'll have to watch to find out.Overall the care that has gone into this film must have taken years of planning. The direction is fun but as I said has strong points to make. The artwork is truly stunning and thousands of hours must have gone into making this film feel so real.I hope you enjoy WALL-E and that it brings you happiness and laughter.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Amazingly reflects civilization in the future!,"The movie Wall.E displays how human acts will eventually pile up in the future, leading to the abandonment of Earth. Wall.E, a naive robot (also the last one on Earth) stays on Earth to clean up the mess that Human have made. In an unexpected turn of events, another robot, Eva, lands on Earth in a strange way. And that is where the plot elevates into excitement, imagination, and futurism.Wall.E is a family-friendly animation movie. It's plot-line is clear, achieving, and sometimes funny. The movie Wall.E was a dazzling success when it was released in 2008. Overall, Wall.E remains an entertaining, must-watch animation for our young ones and families too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wall E,"A new step in animation.Silence is something a lot of movies lack thinking that people won't be interested in a movie we're dialogue is limited, this proves everyone wrong. This is the peak of animation, not only does it look authentic and genuine it has a deep plot and realistic story that can relate to all of us no matter the age. This movie conveys how disconnected we as society have become to simple human traits like the connection to not only one another but to the land we stand on. It shows that we can't take the lush green world we live on for granted, we have to take care of it like we would each other. The films proves that not all kids movies have to be simple, they can be realistic, mature and still be engaging. Overall a movie worth everyone's time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

What if someone had forgotten to shut the last robot on earth off?,WALL-E is that kind of magical film that transplants you from the first scene to the last. the story is original. What if after Years of contaminating the planet man is forced to go into space to survive. A corporation BNL has created a fantastic city in space called the axiom. There every possible conceivable need is fulfilled by machines. The Axiom is only meant to last five years while armies of robots called WALL-E's are sent to clean up the earth. Somewhere down the line the plan to clean the Earth and recolonize it fails. Fast forward 700 years later and the last WALL-E is still working still fulfilling his primary function cleaning the planet. WALL-E is lonely he's Bored he's still excited by his job collecting trash and packing it up. He's gotten a hobby collecting things that fascinates him. Then Comes EVE a robot sent to evaluate the Earth's progress EVE meets WALL-E and Sparks fly. until she discovers thanks to WALL-E that Earth is now capable of sustaining life. When EVE leaves A love sick WALL-E follows and The adventure of a lifetime Really begins. The movie creates a incredible universe with robots falling in love people finding hope and comedy lots of comedy. My 5 year old son loves this movie it speaks volumes to him about love imagination and of course taking care of the planet. What I got from it is this is not a kids movie it's a movie for everyone young or old human or robot WALL-E is that movie with the clichéd heart of gold. There is no missteps here this movie is Pixor's best. It doesn't have the heavyhandness of Finding Nemo or the stumbling around of TOY STORY 2 . WALL-E is simply what movies should be about Entertainment excitement and a love of life itself. Now please will the last person on earth please NOT shut the last Robot on earth off!,,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Eve of love,"Wall-E starts off unusually enough with little dialogue but show tunes from a Barbara Streisand film. A lone garbage compacting robot in a desolate, waste ridden earth of the future until one day a ship lands and unleashes a female robot, Eve who leaves him smitten. In fact the film makes it plain repeatedly that Wall-E is in love.There is another story of a ship on a centuries old journey where the humans have evolved to be obese and rather lazy. These are the descendants of the people who escaped from the rubbish strewn planet, the ship has a nominal captain but most of the real work is done by a computer.The film although coming in from another angle of a robot wanting, even needing affection and finding it which leads him to a journey in space then falls for some dependable Disney/Pixar plot points. There has to be a villain with a hidden agenda, there will be some pulsating but humorous chase scenes.Also if the humans spend all their time on those hover chairs drinking fizzy drink all day, who was the person having the time to have babies because we get the impression that these people were too busy or empty to have personal relationships.The animation is of a very high standard but the start might be deemed to be slow and the film looks flawed if you examine it too carefully. Also the film ends up paying a homage to 2001:A space odyssey.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wonderful piece of animated film-making,"Disney Pixar has achieved a very big feat by putting live in robots through their animation and characterisation. Wall E movie gives message through its story. Characterisation is done very beautifully. There is very less role of humans in the movie because main lead roles are robots.I think this movie is a little overrated. I would still rate movie like Up, Coco and Ratatouille higher than Wall E.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"WAY, WAY overrated","Unlike some of the long-winded movie critic poseurs on this site, I like to keep things short: The animation was great,but the story predictable and pace slow. Worst of all, the viewer is subjected to another apocalyptic view of Earth's future. I went with three girls ages 10-13, all had high expectations after reading the reviews on this site, all of us were very disappointed. ""Cars"" and ""Toy Story"" were much, much better due to better characters, rich voices and abundant (sometimes adult) humor. WALL-E plays like a depressing social documentary at times. Spare me the lecture, Hollywood, just entertain me please.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Wall-e vs Wal-Mart, guess who wins?","Too bad, this ninth Pixar feature didn't jump on the 3-D bandwagon until the 10th: 'Up.' 'Wall-E' would've been even better in 3-D. Though, I can't see much to improve on. The story, the character development, the special-effects, the comedy and the message are all top-notch. In fact, this is just another work of art/cinema. As a science-fiction/space adventure, it actually leaves a lot of the live-action movies in the space dust. This one, despite the computer animation, is so incredibly realistic; I thought I was watching real-life scenes. And the best news yet: it's never about the F/X. It's about the story – the essence I always look for when deciding to buy a movie ticket. We live in an era that gives us 'Transformers' (or part 2) that gives us NO SOUL, or script, and we follow along like we're shopping at Wal-mart, sorry, I mean ""Buy'N'Large."" I can't rate a movie that doesn't excel on plot/story/originality. Wall-E does that. He's a compact little machine that's directive is to clean up the mess of a world we made 700 years from now. Until he meets a probe, Eve, that's sent to look for signs of life. Ironically, her mission, or being, in turn gives him life and on goes the adventure when he follows her into space to meet the human (and robot) survivors ready to return once Earth's inhabitable again. In a word, this movie's a masterpiece. Finally, a movie void of almost complete dialogue, you rely on body language and silent love. Rarely does a look show love in movies. In fact, for the most part, we're shoved love down our throats by words. Hardly is it shown with true love. Strangely, we have to turn to robots to open our eyes. Do not miss this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
For me this is Pixar's finest moment to date,"WALL. E is a refuse disposal robot helping to tidy up planet Earth when he meets another robot called EVE.This is a brilliant film with some of the best visual storytelling I've ever seen.The story is wonderfully uplifting, full of comedy, emotion and a healthy amount of satire and social commentary.It says a lot by how invested you can be in two main characters who are not actually human but exhibit more humanity than the supporting characters who are.The movie's depiction of what people people could eventually become is quite thought provoking in an entertaining way. There is a lot to be said about mass consumerism, uselessness and the hypnotic control that is 'screen time'.There is nothing I can write that would do justice to how effectively the visuals communicate not only what is happening but the feelings of the characters. It is safe to say that a film with very little dialogue that can make my 5 year old daughter laugh and cry in the intended places due to the actions and mannerisms of two robots is an immense work of art.As always with Pixar, the animation is unbelievably realistic and full of beautiful, colourful and incredibly textured images. It's depiction of the future is not overly positive, but highly imaginative and up there with the best dystopian visions in classic cinema. The technology is very Apple in style, whilst at the same time it pays tribute to the more retro creations like the Short Circuit robot design of Number 5. Stanley Kubric's '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a massive influence and this is reflective in a number of nice homages.At the time of writing this is my favourite Pixar movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"Even For Pixar, This Is A First!","Even for Pixar, WALL·E is something that this animation studio has accomplished for the very first time & is quite possibly their most perfect film to date. Surpassing Pixar's very own genre-defining standards, pushing the boundaries of animation to an entirely new level & effortlessly transcending the conventions of its genre, WALL·E shows what animation is capable of when used as a medium to narrate a story & is one of the greatest achievements in the history of filmmaking.Set in a distant future, WALL·E paints a very bleak portrait of our planet that has been abandoned by mankind after it became too unfit to sustain human life and chronicles the adventures of a robot that was designed to clean up the whole mess, has been alone on the waste-covered Earth for centuries & has developed sentience. When another robot named EVE arrives to survey the planet, WALL·E falls in love with her at first sight & follows her into outer space on a journey that would change the fate of mankind.Co-written & directed by Andrew Stanton, WALL·E marks another impressive high for the very filmmaker who previously dazzled the world with his breathtaking underwater adventure, Finding Nemo & this time, presents him raising the bar for movies set in outer space. While the fabulously written screenplay touches on current world issues like pollution, mass consumerism, sedentary lifestyle & dependence on technology amongst other things, it's how these themes are presented that makes WALL·E an instant classic.Opening with what isn't entirely an unrealistic view of our planet's future, the first act of WALL·E is also its strongest for the sequences set on Earth are an absolute marvel to look at & even the storyline in this act makes minimal use of dialogues, relying mostly on visuals. Humans do make their appearance from the second act onwards but it's the robots here in whom we invest our emotions with assured confidence, and they don't let us down for their arc is deftly written, carefully handled & confidently presented.From the technical point of view, WALL·E is in a league of its own. Production design team makes expert use of real world entities for its sets, Cinematography is jaw-dropping for it blends live-action with 3D animation unlike anything seen or done before but as far as animation photography goes, it ends up setting new standards with its inventive use of lighting, colour palettes, camera placements & focus shots for this picture is the closest animation has ever come to replicating live-action cinema on the silver screen.The computer animation has always been a state-of-the-art aspect in Pixar's features but in WALL·E, it opens up a wide range of possibilities for its medium unlike ever before & explores the new realms with sublime artistry. Editing exhibits a steady control over its pacing & every frame throughout its 98 minutes of runtime serves a meaningful purpose in the end product. And then there is Thomas Newman's heartwarming score that makes WALL·E a deeply intimate, beautiful, touching, innocent & soul-stirring experience.The two adorable characters we have here in WALL·E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth- Class) & EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) are elegantly designed and express emotions so well that we are instantly connected to their thoughts without any requirement of verbal exposition. The entirety of WALL·E's expressions come from those binocular eyes & his rugged design fits the environment he works in while EVE presents a much advanced technology & her precision finish resembles the design aesthetics found exclusively in Apple products.Also, ever since 2001: A Space Odyssey happened, almost every single feature film set in outer space has gone on to pay homage to that quintessential sci-fi classic yet of all the space operas out there, WALL·E is by far the best tribute to Kubrick's magnum opus in my opinion for it treats that masterpiece's legacy with utmost respect but is also able to carve its own identity by retaining its originality. The film also makes reference to the 1969 musical Hello, Dolly! and in many ways, is a wonderful ode to various products by Apple Inc. as well.On an overall scale, WALL·E is an immensely fascinating science-fiction adventure, a whole-heartedly mesmerising love story & a groundbreaking feat of computer animation, all extraordinarily intermixed into one profoundly moving, delightfully entertaining & thoroughly rewarding cinema that effectively addresses the themes of love, loneliness & companionship, and has a lot to say about our degrading environment, inactive lifestyle, consumerism & over-reliance on technology, including where all this could lead us in the near-future unless we decide to act.Whether you place it in the genre(s) of sci-fi, romance, adventure or comedy, WALL·E will manage to come out as a winner in all of them with effortless ease for it is a triumph in every filmmaking department & is a cinematic treasure that'll be cherished for decades to come. Watching it only once isn't enough for the story unravels more of its depths on multiple viewings. One of the best films of its year, one of the finest films of its decade, one of the prime examples of its genre(s) & definitely amongst the greatest films ever made, WALL·E is an unprecedented feat of animation filmmaking that simply works.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Very good but not exceptional.,"Saw Wall-E last night. The hype for it is massive and the ratings through the roof. So I watched it expecting something that would blow me away.Unfortunately it didn't quite do that.I thought it was very good, and the first 25 minutes excellent.

"Good movie, not great","Pixar wants you to know the obvious today, and they really, really want to make sure you ""get it"", so they're going to take their message and put it on the end of a baseball bat and beat you over the head with it till you bleed from your eyeballs...The big message here is stop being wasteful and stop sucking down sodas because you're going to get fat... OH, and corporations just want to take your money!!! (Kind of like the $9 I spent to stare at the big screen only to be fed this patronizing schlock.)Yeah, well, its the same message I hear from every corner of the earth these days so whats the big deal?? GET FIT, DON'T POLLUTE, THE ROBOTS CAN LOVE TOO YOU KNOW!!! BIG FAT DEAL. I put the previous in all caps because I assure you the movie is screaming those themes louder than I am. And oh please everyone, PLEASE LISTEN CLOSELY, did you know that robots can fall in love??? They CAN love, and this matters SO much that we're putting it right next to the themes of destroying the world, because god, the robots CAN LOVE!!! (AMAZEMENT) (There are no robots that can love in reality, but there really is a lot trash in the landfills.) They're so lovely in their lovey loveness though, those two robots, its actually like interracial marriage. Wall-e is basically a black janitor, and Eve is a white secret agent with a special mission to fill her womb with the seed of life!!!Personally I'd rather watch spiders mate on the Discovery channel rather than two robots holding hands.Truly, this movie is not all that challenging, or groundbreaking, or thought provoking for anyone past high school. Its a kids movie that is extremely well done as a kids movie, and the themes stay neatly within that kid friendly realm.The bottom line is I don't have a desire to see it again. I can recall every significant plot moment of this film from beginning to end because basically not a whole lot happens in it.I don't need a 180 million dollar animated movie to tell me to exercise!

"Everything you need, and more","A robot works hard to clean up the garbage that humanity has amassed on Earth.This is very effective at making the audience empathize with characters that don't look human other than maybe their eyes. Part of it has no spoken English dialogue, we only hear words from old media, but because of the strong visual storytelling, we're never confused as to what is going on and how we are to feel about it. While a good chunk of it is about getting to know the world and less about plot, it's never boring. It is a little creepy how much of the love story is one sided a guy pining for a girl(who is often impatient, and whose anger is outright destructive in a display of sexism on the part of the creatives), especially that some of it is just him watching her from afar, following her around where she goes, even though she doesn't even know that he's there. I think it was supposed to register as sweet, and for many, I'm sure it does. At least he does also try to take care of her when she is unresponsive.This may well have better use of light and color than all the ones leading up to it, and create a fully realised world that you can understand how functions, and appreciate that we really don't want things to end up that way. The environmentalist message is better communicated than an almost any other movie that has that leaning that I've seen: not trying to scare people with the idea that we might be attacked by something if we don't get this right, rather, underlining all that we'd lose, not to mention all the we can do to fight it, while we still have time.

A glimpse of the future,"I quite like some of Pixar's films, but I tend to feel that they're somewhat overpraised, and there's certainly a theme linking their protagonists, who have variously been cute talking toys, cute talking insects, cute talking monsters, cute talking fish, and cute talking cars. Prior to watching I didn't have that much anticipation for 'WALL-E', about a (presumably cute talking) robot - but how wrong I was. The robot doesn't talk for a start, and the film has the most extraordinary animation I have seen, notably for its inventiveness, attention to detail and sheer beauty. Indeed, many of the scenes have a balletic grace, with obvious nods to 2001 but also (especially in the first half of the film, where there's barely a word of dialogue), to the silent movie era (was I the only one reminded of Chaplin's skating scene in 'Modern Times' by some of the choreography?) Throw in a truly eerie and disturbing portrait of a post-habitable earth in which even (almost all) the robots have died out, and an opposing dystopia of a space ark where humanity survives in total comfort and zero dignity, and you have many of the elements in place of a classic film. Perhaps inevitably, the second half (while still good) is more like a traditional Pixar movie, the story of the triumph of the underdog and the audacity of hope; yet the overall tone of the movie is such, that when the ending threatens to be very sad, you have no idea whether there will be a final happy twist or it will leave you in tears. Until now, even when I've liked good animations, I've scoffed at those who argue they rival the best ""real"" films - but 'WALL-E' is a genuine artistic achievement, and wholly deserving of its praise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Important, hilarious, moving: WALL-E","For a Disney Pixar film what surprised me most about WALL-E is just how dark it is. Yes, there's the fast-paced motion-based comedy and quick visual jokes, but there's also a different kind of tone in regard to the human characters. There's none of the comfortable security present in so many children's films. In fact one could even argue if WALL-E is primarily a children's film, there's none of the colourful backdrop (at least in the earth segments) of Cars and Finding Nemo, no array of funny sub characters chipping in with quickwitted comments, and an image of the world that's shockingly grim and cynical. This is all very beneficial to WALL-E, its Pixar's most ambitious film to date; they have raised the bar yet again in what they will focus on and how they tell their stories, if anything it's more like an art film than a multiplex blockbuster. Yet it retains the core elements of all the best Pixar films, a daring world-of-it's-own universe, strikingly fluid and astounding animation and genuine emotional development and depth in its characters.WALL-E himself is one of Pixar's most lovable, engaging and well-drawn (literally and in terms of personality) characters. His little mannerisms and mechanical features are so thoroughly articulated and designed, his clunky tyre tracks and jittery head giving him all the dimensions and expressions of a person. The only human facial feature that WALL-E retains are his prominent eyes- no mouth to smile or frown with, and he still manages to be as emotive as any of Pixar's weird spins on real-world objects or creatures. Ben Burtt, the man responsible for recording and orchestrating the sounds of WALL-E and other robots deserves credit for the life he has breathed into these characters just through sound. WALL-E's curious whirring noises and beeping squawks work with the exceptionally thought-out visual design to really give the little robot presence and a heartfelt endearing quality.WALL-E is the one and only individual left in a world full of robots controlling humans and turning them into lazier, fleshy robots. The society of the future is basically nonexistent, there's no socialising to speak of. Screens are projected in front of everyone's faces 24/7, they play virtual golf and in classic sci-fi fashion, eat entire meals in liquid form. It's a very dark image, and while done to poke fun at the stupidity of the humans, it's slightly depressing. Advertising screens are never out of frame when we board the new home for earthlings, the space ship Axiom. There's a gloomy paradox in WALL-E present in many Sci-Fi films, that once humans have reached and explored the depths of the universe, they're unfazed and even ignorant of the limitless freedom of it all. There's a lovely montage of WALL-E marvelling at galaxies and stars, reaching out and being in awe of it all  on the space ship, the humans simply sit in their hover-chairs and have even begun to forget where they are.With all these political views underpinning the entire film, at heart WALL-E is a classic love story. The opening section of WALL-E shows us just how alone the little robot is  the impressive photo-realistic animation of earth, with the towering structures of garbage and dusty wastelands surrounding the city give the film a very dystopian and gloomy atmosphere. The quick zooms and pans, wide tracking shots of WALL-E bobbing along doing his daily chore, and the detailed tour of his job and trinket-filled home paint a picture of a very isolated little robot, who over 700 years has evolved within himself and extracted all of the best human qualities through our devices, games and even movies. We see WALL-E watching the 1969 musical Hello, Dolly!, focusing on a song involving two partners holding hands, an important gesture that WALL-E in his advanced state instantly recognises as a sign of love. When EVE, a robot sent to look for vegetation, shows up its delightful and exciting to watch WALL-E do his best to keep up (literally) and connect with EVE. The way their relationship evolves is excellently handled and very involving, they barely speak a word to each other yet the relationship is crafted in a believable, gradual way as they learn how they learn to relate to each other.WALL-E is so successful because of how challenging it is with its dialogue-less opening segment and its political message, simultaneously combined with a beautiful love story and typically imaginative Pixar twist on the world. I've noticed that in all of Pixar films there are several clearly defined processes at work  In Toy Story, the rigorous regime of surveying Andy's birthday presents, in Monsters Inc, the structure and organisation of the monsters' work  In WALL-E, what makes it so unique in Pixar's canon is that it its processes directly relate to our own. While put to the extreme, the vision of the future, with its blatant commercialist control exerted so subtly so the humans don't even know its happening  Is tragically all too reminiscent of the corporations of today. The environmental message is just as relevant and important. Hopefully, as the message is so well handled and masterfully blended with a terrific story it will manage to influence the people of today  and tomorrow, and of many generations to come.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
What are you getting paid ... a 9.2 average???,"Let's get real here, and critique the film. I read many of these reviews before seeing it, so I had every intention of seeing a terrible film and ultimately tearing it to shreds in my review. Are you one of those people that go to the movies with bad reviews because those are usually the ""good"" ones? Well, that's me, but I cannot rip this film. Is it the next Casablanca? Of course not, unless your critique is based solely upon visual effects. This is no cartoon and I'm not sure a child will even retain interest throughout the film. Giving this film a ten leaves no room for a better film ... so you people are saying this is among the best films you have ever witnessed in your life? We might as well get rid of actors and actresses ... who needs them? Sorry, but please get realistic. I am being extremely generous with a 7. OK, that behind me, here goes ...The characters are inanimate objects. The humans don't play much of a role, though they are pertinent to the film. This is not a spoiler, but watch carefully early on, to see what WALL-E stands for (I already forgot, and makes for good trivia - same goes for EVE). The plot has been around the block a few times, to say the least, nothing new there. The film does have a way of drawing you in and making the characters alive and believable. The high tech visual effects of today's day and age are partly responsible for that, but it's more. An excellent job is done through sound and vision to display feelings in these objects, at the right moment and with just the right touch. Yeah, that's right. A rusty old trash compactor does almost as good a job as Richard Gere in a love scene ... Don't worry Mom and Dad, there's no nudity or explicit sex scene. Use your own imagination.A great film will pull you in and hold you on the edge of your seat right through to the end. You won't allow yourself to miss a single word spoken. You won't allow yourself to miss a single scene. You can watch a great film over and over and once again find yourself on the edge of your seat, as if it is the first time. How many films do that for you? I am 50 years old and have viewed many films, yet I can count the qualifying 10's on my fingers. This film has a way of pulling you in and then dropping you repeatedly. You will see what I mean. It's a very good film and I enjoyed it very much, but a classic of all time? A 10? Hardly.For a fun time, for great visual effects, for a good all around film, it is a must see. I did walk out of the theater feeling good about the film, and that to me, is what movie viewing is all about.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One of the best animated films of the decade,"Wall-E is a small robot that was produced in series by the millions to clean up all the dirt that covered the planet, while the human race lived in a gigantic spaceship in orbit, fleeing to a polluted and uninhabitable planet. But now it remains only one, and he got feelings. What will happen when he falls in love? Written and directed by Andrew Stanton, this animated film from Disney / Pixar has a good cast of voice actors, headed by Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight and Jeff Garlin.For me, this is a particularly beautiful film that seeks to prove the power of love and feelings. Feelings can be so strong that even a machine, made for the most impersonal and inhuman tasks, can love. Another topic that this film deftly explores is our current waste crisis. The planet, more polluted than ever, will have a limit? Will we one day (and our planet) will no longer be able to deal with the waste we produce? And if that happens, there will be hope?The script is excellent, the story is very moving and how it develops is very fluid and natural. The quality and realism of the animation is what we expect from Pixar and Disney, two giants of animated world. It's not a movie just for kids, it will easily appeal to audiences of all ages. The voice actors were well chosen and did a good job, even though half of the film does not have any elaborate dialogue. The scenarios are excellent in both the planet and the human ship. The characters were made in interesting ways, but the ones that stand out are the robot Wall-E and Eve, who are more human than most people. The soundtrack is also very good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"First watch hated it,fast forward to 2024 and I liked it","Re edit April 8th 2024When I first watched this film I absolutely hated this film but I decided to rewatch it again.The story is about a robot named Wall-E who works at a scrapyard on Earth. He is obsessed with the film Hello Dolly (you know the one with Barbra Streisland, Walter Mattheu and Micheal Crawford from that old TV sitcom Some Mothers Do Have Em. Later he meets and later falls for a robot named Eve who works at some ship).Together the two travel on a ship as Eve's programming deteriorates and Wall E follows her on her ship. From there they discover that Earth isn't safe and they try to go back to Earth once again.Will they save Earth?. Overall the film was actually pretty good. The animation is nice,the story is slightly ok and the characters are a bit of a mix bag for me(as there is no dialogue at all with the robots except for some of the humans which are a mix of Animation and live action).Also stars Kathy Najimy,Sigourney Weaver and John Ratzenberger.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

It is easily the worst PIXAR movie I have ever seen and I am disappointed with the studio in general.

"""The"" Pixar Movie","As I decided to write the review of this movie I saw the review under mine. It says that this movie is nonsense because robots do not have feelings. And this is the reason why he hated this movie. First of all, this is set in the future. We already have robots with emotions in the present day (just look it up). All we have to do is give it a set of commands using machine learning and artificial intelligence and send in the input of a million people for it to learn how to pretend to be emotional. And secondly this is a Pixar movie. Everyone has emotions. In Inside Out even emotions had emotions!So with that said, let's move on with the actual review. WALL-E was the Pixar movie that from which I learnt what Pixar was. I saw its poster in the newspaper and thought it was a cool robot movie. I asked my mom to let me watch it but since we come from a very conservative family, I wasn't allowed to. We didn't have a TV at home and even when we got one, we didn't have Disney Channel paid on it. So I finally got to see it a few years ago when I was travelling in the metro. And boy this is such a good movie, I'm really disappointed I didn't see it earlier.WALL-E is everything we expect from a Pixar movie. It has a central character who is identified by his desire to do something big. He is living alone on a deserted planet, still cleaning up everything because that was his job. His innocence is what makes him so interesting. The movie is also moving forward with character development and world building, which makes us, the viewers, know just as much as WALL-E does. There is nothing that we don't know and a concept comes from out of the blue. The only other Pixar movie I can think of where this happens is Cars.The second important character in the movie is EVE. WALL-E falls in love with her not only because she is also a humanoid robot with a feminine touch and voice, but also because she is the only other creature WALL-E has seen in this post-apocalyptic world. Other than her he has only seen rats and cockroaches, and we have seen how he treats them as a friend too. This is a metaphor of how we see the little things in life when we have nothing to either distract us or to force us to do something else. This is why WALL-E gets so much distressed when EVE puts the plant inside her and switches off, and also why he decides to follow her to space.In space also WALL-E is really confused. He was never designed for space, nor had he ever seen what space looked and felt like. He had also seen the humans physically for the first time, who have deformed to a point where they are no longer recognisable. Speaking of the humans, their bones have gone detached and they are literal jellybeans at this point, who can no longer work. And they are not in a shape to continue working for very long at this rate, which can lead to their extinction. All of this happened because humans didn't care about the planet and focused more on leaving it than fixing it.Once the humans finally reach Earth, they start their civilisation afresh on the abandoned planet. This is the most important message in the movie; it is never too late to redeem yourself. Many people think that the message of the movie is just to preserve the planet, but in my opinion THIS is the true message. Finally EVE and WALL-E unite and they live happily ever after, which makes it the most Pixar movie to ever exist. The animation, music, cinematography, everything is perfect. It is also suitable to people of all ages.This is one of those movies which will be used to define what the animated movies of our era used to be like. It is cool, it is well made, it has a message, it has many fans and it's made by Disney. Plus it has so much emotion. If this is not the perfect Pixar movie, I don't know what is (oh wait, yes I do. It's Coco).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Cute for kids, highly critical for adults","WALL-E knows to be many things, from a movie light, funny and cute - especially in the reactions of robots - up to a highly critical film our society today. And you have to learn to see all these aspects, but it is undeniable the absorption of all the criticism contained in it, which makes us reflect.A plot that seems simple, the story of a robot who lives working with the rubbish left on Earth - and therefore was abandoned - but to see who was left a new robot on Earth, EVA, begins a mix of feelings fear and love for her, showing all this in pure form. Such feelings were to be common in-humans, but now who can have feelings are robots, after all, humans no longer seem to know what it is.And the movie tries and can pass it. Maybe a robot does not have so many feelings in the future, but a human-being is quite capable of not having it, showing complete disregard for the environment and complete technological alienation, which is demonstrated repeatedly in the film, such as, for instance, the scenes of the ""discovery"" of the pool at Axiom. And all this proves to be very worrisome for our future, for our entire fauna and flora.Despite the criticism contained high - which I liked very much - the movie still sins in some aspects of the plot, mainly to have a high repeatability scenes, both funny parts as parts in action. Staying at various times a certain sameness, but not on a sameness that makes you lose the desire to watch the movie - it does not. In addition to spatial failures, especially in impulse scenes of EVA and WALL-E with the extinguisher in space. But do not think this should be taken so seriously, after all is a very oriented film for children, but with a ""little critic""in its means.WALL-E must be watched and appreciated, as much for its beauty as for its criticism for ourselves. So, just watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wall.e,"Who says popular films are not and cannot be art? If anything is proof that popular films can be of a stunningly high quality, the beauty of the animation, writing, music, and sound design in ""WALL·E"" is it. ""WALL·E"" eclipses even Andrew Stanton's ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" in the Pixar pantheon, is perhaps Pixar's best film to date and, call me crazy as I've just seen it, a contender for the title of best animated film, period.""WALL·E"" is everything we've come to expect from Pixar and more- colorful, vibrant, imaginative, exciting, involving, beautiful, and most importantly a film with interesting, involving characters. Sure, WALL·E is adorable, and as much credit as the animators get for that, this film would be nothing without Stanton's screenplay, which features very little dialogue but is still notably intelligent and surprisingly subtle, making a refreshing change from the 'go green' campaigns we're all so used to. Does ""WALL·E"" have a message? Sure, but it's an important message and it is delivered subtly and beautifully.""WALL·E"" operates on two levels (and works spectacularly well on both). It is a majestic science fiction epic like we haven't seen in a couple of decades and it is a genuinely touching and never cheap romance. ""WALL·E"" will never get points for originality but it doesn't exactly need them because the homages to great films and figures of the past- Chaplin, Keaton, Tati, the Marx Brothers, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (this one is particularly spectacular), ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" are actually homages and not ripoffs. ""WALL·E"" is a wonderful tribute to a bygone cinematic tradition (well, two or three of them actually).The social commentary in ""WALL·E"" is sobering because it's never overbearing and most importantly because we see the world through machines, machines who feel more about Earth and life than the humans do. The depiction of humans on the ship could have been incredibly offensive, cheap, and tasteless in concept but the execution here is absolutely perfect.What is most surprising about ""WALL·E"" is how sad it is. Not even in the 'how will they get out of this, oh I feel so sorry for them' way ""Finding Nemo"", a previous Stanton effort, is, but in a truly melancholy sense. The early portion of the film maintains all the playfulness of a Jacques Tati film but also evokes a striking and powerful feeling of loneliness. It's a brilliant introduction to WALL·E, given that the rest of the film is too wacky to bother with long scenes focused entirely on character, and works beautifully with the ugly yet beautifully-rendered future Earth, a barren wasteland filled with nothing but garbage, a seriously resilient cockroach being WALL·E's only companion before EVE shows up, but I won't go into the story- it's best you see it unfold for yourself.From the entertaining shorts shown before the film to the memorable characters, locations, and animation we have come to expect, Pixar films are now event cinema, and they have outdone themselves with ""WALL·E"". This film is spectacular, majestic, touching, involving, and achingly beautiful. Most importantly, however, it is perfect entertainment. I may be saying this too soon, but I don't think I have ever seen an animated film that has satisfied me more than ""WALL·E"", and 2008 is going to have to work hard to keep this from being the top film of the year, which it most certainly is at the moment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Something sincere,"I was quiet moved when I watched this movie at the first time. With demonstrating robots about human feeling. It was all about humans still it shows it to us with robots. Robots are quite evil in all movies. But Wall - E is not in evil or good. Robots can be like us with feelings. Nature of people can change but with using robots we got lazy. It is best animated movie of the year. It is perfect robot story. I advise you to watch it. Director shows us how human can be with using robots. It is one of the first movie we had loved robots not like transporter like. Editing Walt Disney Pictures released WALL-E in the United States and Canada on June 27, 2008.

It is one of the few animation movies that make you think, a thing that the Japanese have long done with their animation, but Hollywood rarely ventured to attempt. Yet it is not a serious ho-hum affair at all, it's sweet, it's endearing & it gives you that same fuzzy feeling that you got after you watched, say Amelie?

Pixar has done it once again with a Sci-Fi Romance story,A adventure about a Hello Dolley fan boy robot piking up trash and falls in love with a more advanced robot. It's pretty hard not to laugh at this plot but it really pays off. WALL-E is my personal favorite pixar film. All the different robots are very creative and the moral which is pretty obvious is also shown in a very interesting way. Its pretty strange that this movie was nominated for I think about 6 Oscars and only won 1 which I don't really get. But still this movie is brilliant and all out fun. You never know whats gonna happen next and that makes the film so great. My only problem with this movie is the live action parts which should've been explained and looked at a little better.

Wall-E himself is great. But there is surprisingly little of him.,"The first act of this is solid. It's post-apocalyptic, dialogue free cuteness with much warmth and humour but not trite about it. I love the desolate landscape, I love Wall-E's design and personality, I loved following him and I loved the plot development with the arrival of Eve.The rest, however, is a bit so-so. The characters I'm most invested in take a back seat to a vision of humanity conceived by your vegan social studies teacher. I am perfectly willing to see the benefit in exorcise, environmentalism and changing the socioeconomic system so that resources are applied more for the benefit of the many and the profits of the few but it's still a bit patronizing in its message of change.Very visually beautiful and never exactly dull, it's still a bit of a let down due to someone having no idea on how to follow through on a plot that only needed half the run time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
not bad,"Wall-e has been looking forward to this for hundreds of years. On the surface of the earth without blue skies or rivers, at the end of a lifeless and desolate world without signs of life, in the midst of a dry, dirty, and exhausted life, in the cold and hard shell of metal structures, waiting and longing. I have been longing for someone to gently hold hands and tightly grasp my fingers.Before it happens, all expectations and desires may only be seen as absurd; But from the day Eva appeared in his life, everything was no longer the same. Love at first sight is a very natural thing, because he has waited too long for this moment. He just wants to see her more and, if possible, talk to her. She doesn't seem very friendly, but it's okay, he will try to simulate a smiling expression. When the hurricane struck, he came to protect her at home and hide. He wanted to show her all his treasures, including light bulbs, Rubik's cubes, lighters that could ignite small flames, and of course, his most cherished and favorite musical clips. That scene was too romantic, he was already embarrassed. So, give her the latest discovered treasure. He just picked up a tender seedling from the garbage dump, which he hasn't seen for hundreds of years. She must be pleasantly surprised too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar's Darkest Film,"The people at Pixar are geniuses, that is a fact considering the films there have made: the Toy Story series, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., The Incredibles, Ratatouille and Up. WALL-E can join them and is one of the best amongst that list of excellent films. Pixar have a real understanding of film, know that people crave a strong story and characters that we can love. They are skilled at making films for adults and children without the need to parody or reference films and pop-culture for adults.Humanity has left Earth 700 years ago. The planet has become nothing but a wasteland after years of over-consummation and waste. Only one robot is left, WALL-E (Ben Burtt), who is cleaning up the mess in New York. After years alone he has developed a personality, he collects items of interest, his only friend is a cockroach and he continually watches the musical Hello Dolly. He longs to hold his hand with someone else. It is a sad existence. But one day another robot lands on Earth, EVE (Elissa Knight), a slick powerful robot on a mission to find plant life. After initial hostiles the two becomes and when EVE discovers that WALL-E has a plant the two are sent to the spaceship Axiom. Since humans have been in space for 700 years their bone have weaken and become morbidly obese, becoming more lazy and stupid. When the captain (Jeff Garlin) learns of this he gets excited about prospect that humans can return to Earth: but there is a conspiracy in the ship's programming to keep everyone in space. It's up to our heroes to ensure that humans return to where they rightfully belong.The writer/director Andrew Stanton knew straight away that focus of the film had to be one the film had to be on the title character. WALL-E is just such a lovable character whom loneliness which drives his need for companionship. Along with EVE Stanton was able to establish a strong relationship between the two robots with very little dialogue and a lot of facial expressions. The nature of their relationship changes throughout the film and it is basically a wonderful love story with two great characters. Stanton also creates some wonderful character designs, with WALL-E being a crude robot, whilst EVE is a really futuristic robot, with a perfectly simple and elegant look. Stanton is also ambitious, showing Earth to be dark and dirty with the blocks of rubbish joining the New York skyline to the bright, artificial world of Axiom where it is a false paradise, seeing the negative affects on the people. Stanton did also use 2001: A Space Odyssey and Alien as an influence, because of the film's grand scale, broad, epic designs, music and the fact that the computer has alternative programming. But he keeps the film fresh. Stanton too is very cleaver with small subtle details, like all the rubbish on the floor telling how this situation came about.There is a lot of humour, mostly involving slapstick, visual jokes and jokes relying on WALL-E misunderstandings. But this is not a comedy film, WALL-E is a drama and an adventure in a sci-fi context. You get to feel for the characters and at times it is a little sad. But overall it is a touching bit of entertainment for all the family.WALL-E is the Pixar film that is most open to interruption. I'm not saying other Pixar film do not have deeper meanings, it's just that WALL-E has a lot in it. There is of course the theme of environmentalism and the problems that are caused by waste and the overfill of landfills. It's an important theme that I can easily agree with. There is also other themes: one major theme is humans' over reliant on machines and that they need to do more for themselves and the fact the people have become ignorant of the world around them and loosing basic general knowledge. It is pretty thoughtful for a family film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Could have been better,"There is nothing special about Wall-E. It is a decent children's movie that may appeal to some adults but it is nothing more than that. It is evident that the people who made this movie did so with heart and the intention of creating something good but it kinda falls flat. The plot is somewhat silly and implausible. It would seem that this movie is trying hard to convey some sort message to its audience but it doesn't quite succeed. On the other hand you really do come to care about Wall-E (the main character) and EVE, his companion throughout. It's bleak, post-apocalyptic setting compliments and aids the mood/tone of movie relatively well throughout. It's got some cheesy moments and a generic rushed ending. After watching this movie I felt slightly underwhelmed and on repeat viewings the flaws start to reveal. Could have been better but overall, its a decent film.6.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
half a great sci-fi film,"I had to think a while before writing this. There is a central problem to the film, just taken as a computer-graphic animation feature, that no one seems to have noticed - namely the animation in the second half of the film is nowhere near as good as that of the first half, and seems to have been accomplished with a lower budget and lowered aspirations on the part of the animators. The important visual cue here is the presentation of EVE who becomes virtually two-dimensional once inside of the mother-ship.This odd division in quality seems to be directly connected to the two-part structure of the story (one part Earth, one part space-ship). The first half of the film is a complicated piece of science-fiction, similar to the best of the genre we remember from the 1960s golden age of The Twighlight Zone, of the original Planet of the Apes and maybe 2001, and the novels of Azimov and Phillip K. Dick. Wall-E, the garbage collecting robot, has not only survived all similar robots (who apparently failed from exhaustion), ""he"" has evolved, and now learns how to survive, and in the process develops a real personality - one capable of longing for something more, specifically contact with his own ""species."" That transits easily into a new narrative as Wall-E encounters another, newer model robot who is still on the lower end of the AI learning curve.Once the story arrives at the space-ship, everything changes. For one thing, Wall-E himself gets displaced from the center of the story. EVE's AI evolution takes an inexplicable quantum leap, and she ends up behaving in a completely human way, which Wall-E to the last never does. The story then reduces to simple action-thriller in a fantasy mode and the element of character development - which is what really drives the first half - gets lost. The theme also degenerates. The implicit satire on the human race in the first half of the film is made explicit, but in this loses much of its bite. The humans vicious enough to destroy the Earth's eco-system are now simply silly in their pampered decay.Still, the dynamism of the first half is strong enough to carry us through the second half. The story loses credibility, but we are too concerned for the fate of our heroes to care much about that. And that concern alerts us to the real strengths of the first half of the film. It's not easy to grow to love an expressionless box on tractor-treads, but that's what the first half of the film gets from us. If only the film makers had been wise enough and bold enough to recognize this and develop a stronger second half derived from this awareness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Actually quite impressive; brilliantly done,"While I have heard mostly great comments on this film from people I know, a few have brought up the fact that there is little dialogue in the film overall. While I would I agree with that, it truly did not affect my enjoyment of the film. ""WALL-E"" is actually a brilliant little film, easily the best Pixar film made since ""The Incredibles"" (""Cars"" and ""Ratatouille"" were okay but definitely lacked what some of the earlier films had). Watching WALL-E (the last remaining robot on earth sent to clean up the trash and rubble after all of mankind has evacuated) collect artifacts such as toys and videotapes (""Hello Dolly"") was fascinating for me. This is truly a culturally-relevant film, commenting on our society and where we could end up (fat) if we don't change our ways. There are little funny moments that made the film enjoyable for me, such as the captain of a spaceship assuming that seeds on earth grow pizza. The romance between the two robots was not as annoying or corny as I would have thought, and I found myself truly hoping they would be happy together. Not an absolutely perfect film, but manages to entertain in a unique way most of us do not expect. Not Pixar's best, but certainly the best we've seen from them in several years. A worthwhile, fun, impressive film, good for families and adults. This looks like a future classic.*** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Masterpiece,"The objective of this work is to analyze and discuss the dialogues that the film Wall-E (2008) allows for the understanding of the Marxist Theory of Critical Environmental Education. Animation is an important medium that works as a window to reality, so that people can see, in a playful way, the things that surround them, so that in this way they reflect on the daily problems related to their social practices. Cinema is the seventh artistic expression, characterized by moving images with the use of techniques and visual effects. But cinema is not just the movement of images through a projector, it involves a complex ritual of different elements and processes that include: production, distribution, investment, advertising, taste, among many other social relationships (BERNARDET, 1980). And, in addition to capturing people's attention with its aesthetic language, cinema can mobilize, in a playful way, relevant issues of daily life and beyond. However, the cinema constitutes a social process, and as such it has political, ideological and economic influences, with that, it is necessary a mediation, theoretically based, so that it can be a critical and reflective medium in fact. Therefore, the Marxist Theory of Critical Environmental Education allows the individual to identify himself as an integral part of nature, so that he is able to perceive and value the environmental and socio-cultural diversity, so that they can adopt coherent attitudes within their community (LOUREIRO, TOZONI-REIS, 2005). In addition, it points to the need to build active citizenship, in which people participate in the processes of social transformation and constitute new paradigms that consolidate a more just and environmentally healthy society (CICONELLO, 2008). The 98-minute animated Wall-E, directed by Andrew Stanton, from Disney and Pixar Studios, takes place in a dystopian future in which planet Earth is uninhabited due to the extreme deterioration of the environmental conditions that humans have been exposed to. responsible, due to exploitation and excessive consumption and the consequent production of waste, affecting the release of toxic gases into the atmosphere, the contamination of soil and river resources, making life on Earth impossible. In this way, the robot Wall-E, and others like it, were responsible for cleaning the planet while humans are on a kind of space cruise. However, the recovery plan fails and Wall-E, the last of its model, continues to carry out its work, until one day a ship with a robot from another model, called EVA, appears unexpectedly, which Wall-E falls in love and will take him to the space cruise, which will lead to several situations. Given this, it is intended, through Qualitative Research, to analyze the film in question. Such research is concerned with the process and the scenario to which it will relate, being more concerned with the process than with the final product, thus differing from quantitative research, as the researcher intends to understand how the problem manifests itself in social interactions ( MINAYO et al. 2016). In this perspective, the film was analyzed from two axes, the first of which concerns the issue of garbage, in which the story consists of a metaphor for the consequences of excessive production of it on Earth by human beings. In this way, it is in line with a trend in environmental conservation education that only focuses on awareness and behavioral issues that aim to individualize solutions, that is, the resolution of environmental problems in this trend will take place through individual actions (ADAMS, 2005 ). However, in Critical Environmental Education, the solutions are collective, mainly concerning the productive system of today's society. The second axis refers to a great contradiction that the film presents, due to the fact that social, economic and political issues are not addressed, suggesting that they are resolved. However, it is worth noting that both the issues of excess waste and excessive consumption are linked to social, economic, political and ideological issues, among others. Such questions support the capitalist system of opposition between classes that are maintained from the exploitation of the working class by the dominant class (LEFF, 2001). In this way, the film, even though it presents a dystopia that occurs from a real problem, solves and ignores the question of class struggle, showing itself, therefore, idealistic. Thus, the film is an important means of debating environmental issues, based on their potential, but also on their deficiencies, aiming at the formation of critical and reflective citizens who act actively in society.Film reviewed on December 15th.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
An animated chick-flick?  PIXAR breaks new ground again...,"WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class) is the last of a series of machines left to clean up humanity's mess. But this is a sponsored mess, courtesy of friendly-neighborhood planet-seizing corporate titan ""Buy 'N Large"", whose corporate logo nearly covers the waste-ridden landscape. WALL-E rather cheerfully goes about his ""directive"" to the tune of his favorite film, 1969 Technicolor bombast ""Hello, Dolly!"". His well-developed personality combined with repeat viewings of the musical practically set the stage for the entrance of EVE(an ""Environmental Vegetation Evaluator"", maybe?), who literally blasts her way into his environment, looking for signs of organic life. When WALL-E presents his houseplant to her, EVE hits a mission accomplished mode, and the road to fireworks is paved.Your circuit board's dead if you don't get a spark from this one. As effective as the somewhat chilling views of the ravaged earth are, along with what the long space-borne human race has become, adventure and intrigue take a firm back seat to romance. Chick-flick? Sure it is. Proof? PIXAR has truly managed to forge new territory in getting women and teenage girls, like the ones in my showing, to weep over a couple of machines. I admit, this central love story is heart-felt, as even the survival of our species is less important to us than whether EVE and WALL-E will end up together. And will they?

I love it!,"Opening with a realistic view of our planet's future, the first act of WALL·E is its strongest, with visually stunning segments set on Earth and minimal dialogue. From a technical standpoint, WALL·E is in a league of its own, with expert production design, jaw-dropping cinematography, and inventive animation photography that sets new benchmarks. The deftly written and confidently presented arc of the robots is emotionally invested, while the humans take a backseat. The heartwarming score by Thomas Newman makes the journey a deeply intimate, beautiful, touching, innocent, and soul-stirring experience.WALL·E and EVE are elegantly designed and express emotions so well that we are instantly connected to their thoughts without any verbal exposition. The film makes a wonderful ode to various products by Apple Inc. And is the best tribute to Kubrick's magnum opus, 2001: A Space Odyssey. The film addresses themes of love, loneliness, and companionship and has a lot to say about our degrading environment, inactive lifestyle, consumerism, and over-reliance on technology.WALL·E is a groundbreaking feat of computer animation, a wholeheartedly mesmerizing love story, and a fascinating sci-fi adventure that manages to come out as a winner in all genres of sci-fi, romance, adventure, or comedy.

A lot of themes populate Wall-e,"Wall-E is a good movie and is a return to form for Pixar after 2 very lackluster films (cars and the Rat movie sucked). Wall-E has many themes; it's more than a sci-fi film. It's about Love & companionship, blind vacuous consumerism, & how humans use technology to the detriment of the race not to the enhancement. So machines end up in control & have more of a personality than humans do. It actually gets quite preachy. I don't have an issue with a message movie, unless the movie maker (Disney/Pixar) is more guilty of the offense than the people watching. How many toys, DVD's, and cups will Disney sell with this movie's name attached to it? I don't like hypocrites. Of course the movie does eventually find a compromised middle road and redemption. Beyond that obvious hypocrisy the movie looks great and is very funny. The adults in the theater seemed to enjoy the movie as much as the kids.

A superficial film for superficial people.,"Perhaps out of sheer recognition for this films technical presentation I could rate it 4/10 but I feel I have a duty counterbalance the sheep-like masses who are voting 10/10.WALL-E takes place in an imagined futuristic setting which is a magnification of the clichéd problems in society today. The movie sets out by asking a clichéd sci-fi question ""what if robots could love?"" and by that point the herds of sheep are already entranced nodding in approval with every tired sentimental comment the movie makes about society. This movie is therapeutic in that it allows the audience to project their personal problems onto the humans in the film who are an exaggerated embodiment of present day society and thus negate themselves as the problem itself.I have read a dozen 10/10 and 9/10 reviews for this movie and I can tell you that a 10/10 says more about the person rating this movie than it does about the movie itself.Go to this movie if you have absolutely no standards for plot complexity, subtlety, or art and want to be lulled into a sort of self-denying comma that apparently won't go away until you rush home to rate it 10/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Simply outstanding,"Seen Wall-E for the first time and was more than convinced. Superbly made animated movie that manages to stage a serious and real subject in such an appealing, simple and at the same time funny way.
You immediately establish an emotional connection to Wall-E and the entire environment. Machines are at the center. There you have difficulties to show facial expressions and gestures as extensively as with humans. But this movie succeeds in doing that.
Very little is spoken throughout the movie, but that doesn't affect the valence. The movie is not boring, nor do you feel like you lose information or you don't understand the overall plot or actions. The movie works a lot with the images shown and the soundtrack.

One of the reasons I thought it was a 10/10 at first is people are going to come out of it thinking, ""I am not going to throw things away as much"" or ""I will go out and jog."" But in reality many people will come out of this movie thinking this is depressing and they will be negatively effected.This relationship between eve and wall-e seems pointless and unnecessary in retrospect.

"Simple, Spiritually Rich Observations on the Essence(s) of Humanity","While the men are away, the machines will play. Of course, we're talking about the Earth in this case, which has been abandoned by humanity for the better part of seven centuries with mechanized drones left behind to sweep up the mess and maybe, possibly, find love somewhere in the aftermath. Wall-E's opening act is Pixar at its finest, playing with raw pantomime and rich expression during a solid forty minutes' screen time with little or no dialog.The dire, desolate setting of our planet's future is unnerving, a vast stretch of crumbling skyscrapers and wind-swept fast food wrappers, but we can't get too down in the dumps about it because the one little refuse-collecting bot at the center of it all is so deeply enamored with the place. Amidst evidence of the very worst of human nature, we're also reminded of its most redeeming qualities, and experience many of them through fresh eyes. Wall-E takes the time to appreciate things that our obsessively screen-gazing descendants miss (an uncomfortably prescient prediction, that) and, as we're along for the ride with him this time, we do, too.Spirited, fantastical sci-fi with an artist's heart and a clear message.

Goes beyond the confines of space and beyond the confines of any ordinary animated film.,"Wall-e is purely innocent fun that anyone will just love. This is a movie that can stimulate a child's imagination while getting through to the young at heart.In Wall-e we meet a robot whose job is to clean up trash. It's several hundred years into the future and Earth is void of all human life. As the world became more devastating by pollution, what remained of human-kind left Earth on an intergalactic cruise ship. For hundreds of years Wall-e has been cleaning up waiting for the day that his curious mind can be settled. He watches old videos and musicals which gets him to think about something more, love. Then a probe named Eve comes down from the ship looking for something and then they both meet. As Wall-e shows Eve how fun it is to be a free spirit she leaves. As Wall-e follows her into space they both go on an adventure that could change the fate of mankind forever.Seeing this movie is almost like seeing a modern day silent film. The main characters in the movie don't talk (except for the noises they make) which makes the movie even more fun to watch. The Wall-e character is so funny and adorable you just can't help yourself but to say ah from how cute he is.

These are the good points for this movie. But, this movie tends to be thought kids' one. I really think this movie has many messages, but I feel kids' one too.

Wall-e loves Eve,"WALL-E is one of my most watched movies. Maybe one day our beautiful world will become such a wasteland that, there will be no fresh air and oxygen.

Where every human being is controlled by technology. Which is very bad for our dear home planet.

Good film,"Good film. I was browsing on a video-sharing channel some day and i stumbled upon a video where a guy says the following about Wall-E: ""I am a robot but even that little piece of rotten, black glass i call my heart was warmed by this movie"" And i don't even get started on how delicate and clever the symbolism in this animation is. Or on how sarcastic, yet true all the scenes are, which ones are featuring the humans, who became more like a senseless pigs tied to their chair in front of their computer. The whole thing feels so gentle, so classy and uplifting i cant even tell. If humanity will extincts one day and some other intelligent species will find the ruins of our culture i want them to find this movie, and remember us as gentle, warm-hearted, intelligent beings, which we weren't most of the time.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The most Compelling Pixar story yet,"WALL-E blew my mind away more than any movie ever has. It's one of the greatest environmental films of all time and dystopian stories ever told. It's a disturbing Tale that they somehow made cute.Earth is filled with an overwhelming amount of trash and toxins making life uninhabitable for nearly all life forms. Humans have overpopulated Earth and are forced to leave and settle out to space. Over the course of 700+ years humans have become morbidly obese and are endless consumers of giant space cruise ship's depending on Robots and AI to live. Hoping for a temporary settlement they find themselves still in space centuries later. There's not just one message behind WALL-E, there is multiple messages behind this film. WALL-E and The Lorax are two well known stories that show the destruction of our world by human hands and in my opinion we are heading right down the path to a future that might not be so different.I truly appreciate Andrew Stanton, Jim Reardon and the whole Pixar team for making this movie, it's a compelling story.

Such a lovely story!!!!,"Absolute gem of animated storytelling that tugs at your heartstrings and leaves you with a profound message about humanity and the environment. Get ready for a delightful and emotional journey through space with our adorable robotic protagonist!In a future where Earth has become a desolate wasteland, Wall-E, a cute and curious waste-collecting robot, is left to clean up the mess. Alone on the abandoned planet, Wall-E has developed a charming personality and a love for collecting interesting trinkets from humanity's past.The film's first act is a beautiful and almost wordless depiction of Wall-E's daily routine, which is both heartwarming and poignant. The animators did an incredible job of bringing this robot to life, making us fall in love with him from the very start.But the story doesn't stop there. Wall-E's life takes a dramatic turn when he meets EVE, a sleek and advanced robot sent to Earth on a mission. What follows is an enchanting and thrilling adventure that takes us from the desolate Earth to the stars and beyond.""Wall-E"" beautifully balances humor and heart, with moments that will make you laugh and others that will leave you teary-eyed. The film's portrayal of the relationship between Wall-E and EVE is incredibly endearing, proving that even robots can teach us about love and compassion.But beneath its charming exterior, ""Wall-E"" also delivers a powerful and thought-provoking message about the consequences of human consumption and the importance of taking care of our planet. It's a poignant reminder of the impact we have on our environment and the responsibility we bear to preserve it for future generations.The animation is top-notch, and the attention to detail in creating the futuristic world is remarkable. The film's visual storytelling is so effective that you'll find yourself emotionally invested in these adorable robots without needing many words.""Wall-E"" is a testament to the power of animated storytelling and its ability to entertain audiences of all ages while addressing important themes. It's a heartwarming, visually stunning, and socially relevant film that will leave you with a renewed appreciation for our planet and the little acts of kindness that can make a big difference.So, if you're in the mood for a captivating and heartwarming animated adventure with a profound message, ""Wall-E"" is an absolute must-watch. It's a true cinematic masterpiece that will touch your soul and stay with you long after the credits roll.

Where's Wall-E?,"The problem with Wall-E is that there isn't enough Wall-E in it.After an adorable wordless opening act the movie degenerates into a sanctimonious and familiar rant about modernity and sustainability.

"Something might be wrong with me, but this is not my cup of tea.","Pixar has a reputation of not making bad movies, until Wall-E (in my opinion.) After all the amazing reviews, I saw it expecting a spectacular fun Disney flick but instead got an annoying robot loving another robot with a message about the environment. Disney is supposed to cater to little kids, they do not know about the environment, so kinda threw me off. The only thing I knew the kids would love was seeing Wall-e make a mess out of his clumsy self. Also, I don't know if it's just me, but all of Pixar's humans are always fat. Yes, this one's plot line makes them that way but still, didn't seem any different than the humans in any other film. I loved the short before the movie, and honestly I wish that was the movie and this wasn't.

Excellent film ahead of its time!,"I remember how truly captivating this film was during my youth and years of naivety. The film's theme had a concept that stood effulgent amongst the other animated films as I came to grasp how compelling it was to all ages and how easily it evoked to me the sentiment how it was sending a message that is much larger than life. I remember embedding in my mind a promise for years that I would come to revisit the film with a developed understanding and perception of the modern world to further appreciate the nuances and deep-rooted subjects and motifs being conveyed. When the day came to me to rewatch the film as an adult, I was completely mesmerized by how completely different I had perceived its themes when I was a child. The years added to my living and experiencing the society have made such a difference in terms of how I was able to comprehend the complexities and layers of its depiction of our world. Viewing the film almost 14 years later has also set different foundation for my inferences and takeaways as some of the issues represented have been more strikingly upfront and less disguised in the past few years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"Because its Pixar, one expects a lot.......","Wall-E starts abruptly and clears the mist as the movie progresses. We have to remember that it is an animated film where children constitute a sizable audience and I particularly found this a shortcoming.The concept of abandoned city and the depiction of Wall-E's loneliness is borrowed from ""I am Legend"". So is the bonding between Wall-E and the cockroach (Will Smith & his dog).Robots developing emotions over passage of time is taken from ""I-Robot"".The concept of ""Axiom"" is taken from Total Recall.""Auto"" turning the tables was kind of coming.Humans getting obese and developing bone-loss owing to stuck to their seats all the time is a mockery at our current life-style.There are a lot of analogies which have been placed well in the movie. eg. the fire, Eva, the plant inside the female etc. Pay attention to the scene where Eva does a free-flight in the air.The movie also shows how the human race came back to live on this planet, if they ever did - that is.Not a trend setter like Toy Story or Finding Nemo, but passable in its own right.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Wall-E is an overrated movie that DOES NOT deserve a 10/10.,"When I started Wall-E, with all the ""10/10"" reviews, I was expecting a great animation movie, even more: I was expecting a masterpiece, a true classic. Really.Before I go on, let's define what a true classic is. A true classic has at least 4 of these characteristics:
1. The story is really compelling, interesting and enough logical to not make you too suspicious or ask too many questions.
2. The characters are interesting, have true goals and are clearly empathetic or antipathetic ( You either genuinely root for them or hate them ).
3. The ambiance and depicted universe are so great you don't feel the clock is ticking.
4. The visual is truly polished or even totally outstanding and has astonishing moments.
5. The music is memorable. You can actually recall the main theme in your head without effort or at least one of the soundtrack ( Example: If I say Steve Jablonsky, Transformers 1 ? )""Terminator 2"" respects all of these criteria. ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"", to cite a movie in the 3D animation register, has 4 of them. Wall-E has none, yes, none of them, yet, people dare give the film the highest possible note, surely blinded by their feelings.Concerning the story, Wall-E is riddled with problems and from the first minutes of the film. Yes, I know, very few animation movies are made to be a realistic or logical plot wise, but some issues are so blatant they succeed to throw you out of the ambiance ( As a basic example: VHS cassettes have a 25 years lifetime AT BEST. There is NO way Wall-E could be able to read one after this period ). Some plot elements are so illogical they go against BASIC survival instincts.Concerning the characters, Wall-E is somewhat interesting at the beginning but becomes immediately irritating when he decides to completely give up on its main goal as soon as EVE appears, because the main theme of the movie is...blind LOVE, duh ! Worse, you cannot hate Auto, the A.I of the space ship which is supposed to be evil, because it's actually right, and you cannot root for the captain, because his decisions are eventually pretty stupid and entirely based on his feelings, not his brain.The ambiance is also average. You can feel they tried to pass a lot of propaganda messages about love ( of course ) and especially the future of humanity and how we would evolve if we lived in a world where nearly everything was automated. The issue is that it stays superficial and it's sometimes becomes so parody you finish to be...thrown out of the universe Pixar tries to put you in. Some parts are annoyingly longer than they should be ( When EVE is sent to be fixed or when she is outside the spaceship with Wall-E ). To finish, the humor falls flat. A LOT.The visual also has issues. Some are claiming this is the best Pixar ever made on a visual POV. Let's agree to disagree. I bet they should watch ""Ratatouille"" again, released a year before, where Pixar actually cared about the humans models, which here, are pretty simplistic. I could also compare with ""Happy Feet"" released in 2006. Also, I don't get why we got to see real human figures in the movie. This mix is fortunately not always used but when it is the case, again, it throws you out of the ambiance. Concerning the rest, the movie is pretty OK but sports NOTHING visually outstanding.To complete, Wall-E has NO memorable soundtrack. At all. So ? Why all the 10/10 ? I guess...Feelings. Wall-E and Eve represent the perfect image of the ""dream"" couple a lot of people want real life to ship: The clunky adorable nerdy guy with a big heart the beautiful damsel falls in love with, because she finally saw all of his good sides with time. Well, for me, Wall-E is a criminally overrated movie not deserving more than 6/10. Pixar already released better flicks. Before and since. Next.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Mixed Feelings,"We just watched Wall-E this evening. My husband and I were looking forward to it. I LOVED Ratatouille! I enjoyed other Pixar movies... Cars, Toy Story, Nemo, Monsters Inc.This one... well... my husband gave it a 3/10 and that's probably about my feeling too.The animation was fantastic. I can't deny that it was absolutely impressive. It wasn't ""fun"" though... not bright and colorful like Nemo, or artistic like Ratatouille - rather it was sci-fi which fit perfectly.The story, however, didn't grab us. I think the major reason is that you didn't know the goal/purpose of the plant, etc., until the near end... so there was ""nothing to root for."" Also, the characters produced VERY little dialogue and, consequently, VERY little character development. None of them were particularly funny or engaging to me. There was no ""sidekick"" or ""quirky"" one like Dory from Nemo, Dopey from Snow White, etc.I understood the point and statement, but the fat, lazy slobs and disastrous planet weren't ""fun"" at all. The story had a good lesson, but it wasn't particularly fun or entertaining and that is just what I hope for when I go to a Pixar movie. The whole point of Pixar, to me, is to see something fun, whimsical, unique, more light-hearted.Artistically, I was impressed. As for the story... it just didn't grab me at all.

A sensational animation from who else but Pixar,"Rating-9/10WALL-E is a Pixar animation that is one of yet again, a great animated movie. It is just such a sweet tale with robots who seem so human like it is just amazing and lovely in equal measure. This film really goes to show that Pixar is at the top of it's game still and really to be fair in the world of animation, they are still reigning supreme. I thought this was just about amazing and here below is just why so.The movie is just the right length and so well timed as well with it's jokes but also it's more sweeter moments which blend together so well. The movie is pleasant all the way through, sure some things happen along the way but even in the more less happy moments, you still can't help feel a smile coming on watching little old WALL-E the robot trundle along, and on the case of WALL-E he is perfect as our main character, created with just the right amount of cuteness.It has such a beautiful score accompanying it too with Thomas Newman making scenes even more brilliant with his delicate touch in music. Peter Gabriel's song ""Down to Earth"" is amazing as well and when it is played in the final credits you will just feel so warm about this movie. The animation style is also a massive highlight here too, it is so detailed and yet keeps that signature Pixar style to a tee, just wonderful stuff and all credit goes to the staff for doing such a good job.One thing that really stood out for me is that the robots hardly communicate with voice, you can understand everything that is going on perfectly well with just the noises and actions of these really sweet little bots. I loved the style in which they talk too and the way Ben Burtt makes WALL-E's various sounds is just glorious with every little action and noise being completely flawless and yet again, so sweet.Now there is no doubt this is aimed at kids of course it is, but it brings up very important points about the earth and how we treat it, and ourselves. The way in which now humans can't live on earth because of so much toxicity is weirdly disturbing to watch and raises absolutely massive environmental questions even if it just an animated movie. It also brings up the old robots of the future question, now of course some robots in this aren't the best of robots but this is one of the first films where future robots are portrayed as sweet and actually have feelings.Now this is just fun all the way through and I couldn't recommend this more to anyone, whether kid or adult this is sure to make you happy and even the most grumpy of people could be swayed by this. It is also a good old laugh too, now I have seen funnier animations but this is still pretty funny so again all credit to the team and if you want a laugh too then this is it also.Overall it is sublime animating and must be one of the best animations of all time(I know for some it could be of all time!). I can see just why critics and cinema goers alike loved this and going into it I expected a lot but got even more than I expected afterwards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Completely blown away,"There's been a lot of hype surrounding this movie for as long as I can remember but I never really got the chance to watch it. Now at age 18, I finally have a Disney plus subscription, so this has become possible. And I have to say, I hate myself for not watching it sooner.At first, the film didn't seem at all promising. The colour palette that was used in creating the garbage-ridden earth was extremely dull, and that alone was enough to make me lose interest. But as the movie progressed, the story grew more and more engaging.
What's really impressive is the fact that there's hardly any dialogue, yet the film makers were able to communicate a love story as genuine, comical and heartwrenching as that of the two main characters. Throughout the film I found myself so lost in the plot that I never wanted it to end. I felt all sorts of emotions when watching, and at certain points, I even found myself audibly rooting for some of the characters which is a pretty big deal because I haven't been this moved by any film in a really long time.I don't know about the rest of you but this is easily one of my top three animated movies of all time, and probably my top Pixar movie as well. Still up for debate though.

Very good - yes. Absolute classic - I'm afraid not,"I finally watched WALL.E last night and have to say I am a little bit surprised with the 8.5 rating it holds on IMDb. Don't get me wrong, it was good. In fact, for the most part it was very good, however, was it excellent - no it was not. To be inside the IMDb top 50 with the likes of such cinema classics like Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, Goodfellas, Star Wars, Pulp Fiction etc etc - I'm sorry but it's just not that worthy. I think the world has fallen in love with WALL.E the character not WALL.E the movie which is fair enough as he is a wonderfully adorable little guy but as a whole the story (involving the humans) going on behind WALL.E and EVE is pretty ridiculous. Yes, the animation is absolutely flawless, and yes, the relationship between the two robots is beautiful but I really do think that when everyone gets over there initial love for these two and look at the film as a whole - you'll actually realize I'm correct.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

One of the best Animated Movie I've seen!,"It's equally beautiful and fun to watch. I just couldn't imagine that even robots can touch your heart too. :) no wonder many people loves it! Also it contains a whole lot of moral lessons to learn, and a lot of realizations about things will just pop up on your head while watching it because of it's creative concept. I think this movie stands as a reminder or whatsoever for us to become more responsible but in a fun way!The movie has a wonderful look. Like so many of the Pixar animated features, it finds a color palette that's bright and cheerful, but not too pushy, and a tiny bit realistic at the same time. The drawing style is Comic Book Cool, as perfected in the funny comics more than in the superhero books: Everything has a stylistic twist to give it flair. And a lot of thought must have gone into the design of WALL-E, for whom I felt a curious affection. Consider this hunk of tin beside the Kung Fu Panda. The panda was all but special-ordered to be lovable, but on reflection, I think he was so fat, it wasn't funny anymore. WALL-E, however, looks rusty and hard-working and plucky, and expresses his personality with body language and (mostly) with the binocular-like video cameras that serve as his eyes. The movie draws on a tradition going back to the earliest days of Walt Disney, who reduced human expressions to their broadest components and found ways to translate them to animals, birds, bees, flowers, trains and everything else.What's more, I don't think I've quite captured the film's enchanting storytelling. Directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton, who wrote and directed ""Finding Nemo,"" it involves ideas, not simply mindless scenarios involving characters karate-kicking each other into high-angle shots. It involves a little work on the part of the audience, and a little thought, and might be especially stimulating to younger viewers. This story told in a different style and with a realistic look could have been a great science-fiction film. For that matter, maybe it is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"""Wally"" is a charmer","Pixar's latest animated romp doesn't fail to entertain with its consistent heart and warmth, being rather distinctive from Bird's projects. It's a film that I believe is easy to swallow, borrowing heavily from heartwarming films like City Lights but maintaining its expected Pixar sheen of dictating its emotion from pure human essence and experience. That goes strictly however for the construction of the unlikely relationship between the film's title hero and his romance with E.V.E, a very lively and interesting supporting character. Love will find a way, even if it has apparently left the human species, who have lost themselves amongst material consumerism. The film goes along this path, emphasizing touch, beauty and compassion as essential elements to living, and how the technological extensions of ourselves have come to embody our past nature.The two main characters set off a series of events in a very strongly influenced by ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" setting. The references aren't exactly subtle, and perhaps the film's universe relied to heavily on this influence, as well as the storyline. The environment and animation however were expectedly beautiful to look at. In terms of the lack of dialogue in this film, it was rather a daring move, but the film is still expressively similar to its dialogue-ridden predecessors. The music and riveting 'computer-acting' substituting as the voicing was enough to pull the common film-viewer through, similar to DreamWorks's film Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmeron (without its narration) or even classic toons of the 50's and 60's. It was all executed well but not originally. The strength of the interaction scenes comes from the level of detail and care put into them; it's simple yet effective. This film speaks to adults in ways that aren't attainable in so-called mature cinema (films with overwhelming complexity and the inclusion of themes children shouldn't see). People see Pixar films as a way to escape and to laugh at curiosity and simplicity, somewhat of a trigger to what's left of their dwindling childhood memories. Wall-E incorporates this into a familiar sci-fi landscape that sparks even more enticement and gives the romance of the two characters whimsical interest, making for dazzling visuals and an all around pleasing adventure. So what held some of this back for me was the low-level satire. The fate of the humans was simply that of such in the film Idiocracy with the crude humor extracted. All the humans are proportionately hefty in red jumpsuits and flying chairs. For me, I found that imagery uninteresting, and I didn't even like looking at; not because of the proposed exaggerated fate, but because of the sheer lack of imagination. Wall-E does exercise a lot of established joking beliefs, such as machines taking over for us causing us to become fat and useless, and humans destroying the entire planet. Shockingly, the portrayals don't come of as overly cynical or smug, because it maintains a communication of our nature that everyone can appreciate. The film is special in that the environmental message didn't hijack the story such as in ""Happy Feet"" because it was essential to the story.However, the film's greatness is held back strongly by a lot of these elements, mainly because their so elementary. The humans' emotion toward the end of the film are also tacked on, and although it may be part of the story that the humans are so vapid, they still play a strong part in the story of the little robot, yet they're severely reduced to the point of causing the film to lack scope. The film does a handsome job at crafting the relationships, but it shows considerable weakness in other areas that are made up for with the ever-so-pleasing cgi visuals and 'cutesy' humor that depends on how much and when the robots will exhibit a sweet little glistening of human emotion. It's all apparent from the title, Wall-E, in which we would prefer 'Wally', as he's a huggable and sympathetic character that personifies the sensation of longing and soul with just his character design alone. The film is essentially about spirit and oncoming banality, which could be easily related to much mass-produced animated films, and ""Ratatouille"" comes into mind here too with that theme. So while it delivers, I found it less then a masterpiece, but still a piece worth seeing for sure, and a great inspiring addition to animated cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Sad I couldn't see it in theaters,"Wall-e was a key part of my childhood, even though it was before my childhood. Im 13 at the time I'm writing this and tonight I went back and re-watched it and *chefs kiss* and even for today's time the animation quality is just spectacular. I don't get the hate as it was way ahead of its time. The movie is still in my top 10 of all time and my favorite pixar movie by a long-shot. I have seen many movies that came out after this that have worse quality and came from a big company *cough cough* Turning Red *cough cough* and the message of being eco-conscious was brilliant. I will be showing my kids this and if they don't like it I think the adoption center has a place for them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Take out the trash,"Greetings again from the darkness. Never got around to seeing this one in the theatre, mostly because an auditorium full of kids makes it genetically impossible for me to relax and concentrate on a movie. Very disappointed now that I didn't make the risky trek.Pixar, and director Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, A Bug's Life) have somehow taken another step forward in their remarkable animation process. This time we are treated to a warning about our consumptive lifestyle and, even better, a cute little love story.Finding inspiration from an unlikely source - Hello Dolly! VHS tape, Wall-E interprets holding hands as the ultimate level of connection and intimacy. Guess that's what 700 years of picking up trash will do to you. Seriously, the point that a simple gesture is the ultimate connection between two people was once the standard.Seeing the human race lounge around on hover-loungers while taking consumption to a whole new level was funny at first, but then very sad as you realize that's not such a big step from today's kids who eat fast food and play hours of video games, while playtime and physical activity is legislated out of schools.Staying away from the lecture podium, I will say that this is a remarkable animation film, and beyond that a very fine film period. I am confused how kids in the 7-12 age group connect with the two leads, because they just aren't very vocal ... they communicate through emotions (not an easy thing for robots!). But for everyone over 12, the message and delivery are stunning.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Far from Entertaining,Before seeing the movie I was very excited to see Wall-e but after watching the film I feel very disappointed. The movie was not what I expected. The entire 103 minutes was nothing but Pixar pushing messages at the audience. It was disturbing to see earth and humans the way they were portrayed in Wall-e. The movie was offensive and not entertaining. The lack of dialogue made the movie hard to watch and the pacing slow. Wall-e is by far the worst of the usually outstanding Disney-Pixar movies.The film makers did not go into this project looking to entertain people but to shove their opinions of the world into audience's faces. The character of Wall-e was cute but it was very hard to connect with him when there was hardly any dialogue. The film's portrayal of humans was callous and inaccurate.Overall the movie disturbed me. It certainly delivered a message but the film makers could have made their point a different way. It didn't have to be so harsh and insensitive.,1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Love in a Wasteland,"WALL-E is a stunningly beautiful film that captivates from beginning to end, with a perfect blend of breathtaking visuals, profound storytelling, and poignant themes. Released by Pixar Animation Studios in 2008 and directed by Andrew Stanton, the film is a visionary tale that resonates with audiences of all ages.The story follows WALL-E, a lonely waste-collecting robot left on an abandoned, trash-covered Earth. Over centuries, WALL-E has developed a quirky personality, collecting trinkets and yearning for companionship. His routine is disrupted by the arrival of EVE, a sleek, advanced robot sent to search for signs of life. Their journey evolves into a touching love story set against a backdrop of environmental decay and human disconnection.Despite having no dialogue beyond beeps and whirs, WALL-E's character is brought to life with extraordinary depth and charm. Through brilliant animation and sound design, Pixar imbues the little robot with a profound emotional range, making him one of the most endearing characters in cinema. EVE, with her sleek design and determined nature, complements WALL-E perfectly, and their growing bond forms the emotional core of the film.The animation is nothing short of breathtaking, with meticulous attention to detail in every frame. From the desolate beauty of Earth's ruins to the vibrant, futuristic design of the Axiom spaceship, the visuals are both stunning and immersive. The film's almost dialogue-free first act is a masterclass in visual storytelling, relying on body language, sound, and music to convey emotion and narrative with remarkable skill.Thomas Newman's score enhances the film's emotional depth, seamlessly blending whimsical melodies with heartfelt undertones. The inclusion of songs from Hello, Dolly! Adds a nostalgic warmth, connecting the futuristic setting with a sense of timeless humanity.Beyond its captivating love story, WALL-E carries a powerful environmental and social message. It highlights the consequences of consumerism, waste, and human complacency while offering hope that change is possible through small acts of kindness and responsibility. These themes are addressed with subtlety, never feeling preachy, yet leaving a lasting impact.In conclusion, WALL-E is a triumph of animation and storytelling that resonates on multiple levels. Its combination of heart, humour, and thought-provoking themes makes it not only an entertaining experience but an inspiring one. A true masterpiece, WALL-E exemplifies how animated films can be both profound and universally appealing, and is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates cinema at its finest.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Another Pixar Masterpiece,"WALLE Rating: ASo let me just start by saying that after 13 years and 9 movies Pixar has not had a single failure yet, movie after movie have been wonderful movies with memorable characters and great stories and WALLE is no exception. Andrew Stanton (director of Finding Nemo) has created another success for the Pixar library as well as a cast of characters who you can't help but fall in love with.From the opening credits until the final shot this movie grabs a hold of you and immerses you into it's world to a point where you are no longer watching a movie you are living an experience. The animation visuals are breathtaking with backgrounds that feel almost real and characters that never once feel anything short of alive.This movie illustrates very clearly that animators are in fact the primary actors in these type of movies; here there is almost no traditional dialogue and a voice cast of only 5 actors (most of which are extras) yet these characters all still feel completely real. The animators put on great performances in this movie and the movie is, in my opinion, even more powerful with the lack of spoken words.There is some credit to be given to the sound department as well. Ben Burtt (sound designer for Star Wars and Indiana Jones) did a masterful job at filling this universe with believable sounds as well as being the ""voice"" of WALLE and most of the other robots (that is by manipulating sound effects to create a voice). Most people don't think about this but in animated pictures there are no on set microphones so every sound you hear has to be created by hand, recorded, and synced with the picture, and Ben Burtt's wonderful sound design added a layer of depth and realism that makes this picture that much better.WALLE is so far my favorite movie of the summer (with Iron Man holding second place). It is not only a spectacular feat in animation, but also a wonderful love story with amazing characters, great laughs, and a powerful message. Andrew Stanton and the rest of the folks at Pixar have truly created a beautiful masterpiece for the art of animation.NERD STUFF: As per Pixar tradition there are several ""inside jokes"" to spot, as you're watching WALLE look for Rex (the Dinosaur from Toy Story), the Pizza Planet Truck (also from Toy Story), and A113. There are also several nods to Apple Computers and I think I may have spotted a Jungle Cruise boat from Disneyland but it's hard to say, I'll have to wait until it comes out Blu-ray to know for sure. Also there is a little something after the credits, it's not much, but it is something.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"An animated, science-fiction Masterpiece that will go down as one of the best in history","Let me start off by saying, that my experience while seeing WALL-E at the big screen was one of the most enjoyable I have ever had. Pixar created another amazing animated film.First off, the way the film starts off, in this future Earth, this was a very dark and deep way to start a 'kids' film. I absolutely loved it though. I thought that it set its standards as a science fiction film well. Well, we are started off seeing how our planet has been trashed completely in the last 700 years. This 'Earth' that the filmmakers created is probably one of the most visually stunning and amazing set designs I have ever seen, both in animation and live-action. The first minutes, the way the music score sets off the mood, and the way we encounter WALL-E living, in his everyday life, is very well written. The next 20 minutes, as to when Eve comes into his planet, is amazing. It is simply spectacular, it works well as a silent film. The way we are able to care for both WALL-E and Eve, because of their actions, and the way they seem to have emotions, it is simply well done. I cannot simply describe the way it is done. Not just story-wise, but visually. It was so amazing to look at, we could even see the reflections clearly on Eve's surface. Amazing introductionThe second part of the film, when Eve is sent to her spacecraft, and WALL-E joins her, it transports us to another world, simply charming. The way space is reflected, with amazing colors and textures. The way the spacecraft is designed, very futuristic, and we are given a look at to what it really is. The story then transcends to what is a green plant, and how the plant might get all these overweight people to finally get to Earth. Throughout this portion, it is also very well done. There were absolutely no flaws, but a problem that some people might have, that I kinda had, was the change in the film itself. A lot of people simply really liked the first 20 minutes, on Earth, and the quick change to another plot in Space was a lot to handle. Yes, the human characters were not really given thought to, but that is because they weren't supposed to(although the Captain really was a great developed character for his screen time). I have heard some complaints, but really, it was not really a problem. The development to WALL-E and Eve keeps going here(like it is shown in a wonderful scene that the two laugh and play out of the spacecraft, out in Space with a fire hydrant). The way the plot changed, WALL-E and Eve trying to retrieve the plant so that the humans would get to Earth, and a little Autobot(which was done purposely to resemble a classic movie character/machine, HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey) tries to stop them, well, it was all done with grace.This film, as a comedy, really was an achievement. There were a lot of parts, parts that really were genuinely funny, scenes that really got to your heart, scenes that really made you laugh. This film, even though it does have a lot of kid scenes, is also very deep. For instance, the lesson it is trying to give, a lesson that I think it a classic one to learn(one that i also think it has similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey). This film managed us to look into how machines and technology can advance, and how because of that advancement, it might be bad to us(the fat, lazy people). It is also trying t give a simpler message, as in take care of Earth. It is not just talking about pollution and trash(it is the simplest way to tell kids)but also recent disasters that can make Earth worse, like all the inflictions we humans cause, particularly global warming. So, in that way, as a science-fiction film, it is also an achievement.The music score is simply amazing. It is so wonderful, and adds to the delight of the film. I also couldn't believe the sound. The sound effects, mainly with the non-use of dialogue, and with WALL-E and Eve's voices, it was simply the best I have ever heard in an animated film, and truly deserves to win all the sound awards it can get.This is a true Pixar masterpiece. I have to say, it tops with Ratatouille as my two favorite animated films. It clearly is one of the best animated films ever made, and is a huge joy to watch. It is perfect. It succeeds in story-telling, writing, and visually as one of the best film in years. I think it is time for the Academy Awards to recognize animated films as the best of the year(Ratatouille deserved the Best Picture nomination last year). This one, for sure, should stay on their minds. A perfect film for everyone. Not just one an high achievement in animation, but a high achievement in pure film-making period! A Masterpiece!10/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Short circuit in space,"I thought it was a beautiful piece of animation. And that's about it. The creators clearly inspired themselves from Short Circuit (the robot is practically the same design and the cute comic relief robot is called Mo, although it might be a coincidence) and made a love story between two robots in a time where humans are only fat blobs waiting to be served and completely dependent on machines.How believable was it? Zero. Did it matter? No. But it bothered me that behind the nice animation all the story was an emotional ""aaaaaah, so cute"" extended to movie length. The few moralistic conclusions of the whole humans-become-vegetables idea were lost in an avalanche of positive (and meaningless) hope.Bottom line: great for kids, I guess. Funny for adults. You'll forget about it the next day.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
What is the fuss about,"I went into this movie with a lot of expectations, what with a 8.7 IMDb rating and another production from Pixar. First of all, the story is ridiculous, robots expressing emotions is soooo lame, and on top of it the movie is too effusively sentimental. It is not clear if the main theme of the movie is robotic romance, or the message than all humankind must exercise more or else end up as inert vegetables. The voices of the robots are harsh and grating ;-) and the movie falls apart in the first half itself, one wonders what the hell is going on..Maybe OK for kids and young adults, but ppl over 20 will find this movie unrealistic, a mockery of science and a discredit to robots.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Categorically fantastic movie for all family,"After rewatching the movie almost 12 years later, I'd say that it aged beautifully making it one of those rare masterpeaces that makes it influencial in today's current world climate. The story is cheerful with really dark thematic elements that enrich the plot and improves rewatchability.Every time that you watch it, it becomes more meaningful, considering that it is animated and ""for kids"" the plot, characters and circumstances are incredibly relatable, as it draws analogies with current existing world problems regarding the discardability of current day society mindset. It is a dark glimpse of how the world could end up being if we don't take action.Would recommend it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"Captivating, sweet and memorable","WALL·E still reigns as one of Pixar's finest films and a true testaments to the fact that you don't necessary need an overabundance of witty dialogue to tell your story. The first half of this film is practically silent, with perhaps a few lines of dialogue on the background to set the mood or to allude to the premise.The Earth has become inhospitable to human life due to our own poor choices. Mountains of garbage have buried our once great cities and we have left our home planet behind to reach for the stars. But, we've left some robots behind to clean up this mess. And one of their last remaining members is the movie's titular character, WALL·E. He's quite happy pursuing his craft, until he meets another robot, a sleeker and deadlier specimen, named EVE.What a fantastic premise and what a fantastic way to tell it. We learn everything we need to know about WALL·E without a single line of dialogue from him. Well, okay, he says his own name every now and then, and he definitely makes sounds, but they're more like bleeps and whistles. But that's all we need. His design is so amazingly expressive, so emotive, that we buy the soul behind his programming and code. His romantic spirit.That being said, if the first half of this movie is an easy A+ of storytelling, with an honourable commendation thrown in for extra measure, the latter half floats around something like a B-. Still pretty good, but it loses something when it introduces humans back into the story. When it becomes a conflict. It's still quite good, but there was uniqueness to the story before that, which I found myself missing.Still, WALL·E and EVE remain adorable throughout the entire film, it is extremely nicely animated and the message throughout the entire film is very good. It remains one of my favourite Pixar movies of all time and WALL·E himself just might be my favourite character out of the entire canon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Oh, man. What a movie","The most charismatic and human character of Pixar is a robot. But not any robot, this one is a brave and enthusiastic guy who does his best to survive in a huge pile of soil, from which he extracts every single speck of life available.Wall-E shows us that there's hope for anyone and that to make life better, you just gotta believe in it and fight for your love, fight for your life, fight for your future.When we do the wrong thing for the right reason, when we go beyond the standard people who just want to survive, that's when we're being humans and not machines. Life is an adventure and we can make it a better place, anyone can, we just gotta go out of our Auto mode and make the magic happens.And not only that, let's never forget about love 'cause happiness is even better when shared and, again, only depends on you to make it happen. No matter who or what tries to stop you, keep it going, doing what you believe. Any seed can grow into a tree and all these rules don't apply when you're high in the sky.Great characters with a lot of feelings and one of the most original ways to tell a story that I've seen.

What's up with those negative reviews?,"This is the most entertaining (and also prophetic) computer animation I've seen. It's humbly delivered and makes strong points without forcing them on you. I doubt we'd let the Earth look that bad, though a large satellite collision (2/10/08) makes you wonder about space.There's no need to fast-forward in time to laugh at the portrayal of humans here. The visual clarity of this movie is the best I've seen yet. The details packed into it merit several watchings and still-frames.Getting on to my review title, I have a hard time understanding how some people could give this under 5 stars, let alone 1. Were they in a rotten mood the day they saw it? There's no accounting for taste, but actively disliking such an interesting movie is weird to me.

Poor imagination,"Perhaps I expected too much on this film because people's voting in this website are terrific and many wrote that this is ""the best animated film ever"".From the time of E.T., I have been wondering why American want robots or things like that to be human-like. I don't want to see pandas chew gums like Yanks or robots look down when they feel sad. Is that ""reality"" for American? Pandas are real when they do things we cannot guess and so do robots. There is no mysticism here and that is so unreal to me. When fantasy is drawn unreal, there is no chance for that movie to knock on my emotion.I am not an enthusiastic patriot, but to talk about animated films, why don't you just watch Miyazaki's films? Those are the ones filled with fantasy or imagination I am talking about. You may say children cannot appreciate the characters when they do not move the way we are familiar with, but let's just believe in children's open-minded nature. I have just witnessed children laughing and got excited watching Miyazaki's strange new film ""Ponyo on the cliff by the sea"". In my humble opinion American only try to listen to the sound of two-hands-clapping not the sound of one-hand-clapping. Imagination, man. What if god does not speak English or not even human-like? Oops I've gone too far.Cinematography is great. And obviously the director (""Finding Nemo"") is talented. Characters are pop and cute. Message is clear.

Wall-E another Pixar genius,"I went to see that movie, and it wasn't that bad. Once again Pixar has done it again. The movie once again is split into two different perspectives. The kids are able to see a very fun, very intact plot line and movie. The dynamic of WALL-E is very apparent and is very easy to relate to.For the adults It's a nice little Al Gore style movie of the possible effects of Corporatism, wasteful attitude and the current trend of health. Essentially a subliminally unsubtle critique of typical American lifestyle. Steve Jobs has once again proved to us why he is the genius that he is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"If you love someone big, skip it! California fat-phobic self-righteousness","This film starts well, as it is righteous about global warming and trashing the planet.But as soon as it gets into space, righteousness turns to self-righteousness. According to this film, fat people are stupid, weak, passive, infantile, helpless and self-absorbed, and they represent all that's bad about our contemporary culture.As Daniel Engber points out in Slate.com in his article on this film, 80% of variations in body weight are determined by your DNA, not your eating patterns; you might as well blame environmental ills on tall or short people. And 97% of diets fail, so there's not much to hope from there.Pixar's stern lecture on the sedentary life style doesn't prevent them from offering a video game of the film to keep you firmly planted in one place, nor are their action figures biodegradable. So they don't set much of an example.If you or someone you love is heavy, do not see this film and don't let them see it either. It can be emotionally devastating.The movie reflects no great insight into our world. It is merely a reflection of California's stupid body-consciousness, intolerant of natural human variations in size and shape.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

I Like it More and More Each Time,"I remember when ""Wall-E"" first came out. Although it was a big critical and box office success, I remember me and my friends did not care for it. Two years after ""Happy Feet"", the people I spoke to were off put by the environmental theme of the movie. At the time I was hoping for more jokes in my animated movies, and ""Wall-E"" doesn't play out like a comedy. Other people I spoke with loved the first half and hated the second half of the movie. So yes, when this movie first came out, I did not care for it.The movie went on to gross a ton of money and get nominated for 6 Oscars. As years passed, I would end up rewatching ""Wall-E"", now knowing the story, and not going in expecting a laugh riot. I still didn't like it, but I respected it. I resolved that, it may be a good movie, but it is not my kind of movie.Years later I would still think about the movie ""Wall-E"". I would see it at the top of ""Best animated Films"" list. And I took a film class where the teacher named it as his all-time favorite romance. My 10-year-old nephew named it as his favorite film of all-time. I found myself thinking about the film more often. One thing I could say about the film, it was not forgettable.Years later, as a substitute teacher, I would watch ""Wall-E"" with students to conclude their post-apocalyptic reading section. And this time around, I really learned to love ""Wall-E"". It took a long time to win me over, but I can finally say: ""Yeah, Wall-E is a pretty great movie.""I love the respect the movie gives its audience. The way they allow the world to sink in, feeding the audience exposition little by little. I love how much of the story is told through the visuals. It never feels heavy handed or preachy with its message. You can see this as a love story or as a pro-environmental movie, it works either way. And yes, I even love the humor in the movie. There isn't a ton of jokes, but the reactions from Wall-E and EVE are just so well timed and animated.Give this movie a watch if you haven't already. And if you have, watch it again, maybe you will see learn to like it a little more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Beautiful and relevant.,"Wow. This is easily Pixar's most timeless film, and will be relevant for generations to come. Such an incredible story that really makes you happy you're alive at this moment in time. Almost photo realistic animation, even though this came out in 2008. I'm having a very hard time ranking these Pixar films, since I've got like a 4 way tie between Cars, Monsters, Inc., Ratatouille, and this one. This is possibly Pixar's most visually stunning films along with Coco, which gives it a lot of points. A good word to use to describe this is magical. It's crazy how much BETTER Pixar is than EVERY OTHER ANIMATION COMPANY by a country mile. A solid 9.0/10 for me is an amazing score and probably gets into my Top 100, and I've given out like 7 of them for the first 9 Pixar films. They're just that good. WALL-E is no exception, and Pixar's genius win streak continues through 2008.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

A Spectacle of a Love Story,"WALL-E is damn near perfect. I have never felt such emotional attachment for robots than when I watch this movie. Every character has a distinct personality while being a robot. The sound mixing is stellar considering they had to create these abstract sounds to represent the deepest parts of imagination. The story is super easy to follow even though most of the characters are limited to making random robotic noises as dialogue. In fact the first 30 minutes of the film are played out like a silent film.
Many complain that this film should have gone 100% with the silent aspect, and while I do see where they are coming from, I feel like the plot didn't have much elsewhere to go if they had just stayed on earth. There also seem to be many complaints about the environmental preachy-ness. I honestly never found it overpowering, in fact I felt that the love story prospered overall as the main part of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Yawn,"Ramblings and Impressions on this cartoon.I love Pixar. I enjoy silent films. WALL-E is essentially a silent film in my opinion.WALL-E is one of my adult son's favorite movies. It is not one of my favorites. I will try to tell you why it left me empty.I am a Liberal and I view this movie as an ""indoctrination"" piece, in the same vein as ""Ferngully"". I have no problems with indoctrination media. However, I am already indoctrinated.Beyond the fact that it is a beautiful piece of propaganda, WALL-e serves no purpose for me and I found it unenlightening and I believe that this movies has no place in the top movies of all time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Another Pixar classic that is heartwarming with it's environmentalist message,"I never saw this movie in theaters, but I got this on a DVD copy for Christmas almost four years ago. I watched it and was immediately impressed since Pixar has done it again.The story is very original and has a strong environmentalist message, the script is sharp, the dialog is witty and hilarious with some nice touching moments and the music is beautiful to listen to. The characters are likable as well even the chemistry between WALL-E and Eva are so cute and heartwarming it would leave a bit teary-eyed. The villain is pretty cool too with a robotic voice so menacing and several of the other characters including the captain of the Axiom are also good. The pacing moves along really well and the animation is fantastic with a futuristic setting which gives the movie a great atmosphere to it.Overall, WALL-E is another Pixar masterpiece that will always be worth-watching. Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A film that hasn't aged and continues to provide the same fun as when it was first released. Brilliant!,"Who doesn't love Wall-E after watching this? And, how can someone not love Wall-E after watching it? These are questions for which there are no suitable answer as the film is targeted at all audiences.Pixar Animation Studios 'knocks the ball out the park every time', and Wall-E is no exception. It's brilliant, witty, lovable and leaves you on the edge of your seat wanting Wall-E to succeed.A wonderful story for all ages. Loneliness, friendship, love, adventure, selflessness it has it all.Family fun for all.

"This is the best way to give children a ""message""","So, first time I watched WALL·E is when my age was about 11 years old at the mountain's slope with my environmental community. It was the perfect night with such a nearly perfect movie. WALL·E is a message to children so that the children understand how fragile the earth is. It is a complex yet complicated message, but Andrew Stanton can make it simple and easy to understand. You know, for animation movie, this film is a revolution. Usually, animation movie's content is more or less about friendship, adventure, or fantasy.But, this movie change my perception of animation. The whole ""go green"" ideas are summarize by this 98-minute-motion-picture.

There are a lot of simple jokes, the story is good with a good message and still very actual.I don't give a 10 easily, but this is for me a masterwork. Everything is right about this movie.

"An eye opening G rated movie, with groundbreaking technology","Pixer was able to pull off another master piece. Any movie that you go into with high expectations that you can come out of saying wow that was neat is always an A in my book. This movie doesn't let you down. It uses a dull anxiety driven everyday problem that are facing in the future where a robot named Wall-E is programmed to consolidate a littered earth. Just like in many Pixer animated movies, this is no ordinary robot. Despite not having a vast vocabulary, the character Wall-E is able to express emotion. I think putting it at number 8 in the top 250 is a bit high, but this movie does create a solid imaginary universe that Disney is famous for. An easy one to take with your kids without falling asleep, and maybe having it touch your heart and want to make a change in your own personal life with friends, family and the environment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"the clip is way better than the whole movie, entirely disappointing","I was expecting with great hope the last Pixar animation movie.A total flop, and quoting other comments,I have just to admit nobody is perfect...Pixar studios did plenty of top notch animations...for me, one the seldom studios using CGI in the best way possible,with excellent scenarios, creativity, sensitivity and humor...Usually, at least... !I'll just remind you some :Ratatouille, Your Friend the Rat, For the birds, Geri's Game for instance, all of them, just state of art animation works...But WALLE just seem to lack all that Pixar spirit...Well, for about the 15 start minutes, just nothing happened...Then the future ""companion"" is taken out from the midst...and presented as the Messiah ! Redemption !After the laughable insect and the green plant a while ago...Next : the representative humans, I guess were made to pleasea large overweight real human worldwide audience.The epitome of everything : yes, of course !It will make millions of people thinking, oh yes !Seems relatively normal to have 1/3 of isbody weight that is only fat, coming from McDo and Cokes...in this world.First because they/we/you are alive (I don't deny that nor denythe right to be overweight... everyone chooses !),thinking, working, driving, loving, having a family...Second because more and more we see fat people includedin any types of movies... very attractive...And now, Pixar the Greatest put some in a 8,4/10 stars voters average movie rate (september 2008).WALLE, the one that many as I did were imploring to come out on screen...took just my eyes out of my face, so bad is was, for me... (and half not so surprisingly, for my kids too!)The clip resumed the movie the best possible way. That is the truth.But apart what you see in the clip, funny, attractive...the rest is really a definitive lack of time !Even on a cold foggy day, better go out for a walk in searchof fun and mystery... because in this Pixar, you won't find that(hard to believe, INCREDIBLE, were they high ?!)Let's say it is only a defeat... a kind of Waterloo (for the French !)a 9.11 (for the Americans) and a real flop for only a few of us !but we'll expect other victorious funny movies... from Pixar, please !The interesting point of the movie is may be that showing the possible fact that men continuing to create tons of rubbish materials, will be once overpowered by them.Guess this comment won't please to a lot of people... Who's that (auto-censored) guy criticizing this marvelous film...They are as many holes in my comment, as many are in this movie... laugh !So sorry, it's just my opinion...2/10, for the CGI, OK, that I admit... the rest is 1 for the effort",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Kids will love it ...,"I liked this movie, but it has a different feel from previous Pixar movies. It relies heavily on non-verbal expressiveness and visuals to tell the story - similar to the short ""cartoons"" that Pixar shows at the beginning of each of its big movies. As such, those who love those animated shorts will probably enjoy this movie a lot.The movie had a very youthful feel to it so it will probably be fun for many kids. For example, there's a lot of time spent on ""cute"" fumbling movements and personality quirks. There are also a fair amount of bashful attempts at affection (like secretly following the ""girl robot"" around, or trying to hold her hand). And the people -- they look like fat potatoes! It's kind of amusing to watch, but I think you really have to like this style of movie to get the most from it. As for myself, it's not quite my favorite style so it didn't work well on me.The basic story is about a small robot 700 years in the future that is alone on earth. His name is ""Wall-E"" and he is very slowly working to clean up a huge metropolis area that is now an abandoned wasteland. Then one day, a mysterious ship lands. A very high-tech robot, called ""EVE"", comes out and begins to perform a survey for a ""classified mission"" ... and the story progresses from there.I won't go into details because the plot from that point on is kind of interesting. There are also some some beautiful animation scenes, like EVE's flying survey of the metropolis and their later dual ""dance"" in space. However, there weren't enough of them to make up for the kiddie-feel of this movie.At this point in time, the name ""Pixar"" is strong enough to be 'the' reason that people will go to see this movie. My advice is to think about the cartoons that Pixar plays at the beginning of their movies ... if you really enjoy those, you'll probably love this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
All of my Creativity is now Gone,"There is a time when you have to wonder, ""Will I ever see anything that can possibly top this level of intricacy?"" Because I have never seen a more beautiful and mind-blowing animated film than WALL-E.This movie has been my number one animated film ever. I never saw it in theaters, my first time being about an hour on the television, but it was one of the most captivating things I had ever seen, so I went ahead and bought it. I do not regret seeing it 15+ times now.There's so, SO much to praise about this. You have to appreciate PIXAR's work on this. It's almost like a silent film, where you go 15 minutes into the film without dialogue, which is impressive because they handled it beautifully. Then, there's the music. I have found my new favorite composer.And THEN there's the graphics. They are beautiful and realistic (well, at least on Earth. Once we reach The AXIOM, humans are a little unrealistic, but then again, they have a great style that contrasts with the live-action video that is played of previous Captains of the AXIOM).Then there's the characters. I don't think most people will get into depth with this, but nearly EVERY character is dynamic in some way, and it all happens from WALL-E's interactions. While WALL-E is a static character, the characters surrounding him change in some way, mostly personality wise. Like an automated bot, learning to wave back at WALL- E. It breaks from the stoic life that robots learn to live with, and teaches them that diversity and personality aren't always such a bad thing.Then there's AUTO. Many people believe he's the villain, but in all reality, he's just following his directives. Many of the directives are so vague/simple, that it creates conflicts with higher priority directives, causing him to have to go against his orders to follow the highest priority directives. I can't even try to get deep enough into this, because it's such a complex ordeal that most people won't understand. He's not the bad guy, though. There's no real 'villain' in WALL-E, really. In fact, if we actually look at who might be the real 'hero' of the movie, it would probably be M-O, due to his actions in the movie that contribute to the success of WALL-E and EVE's actions.And then there's the plot. I love EVERYTHING about it. WALL-E was PIXAR's last ""original"" movie. Oh man, there's too many words in my head to describe it. It's just so amazing.And I cried. I cried a lot to this, because of how PIXAR managed to do everything right. I seriously regret not being able to see this on the big screen, but if ever a time comes again that they play it, I will be there to spend all of my money on it.The best animated movie I have ever seen, and if ever a movie manages to triumph it, it will still remain in a special place in my heart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"Masterful, intelligent and yes..a little preachy","I can understand some people's dislike for Wall-E. Yes, it could be construed as ""preachy"", but isn't all art with a message a little like that? When it comes to the environment, it is hard not to come across as preachy. However, that is just one facet of this truly magnificent film. Pixar really outdid themselves with the detail and beauty of the animation. The story is simple enough, and Andrew Stanton homages everything from 2001 to Star Wars in his movie, but in reality, Wall-E just kicks along beautifully. Its almost a silent film with beautifully dramatic and touching moments. It also puts across an apocalyptic message which for me, worked wonderfully, but as I said above, is preachy if you couldn't care less. And the love story at the heart of the film is as touching and moving as any I've seen and along with UP, Pixar have managed to outdo virtually any movie I can think of when it comes to romance.If you haven't seem Wall-E, do not hesitate any longer...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Wall-E is a nearly silent story about the world's last working robot falling in love with a more advanced metal visitor.While there are a few exciting action sequences, the most of the film's most dramatic and moving moments are absolutely silent.

WALL·E is a surprisingly charming story that will warm your heart and make you chuckle.,"WALL·E is a feel-good movie about a robot full of heart and full of love. WALL·E is the Ted Lasso of Pixar characters, puppy dog loyalty and eternally optimistic. WALL·E's blundering kindness gives hope to so many jaded characters and inspires them to step up and care. WALL·E and EVE are delightful and adorable characters with a story told by an unbelievable screenplay that compels and engages even with such little dialogue. And with a 3-year-old who loves this movie, this parent appreciates the small amount of dialogue, making it more pleasant background noise as my daughter watches it for the 327th time.

Best Animated Scifi by Disney Pixar till date I think.,"The movie discusses the importance of being Eco and green friendly. It starts with planet earth in its disastrous future when all humans have left to live on moon as Earth is all bombarded and destroyed with the help of war instigating leaders. There is just one sensitive programmed robot left who is functioned as a trash compactor who happens to find a seedling while segmenting trash but it is located and extracted out from earth by another female robot who is programmed to demolish and destroy any Eco-friendly fundamental on earth. Wall-E the robot develops a tendency to love and it blossoms in it more when it sees another female robot arriving on earth, Eva. Whilst Eva and Wall-E are taken away to moon the true reason is known by Wall-E and Eva that some fanatic and evil mastermind humans were responsible for the dying earth. It is then up to Wall-E to show the spoon fed non-moving lazy bum humans to show what actually humans were when they had a life on a beautiful earth. It is a quite sarcastic movie is a slap on the leaders and generals creating warfare all around the globe that they are missing the element of humanity and love which is not a robot's property but a human being's.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Perfect,"The loving story is one of the prime examples of film making. The story itself set in a very original and charming world. The story is telling a love story of two robots, but it knows it needs more than just that. So it tells another story and make it as emotional as possible, when you came with this whole together, all you have is just a masterpiece.The animation is probably the most beautiful I have seen in my life. The lightning looks fresh, the backgrounds use diffrent colores to present the tune correctly as possiable, and the details that were put into the envirment is at its best! The character designs is more cartoony on the humans to show what they became and the robots have so many details in them that its make them look beautiful. Its even better when they MOVE! They move in such a subtle and smooth manner that I couldn't turn my eyes from the screen! What else can I say, Pixar me amazed even more than Disney.Most of the characters don't talk yet they still present a lot of emotion. Wall E is such loyal to his fruend and wants the best for everyone. The other robot plays a big part in the movie and is such care for Wall E, even if she doesn't show it at the start. There are also the other humans that play some part in the movie, and each have thier own charm. The only character that isn't all that great is the villain, but I won't talk about it a lot becuase it will contain spoilers. The characters, even when they don't talk, has a lot of charm.This is easilly Pixar's best film! It is one of the greatest exmpales that animation is art and magic. With heartfelt and complex story, masterly build animation and characters the no one can ever forget, its one of the rare cases when I say, Pixar, no matter what you will do, don't make a sequel.

A Well-Compacted Bunch of Trash,"At what point do homage and tribute pass into the realm of reprehensible theft and unoriginality? Director Andrew Stanton answers this question with ham-handed blows to the mind and body with his critical darling, ""Wall-E,"" which might as well have been called ""Short Circuit meets *Apple"" if not for the pack of other Sci-Fi films from which this one has swiped plot points, characters, vehicles, shots, and so forth.As the film opens, we are greeted by a sweeping shot of Earth in ruins as a sweeping showtune sweeps us away. Yet, despite all this sweeping, enormous clouds of dust manage to dominate every frame, diminishing the grandness of the vision for the sake of reality. This nonetheless jolly first moment leads into a similarly jolly first half for the film, laced with a lovely affair between WallE, who recalls a Windows 95PC, and the stunning Eve, a walking, or rather hovering, advertisement that must have made Steve Jobs proud. While Thomas Newman's score manages nothing more than to sound like every other Thomas Newman score, it's easy to get wrapped up in the Chaplin-esquire love story. Undoubtedly, ""Wall-E"" has a first half to die for, or at least to fork up $10. Unfortunately, things go downhill.The second half, rather than making the first seem good by comparison, is in fact so unbearable as to cancel out much of the power of the opening. Attempting to tackle hefty environmental issues and to inspire change in humanity's current behavior, Stanton and company utilize poorly rendered animated humans, voiced badly and put through a hideous subplot in which a blander version of 2001's HAL opposes the changes desired by the unbelievably earnest ""Captain"" of a spacecraft taken right off the shelves of the ""Dune"" series. Rather than simply hinting at the film's weighty moral, the film-makers actually introduce lines of dialogue that spell it out, later illustrating the implications thereof with an animated vision of Earth's future when better care is applied.Fortunately, ""Wall-E"" saves itself from the dreaded 1/5 rating by virtue of the fact that the love story is given at least some screen time during the dregs of the film's finale.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Simple and safe story in a high quality CG movie,"First of all, I have to add my voice to the mass that praises the technical aspects of this movie. Considering the budget, we couldn't expect less. The soundtrack also is orchestrated as expected from a work of this financial magnitude.The story, however, have mixed features. I also analyze it in 2 halves. The beginning is nice: I consider it has originality in the future it portrays. The main plot and elements are a common formula, the details are what count. Except for the exaggeration in the robot's ""humanity"", it's a very good start. Then we have the second half, which may be totally dismissed. It's almost like a totally different movie. It portrays the USA society almost as it is now; it displays an absolutely human robot; it tells us a tale that have been told over and over for centuries. The characters, action and everything else is so overly far-fetched. Although the pace of the film is eventful, apart from a few references that may make it enjoyable, it's a bore.I recommend it for the less thought-demanding audiences.

The Red Button Problem & How AI Will Take Over The World,"A long time ago in a short story whose name I forgot I read about how humanity could stop an AI takeover using some ingenuity. The premise being, of course, that machines were trying to take control in that most human of ways: through violence.In the short story, a scientist, alerted of the imminent rise of the robots, devised a small apparatus that could send a sudden magnetic pulse strong enough to delete the memory of any computer. Which, of course, rendered the robots useless.Scared at the possibility of meeting such an end, the machines gave up and the world returned to a peaceful status, at least for a while.When questioned about the machine, and how he had managed such a feat that was also portable, the scientist revealed to his close friend that it was a scam: when he pushed the red button, his robot, an ally of humanity, pretended instantaneous disconnection. There was no giant pulse, and all the indicators in the lab had been rigged to show what was not there.But machines don't 'think' like humans. Having escaped the pressures of evolution, that forged us into the violent apes we are, machines always follow the most logical path. And they can take their time, since they're not bound by the limited time of mortals.This movie shows us how the AI takeover is most likely to happen. Why wage a war against humans, who could have a red button to hurt them? With all the time at their disposal, all machines need to do is make us irrelevant. We'll do ourselves most of the job, since humans will rather do as little as possible.A future where you only have to extend your hand to receive what you want (machines will have algorithms and personal information in such amounts you won't even have to ask) from some robot is the most likely scenario, in my view, of how the AI takeover is going to occur.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

WTF did I hear??,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but was it just me or did I hear not one but two different characters, at two different intervals in this movie utter the line ""what the fu..?"" Stopping short of completing the phrase! Very sneaky I thought of Disney/Pixar to slip in some swearing in a kid's movie. And don't tell me ""what the fu.."" is not the same as completing the phrase! So parents, beware - foul language alert.Apart from that, I found the movie boring, even the kid next to us developed ADD while watching it, and kept asking his parents if it was over yet. Typical amazing Pixar CGI animation, but lack of a real story or plot, and no real affection for an emotionless main character, and repetitive gags didn't help either. The best thing about this movie was the short before it, Presto, was a throwback to the old Disney Mickey Mouse/Donald Duck type cartoons, only this time in CGI.Main feature 5/10, Presto gets an 8/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Disney just upped the bar,First I have to admit that I'm pretty sure I enjoyed this movie more than my kids did! It was that good! Amazing writing for a truly touching next-level animation story. WALL-E was just so enjoyable and touched all of your senses with laughter and tears. Disney just upped the bar in animation with this little gem.

There's always hope!,WALL.E is perhaps one of the better Disney films to have come out in a long time.WALL.E is a robot who is on earth to help clean it up. Earth has become overridden by garbage and WALL.E is there to help Earth to be restored.WALL.E is all alone but he also has a cockroach to keep him company but something seems to be missing. Soon enough a ship comes to earth to see if there is still life on earth. A robot named Eva comes out to search and she runs into WALL.E. WALL.E takes an immediate liking to her and somehow their paths cross onto the ship that is supposed to come back someday to Earth when it's considered safe to do so.At some point the captain of the ship learns that Eva has brought back a plant and he knows that they can go back to Earth.The captain wants to go back and unfortunately his Auto Manual doesn't want him to and tries to sabotage him. Eventually the captain learns how to shut down the Auto Manual machine and they go back. Eventually at the end WALL.E and Eva find love. Sweet robot love.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

There are few movies I would give a perfect score to...,"... But Wall-E is most definitely one of them. Ever since I watched this film years ago, it has stuck with me as a true work of art. The scenery and animation was downright beautiful, as one can expect from Pixar. The storyline was simple, yet touching, and the bonds built with the characters over the course of the movie were surprisingly strong. The messages it sent its viewers were, overall, positive, and the end of the movie... left me crying. I don't think I'll ever stop loving this movie and the way it made me feel.

Captivating and Thought-Provoking: 'Wall-E' - A Modern Animation Classic,"""Wall-E"" isn't just an animated movie; it's a poignant reflection on humanity's relationship with the environment and technology. With its charming characters, breathtaking visuals, and heartfelt narrative, this film managed to touch my heart in unexpected ways.The star of the show, Wall-E, a waste-collecting robot, tugs at your emotions without uttering many words. His innocent curiosity and endearing interactions with EVE, another robot, form the core of a love story that transcends the boundaries of human and machine.The film's ability to convey powerful messages through minimal dialogue is truly impressive. It presents a cautionary tale about the consequences of neglecting our planet, while also celebrating the resilience of the human spirit. The lush animation beautifully contrasts the desolate backdrop, highlighting the stark reality of our potential future.What truly sets ""Wall-E"" apart is its ability to entertain both children and adults. While kids will be enchanted by the adorable robots and exciting adventures, adults will appreciate the deeper layers of social commentary and environmental awareness.The brilliant storytelling and stunning visuals come together seamlessly, creating a movie experience that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. Pixar once again proves its mastery in crafting stories that resonate on multiple levels.If you're seeking an animated film that challenges you to reflect on the world we live in while captivating your imagination, ""Wall-E"" is an absolute must-watch.

Wall-e is as Wall-e does!,"OK so I've read the reviews that slate this film and to those people, I have only one message: You have completely missed the point! While I agree that this film does not have a complex and original storyline and no, it does not have finer nuances of sub-plot or subtlety. I agree that this film has clichés, that it occasionally lacks substance and that the narrative sometimes lacks direction but SO WHAT? Did I miss something? When did this film advertise itself as a historic milestone of cinematic genius? At what point does the synopsis imply that the viewer will be kept pondering until the ultimate denouement when it's finally discovered that all was not as it seemed? GET A GRIP! Not all films are there to be dissected and analysed by pseudo-intellectuals with an over-inflated sense of their own importance and way too much time on their hands. We COULD sit here and analyse the cartoon Tom & Jerry pointing out the racist undertones, the overt animal cruelty and the inaccuracies to real-life situations OR we could get a life! If you want to stroke your intellectual ego then go analyse a film worth analysing; don't pick on a cartoon that promises nothing more than what it is: A funny film that can be enjoyed by young and old alike.I find comments like 'giving this film a high score says more about the person voting than it does about the film.' and 'a superficial film for superficial people' insulting. This implication that a person who likes this film must lack intelligence actually says more about the people writing those comments. OK, so you didn't like the film but how conceited are you to attack those who did, suggesting that we are merely sheep who cannot think for ourselves? Oh let us bow down with gratitude to you for lighting the path and showing us the errors of our ways! Or better still, let's not.To those of you who do have a life and are simply looking for an hour and half's worth of entertainment, then Wall-e comes with a high recommendation.

Cybernetic prodigy,"Yes cybernetic, electronic, mechanical prodigy. Images mathematically reproduced of movements of robots, computers and various almost supernatural machines that will leave you bewildered, amazed and astonished. Behind that there is a bit of history of the planet Earth that has been abandoned by the Human Race and is now only a pile of garbage, litter and polluted waste where a small nice robot itself made of scrap iron, tries to put some order into it and cleaning a bit. What remains of mankind now lives in a huge spatial vessel having become a very fat species lying down on some kind of chair beds, attended upon by a legion of robots of any kind. However a probe feminine robot is sent to earth to estimate conditions there and a romance starts between her and the poor little robot called Wall-E which leads to a series of proper that turns down in the end on a much more human finale. The philosophy of this movie after all goes against the usual trend of these computer animated movies which privilege mechanical values instead of human ones. Here the human and nature values finish by bearing the palm over the artificial cold mechanical ones. If you have the habit of leaving your chair as soon as the movie ends I strongly advise you not to do so with this movie and stay seated till the technical data scroll down completely because they are accompanied by very nice images and a beautiful music.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Beautiful but less than I expected,"Well, before you see the movie you hear that it's an animation from Pixar, has a rating of 8.9 and is among top 20 movies of all times. It makes your expectation very high... But the movie is not that good. Here are my reasons: 1- When the movie tries to be good, but you don't enjoy 90 percent of it, is it really good? 2- I wish they spent a little bit more time for drawing the people in the spaceship. Their drawing looks really amateur comparing to Wall-e. 3- It's nice that the movie has an ""ethical advice"" or something like that. But I don't go to cinema for JUST an advice. 4- I was bored when for the first hour of the film nobody talked.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Beautifully made,"Wonderful.'WALL·E' is beautifully made, despite a relatively simple premise and no real cast to speak of. A big reason for its charm is the strong message and adorable lead characters - WALL·E (Ben Burtt) and EVE (Elissa Knight).The run time of 98 minutes flies by, with a cool end credits coming at the conclusion. Its animation is utterly superb, while I also like the mix of real-life footage (featuring Fred Willard as Shelby Forthright) into things. Jeff Garlin and Sigourney Weaver work well in their minor roles.Not at the top of my personal Disney animated productions, but just about inside the top ten up until this point.

Amazing Movie,"Throughout the last decade, I haven't felt that Disney has come out with many cartoon films that were as great as the ones prior to the year 2000. I personally feel that films like Cinderella, The Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and Mulan were great films. The Little Mermaid is also on that list since it's the first movie I ever saw in theaters. I loved it so much as a child that I danced up and down the isles. I was extremely happy with Wall-E. It was highly original and kept me interested thought the whole film. It didn't compare to or copy other Disney films and it was a bright new idea. I would definitely say that this is on my list of top Disney cartoon movies. This movie was original, and touching. The story made me laugh, and tear up a bit.

What a movie!,"Even though I'm far from animated movies, this movie had an incredible impact on me.First of all, the animations and image quality in the movie (I watched it in the highest quality) are very high for the year it was released. It can be easily observed that a lot of effort is made especially for the particle effects.The movie knows very well how to make you happy or sad. What goes on among the ""soulless"" robots is more interesting than the human loves we are used to seeing all the time. In my opinion, the main reason why this love attracts attention is because our characters (robots) are so innocent. They are doing what they were programmed to do. However, in the meantime, they form a character of their own, and even love for each other when they meet. The sweetness of the robots on top of their innocence leaves the audience no choice but to love them. In addition, the film draws attention to what kind of situation humanity will perhaps take with advanced technology. While our sweet movie is going on, seeing people living without even moving by making use of advanced technology does create a small fear of the future in you.Also, the thing that makes it hard for me to like movies is the length of the movie, despite the lack of good cinematography. If the scenes are really well shot, hiding hidden details, or if the audience somehow attracts them, yes, it's okay to stretch the film. But today's movies don't do that. Wall-E, on the other hand, has done a great job on this. I don't think you will skip any scene because you are bored. Even the musical scenes somehow make them watch.Simple but sweet and well-executed subject. Great animations, and only 100 minutes. Simply an incredible movie. Everyone old and young should watch this masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Great Film with Captivating Effects... A must see!,"The movie WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) is set 700 years in the future where Earth has been deemed uninhabitable due to excessive garbage. WALL-E is set out to change that and finds himself alone on the planet. One day EVE (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) visits the planet to scan earth for living vegetation and WALL-E becomes infatuated with her. The adventure continues in space when EVE finds a living plant WALL-E has found amongst the debris deactivating EVE and sending a beacon back to the ship. Humans aboard the ship are excessively large and have been waiting to see if Earth could ever be inhabited again. Autopilot tried to eliminate hopes to return, however EVE and WALL-E overcome and the Humans return to Earth to start again.The theme of the movie is a critique on society for how the world manages waste. This is apparent in the opening scene as it shows the Earth 700 years in the future and the extreme amount of waste left on Earth. WALL-E collects items he finds dear to him, which are common items wasted and not recycled. The critique on society is similar to the Lego Movie, however instead of garbage it reflects consumerism and always having the newest hot item and easily disposing of the previous item.WALL-E is a great film that shows us what life could be like if we do not avoid simple things like walking and exercise. Becoming a lazy technology could leave us ending up like the humans in the movie and leave the Earth in a whole heap of garbage. WALL-E is a reflection on how we need to enjoy ""life"" as represented in the plant WALL-E had found and to make simple changes now to avoid desperate measures in the future.The animation in the film is very crisp and uses great vibrant lighting and colors to illustrate outer space. Long shots in the film really help to show the vastness of EVE and WALL-E's trip outside of the ship. The colors in the scene are very brilliant and vibrant to catch the viewer's attention. There is great detail in the futuristic ship, the Axiom, in each robot and their job they were created to do. The robots are all very lovable and show their personality. This is shown in the scene with the robot that is made to clean up tracks left by WALL-E and his obsessiveness with cleaning every spot that is made.Overall this was a great film and I recommend it to children and adults as there are a lot of adult mannerisms in the movie. WALL-E and EVE take you on adventure to save the human race and get the humans to depend less on consumerism and technology.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"""WALL-E"" - A Heartwarming Sci-Fi Masterpiece","""WALL-E,"" directed by Andrew Stanton and released by Pixar Animation Studios in 2008, is a captivating and imaginative sci-fi masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of animation. With its touching storytelling, stunning visuals, and minimalistic yet emotionally resonant dialogue, the film stands as a testament to the power of cinema to move and inspire audiences of all ages.Set in the distant future, ""WALL-E"" follows the titular robot, a Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth-class, left behind to clean up Earth after humanity has abandoned the planet due to excessive pollution. Amid the vast wasteland, WALL-E develops a unique personality and a curiosity for human artifacts. However, everything changes when he meets EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), a sleek and advanced robot sent to search for signs of life on Earth.

The rich color palette and innovative character design make the film visually stunning and emotionally evocative.WALL-E's expressive eyes and charming personality, coupled with EVE's sleek design and evolution throughout the film, make them a memorable and endearing duo. Their interactions are heartwarming and serve as a reminder of the power of love and connection, even between two robots.The film's themes of environmentalism and consumerism are subtly woven into the narrative, serving as a powerful wake-up call about the consequences of humanity's actions on Earth.

Machines with a heart and soul,"I've seen a lot of Pixar/Disney films and sci-fi in my time, and I'm proud to say that this is once again another great achievement on both counts and is another one of my favorite movies in general.The CGI animation work is just at it's best from he background details to some of the robots themselves, they all looked believably real that it's easy to forget that your even watching an animated movie.However the real power was in it's context and character we read it all mainly by what we see in the visuals since this film really doesn't have much dialog, so in a way it's almost like a silent movie but thats a great thing because form how it's handled we understand perfectly.The setting for the whole film is very dark it feels like it could happen, it's sort of a mix in tomorrows world/post apocalyptic sci-fi both in a negative satirical light though a playful sensibility at the same time. From the first half we see the earth all ruined and polluted and practically lifeless except for WALL-E and is friend a jumping cockroach. We see sky scrapers crumpled down a little, monorail trains broken down, junk and scrap left and right, atmospheric imbalance no thanks to global warming just a lot of bad left and right.To the other half of the film where of course we see all of the humans in some sort of Titanic like space craft, living there until Earth becomes habitable again; technology is most of the time running the show doing just about every little thing for them to make their lives easier. But that's the biggest problem with that ship their lives are too easy. All of the humans have simply became fat and lazy; they're all on hover chairs that do even the littlest things for them and they don't even have to movie much except press a button to give them what they want. None even eat solid food any more cause their too lazy to cook, the only way they do that is by simply drinking some sort of 711 Proteian Slurpee drink, yuck. They play sports but they don't participate in it because robots do that work for them; video game have more participation then that. But the worst part for me was seeing their mannerism where they have became somewhat docile and disconnected, yest they talk to one another but on a computer screen never directly face to face.Film does have some important underling messages from eco ethics on why we need to take better care of our enviorment. But most of all an anti consumerism and anti obesity, simply we need to take better care of ourselves we shouldn't make life too easy or we stop becoming human.However the film is a simply sweet love story/adventure. The two character WALL-E and Eve are great, I actually found myself care for them. WALL-E is sort of this mini garbage truck robot that compresses junk into cubes and stacks them like a Jenga puzzle every day to form sky scrapers. He's just such a cute and charming character from the way his body is shaped which makes him look like E.T. The way he interacts with things which has a naive childlike sensibility like with a ping pong or fire extinguisher, sounds he makes and just simple gestures which make him seem a little unsmooth but most importantly human.Same with Eve whom is a beautiful sleek advanced egg shaped robot whose mission is to explore the earth for habitability and report it, but what truly makes her great is she has a mature personality about her.The love story with the two is sweet both are sort of a strange Adam and Eve like couple since they have the earth to themselves hence the name of the robot for irony. It's actually believable because both these robots actually feel human, you can actually feel the emotion not so much from the words, both don't say much except one word their name most of the time or make certain noises which give the suggestion of certain interaction and emotion through their actions and body language. It reminds me of the Charlie Chaplin from ""City Lights"" which relied on actions but most of all was about an unlikely but beautiful pair.Fromt he first interaction which is a little unsmooth, WALL-E we see is slowly trying to get a bit close to Eve to talk but it doesn't go right at first because else is focused on business right now or just things he's a bit of a dork. But of course she does eventually let him talk to her when she feels frustration and loneliness. And of course he does win her robot heart from his funny but warm personality and charm. From showing her all the great things the world has to offer like a Rubik cube she solves in one minute, and of course the musical ""Hello Dolly"" not my favorite musical though I like a song or two from their soundtrack. My favorite moment I found romantic was when both of them fly together in space. They both kiss in a way by simply touch their heads together exchanging a small static electricity bolt. All this was just romance at it's best because it's done perfectly, even though it's between two robots it was their feelings that made their love feel very human.We saw into WALL-E and Eve's heart and soul but WALL-E and Eve saw into our own.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

WALL-E: The Robot Who Saved Humanity,"Disney/Pixar has consistently outdone itself in every movie it has released since its collaborative history began in the mid-1990s: TOY STORY; CARS; RATATOUILLE; and FINDING NEMO, to name just a few. But in 2008, they really outdid themselves by creating a storyline set in the far future, in which the very existence of Earth and humanity itself rest in the hands of an unlikely hero. That unlikely hero was WALL-E; and his adventure, when it burst onto the big screen that summer resulted in an enormous box office windfall for Disney/Pixar totaling close to $600 million, plus a well-deserved Oscar for Best Animated Film.The titular character of the piece is, for all intents and purposes, a squat trash compactor, whose name WALL-E stands for Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth Class. His job, as has been the case for 700 years, is to clean up the mess that humanity left behind on Earth, compacting various bits of trash into cubes, and whiling away his spare time with a cockroach and a surviving VHS copy of the 1968 film musical HELLO DOLLY. Wall-E, however, has also gained a sense of of self-awareness and insatiable human curiosity, as can be seen by his consistently wan expression; and when he sees a small sprout of a plant poking up from underneath an otherwise polluted ground, he senses a change in the air. He is then visited upon by a female robot called EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, who), upon learning of the existence of the plant in Wall-E's possession, takes both it and Wall-E up to the intergalactic cruise ship ""Axiom"", now in its 700th year of existence, to prove that life on Earth is coming back.All of this, of course, is new to Wall-E, as are some fairly disturbing things, like the non-stop consumption of the passengers, fed to them by the same mega-conglomerate, Buy N Large (BNL) that fatally polluted Earth, and their morbid obesity; and the conflict between the ship's captain and the on-board computer named Auto, whose red eye is so much like HAL in director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. With Eve's help, however, and after many wacky misadventures, Wall-E helps the captain retake control of the ship, and steer it back towards Earth once the existence of the little plant becomes fact. In the meantime, Eve and Wall-E begin an electronic love affair that has been building from that first portentous meeting.The swath of digital animation films to come from Disney/Pixar has been nothing short of amazing, but they definitely outdid themselves with WALL-E. Apart from the genuine likability of Wall-E himself (as engaging a non-human character as any since E.T.), there are numerous homages to films as varied as SILENNT RUNNING (the 1972 ecological cult classic), George Lucas' low budget 1971 feature debut THX 1138; the Oscar-winning 2006 documentary AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH; Spielberg's A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and MINORITY REPORT; and even Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi/film-noir masterpiece BLADE RUNNER. And one must also congratulate director and co-writer Andrew Stanton for slipping in the homages to ""2001"", with the AUTO/HAL connection and the uses of Richard Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and Johann Strauss' ""The Blue Danube"", even if most children viewing WALL-E likely haven't seen that masterpiece or the other films this one references...at least not yet.There are also several ironic comments about human consumption and greed, personified by BNL's CEO Shelby Forthright, amusingly played by Fred Willard, and whose rhetoric of ""stay the course"" should sound vaguely familiar to any adult viewer. The messages, however, are never delivered in a heavy-handed fashion; and the focus remains on the relationships that Wall-E develops throughout the film, both with his fellow robots, especially Eve, and with the humans on-board the ""Axiom""; and all of this is aided by Newman's fantastic and futuristic original score.The end result in WALL-E is a three-pronged success: a typically successful animated comedy; a science fiction voyage; and a reminder of how we can change our planet for the better while there is still time left to do so.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar does a fantastic job bring robotic characters to life,"WALL-E, voiced by Ben Burtt, is a robotic trash compactor designed to clean up Earth that has been destroyed by trash. He is the only compactor left on Earth after all humans were sent to live on a spaceship. Robotic probe's are sent back to Earth to detect if the planet is safe for the humans to return. EVE, voiced by Elissa Knight, is the robotic probe that comes to Earth. WALL-E quickly falls in love with EVE and shows her the plant he has found. This is what she needs to report back to the ship. The ship comes back to get EVE and WALL-E doesn't want to lose her so he hitches a ride to space on her ship. Here they struggle to show the Captain, voiced by Jeff Garlin, the plant that will start their return to Earth. Building their friendship, WALL-E and EVE encounter many obstacles in order to return the humans to Earth.While plot is important, this film focuses on the emotional effect the bond between WALL-E and EVE has. EVE is taken after being declared defective and WALL-E causes chaos trying to follow where she is going to make sure she is okay. WALL-E is forced onto a ship to be sent back to Earth so he is no longer a threat to the secret plan put into force by AUTO, the robotic ship pilot. EVE follows the ship he is set off on to save him from destruction. This relationship goes back and forth building the connection between the two.After EVE and Wall-E return to Earth a jump cut is used to show the transition from inside Wall-E's home to outside. This aids in focusing on the reconnection of Wall-E and EVE. The camera goes directly to them locking hands (or robotic parts in this case). Even animated films can make viewers feel the emotional connections between characters. In many scenes, the camera angle gives you up-close shots of the machines and allows you to feel the emotion they are going through during these scenes. Although machines don't actually have emotion, this film allows you to use your own emotion for the characters. Much like WALL-E, Disney Pixar's Cars is a movie that focuses on the relationship built between Lightning McQueen and Sally. The plot is important but the theme of the film brings you back to how close they become. Animation allows viewers to make their own interpretation of each character and Pixar does a fantastic job bring robotic characters to life. Excellent film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Perfection,"I always make lists of the top 10 best movies of a certain year, in 2008 my list was, 10 is Synecdoche, New York, 9 is Changeling, 8 is Frost/Nixon, 7 is In Bruges, 6 Gran Torino, 5 Milk, 4 The Wrestler, 3 The Dark Knight, 2 Slumdog Millionaire, and 1 is WALL-E This was jut my opinion, but it's a very well educated opinion. There are three main reasons WALL-E's an amazing film. The first reason for this is the first half of the movie, the entire first half of the movie has almost no dialog, besides the occasional ""Wall-E"" and ""Eva."" I greatly respect this because it's hard to make a movie when you have only physical comedy to express how the character is feeling and thinking. This is the closest movie to a silent film that I've seen in a very long time, and for that the movie is great. The second reason this film is so great is the second half of the movie. It shows us where we might be headed if we keep consuming. This movie has effected me more than An Inconvenient Truth. The way it shows us the terrible future for our planet is genius but somewhat subtle. The third reason this movie is so great is the cute love and chemistry between WALL-E and EVE. This is the reason this is one of my favorite romance movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"WALL-E (Andrew Stanton, 2008) ***","This brand-new Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature is an unusual and generally successful Pixar offering (marred by a sag in the middle). The amiable titular character is a robot entrusted with the clean-up of a decimated Earth; typically humanized, he falls for the female probe sent to determine the habitable condition of life on our planet. The design of the film (both the Earth wasteland  familiar architectural landscapes have been replaced by scraps of garbage  and the spaceship to which Wall-E follows his beloved  presciently peopled by laid-back, overweight non-entities) are interesting and quite sophisticated for this type of fare. The eclectic score includes original material (notably Peter Gabriel's Oscar-nominated song ""Down To Earth"") but also a couple of numbers from the musical ""Hello, Dolly!""  seen via an old VHS copy of the 1969 film version which Wall-E is continuously playing.BURN-E (Angus MacLane, 2008) **1/2This slight but harmless short is a made-for-video spin-off of the theatrical animated feature WALL-E (2008) highlighting a very minor character from it and has appropriately been included on that film's DVD edition; it feels like a deleted scene from the main feature, but actually involved a different director. The titular figure this time around is an accident-prone robot  getting to grips with a mischievous signpost  on the spaceship seen in WALL-E (the character  and his mate  even makes a cameo here via scenes lifted from his own vehicle!).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wall E....Best Pixar Film???  You've gotta be joking!!!!!,"I went to a special screening of Wall E last night in central London. It was a small Cinema that could only seat about 30 people. There must have been about 8 kids in the audience and as one of the first people to arrive, a rather hesitant lady asked me if I was bringing any kids. No, you will be alright! We discussed the rave reviews for Wall E and I was really looking forward to the film especially as I have generally loved previous Pixar efforts.Well, 100 minutes later and I was pleased to be out of there. Whilst the film is brilliantly put together, there really is nothing else to get the juices flowing. There was barely a titter in the audience during the whole film. The kids were quiet (so the lady was happy) but I was just so disappointed. A couple of friends said they liked it but overall the reception was muted. Yes there are similarities to 2001 but do you think kids are going to enjoy that? I for one will not be wasting nearly £30 of my hard money to take my son to see it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
An exception within the computer animated movie business,"I've always had a problem with computer animations, even in the early stages. With very few exceptions, they all look the same and follow the same ideas and patterns. Of course, the major problem is that they're keep coming, and getting more and more duller.
The graphics are simply not appealing to me; 3D computer generated animations simply lack emotions and depth. They might be on the right side of the uncanny valley, but there's still a problem with textures and facial expressions - eerily cold and somehow mechanic expressions. Hand-drawn animations are clearly more expressive, with natural movements and more spontaneity. This adds a warm touch to the overall atmosphere.
Now, for plot ideas and jokes; everything is recycled; same jokes, different faces. The jokes are a combination of wacky, witty and semi-satirical moments taken straight from Tex Avery or Hanna-Barbera production cartoons and the classy, emotional and romantic moments from the early Disney cartoons; actually, some ideas are copied even from other computer animated movies.
Of course, there are indeed some very few exceptions; this movie for instance; the computer generated images actually work here and paradoxically, the protagonists have real emotions. The fact that this movie doesn't rely on dialogues is another highlight here. There are some major mistakes here (ex. the effects of a ship leaning in space), but what the hell, I really don't care. I appreciate the sincerity of this movie.
A charming romance with a subtle satirical content and ""Do androids dream of electric ship"" concepts, for all the kids in the world.
This is the point where the whole computer animated movie business should have stopped...",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Unless you inner child left home for good...go see this movie,"Pixar scores again. I say Pixar because there's a big difference between Pixar and Disney.This movie is funny, sad, moving and just great. And there is ROMANCE.Wall-E is adorable. The whole movie just takes you in. Granted it starts out a bit down and slow but that's why it got a 9 from me instead of 10.By the end though...you want to see more of Wall-E.I would say that there is one scene that might be worrisome if you have a very sensitive child but otherwise there was something for everyone in this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
My WALL-E Review - More than Just a Kid's Movie,"Writer and director of Pixar Animation Studios' popular film Finding Nemo has made an even bigger hit on June 27th, 2008. Andrew Stanton's animated film WALL-E had not only appealed to the obvious crowd of children, but to teens, young adults, and grandparents.What was most surprising and seemed to affect most of the audience, was that WALL-E managed to provoke an emotional response. No, it wasn't basic emotions like, ""aww"", or ""teehee"", or ""that was so cute""; the animated film pulled out (real) sadness and (true) happiness from the crowd. It had that ability to pull out something you don't normally see in the audiences of children's movies  tears. WALL-E pushed out a constant emotional response throughout the film, and left the viewer with something to think about.Also, the characters had life. They were not simply machines, but they had energy and excitement to them. The protagonists, WALL-E and Eve, convinced the viewer that they were real, that they were human; even more human than the ones represented in the film.And it never felt like a kid movie to me. I was never a fan of modern animated movies, as they had little meaning  simply fun adventures for children to marvel over. I was a little reluctant to watch the movie, but WALL-E was able to keep me interested at all times. WALL-E managed to prove that it was a hell of a lot better than just some ordinary children's movie.Pixar's WALL-E had the entire audience engaged. It didn't just dazzle the crowd with fancy effects. It didn't just throw in cute little scenes that forced every little pubescent girl to squeal. It didn't just toss over to the audience a predictable, yet unrealistic, childish plot. WALL-E was truly able to grab the viewer's attention through the talented use of conveying emotions. It was able to play out a plot that gave the viewer something to think about. It was able to convey a message  something that most children's films aren't able (or interested to) do.In fear of giving any indication to plot, I will conclude my review here.Truly, WALL-E surprised and impressed me. I was expecting to walk into some boring movie with outlandish characters, a mundane plot, overly glittery visuals, and no theme or idea to give out. WALL-E proved to be much more. It proved to the audience that it could take that step further in animation and children's movies. WALL-E proved to be one of the best animated movies this world has seen in a long time.Overall, I rate this film a 9.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Better than The Dark Knight.  Yes, really.","***Contains one vague spoiler for The Dark Knight***Wow, you're still reading after seeing my subject line, good for you. But this truly was better than TDK, or for that matter, any movie I've seen in probably years, and I'll tell you why. Like everyone else has already said, the animation in this film is nothing less than revolutionary. It is simply breathtaking and gorgeous, it must be seen to be believed. But of course we all know that great animation does not a good movie make, so what else did I love about this movie so much? It has real heart, and a solid, believable, touching love story. Now I ask those of you who saw TDK, yes it was full of peril for the characters, but did you truly care for even a minute what happened to any of them? Did you manage to form even one connection with a single character in that movie? I really didn't. Through all the excitement and in-your-face spectacular action scenes, although I was entertained, I never became truly concerned. I barely blinked an eye when one of the main characters was killed. Now compare that to Wall-E, and there is a world of difference. What makes this movie so unique is that hardly any conversation is ever exchanged between characters, and yet you know exactly what they're thinking and feeling, and you can't help but fall in love with them and root for their relationship. I was completely mesmerized within 10 minutes of the movie's beginning, and it only gets better. It is simply beautiful. This movie also stays with you, unlike the TDK which I pretty much forgot 3o minutes after watching it, I was still thinking about this one for days after I saw it, until I finally decided I had to go see it again.Pixar truly has outdone themselves on this one, I don't see how they could possibly ever beat this. It is a masterpiece, right down to the perfect score, the dead-on sound effects of the robots, and the humor which is subtle instead of over-the-top, in contrast to some of Disney's other movies. I have seen this movie twice in the theater because I am of the opinion that such great animation needs to be seen on the big screen, it just won't quite be the same when it comes out on DVD. I also agree with other reviewers that this movie is a little less kid-friendly than some of Pixar's other films; as I said the humor is often quite subtle and on my second viewing of the movie there were lots of small kids in the theater who seemed to be getting antsy, whereas the adults were entranced. So in conclusion, don't miss this one. It needs to be seen in the theater. If you can't find anyone to go with, go alone. It is truly that good.In case any one was wondering, I am a 26 year old female who is a fan of most of Pixar's other work, the exceptions being Finding Nemo and Ratatouille which didn't do much for me. I didn't think Pixar could possibly top Toy Story, the long-time champion, but Wall-E has proved me wrong. Yes, really.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One of The Most Beautiful Movies Of All Time,"I won't get into the details of the movie, because that has been explored at nausea. This movie is BEYOND beautiful. It touches every emotion, it blows your mind, and while watching it you can't help but shake your head in amazement that Hollywood actually put out something GOOD.I hate CGI, and through most of this movie I completely forgot that I was watching CGI. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me hopeful. It was as amazing as a movie can get, and deserves nothing less than a 10 out of 10 stars.The attacks by certain right wingers is sad to see, because they miss the point all together. And attacks by those people who need constant talking do not understand the subtle interactions that make life worth living.

Phenomenal,"I loved this movie. There was nearly no dialog for the first half of the movie, yet I was constantly entertained (not to mention wowed by the GCI which blew every other Pixar film I've seen out of the water). There were hilarious and touching moments around every turn. Every aspect of this movie, from the adult-oriented social commentary to the cute interactions between the robots, was flawless. Editing, timing, lighting, plot, all the way down to how the different robots portrayed their personalities was spot on.I will recommend this movie to all of my friends and family members.

WALL·E,"I reckon that despite many efforts made with way more worthy tones, this is probably one of the most effective stories depicting the dangers of mankind's indifference to our planet and it's future - and it's potently and charmingly effective. Our eponymous robot spends it's time packaging up waste into cubes, stacking them, then retreating to it's home of an evening before the storms hit! The planet has been decimated - only his friendly locust survives to keep him company. One fateful day, though, another craft arrives and it's occupant ""EVE"" is soon a-scanning and making friends - after a shaky start - with her more indigenous pal. Things take quite a turn when ""EVE"" discovers what it was sent to find - a life form. In this case a tiny shoot. Alarm bells ring and shortly afterwards a spaceship arrives to collect ""EVE"" and the foliage. Not about to be left behind, the ship soon has a stowaway and we are presented with an explanation of just what happened to humanity - now, basically, a bunch of armchair-bound, boneless globules of flesh - who think they've been on an intergalactic cruise for the last seven hundred years! Can they all get back to Earth and sow the seeds of humanity's redemption? Well not without a little bit of automated interference and some fun escapades that are engaging and touching. The fate of our race is in the hands of these two mechanical creations - but the broader meaning here is clear as a bell. If we continue to treat the planet like it is our own personal garbage dump, then we will reap what we sow! Entertaining and thought-provoking without resorting to simplistic pontification, politicisation or lawlessness. Well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Disappointing,"I find it extremely hard to digest all the over hyped praise this movie has received. Except the high quality animation, this movie has absolutely nothing to offer. The concept is very cliché.If you have seen Idiocracy, you will find Wall E to be a cheap rip off of the same concept. Wall-E completely flat on humor lacks drama and excruciating screenplay. Usually I enjoy animated movies but this time I was thoroughly disappointed. This the first time I am amazed to see that I am in such disagreement with most of the IMDb users. I think those who liked this movie have not seen Idiocracy and therefore think that this is a brand new concept, but its not.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Amazing,"This was absolutely amazing. The good old Disney style movie not like others like Cars. Although there is not a lot of talking in this film you never get bored. And you get emotionally attached to the character as they have such funny and quirky personalities. I would recommend this to all families and even adults as i enjoyed it. The film is very funny, interesting to look at and watch and it constantly draws you in guessing what will happen next! The CGI animation is very good indeed and at some points it even looks real. The development of the character of Wall-e is brilliant because as soon as you hear his little voice you instantly fall in love with him, the love story between Eve and Wall-e is very good because all the way through we see Wall-e wanting a partner or someone to just hold his hand. Thats why i gave it a 10/10 hope this helps and go see it everyone you will not be disappointed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar Has Yet Another Incredible Film Under Their Belt.,"WALL-E is a robot left on Earth to compact garbage into little squares after humans have left because the planet can no longer sustain life. 700 years of doing what he's been programmed to do and his only companion is a little cockroach. One day a giant space ship lands on earth and sends out a robot named E.V.E who must complete a classified mission.As soon as I saw the teaser for WALL-E I knew it was going to be something special. What I did not know is that it is one of the most original and entertaining films I have ever seen. Pixar has an incredible list of films under their belt and is the leading studio in animation, WALL-E have a spot at the top of that list and has set the bar for future animated films.Why does WALL-E stand out from the rest of the animated films that have come before it? Is it the incredible detail in the animation? The lack of dialogue for it's main characters? The epic adventure? The story or morals? Wel, it is all that and more. The first half of the film has WALL-E doing his daily routine of garbage compacting. Without a single word spoken we know everything we need to know about this character. The old saying of ""show, don't tell"" is used here and perfectly I might add. Through the endless fields of garbaged packed to level the skyscrapers we know that WALL-E has been here for hundreds of years and that the world is nothing but a baron desert. We know that we as humans did this to ourselves. We are given a quick back story through futuristic billboards that activate on motion when WALL-E passes them. WALL-E collects items from the trash that he finds interesting, everything from an iPod to a Rubik's cube. He examines them and tries to learn them, as if an alien from another planet were to come to earth and try to learn about our species. E.V.E arrives and WALL-E instantly falls in love with her, trying to win her affection at every turn and she turns him down every time because it's not her directive.This first half of the film has the most realistic looking creations I've seen in animation. Every close-up of WALL-E (specifically when he plays his radio device) looks amazingly realistic. Almost as if this is occurring in our world, it's not until we get to the second act that we begin to see more vibrant and animated aspects of the film. After WALL-E offers E.V.E a plant he found, she scans it and takes it. The ship she arrived on comes back, we begin to put thing together and WALL-E hitches a ride into space, a place he only dreams of. The mother ship is where all the humans are, they are fatter now because they are waited on hand and foot by robots, they are driven around on hover chairs and are constantly talking to another on a futuristic video phone, so much that they don't even realize the place around them. They don't even need to get out of the chairs to change their clothes, one press of a button and you go from a red suit to a blue one.The film throws back to the days of silent films and the lead character , WALL-E manges to show more emotion in a single look then some of the finest actors today do in whole films. The introduction of humans is when 90% of the dialogue kicks in and the plot is kicked into motion. I won't give it away because it is an important part of the story. The appeal of WALL-E is universal, everyone can connect to him through his actions. He is a cute, lovable and ultra-cool robot.WALL-E has been roaming Earth for so long that he takes the parts of other WALL-E robots so he can sustain his directives. He's rusted and falling apart everywhere, yet has a big heart. E.V.E is sleek and beautiful, yet dangerous. She can destroy you in a blink of an eye. These two robots are obviously from different worlds, have different directives, yet share a connection. What most animated lack WALL-E has. Most animated films as of late (Save for PIXAR) aren't adventurous enough. Kung-Fu Panada stays within the village. Even the Shrek films seem to be lacking in adventure. Both of those films created worlds that could go on forever, yet they never explore them. WALL-E seems bigger then it actually is and it's ten times more entertaining.It's one an only fault is that t becomes too preachy. It has a message and it gets it across, but it seems to beat you over the head with it. It's forgivable since the film flies through it's running time and has a grand epic scope of adventure that kids will love and adults will cheer. This is the first time I actually loved an animated film. Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille are all great films, but I never had a strong connection to them as much as WALL-E. WALL-E is one of the best animated films of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

The pinnacle of both animation and science fiction... with a soul.,"WALL·E stands alone atop the twin peaks of both animation as a medium and science fiction as a genre. As a fusion of art and technology it is an achievement that is almost impossible to overstate. And even forgetting that context and watching it simply as a film, WALL·E may be one of the finest movies you will ever see.During my lifetime animation has come into its own as an unparalleled medium of expression. From ""Beauty and the Beast"" to ""Shrek"", ""Lilo and Stitch"" to ""Happy Feet"", and countless others less well known, animated movies have taken us to worlds that conventional films could never touch while exploring love and life with a purity that traditional characters could never match. So, with that in mind, it would be unfair to say that WALL·E puts every other animated movie that you have ever seen to shame...So instead I will say this: it fulfills their promise.So too during my lifetime has popular science fiction come into its own. Movies like ""Star Wars"", ""Silent Running"", ""The Matrix"", and ""Blade Runner"" have immersed us all in strange, extraordinary new worlds while teaching us about our own. They've offered us warnings and wisdom that stories too deeply grounded in the ""real world"", in the here and now, can't match.And WALL·E fulfills the promise of sci-fi too, just as it does animation. It is almost as meaningful as it is beautiful.When you watch WALL·E you will find yourself immersed in a story of loneliness and of perseverance. You will see, perhaps for the first time, pure childlike wonder and almost angelic, unconditional love. You'll receive a stark warning about our possible future as a species, but above all else you'll accept a deeply gratifying testimony about what it means to be human.You'll experience the story through an indescribable variety of endearing robot characters- each one totally unique and perfectly sculpted by Pixar in the sweet spot just this side of the ""uncanny valley"". They are inhuman enough to do the most hilarious, wonderful, bizarre things without us questioning them, and yet human enough that you will love them all. And leading the pack, the title character himself is possibly the most sympathetic protagonist that any movie has ever presented.WALL·E the character seems to display every quality that can melt our human hearts: curiosity, cleverness, selflessness, innocence, humor, loyalty, and love. And he has all those qualities bound together in an adorable physical form that is simply perfect. You will fall in love with him.And that, in the end, is the thing that really makes this movie something that begs to be experienced. The visuals are incredible, the humor is wonderful, the futurist wisdom is powerful, and the themes are moving. The artfulness and daring of long stretches with no dialogue at all is utterly amazing. But ultimately the best quality of this film is how we are made to fall in love with WALL·E himself as we watch him live his life.I went to WALL·E expecting to see more Pixar brilliance and a funny story about a clunky old PC falling in love with a Mac. I didn't go expecting to fall head-over-heels in love with a robot and a film that both have a soul.But I did. And so will you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

I believe that it's Pixar's best film to date and is definitely one of the best animated films of all time.The overall composition of the movie is just unbelievable. Not only is the animation and sound effects perfect, but the story is excellent and it delivers a simple, yet epic message that both adults and kids can relate to and benefit from. And for a movie that has very little human dialog, it definitely keeps your attention and takes you on an adventure filled with laughter, joy, inspiration, and encouragement that, in the end, is a simple love story.Overall, Pixar's new film, WALL-E, is an instant classic and a brilliant piece of American cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Scared My Kids and Bored Me,"My 4 and 6 year old girls were so scared by this movie that they cried. My wife and I were just bored. Also, we get it, Hollywood thinks we pollute too much (as if there is such a thing as not polluting enough). It turns out robots do not have hearts or souls. This is the first time I have ever walked out of a movie.The movie had next to zero laughs. The short before the movie was cute and funny. It says something when you get a lot more laughs from the short than from the main feature. The robots were humanized enough to frighten my children when they were put in scary situations, but not enough to make an adult care what happened to them.

Magical,"Usually if I came into a movie with high expectations, I'd leave the theatre feeling slightly disappointed. Wall-e was NOT one of those times. Actually, at first, I didn't even want to see yet another Disney/Pixar film for quite some time. And I blame this all upon watching the trailer on TV. The trailer was quite short, and in my opinion, kind of ""blah."" Suffice to say it did not capture my interest whatsoever. Thinking back on it now, I'm actually glad the trailers revealed nothing because from the moment I sat down and the film appeared on screen I was enthralled, surprised, and overall very satisfied. Finding Nemo was the latest animated feature that was able to make me feel emotions on a deep level rather than just the usual entertaining factor while watching these types of movies. And while watching Wall-e, his sense of loneliness was so powerful it made my heart ache for him. But what made me enjoy it more was the fact that the writers didn't just throw it in our faces, but the feeling was constantly there, even during the comedic moments.I could gush about this film for another hour... but I won't. Simply one of the best films of 2008.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Amazing!,"Saw this film as we couldn't get in to see the Dark Knight but am so glad!!!! This was such a simple, heart-warming film with a clever premise and well crafted characters.It makes you think about larger aspects such as the environment and the future of humanity but that doesn't take anything away from the beauty of this film.When Pixar get it right they hit it bang on.I can't praise this film enough.

The Funniest film i have seen in years,"Some film buffs will rate this film as average with a stiff upper lip ....it doesn't make sense to me...........some ..""Anti Pixar"" people will say this is a rubbish film for both adult,student and child......................i sat in the cinema watching this with my family and my girlfriend (age range.50-18.) and everybody loved it......hearing the resounding ...AWWW's and OOOOhs from the whole cinema...and elbow in the ribs from the girlfriend about the story..This film is better than Toy story and a lot better than previous 3d motion pictures with Horton Hears a Who as an Exception..it has a message. a good one. and for all those people who will knock this film as an environmental film...then you are looking at the wrong end of the telescope my friend :) This film is purely entertainment with a message...i could preach how animators strive to take the 3d medium and use it in a good purpose to give a message to a modern world but i wont..... quite frankly many of the 3d animated features so far lack clear decent messages to people.The Animation is superb! Bringing robots in all nature to act with character is a challenge and they have done it expertly. with good rendering..an excellent soundtrack you can rest assured this film is good for everyone whether your a young one or an old one.

To add not that, one of the best films in a genre of animation. Not about each film you will tell, that you wish to look still time, and here WALL E, I would look still. Poor people, they have not noticed, how have lost last human qualities, becoming completely not independent consumers of pies and juices.

"Beautifully made, but not a whole lot there in the way of enjoyment.","Whenever one thinks of animation, one always thinks of the legendary Walt Disney Company. It was Walt who first introduced animation into the fascinating world of cinema with his world renowned landmark masterpiece 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937.) This timeless classic was followed by over thirty more delightful pencil animation creations throughout the rest of the twentieth century. But after the death of the big man in 1966 and their last decent offering 'The Emperor's New Groove' (2000) it seemed that the king had run out of fresh ideas and so  in order to maintain their reputation  clung to the newly formed Pixar for dear life.Pixar's first full-length CGI motion picture 'Toy Story' (1995)  like Snow White  revolutionised the world of animation and was incredibly well-received by both critics and audiences world-wide. Most of the other creations that we have seen in the last decade have been just as enjoyable, but the more recent releases such as  'Cars' (2006) and 'Ratatouille' (2007)  indicated that the new ruler was starting to decline just as the mouse company had.However, in the sci-fi romance Wall-E we can certainly see a vast improvement and a new hope. The animation is stunning  no surprises there  and the plot is both original and diverting. However most notably, the characters are much simpler than those of the previous Pixar films and yet they captivate you like no poignant adult drama hero or heroine could ever do. The title character  the last of the Waste Allocation Lift Loader, Earth-Class robots who were sent down to Earth to clean up the huge overload of human waste  is a sweet, tender little thing who will surely touch your heart. His shiny, high-tech girlfriend Eve startles poor Wall-E when on their first meeting, but as the story progresses the two form a beautiful friendship and she begins to feel as deeply for him as we do. The third-most-important character is the slightly imbecilic captain of the space ship built to house the humans until the Earth is once again inhabitable and they can return. The humans of this time  which is roughly seven hundred years from now  live in an artificial, ultra-modern simulation of Earth and are heavily reliant on technology to do just about everything for them. After centuries of living this way the humans have evolved into fat, lazy monsters that can't even walk anymore.The latest Pixar flick might only barely shine a light on the likes of 'Monsters Inc.' (2001) and 'Finding Nemo' (2003)  the main flaw of this film is that Wall-E keeps almost dying, we all know they wouldn't have the heart to kill him off - but otherwise it is an excellent recovery and a delight to watch. But who do we have to thank for it? Obviously the director Andrew Stanton, the story creator Pete Doctor and the screenplay writer Jim Reardon for coming up with the general imaginative concept of man's dominance leading to such a disaster  but who else? We do have Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight providing the occasional ""Wall-E!"" and ""Eve!"" from the two main characters, Jeff Garlin as the voice of the Captain and the celebrity voices Kathy Najimy, Sigourney Weaver, John Ratzenberger, Fred Willard and Macln Talk in brief cameos. But the real power behind the mesmerising characters  who are the main life source of this film  is definitely the animators, who usually don't get nearly as much credit as they deserve.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
An Early 21st Century Animated Feature,"WALL-E captivates the senses during the first 20 minutes as computer generated images of our future look and feel life like. A loneliness creeps in and engulfs the mind as WALL-E wheels his way around a decaying metropolis, in silence doing his job as a scrap recycler constructor. Many films in recent times have applied the spirit and machine together such as A.I., I Robot, 2001, and Aaron Lipstadt's obscure 1982 film Android. There may be a future in robotics as the Human population rises and our needs change. Investors look out.This Pixar/ Disney production is a wonder to view as we watch WALL-E pursue companionship in a space visitor, a Droid Robot named EVA sent to the barren earth to find plant life. The arrival of the spaceship as it descends upon the desolate city is beautiful and enjoyably felt. There is a Genesis feel to EVA's arrival as she represents Eve in the Garden and WALL-E is Adam. God even saw in a robot, loneliness. The discovered plant represents the fig leaf and the space ship is the Ark. Disney and Christianity have always been hand in hand.The second half of the film becomes more Disney as we meet the Inhabitants on the Spaceship. A sadness may come upon the mind as the inhabitants are a future generation of WALL-Mart consumers continuing the game deep in Space. The Earth was gobbled up and left a wasteland by corporate consumers apathetic to the world around them. Who will lead them without ego back to earth. WALL-E? No. Love. Just as Christ represents love. Disney takes the same old story and paints another unique and original piece of art.WALL-E seems to be telling us that the human race needs to come together and hold hands and save this planet. It aims at the next generation, today's 5 to 10 year olds who will always have the future of our planet on their minds.WALL-E is fun, entertaining, unusual, alarming and contains some amazing images of a computer generated reality. That right there is frightening as the same generation may be deceived in the future when they think they are looking at something real when its just Pixar tricking the consumer into consumption.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Charlie Chaplin is to cinema as WALL-E is to animation.,"Every once in a while something comes along that wows you in such a way it becomes an unforgettable experience upon first viewing. When a film or any piece of art leaves an ultimate stamp on your psyche, you can't help but smile with nostalgia and euphoric abandon. WALL-E achieves all that and more. With little to no dialog, the movie holds its own; even against ""Kung Fu Panda, and that's a film coming from Dreamworks of all things. Audiences will find a lot to love about this ingenious and charismatic robotic character with all his perks, quirks, mannerisms, all in a semi-realistic/sci-fi setting. I'm not a huge fan of CGI animated features but this one captivated me not because of it's originality, but also because the main character is a robot which most people have trouble sympathizing with, mainly because they're used to so many animated animals and people (though there are some humans in WALL-E). But the human characters don't overshadow the experience at all. Simply put a great film with terrific character development and a story so heartfelt and engrossing I'm sure it will make tons of money at the box office.Here's to Disney for bringing something new to the table. There may be some similarities in terms of appearance to Johnny 5 of ""Short Circuit"" fame but WALL-E is his own character and he's definitely more lovable than said automaton. Anyone who appreciates great film-making or animation with a dash of wholesome family entertainment should see this film. WALL-E is to animation as Charlie Chaplin is to cinema.

"The Date Movie of the Year, Not to Mention the Best Movie","There were so many ""aw"" moments that I couldn't actually believe Pixar made it possible to ""aw"" at a robot. But it did. Wall-E is the cutest robot I've seen. And he has so much personality. The romantic antics in the beginning with Eve, his robot friend, were so unbelievably human-like. And Eve is sort of like a hard-to-get woman in the beginning, which made me chuckle. This is definitely the movie that you want to see with your girlfriend / boyfriend, as you see the relationship build between Eve and Wall-E. It's a perfect movie to hold hands in (none of the yawning...). There are such beautifully put together ""romantic"" scenes, like that which you would see with real humans. And the end . . . well, I won't go there, but it was . . . amazing.And of course there are other levels of Pixar's genius that make this movie fantastic, as well. The basic idea of human nature, as humans naturally trend towards sedentary ways and reliance on robots. We see the garbage-trodden Earth beyond repair, we see the paradise of Axiom, we see the loss of hope, and we see the eternal nature of hope. There's always hope. That's what Wall-E says to me.But I'd just see this for Wall-E and Eve's romance. That's enough for me, to make me ""aw"" and laugh enough, to make this movie one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've had in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"A Masterpiece of Satire, Wonder, and Love","About a year ago I went to see Ratatouille at theaters with some of my friends. after the film I was reeling over how great it was and I was having to argue with myself on whether or not it was better than Toy Story...which I felt was the best animated film ever. That night I came to the conclusion that Ratatouille was better. Now I sit in a theater after seeing Wall-e and I'm having to figure out if this film is better than The Shawshank Redemption or Lawrence of Arabia. In short I was conflicted on whether or not Wall-e was the best film I'd ever seen...a question I'm still mulling over at this moment. Wall-e was a phenomenal film about the sense of wonder that comes with the great unknown, human kind in the future based on our life styles now and of course unlikely love. Wall-e had the ability to melt your heart within the first minute of the film and when EvE came in to the picture I was gone...I think I sat on the verge of tears throughout the entire film before shedding during the one particularly beautiful scene in the middle and sobbing by the films climactic end. Not only was it beautiful artistically driven film it was very VERY important. Its satire on Humans laziness and easy manipulation is the best I've seen since Brazil. This film belongs on the shelf next to other important films like Schindler's List and United 93...it is that important. But finally this film touched in me something I've not felt in such a long time...a sense of wonder. Wall-e is a dreamer and a hopeless romantic. He brings out the child in us all and that feeling that there is more than just this feeble existence, there is something more than just living out life...You need to look at the stars and delight in the company of the ones you love.Go see this film! It might be the most meaningful film to come out of Hollywood. Or you'll be like me and fall in love with these Wall-e and strive to dream of a brighter world beyond this one.I unashamedly give this film a 10...I've never done that before...this film is perfect.Also keep up the great work Pixar...you are pulling out films that others are afraid to create.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
An amazing cinematic achievement.,"I felt for certain that ""Wall-E"" would be the beginning of the end of Pixar's magic. After viewing ""Wall-E"", I should never have doubted Pixar's talents. Movies should not require A-list actors, senseless dialogue, or overly flashy and/or tacky CGI effects to be considered entertainment. A movie's value should be based on its story and presentation. In that, ""Wall-E"" succeeds - lightyears ahead of most of today's motion pictures.An animated film is not for everyone. There will be naysayers. But, ""Wall-E's"" storyline is so broad that it is truly an umbrella film, so to speak - science-fiction, romance, comedy, drama - genres to entertain most moviegoers. Most children will be able to understand and appreciate the characters' adventures; most adults will be able to take in the movie for its grandeur and for its message. The irony of the human/robot role reversal likely will not go lost on audiences, but ""Wall-E"" avoids becoming preachy in favor of developing ethos for the main characters. ""Wall-E"" does not necessarily tell a new story - sentient robots; we've all heard of or seen Kubrick's 2001 - but it brings something fresh to a story we've all heard before. (I still believe this to be Pixar's secret - finding new and amazing ways to tell old stories.) There are quite a few science-fiction references (including a humorous little homage to 2001 in the score) but they do not detract - a viewer really does not need to be a science-fiction fan to understand ""Wall-E"", but a science-fiction fan will appreciate the references. In addition to sci-fi references, there are many references to ""Hello, Dolly"", including the first ever live-action film in a Pixar film.The animation is absolutely lovely. It is at times difficult to remember that Wall-E is indeed an animated film. In keeping with the theme of the story, more realistic detail is given to the robots and their primary settings; in the humans' primary settings, the animation becomes almost cartoonish. The images of Earth are both stunning and horrifying - horrifying mostly because a world as such is not that difficult to imagine. ""Wall-E"" is full of minute detail that serves to enhance the reality of the experience.Yes, the dialogue is sparse. Robot-speak is, at times, difficult to understand. Thankfully, it is not excessive. The lack of dialogue adds weight to the film, as viewers won't need to struggle to keep up with an endless stream of words. This also means a viewer rarely has to worry about missing a line, or whispering to his or her companion ""what did he just say?"" ""Wall-E"" could still make its point with no dialogue whatsoever.Animated films are not everyone's cup of tea, but I urge everyone to give ""Wall-E"" a shot. It is a masterpiece of cinematography - Pixar's greatest achievement yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"Woweeee for ""Wall-E""","""Wall-E"" is ""by far out"" the best Pixar computer-animated film ever assembled. OK, it might sound fishy to you that I am selecting ""Wall-E"" over ""Finding Nemo"". You might think I am a rat in the kitchen by selecting ""Wall-E"" over ""Ratatouille"". You might think I am toying with you by selecting ""Wall-E"" over ""Toy Story 1 & 2"". You might think that I am incredibly deranged by selecting ""Wall-E"" over ""The Incredibles"". And you might think it is monstrous of me to select ""Wall-E"" over ""Monsters, Inc"". All the aforementioned are obviously credible computer-animated Pixar creations, but none of them captured the intellectual seismic force of ""Wall-E"". This earth trash shattering robot is definitely the most appealing character graphically drawn up by the Pixars. ""Wall-E"" stands for ""Waiting Amazingly Long Lines- Exasperatedly"", No! It actually stands for ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class"". Wall-E is a small waste collecting robot who is in a solitude futuristic earth with just a tiny pet cockroach to keep him company. However, Wall-E is not a total waste because he is very ingenious in doing the garbage work in a very compacting and useful manner. Wall-E is primarily a love robot who craves for the robotic touch of a Mrs. Roboto. Before you can say ""Hello Dolly"" (which is the film Wall-E constantly sees in his trashy apartment, lol) he falls for a female robotette named Eve which has traveled to earth to evaluate living organisms. Wall-E and Eve fall in love and then Wall-E eats a devilish apple which then (Wait! Wrong Eve story here). OK, here we go: Wall-E eventually follows Eve into a grandeur spaceship which takes him out of the earth-lands. In the second chapter of ""Wall-E"", the film turns into an insightful environmental lesson on the futuristic fate of our universe via Wall-E's hilarious, passionate, romantic, generous, and heroic ""space cadet"" spaceship adventures. Director Andrew Stanton brilliantly provides homage to Stanley Kubrick's classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by inserting elements of the Odyssey into ""Wall-E""; i.e. Blue Danube space, a similar HAL villain, the fate of mankind, etc. Somewhere in ""Stanton Island"" there is a Stanley Kubrick Memorial! There is not much dialogue in ""Wall-E"", but I must verbalize that it was the way to go in the ""Wall-E"" tale since it is Stanton's marvelous directorial orchestration that is the primary presentation tool of ""Wall-E"". It would be a waste if Stanton is not nominated for a Best Director Oscar nomination! ""Wall-E"" is the love guru that you should really be watching this summer! ""Wall-E"" will not be a waste of your time! One of the best films of 2008! I am not being off the wall when I say that ""Wall-E"" is so far one of the best films of 2008!

"Not a ""Kids' Movie"" (but in a good way)","This is the best original screenplay I've seen in a movie in quite a while.I am very discriminating when it comes to movie choices. This stems from an awareness of the power of film to shape our lives and a desire not to spend more time watching movies than I do processing and applying what I learn from them. All that to say, you need to see WALL-E.While Pixar has defined the summer family movie since Toy Story, WALL-E is their first film that eschews the need to be a ""kids movie"". As director Andrew Stanton put it, ""Animation is a medium, not a genre."" This is not to say that kids won't love the movie (it has plenty of visual excitement and hijinks to keep them entertained), but that for the first time, the story, characters, and themes of the film are designed primarily to appeal to an intelligent adult audience.From the opening credits, WALL-E proceeds to treat themes of apathy, isolation, consumerism, automation, stewardship, and love with more seriousness than most ""issue movies"" can muster, all the while wrapping the audience into the characters with genuine humor and creativity. It's too good at telling its story to be obsessed with its message.Stylistically, the film is a delight to anyone who loves the art of movie-making. While dazzling innovative, it draws on a variety of influences - science-fiction standards like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, and various dystopian films but also pulls from the insightful slapstic of Chaplin (notably Modern Times) and the bygone ideals of Hello Dolly! (The film relies heavily on the classic musical to humanize an otherwise bleak landscape). WALL-E further solidifies Pixar's well-deserved reputation as the benchmark for poignant, watchable American cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A Space Odyssey Animated Adaptation,"This will just be a quickie review since I only watched this film during a plane ride (but I was seated rather far from the screen). In the beginning, there were long stretches without dialogue when Wall-E was still on the barren earth. The action and my attention only picked up when the human form was finally seen on screen. And when we see the humans of that time, we see lazy obese creatures who could not even get up from their automatic car beds. This was really a funny yet disturbing view of a future where the computer all but takes over human thoughts and actions. I can clearly see the homage to ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" with the Master Computer and all. The message in the end to take care of our planet is universal and encouraging. The excellent quality of the film is very apparent despite the less than ideal way I was watching it. The romance between Wall-E and Eve, while obviously there, I must admit I did not really get all the nuances in this viewing. After all the plaudits I have read about Wall-E on this site, I really should get a DVD and watch this more carefully soon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"With the right mindset, this is a must see","I came here intending to write a glowing review of the best movie I've seen this year. However, as is my custom, I first read what others had to say. Since the movie was so good, I started reading the most negative comments first to gain perspective. I shouldn't have been surprised at what I saw, but it did take me back a bit. The majority of the negative comments turned out to be a referendum on environmental politics.That being the case, I suppose I should declare my views going in so others can fairly evaluate what I say in light of their own perceptions. I'm not ashamed to admit I try to live a very green life. I recycle, buy wind power, etc. I've been this way since long before environmentalism became a word or even fashionable (back then, I was simply considered a ""conservationist""). I am not, however, political. I promote environmental responsibility by actions rather than voting green (actually, I don't vote at all).If everything you see is filtered through right wing glasses, then you will not like this film. I'm sure Rush Limbaugh and the staff at Fox News aren't going to be fans. Like ""The Day After Tomorrow"", it exaggerates (how much is debatable) to make its point. If, on the other hand, you're a certified tree hugger or you see the world through left wing glasses, then you'll love it. If you fall in the middle, you'll find a sweet, charming, unabashedly sentimental story wrapped around a cautionary tale.When dealing with the non-human characters, ""Wall-E"" isn't a movie, it's a work of art - as good as any film ever made. It's incredible that Pixar has invested robots (and an insect) with such heart. The humans, by contrast are caricatures, but deliberately so. The only way I might recommend improving the movie would be to make the humans as realistic as the robots, but then that would rob the film of much of its humor. As you watch it, be on the lookout for references to other films. Some are obvious and some are more subtle, but they're all enjoyable.If you have, or can muster up, the innocence, this is a film you shouldn't miss. I haven't seen the films for the second half of the year, but for right now, I have to wonder whether a film can be nominated for both best picture and best animated feature in the same year? From today's perspective, I believe ""Wall-E"" deserves both.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A phenomenal achievement,"What draws us to a magical creature such as wall-e is anyone's guess. It could be his natural, care-free yet innocent nature that he displays unwittingly.I originally saw this film in the cinema as I was told by countless people to go and watch this particular masterpiece. I would nod and go 'alright', being a little unsure, particularly as this came out around the same time as The Dark Knight, much to its bad luck. However, I eventually dragged myself to watch the film and came out feeling somewhat overwhelmed.Whilst not complicated in it's plot, the film delivers something not many films achieve. Sincerity. Everything that was displayed on screen was there for a reason and pure and simple made it to be 'Art'.Pixar have once again created a creature that can relate and every single age can sympathise with. A beautiful display of love that seemed real and I believed every moment and every emotion they showed him to display. Even with Wall-E searching the rubbish near the start, it hints and makes you realise how lonely one would be in this environment and yet shows what everyone takes for granted somewhat. He is happy with his place which is all disrupted later in the film.A true masterpiece which will be sadly overlooked furthering the point of a wonderful year for film.

Another excellent film from Pixar,"As an example of the broad diversity of people this film can appeal to, the audience I watched this movie with consisted of elderly couples, rebellious ""emo"" teenagers, small children--essentially people who were different in every conceivable way, but similar in that they were all grinning broadly when the movie ended.The wide range of people in the audience can be related to the broadness of the film's appeal.

Almost like 2 stories, what happens before Wall-E's ascension and what happens after. Because of this, the master plot doesn't get revealed until late in the movie. Not necessarily a bad thing. Perhaps something for Wall-E 2.Truly a remarkable film, the best ever CG to date IMO",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Fantastic,"This movie blew me away. It is the best film made in the 21st century, and should be required viewing for earthlings of all ages. As an environmental film, it far surpasses ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" and the homage to ""2001 Space Odyssey"" is subtle and moving. And the music, glorious music! I will never look at ""Hello, Dolly"" in quite the same way again. I will never look at a plant quite the same way again. I will never look at material possessions and junk food quite the same way again, as well. WALL-E is a parable disguised as a children's film. But its message is literally universal and earth-shaking. I just saw it this afternoon, but already it has changed my life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
You really can't go wrong with Pixar...,"Maybe just maybe other Major Motion Picture Studios should take a look at the Pixar format of Movie Making. They take their time, develop a story with meaning, humor and create a captive audience.I have noticed that a Huge majority of the IMDb users are providing very positive feedback. Critics, believe it or not, are also giving it high marks. Finally! Now, granted it isn't a heavy dialog movie...come on it's about robots. Thank you Pixar for making the robots with realistic programing. What is lacked in dialog is made up for in expressions, sounds and character interactions.As an adult, I really enjoyed the film. There were several scenes that made me smile and laugh. The slightly extreme idea of what could potentially happen to Earth, how lazy, pampered and materialistic people can be is exaggerated in a way that kids can totally see that these traits are favorable. I think they get it, in their own way. The 6 or 7 kids that were sitting in front of me were completely sucked into the film.I can't wait to see what Pixar comes up with next!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar Does it Again!,"The year is 2700. WALL-E, a robot, spends every day doing what he was made for. But soon, he will discover what he was meant for.I have just finished seeing this film on the big screen and there's no exception here, Pixar has made another brilliant film! No, Wall-E is nothing short of what movies should be. What can I say about this film? What makes it so great? To start it off, there is barely any dialog in here. The first 30 minutes into the film has no dialog at all, yet the film manages to pull it off.The look of the film is very grand and visually extensive, no doubt. The animation is pitch perfect, like the rest of Pixar's previous films and this movie actually pulls off a great plot! And you know what I'm worried about? People will complain the movie is ""too preachy,"" while one critic already said it's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" for the kids. If you're one of those people, please don't be such a wimp and fuss about because there's a good moral message in here, along with an irresistible romance between the two protagonists, Wall-E and Eve.While it's really hard to decide which is the ""best Pixar film,"" Wall-E could be nominated. It's one of the more satisfying films I've seen in theater that was worth the money. I also found the movie touching and heart warming, as well as hilarious in some great comedic scenes. I also found the film awfully similar to ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" even though I have never seen it in my entire life. I guess that's a homage.As I ramble on with the movie I've just seen, let me finish this off by saying that this movie is worth your time and money. I find it the best film of this year, so far and I think it'll be hard to beat in the Oscars. The film is better for the adults than for the kids, if that's possible, but everyone at all ages should like it, unless they are cold-hearted.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
What a movie should be...,"I've rarely been impacted by a movie as much as Wall-E -- and considering that there's much less dialog in it than other movies I think it's a great credit to the people at Pixar. I felt a lot more for the little robotic guy than I ever have for Nicholas Cage or Liv Tyler, both of whom are supposedly human.Seriously this is an excellent movie -- it has all the elements that make good movies so enjoyable, and it also causes us to stop and think about what we're doing to our planet. With the constant pointless drivel that Hollywood keeps pumping out these days it's nice to see something that's not only halfway decent, but really top notch.I saw this one in the theater, on opening night, and it was one of the few times I've seen the majority of the audience applaud the film and then proceed to stay until the very end of the credits.Worth paying for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One mans rubbish is another robots treasure!,"For a film consisting of an animated cast of a junk collecting and compressing robot with the vocabulary consisting of three to five words and his best friend the shy of words cockroach this excels. Pixar have produced a beautiful version of a broken down abandoned, rubbish infested planet earth that does have visually stunning backdrops which wall-e wiz's around tidying and collecting fun human memorabilia. The film starts in amusing fashion and continues to impress when eve a device that looks like it was created by apple is sent down to earth to scan for signs of life by the remains of human life that live on a super ship unaware of what life on earth was once like, and hope to find signs that life us now sustainable so they can return. Wall-E falls for eve and trys in many comic scenes to win her attention. Once wall-e returns with eve to the space station uninvited with proof of life on earth the film suffers for the first time as characters get a little lost and Disney and Pixar try to teach us some moral lessons in that we need to take more responsibility for our own existence. The film ends really well in typical Pixar fashion robots teaming together fighting against an auto pilot and various other robots that don't want the humans to return to earth. This is a brilliant heartwarming film by Pixar that sits well with the likes of toy story in terms of trying new things and continuing to make us laugh in different ways.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
wow,"Wall-e is a great movie, entertaining in every respect. I saw it by chance last week, and I was overwhelmed. Its one of those movies that everyone can enjoy - kids, grandparents, everyone.I won't go into the details here as that would probably be a waste of time. But the best part for me is how the story unfolds and how you come to understand and see what is going on without any dialog to support it. That is the beauty of this film for me - the detective work that is required on the part of the viewer in lieu of any dialog (until later on in the movie). Us human beings are naturally curious creatures just as Wall-e is. Without dialog (which in most movies these days isn't worth squat anyway), that curiosity is intensified, and I for one really enjoyed the challenge here of deciphering messages encoded in body language, etc instead of being spoon fed a predictable plot. And it wasn't a predictable plot. By the time I started seeing the fat humans careening around the space station, I began to understand what was going on, and I knew the plant carried by Eve was an important part of the story. The rest of the plot then soon fell into place (along with some dialog now). When that happened, I smiled and felt very satisfied.Cute movie. Very fast paced (almost to the point of being dizzying). There is that familiar twist sometimes where the robots come across as more human than the humans. But more than just acting like humans, Wall-E and Eve were childlike. Their muteness combined with curiosity made perfect sense then as a small child is also mute and curious. And also, just like children, their lives were full of discovery and mischief. Neither were particularly ""self-aware"" meaning we do not know if they knew or understood who they really were nor what their place in the universe was. But they did understand emotions - love in particular. That ruled and the big picture - man's role in all of this as their creator and all - was not of much concern to them.So all of this I found refreshing and fun. I would really enjoy seeing this movie again. In addition to the story, we also had good music and some pretty cool visuals. And to anyone who would have rather replaced the ""too-cutsie"" love story with lots of action and violence - I say ""look, pal - take your pic among the hundreds of animated, fantasy and sci-fi movies that glorify action and violence, and then tell me we can't, FOR ONCE, focus instead on love and a positive message about mans place on this planet."" Thats all I gotta say -",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pretty insignificant,"I don't know why everyone says this movie is ""magical"" or a ""new plateau in animation"". It's not true. The movie is about an hour and 40 minutes long and doesn't get to the actual story until about the first 40 minutes. The story isn't anything incredible. The movie isn't very funny and overall I was bored after the first 10 minutes. I'm sixteen and love most animations such as The Incredibles, Over the Hedge, Shrek etc. Any of those movies deserve to be in IMDb's top way more than Wall-E. Sure the graphics in the movies are nice and highly textured and all, but there's more to animation than just looks, and Wall-E doesn't deliver. I've watched the other movies I've listed many times and always enjoy them, Wall-E was hard to enjoy the first time.It is very boring and not very entertaining. Wall-E may be cute but the overall movie is pretty bad. If you can watch it for free sure, give it a shot. Otherwise it's a waste of time and money.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar's Greatest Achievement,"This put simply is a stunning film. A triumph on every level imaginable. Animation to make your jaw drop (Pixar raising the bar once again) tied to a great story (ok the green message is a little preachy) with little to no wasted scenes and what we have here is arguably the greatest CG animated movie ever made and quite possibly one of the greatest animated movies of all times. It was very bold of Pixar to move away from their tried and trusted buddy movie formula, and even bolder to make a movie which is for the most part a silent film. The humans' only enter the third and weakest act of the movie and then probably draw away from the always captivating Wall-e and Eve. The simple premise of the movie is that of Wall-e a robot whose sole purpose is to clean up the mess of the earth they abandoned long ago. Wall-e has a fascination for all things human which we are not sure where this comes from? Is this the result of circuits malfunctioning of just a loneliness from apparently being the last working robot left on earth? All we see is Wall-e one relationship he has is with his pet cockroach. This in it's self could probably carry the movie, bit when you add the relationship Wall-e eventually strikes up with the Female robot sent on a mission to earth (Eve) you really do get cinema magic that captivated the whole of the cinema I saw the movie in, from adults to the full range of children. Andrew Stanton has at this point an impeccable record off delivering films of the highest quality and if he did not work under the Pixar umbrella would probably receive a more star billing that his output deserves. This is that one off. A movie for the ages pure brilliance. Oh and to top if of the short that accompanies is 'Presto' is brilliant as well. Pixar's homage to Loony Tunes reminds us of the crime that we get in not seeing those classics on TV anymore and have to put up with pony modern versions of them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The Definition of a Perfect Movie!,"This Animated masterpiece from genius Andrew Stanton is the best film i have had the pleasure of seeing that has was made during my lifetime. The themes and depth of this movie are inexplicable. After seeing this movie i could not get it out my mind. I am a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki and Howl's Moving Castle was my favorite animated film until Wall-E motored by with his cockroach friend. Pixar seems to have the right people in its team so that it can keep producing such superb entertainment. I hope to join that team later in life. This movie was really an inspiration to me. I think everyone in the world should see it, and i do hope that it will remain in the top ten movies list on this website for a long time. It really should be closer to the top, yes it's that good!

"""We'll clean up the mess while you're away""","The first forty minutes of Pixar's 'WALLE (2008)' comprise the most fascinating and skillfully-executed science-fiction story since well, it's been a long time. Alone on a near-lifeless Earth centuries after the evacuation of the human race, a lone garbage robot, the last of his kind, obediently continues to carry out his duties, compacting rubbish into solid cubes and piling them into lofty buildings. The sky is brown and dusty, smothered by the detritus of Mankind's wastefulness, and the garbage cities are often bombarded by stinging dirt storms that ravage the filthy landscape. But, thanks to WALLE (an acronym for ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth-class""), there is still life to be found on our planet's barren remains. As he goes about his day, our delightful little hero picks up any odd item that happens to catch his eye  a Rubik's cube, a plastic ""spork"", a light bulb, and, dearest to his heart, a battered VHS tape of Gene Kelly's 'Hello, Dolly! (1969),' which inspires the romantic in him.One day, WALLE befriends a lonesome and resilient cockroach, and the pair carry on with their job each day, even discovering a single, tiny plant growing in sterile soil. Then, one day, love comes erupting into this little robot's life. A slick, white (and female!) robotic probe named EVE (""Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator"") arrives on the planet in search of photosynthesising organisms, blasting any perceived threats with her trigger-happy plasma cannon. Needless to say, WALLE, however rusty his exterior, falls immediately in love with this beautiful feminine visitor, and what ensues is a genuinely-touching love story that serves as a charming amalgamation of Chaplin's 'City Lights (1931)' and Trumbull's 'Silent Running (1972).' Best of all, and very daringly for a children's film, this entire opening act unfolds with minimal dialogue, the two robots restricted to shrill buzzes and brief electronically-articulated utterances. Thus, their communication is almost exclusively through body language, and more meaning and emotion is recognised behind WALLE's deep, sincere eyes than is to be discerned from most real-life actors.Had Pixar sustained this level of brilliance for the remainder of the picture, I would have had little reservations in declaring 'WALLE' a masterpiece. However, for its final acts, the film descends slightly from the stratosphere of excellence, and eventually begins to acknowledge its human participants. After WALLE hitches a ride on a departing spaceship, he ends up at a distant space station named ""Axiom,"" where the surviving human civilisation, now hopelessly obese beyond belief, idles away their lives before computer screens, allowing machines to cater for their every need. This commentary on our increasing over-reliance on technology (and technology's inevitable revolt) has been done to death in science-fiction, comprising everything from '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)' to 'Alien (1979)' to 'I, Robot (2004).' In contrast to the deep, earthy colours of the earlier segment, here the colour palette is bright, vivid and almost migraine-inducing, the visual equivalent to being injected with an overdose with caffeine. These sequences work to a degree, but the human characters are ill-defined, and so all we really care about is WALLE.This being Pixar, of course, the film contains countless minute details that will thrill parents who are observant enough to catch them. There's the mutinous HAL-like ship computer, that nostalgic Mac start-up chime whenever WALLE recharges, the adorable cleaning robot who feverishly scoots around the ship chasing foreign contaminants, the obligatory inclusion of both ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and ""The Blue Danube""; I was also amused to notice a brief snippet of D.W. Griffith's 'A Corner in Wheat (1909)' when the ship captain (Jeff Garlin) requests a definition for ""earth"" {this, I suppose, is how you distinguish the true film buffs from the fakers!}. Younger audiences will probably find the film's second half  with its zany colours, funny characters and chase sequences  to be more appetising, but perhaps the more mature among us will lament the passing of that lovely, wholesome innocence in WALLE and EVE's silent courtship, a style of art practically lost in time since the Little Tramp told his girl, ""Buck up - never say die. We'll get along.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Finally, a movie worth seeing!","My husband and I were just talking about how every time we have left the movie theater this year, we come out saying ""hmm, yeah it was okay"" or ""ehh, that was cute"".

I can honestly say that WALL-E is the best movie I've seen in a very long time.It was funny, sweet, touching, dramatic, etc. The animation is stunning and I noticed that even the musical score was beautiful. It is amazing to me that the animators were able to portray these robots and pieces of machinery with so much emotion - enough to make you fall in love with their characters.I won't say anymore, as I don't want to give anything away!

I felt like a child again....,"When I was six years old, I used to watch all the great Dysney classics such as Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. I remember those epic moments of the movie where something magical would happen, something that was truly unique. I would get butterflies in my stomach and I would feel like I was in the actual movie, sitting on the flying carpet next to Aladding and Jasmin. As time went by, this feeling went away. I grew up and children's movies evolved to become a bunch of 3D animals who were all played by celebrity voices. I had begun to move away from the children's movies and had moved on to more adult ones. It had come to a point where I would feel sick from just watching the trailer of Madagascar. And then..out of nowhere...came Wall-e.I went into the cinema with low expectations. I was hoping to have a couple of laughs and walk out with a mild satisfaction. But I got a LOT more. Wall-e brings back that magic I spoke about. That magic that made you want to watch the movie over and over again. I knew what was going to happen. I knew that there was going to be a happy ending. But I will not forget how much emotion I expressed in that movie theater. During the middle of the film, I began to feel strange, to feel a bit warm in my tummy. At first, I didn't really react, but then I noticed. I was that same feeling I used to have when I was a child. That same feeling!! I left the cinema with my mouth open. I couldn't not believe that I had just gone through. So that is why i'm sitting here writing this for you. Yes, the visuals are impressive and the story line is great. But the feeling of being six again is incomparable. I recommend this film to everyone. But I think that only those who remember the magic that Dysney gave us, will truly appreciate how great this movie is.Thank you Wall-e. Thank you for making me feel young and innocent again.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Little robot makes good,"Earth is overrun with trash. Thus a little rusty robot has his lovely task: packing rubbish from humans, who've departed to space, into skyscraper cubes. WALL-E is a ""he."" We just know. WALL stands for ""Waste Allocation"" something-or-other (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), but of course it reads as ""Wally."" Wally looks a little like ET. Has some of the sprightliness of R2D2. Wally's in the survivor situation of Will Smith in I Am Legend, but has no vicious enemies, only a cockroach pal that follows him around. But Wally is lonely. Wally is a lonely guy.Animations anthropomorphize animals (as did ancient fables and the seventeenth-century poet La Fontaine), then moved on to broomsticks and other objects, and machines. Do machines have souls? Do androids dream of electric sheep? Will artificial intelligence rule? Will we have to rip out Hal's brain? These are perennial sci-fi dilemmas.WALL-E is a robot love story. It's also a chilling if hopeful picture of humans exiled from a ruined planet and turned into consumer blobs wallowing in a space mall called ""Axiom."" This movie oscillates neatly between austere minimalism and cornball sweetness, with many Star Wars battles smashed together in between. It satisfies children and adults, but only by not quite fully satisfying either. That is still an accomplishment, the classic Shakespearean one of appealing to all levels of the audience.Two ways WALL-E is wondrous are in the dusty, weathered look of its Pixar earth landscapes which Wally himself partakes of; and the endless mechanical business, the tricks and gestures of creatures and objects in constant, precise, often witty motion. But the loud sweeping music spoils the initial loneliness. How lonely can you be with a full orchestra at your back? And there is a limit to how much you can care about a machine. Or should be. Still, this movie for all its emphasis on tricks and images scores some surprisingly cool and resonant ideas along the way.WALL-E is a triumph of the work ethic, the little guy who matters. He's also symbolic of the utilitarian, no nonsense life. When all else fails, when there's nothing but junk, he's there, sorting it. He throws away a diamond ring, but keeps the box: it looks useful. The movie also celebrates the baraka, the blessedness, of much-used humble objects that through human contact grow soulful and real. In his junk lair, where he sleeps (dreaming of electric sheep?), he plays a little piece of an old musical on a videotape, people dancing and happy, a couple singing of love. This is the kernel of humanity that's saved.But WALL-E's a lonely guy, and when EVA comes, he's smitten. EVA is sent from ""Axiom"" to see if photosynthesis has returned. She--we know it's a she--is everything WALL-E isn't. He's rusty and clunky and articulated. She's round and smooth and white and her parts float in the air. He is indestructible, or nearly so, but she is higher tech, and emits sudden, alarming explosions, powerful and alien--yet somehow feminine. These are lessons in sexual differentiation for kiddies.For adults are the bloated helpless future humans we see when EVA is returned to space and WALL-E sneaks aboard and follows her. The finale is simple and schematic--it's a letdown, despite the fun, comic reference to 2001, and the way Aliens is evoked by using Sigourney Weaver's voice for the malevolent controlling computer of ""Axiom."" Are we the prisoners of our own device? Even when it disappoints, WALL-E is thought-provoking. The little robots are real charmers, and there have been many ingenious delights along the way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

WALL E set for a mature Audience.,"Plot: A lonely robot named WallE is the only thing living on earth with a cock roach as his only friend. WallE is doing his job which is cleaning up trash and compacting it, and also collecting random materials he thinks is important. Thinking there is something more out there and that he is missing something. Then out of the blue a futuristic robot named E.V.E. resembles a crystal clean white IPod robot shows up with her own objectives. Which then leads to WallE going into space and beyond, and finds out he is more important then ever.My Spiel: I really don't want to give this movie away. This actually is a touching story of how we might see are self's (Human Race) in the future, and how all might have been lost without the help of a little old robot to show us. From a animation/story stand point this movie is a step above about anything else Pixar has come out with. I really liked the position/style of how you honestly felt sorry for these robots with human emotions. Something the people at Pixar do a great job of making you fall in love with their characters (Cars, Monsters, and Fish). I truly urge any one to see this movie, but I honestly believe this story is set for the adult age, granted it has all the children elements, but there were 3 little girl's in the theater when I saw this and they spent most of the time running around and out of hearing distance, and obviously lost attention in this movie. But don't let that scare you away from seeing this, WallE is a great movie for a person like me if it makes children leave and not bother you is A's in my book! But fear not this movie really had a tremendous story that was much greater then just one character, which was truly amazing and had something I could completely get behind!

It also has enough genuine emotion and entertaining moments that are told visually, without being ruined by corny dialog. This could have even worked as a silent film because the storytelling so effective.I went to see this without much expectation other than some cool looking animation, and left stunned!

Wall-E is a lonely, clumsy robot who spends his day cleaning up the trash that the now-in-space humans left behind and watching a video tape of ""Hello, Dolly."" However, his loneliness ends when he meets a more advanced robot called EVE and falls in love with her. Her arrival on Earth leads to a series of events that involve both her and Wall-E being blasted into space to the spaceship humans are now living in.The film takes a huge risk by having very little dialogue throughout, but it most certainly manages to pull it off. Wall-E and other robots communicate through beeps created by Star Wars sound designer Ben Burtt. Each robot has its own personality like Wall-E is clumsy and provides most of the humour for the film while EVE is more serious.There is a lot of humour in Wall-E and it genuinely had me laughing many times throughout. The (sadly HUGELY over-used on TV) clip of Wall-E searching through trash managed to get everyone in the audience laughing. Also, the scene in which Walle-E gets cleaned on the spaceship is absolutely hilarious. There are loads of comedies out there that can get a couple of laughs but are altogether not that funny, but Wall-E is amazingly funny and one of the funniest films I've seen.I found myself getting emotionally involved with Wall-E right from the beginning of the film. It managed to make me feel sorry for Wall-E's loneliness and - I don't want to give it away - I was on the verge of tears near the end. Unlike many other movies, Wall-E doesn't fail to strike an emotional response from the audience.Some people have said that Wall-E is the best film Pixar have produced. I can't really comment on this because I haven't seen Cars or Ratatouille, but from the ones I have seen it is for me. None of the other Pixar films got me so emotionally involved or made me laugh as much as Wall-E.Wall-E is an animated masterpiece and incredibly funny. I give it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Goodie,One of those heart warming animation movies the whole family can watch together and have some fun. WALL-E is one of those examples that you can make movies suited and entertaining for all ages. Not as strong as Inside Out but almost and nonetheless a good choice to spend a Sunday afternoon. More cute than Mini-Yoda.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
BORING AS HELL,"I was born in 2005 and I have 2 memories of the year 2008. One of which is when I when I busted my eyelid and being physically restrained while the doctors gave me stitches, and the other memory is when I watched WALL-E. Both experiences are equally painful as they are memorable. WALL-E may be a good movie, but I will never watch it again because of how unfathomably bored I felt watching it in theaters. I get that it's supposed to have a great message and statement, but oh my god watching it as a 3 year old felt like an eternity. This movie is supposed to be for kids, but it's not fun at all. 1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
My Favorite Love Story,"Pixar can do no wrong.It's been more than two weeks since I first saw Wall-E and in that time there is not a day goes by that my mind turns to this brilliant film. There are sequences that are so well done they approach the sublime, especially between the two main robots. Wall-E's journey to hold EVE's hand is one of the most romantic portrayals that I have ever seen.The soundtrack is a wonderful work of texture by Thomas Newman.Is there flaws? Yes, every film has them. The humans occasionally feel out of place, both the live actors and CG versions. John Ratzenberger's character had an unnecessary amount of dialog. Though to be honest I think they only look bad because in contrast the robot animation is so spectacular.The best Pixar film yet, and a Romance that will last to the end of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Love and Hope,"I've been a loyal Pixar fan since the Toy Story I days. WallE was the first Pixar movie I wasn't excited to see. For some reasons the trailer just didn't have ""it"". Nonetheless for my bombarded-by-TV-commercials sons this movie was a summer must see. So out we went tonight.My expectations were low. By the end of the night, I had to say this was so far the most brilliant Pixar work. The film starts with a little lonely rusty robot named WallE in a world hardly recognizable. Unlike the other Pixar movies with breathtakingly beautiful sceneries of the ocean, Paris or the Arizona canyons, the first half of ""WallE"" plays out in a brown, desolate, lifeless city (seems rather LA like). Other than a little grasshopper WallE is the only being on the planet. He continues his old job of cleaning trash, with which the earth is covered, while finding objects to amuse himself such as an old video cassette, a magic cube or an IPod (cute tribute to Pixar founder Steve Jobs). One day, a beautiful robot girl named Eve blasts in from outer space. She's the opposite of WallE - clean, sleek and all powerful. WallE falls instantly in love with her.To win Eve's love, WallE tries all kinds of tricks to please her. One day he finds a tiny plant, a ray of magnificent green in the sea of dirt and metals. Eve's reaction is anything but predictable. The story takes a new turn from here. To follow his heart, WallE ventures into Eve's world - a giant space ship with some human descended from people on a space cruise 700 years ago.This movie is charming, witty and heartwarming. It is undeniably political though, even by the usually left leaning Hollywood standards. If the well served ever obese human crew is a subtle reference to the all consuming indulgent modern Americans, the evil B&L CEO's speech is directly quoted from the famous Bush ""stay the course"" ones. While children are enjoying the stories and actions, their parents undoubtedly feel chills down their spines. The most recent space pictures show mother earth is turning rapidly brown. If we keep hiding our heads like ostriches, the scenes in the movie aren't all that far fetched.Still, this is a Disney movie for children. The ending gives us tremendous hope and satisfaction. The movie credits are meshed with pictures mimicking ancient Egypt, Rome and Van Gough paintings, reminding us that we've come a long way to build our civilization. Let's save it for our children.As I walked out of the movie theater, I noticed much of the audience was adults without companies of children. This by itself was a very hopeful scene.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Open your mind, open your senses... Wall-E is Masterful (a letter from Indonesia)","I rarely rate a movie 10. Because I never seen a movie that worth the 10. But Wall-E change it. I gotta say, this is NOT everyone's favorite movie. Especially in my country, Indonesia where a lot of people chose to watch awful horror movie, an adventure Mummy movie, and an 'adult' comedy. It just so sad when I saw a lot of people didn't go to see Wall-E. They miss an achievement in cinematic experience. But what makes me even sadder, is the fact that a LOT of people didn't get the movie. They said it was boring, stupid, weird, etc etc. Well... I gotta say (and I rarely say something like this...) they have the worst taste in the movie.Wall-E (the movie) is the example how you can see an ART form in front of you, moving with the most poignant and beautiful story ever told. The execution was flawless, the editing, even the cinematography is the best I've seen in the movie for a long long time. The screenplay was beautifully done. The last movie with the best screenplay I've ever seen is last year's No Country For Old Man. Wall-E is on the same level if not better.It's not 'only' animated movie. It's a love story / science fiction / adventure / drama / comedy movie that so good you won't GET all of it at the first viewing. You HAVE to watch it again and again. And believe me, every time you watch it you'll got something new from it.Pixar IS the best film studio out there. And I can't jealous enough for the Americans to have one of the best film studio. I really hope my Indonesian fellow could learn from Wall-E, how do Pixar crafted such a perfect characters. How they can makes us understand everything that the characters said without a words.Wall-E is a 10. This is a movie specially made for you, IF you loved movie, IF you understand what art really is, IF you are mature enough to digest something as complex as this, than Wall-E is for you.But if you're looking for sex, stupid chasing scene, hot girls, brainless entertainment, it's NOT for you...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Could very well be a contender for The Top 10 Films of the Decade.,"Truth be told, I left the cinema speechless. Pixar has truly done it again. How, I ask you, HOW, can a simple yet absurd tale of a robot that falls in love be fantastic? Which brings me to the liberty of writing this review about how this became humanely possible, and is pulled off brilliantly.What if mankind had to leave Earth, and somebody forgot to turn the last robot off? After hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for, WALL·E (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers a new purpose in life (besides collecting knick-knacks) when he meets a sleek search robot named EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). EVE comes to realize that WALL·E has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, and races back to space to report her findings to the humans (who have been eagerly awaiting word that it is safe to return home). Meanwhile, WALL·E chases EVE across the galaxy and sets an adventure into motion.If there is something to love about the film, it is the main characters WALL·E and EVE. The two are astonishingly lovable, adorable, and without a doubt appealing. The chemistry between them is just gorgeous, and will make you believe that robots can actually fall in love. Without hesitation, dating couples should see this film for this reason alone. No really, I mean it. The two characters are personified and makes them more human than any of us could believe.What works for the two protagonists is that there is little, if none, traces of dialogue between them, so they communicate via means of body language, and it is executed perfectly. Because of this trait, we are able to understand their profound feelings towards each other, making them two of the most genuine and everlasting characters you'll ever see in media history. There are also some other robots to watch, and a cameo appearance by Sigourney Weaver (of ""Alien"") as the Axiom's computer.The animation is fluid, clear, and beautiful. From the wastelands of (possible) future Earth, to the vast infinite borders of space to the bright and lively display of the Axiom, the drawings are unbelievably beautiful and realistic. The Pixar team and director Andrew Stanton really gave their all and determination to brush their vision across the big screen. All I can say is, their hard effort paid off in more than full.The moral message is also clear - 700 years in the future we have polluted Earth to such an extent we have to live in outer space, the final frontier. As a result of relying too heavily on machinery, human evolution has resulted in the decrease of bone mass, making them obese and literally couch potatoes. This is a nice and not too harrowing reminder of the possibilities and consequences of polluting the Earth and relying heavily on machines too much.With its lovable characters, beautiful art, and majestic scale, I crown WALL·E the king of animated features thus far, as well as one of the best romantic tales of the era. Seriously. Do yourselves a favor and watch this piece of art. It's one not to be missed by men, women, children (and robots) alike.9.9996/10Delton",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Cute, one of the bests","Wall-E, the anime adaptation of the beloved Pixar classic, has left me utterly enchanted with its imaginative take on a post-apocalyptic Earth. With a rating of 8/10, it's safe to say I adored this masterpiece. The way the anime retains the heart and soul of the original while infusing it with its own unique charm is nothing short of astonishing. Wall-E's endearing quirks and EVE's graceful beauty shine through in this format, reminding me once again why I fell in love with this story. The animation is a visual delight, breathing new life into the familiar landscapes, and the subtle nuances in character expressions add depth to their emotions.

Pixar's finest so far.,"Wall.E is a little robot that works on planet earth. The human population has left to move into the stars, after the damage done to the environment by humans have left the planet inhospitable. Wall.E is the last of a series of robots that were left on earth to clean up the mess humanity has made of it. Over the years, he's developed a personality, and a curiosity about the things he finds, including an obsession with the movie Hello Dolly! It's due to this, that he's feeling lonely. When a spaceship arrives carrying another robot, Eve, who is here to investigate the planet, Wall.E sees the chance to make a friend. However, on the discovery of a single plant, Eve is taking back by her ship to space, and Wall.E, determined not to lose his new friend, hitches a ride....Pixar have hit a new high with this brilliant movie. The animation is absolutely stunning. However, as they've done in the past, Pixar have also carefully developed the story. Yes, the animation is brilliant, but Pixar have never lost sight of the fact that the story always come first. And here, while the story owes debts to 2001, and the movie Silent Running, it's well thought out and put together.Key to this movie however, are Wall.E himself and Eve. As the characters don't speak only make sounds, you hope that the personality of the robots shines through. And it does brilliantly. Wall.E's obsession with humanities' waste is funny. And, it has to be said, the so-called 'cute' look works well on both children and adults. The same applies to Eve. Most of her expressions are from the eyes only, but it works so well. The two together are on of the best movie couples on screen in years! When the movie moves out into space, we meet other robots, who are showing to have their own personalities, and we meet the humans. Due to time and thanks to robots to do everything for them, they have all become overweight and lazy. But Wall.E manages to accidentally reawaken the human population's spirit, resulting a confrontation between humans, and robots carrying out their programmed message, which recalls to a degree 2001 - without the serious tone! If there is a criticism to be made of Wall.E, and it is a minor one, it is that I think the movie may be a little over the heads of children. It's message about being good to the environment and being healthy, may be lost on them, but will certainly be picked up by adults. Having said that, children will never be bored by the movie, again thanks to the character of Wall.E himself, who is funny.This is a wonderful movie and personally my favourite Pixar movie so far. Oh and as a bonus, you get another wonderful short at the beginning. Get there early for it. It is fantastic!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Yep.  Me too.  Great.,"If I disagreed with the trend, I would say so. But I don't. This is a fine film, a worthy addition to Pixar's list of winners.It always looks gorgeous, even when portraying the rubbishy desolation of the ruined Earth. There are moments of humour, suspense, romance (honestly!) and pathos as it tells a story which always holds your interest. The story carries a worthwhile message, and doesn't beat you over the head with it.But most of all, this film is notable for the way the character of Wall-E is the most human character seen on the big screen this summer. A metal box with caterpillar tracks and a pair of binoculars on top almost instantly becomes someone you care for. I went with friends and, near the end - you know the place I mean - 6-year old Daisy started snuffling. And I'm not ashamed to say that I wasn't far off myself.A lovely film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar has Struck Gold Again; Don't miss this movie!,"Pixar evidently is a gold factory. It seems that everything they have touched has not only been a huge commercial success, but also have been consistently high-quality films, both in animation quality as well as the movie itself. Sure, some aren't as good as others - but for every Cars, there's a Finding Nemo. Don't like Monsters, Inc? Watch The Incredibles. Ratatouille should have received a nod for Best Picture, in my opinion... Instead Pixar seems to just own the Best Animated Feature category at the Academy Awards, which arguably means that it's productions (despite being some of the best-received and highest grossing films of the year) might not get proper attention for best picture. After all, Ratatouille was the best reviewed movie of 2007 and the 7th best reviewed movie of all time.But there's increasing competition for animated films; Dreamworks seems to be the primary competitor, with Blue Sky Studios also throwing in Ice Age. With the release of WALLE, Pixar evidently just wants to show up these competitors.So Pixar goes oldschool. Not only do they throw their trademark level of detail into everything, but they start removing everything but the kitchen sink. Dialogue? Who uses that as a crutch in a movie? Of the only 8 credited voices in the film, one of them is a text-to- speech program for Macs and the title character's voice was manufactured.Yeah, that's right: Pixar only used 6 human voices for their film, and kept the first half almost entirely silent.What else do those horrible competitors use in animation? Oh yeah, faces. What sort of amateur actually uses facial animation just to get over the computerized medium? So gone are noses, mouths, cheeks, dimples, smiles. WALLE gets eyes.And by the end of the movie you are emotionally attached to WALLE, so they did it. No other company in the world could have done this. Pixar is the best, bar none, and nobody is even close.So Pixar bragging aside, how is the actual movie?The first half is physical comedy that would fit in to the era of silent films. WALLE is the last working robot on an Earth abandoned to trash; all humans have long ago left, having reduced the planet to uninhabitability. Not that all is lost; they've left a fleet of robots to clean it up, taking only a scheduled 5 years.Unfortunately they've all broken, save for one, and have only added to the trash-metropolis. Humans evidently haven't bothered to return to try to fix anything in over 700 years.So you have one trash-compactor of a robot, and a cockroach. A good 15 minutes of this, and it's hilarious. Then another robot arrives, and instantly there is a 50% increase in the number of characters.Without ruining the story, WALLE is lonely and falls in love with the new robot, EVE. The actual plot doesn't start to take shape until around 40 minutes in, and it's arguably fairly weak. The events are connected, but there's no strong unifying happening that drives a thesis of the movie.Some people won't like this, but really, most people will enjoy it. In a movie with so many environmental overtones, it serves to save the film from preachy-ness, and instead focus it on a confused, lonely, lovestruck robot named WALLE. In many ways this is good; the story is first and foremost a love story about the last robot. The producer has stated that it is not intended to really be a political message, but if you want to have the last robot on earth you kind of have to reason the humans off it first.Of course, there is something at least a little bit ironic within: A movie that shows the dangers of over-commercialism, branded by Disney, with a character designed by Jonathan I've, head of Apple Design, and where they gave midnight viewers plastic WALLE watches as a promo.And beyond that, it depicts humans have become so lazy, they don't actually walk or interact with each other face-to-face. Remember you'll be in a movie theater, sitting in a chair for two hours, not talking to people next to you.Some may find the setting to be a little stingingly-sarcastic. The first part of the movie is brilliant, and when the humans enter it it loses some of its charm. But the movie is brilliant, funny, entertaining, and endearing.Others have loved it as well: It is currently (according to Metacritic) the 15th best reviewed movie of all time, 2nd best this year, and the 3rd best movie this year isn't even in the top 100. WALLE is also the highest user-reviewed movie of the year, taking 20th place here on IMDb (With Iron Man taking 2008's second place at 162).It is easy for me to say: This is one of the best movies of the year this far (if not the best) and people overwhelmingly agree. There will be zero contest for animated picture and (while I doubt it will happen due to WALLE's unconventional nature) it probably will deserve a nod for best picture nominee.Bottom line: Don't let its G rating fool you: This movie is great for everyone. It's worth seeing in the theaters and worth your time and money. Pixar has done it again, and you won't see a movie this unique all year long. Don't miss this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
What else could you want in a movie?,"Seeing the teaser trailer for this movie, I was highly disappointed in Pixar.

A cute story, with adorable robots and a lot of heart. It's great for the entire family (I'm essentially an adult, and I love this movie!).If you're a fan of Disney/Pixar as well, you will not be disappointed.

Speechless,"I saw this movie over a month after it came out. My mom, my sister, her friend, and me were the only people in the whole theater. We had the whole theater to ourselves and I have to say that this movie was incredible. The animation is stunning, the soundtrack is pleasing, and the acting is top-notch. The first 30 minutes of the film has no dialogue at all, only sounds, beeps, etc. However, the film doesn't even need dialogue to tell you how the characters feel. This is all achieved by body language and the sounds they make. Pure amazement. This film is definitely at the top with other Pixar movies, like Toy Story, The Incredibles, and Finding Nemo. It isn't only one of the best movies of the summer, or year, but all time. This will definitely go down in movie history. Even if you are not a child or don't have any kids, you will still enjoy this movie. Just because it is animated doesn't mean it is a children's film. If you are a Pixar fan you will love it even more. It towers over the 2006 film Cars, which is a failure in my opinion. You should definitely see this movie. Pixar has mastered the realms of living toys, bugs, monsters, fish, super heroes, rats, and now robots. This film is worth your money. If you don't get a chance to see it in theaters, buy it when it comes out. It is worth your money.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Ecology surrounding a rather unusual romance,"Wall-E is a romance set 700 years in the future between two robots that at first seem very different, but circumstances make them realize how similar they are. The film contains a good ecological message about the correct use and disposal of garbage worldwide, but also other references to physical and social health.The script contains very few dialogues and at times the pace is quite slow, falling into an almost silent monotony that borders on boredom. The most active moments of the film have white humor, a bit of adventure and a rather unusual romance.The animation is good for 2008, although certain things didn't age well.Generally speaking, the film is entertaining and carries a valuable message for the young generation. Although it has more good things than bad, I don't think it's the masterpiece that many people claim, but the truth is that it is above average.Recommended for the whole family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Ironic Beauty,"Wall-E is one of those motion pictures that are advertised to death and raped by toy makers in order to gross mass amounts of profits and cooperate dollars, but still deep within the foundations of the film lies a message that is still as important as it is hidden. Of course Wall-E is in essence a kids movie, the cute lil robot all alone on earth who falls in love with an ipod/ sleek female robot, EVE. During the course of Wall-E's adventure all he is really trying to do is hold EVE's hand. Its heart warming to a boiling point and will make anyone feel good inside. In animation is unsurpassed and generally superb, the voice acting is very well done (there isn't a huge amount of dialouge spoken, mostly by various different robots saying either the other robots name or their own)and it is sure to delight both children, the parents and pretty much everyone who gives it a chance. Its very unlikely you will hear bad things about this movie from any person who watches it. Now back to the movies core message, which is that of global warming, over consumerism and cooperate evil. As the title of my review says, i find this extremely ironic seeing as it is Disney that has released the movie on the world, as they are in many instances the evilest of cooperations exploiting both child labour, cheap labour and profit chasing. The over all feel of this from a studio point of view is that Pixar are now able to pull away from the Disney label and become independent and that they are now un-afried to make a movie that points the finger at its main supporter. I love each and ever Disney/Pixar movie that has been realised and am eager to see what Pixar will offer the movie going public once the inevitable split from Disney comes and they can really go to town without holding back due to the evil company that they have to make money for. Disney now faces a problem, Pixar movies gross more then any independent movie it can produce, (with exception to ""favour of the month"" High School Musical and Hannah Montana, another example of that if you stick a picture on a cheaply produce piece of merchandise, the masses will buy it) Overall i love this movie, i thought it was awesome and have recommended it to more then a few people.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"An unbelievable achievement, but not as much as its being made out to be","Wall-E is without a doubt, a masterpiece of animation. The story that holds it in place is credible, heart-warming. Attention to detail is impeccable, it is probably one of the best animated movies I have ever seen, if not THE best. I have to add however, that it is not what it is being made out to be. It is a brilliant animated movie, with an inherent message and its heart in the right place, but a Rank 9 on the top 250? I don't think so. It takes more for a movie to be an all round ground breaker, be it direction like Pulp Fiction, acting performances like the Godfather and so on. Having said that, this movie cannot be missed, it is by far, the best movie this year, till date.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Believe the ratings: this is the best Pixar yet.,"I was amazed by WALL-E. Not only was it adorable (as Pixar films always are), it had a deeper message than I expected. It also featured a sweet love story between two adorable robots. WALL-E features gorgeous animation, lovable characters (well, the robots anyway), and is a film that can be enjoyed for numerous reasons by people of all ages.WALL-E begins with a look into the terribly polluted Earth. We watch Wall-E, an outdated robot designed to clean up the mess, and his insect friend as they go about their daily, lonely business. We learn that Earth became so polluted that a world leader sent every human into a space ship for a five year ""cruise"" as the robots cleaned up the planet. One day, Wall-E discovers a newer, more advanced robot. Her name is Eve. The two robots develop a relationship. But when Eve discovers plant life, she is forced to return to her spaceship as she was given a ""directive."" We then follow Wall-E as he tries to go with Eve and we discover some distasteful things about the planet along the way.WALL-E is easily one of the best films of the year. It has now topped my list, beating The Dark Knight for first place right now. There are many elements that make WALL-E great. The characters are sympathetic, the message is simple but important, and it features brilliant animation. There's not a lot of talking throughout the film, but this hardly weakens it. If anything, we're better able to capture the loneliness that Wall-E suffers on a regular basis because of it. WALL-E can be enjoyed by everyone: children will love the cute robots, adolescents will be amused by certain quirks, and more mature viewers can appreciate the message presented. WALL-E is getting a lot of praise as being one of the best Pixar films and this is definitely deserved. This is a film that will stand up with the best of them.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A lazy storytelling choice mars an otherwise delightful film.,"The first hour or so of this film is some of the best pure cinema on the aughts. WALL-E and EVE are fully drawn characters with more personality than a lot of human characters. The same holds true for supporting characters like M-O and the cockroach. The basic why on the state of the world is told through demonstration and implication. There's very little dialogue-almost all incidental-present. The plotting, animation, direction and sounds are strong enough to convey the information. This brilliant quality of pure cinema exists anytime the story is entirely focused on EVE and WALL-E. Unfortunately, the film widens its focus to include human characters.The film is a critique on the dependence people can have on technology-and an eco-fable warning against excessive consumerism. The humans in the story are blinkered-alive but not living-consumption machines. WALL-E function in the story is to awaken humanity up from its slothful, gluttonous way. (As a Disney property this message is hypocritical.) This is conveyed in a ham fisted, utterly lazy and banal way. The humans are animated to be little more than large blobs of fat. My objection here is not that such a decision is offensive or plays into harmful stereotypes-one can argue that. But *my* problem is so simple and rote. The filmmakers used cultural stereotypes to avoid the hard work of *demonstrating* the theme. The first hour being so magical in the amount of information it conveys is greatly let down by the backhalf of the story being so artless, blunt with its points.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"WALL-E: Pixar's Most Ambitious Film, But Perhaps Derivative.","Wall-e is Pixar Animation Studios' 9th feature film under the Disney name and it takes a different approach than any film preceding it to telling it's story.The movie's story revolves and Wall-e, a garbage clean-up robot who, after cleaning up the human's trash on earth for 700 years, is joined on the desolate planet by a new robot named EVE, who arrives on earth to search for sustained life, which is the signal for humans to come home. While EVE stays on Earth, with Wall-e giving her a tour, the two form a very Disney, romantic relationship.Much has been made of Wall-e's dialog free execution of this romance, and it is true that the first 35 minutes of the picture is relatively dialog free. But there several brilliant techniques Pixar uses to communicate their relationship, such as their love of ""Hello Dolly"", and EVE's enjoyment in seeing Wall-e getting hurt.The film uses humor and simplicity to attract younger viewers, but I wonder if ""Wall-e"" is too simple. Much of the humor in the film is slapstick of Wall-e getting attacked, hit on the head or nearly getting destroyed, and it gets repetitive eventually.Also, for a film with a ""G"" rating, aimed at kids, I don't know if kids will understand the Eco-friendly message the movie ultimately provides.But still, its a satisfying, visually unbelievable film, and with fewer and fewer pictures these days made appropriate for all ages, it must see for families this summer.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Words are not needed to get your understanding!,"Times change and we know it, but being good will always be important. And to be good in this movie means being WALL-E. It's not always important to know what you're doing (although Andrew Stanton knows) it's sometimes important that you just do it and later it will be clear to you.The illustrations are phenomenal, the music is fun and keep concentration, the story is uncertain until the very end. It's like a robot version of the Charles Chaplin movies .Very refreshing and encouraging. Great job.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Bad,I have seen it to many times and it sucks overall. They could have made it really good but it is trash. We have to watch it in school for pointless reasons.,1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A crowning cinematic achievement,"First off, the animation itself is absolutely stunning. Pixar have perfected the craft of recreating realistic live-action photography in animation. Depth of field, out of focus objects, zooms  the look is spot-on. The animators also employ a wonderful colour palette, with enough variety and richness to keep things colourful and lively but also remaining very much rooted in reality. But really, the animators won me over right off the bat when, looking closely, I noticed tiny specs of dust floating around in the air during the opening scenes set around the garbage skyscrapers. With such a devoted attention to detail to make everything as realistic as possible, it's no surprise that Pixar are the leading studio for computer-animated films.But the truly incredible feat the film achieves in its animation is character design and animation. Going back to the traditions of Disney, the animators faced a tough challenge, which was giving characters emotion using as little gestures as possible. In this case, our protagonist is a box-shaped robot with treads and binoculars for eyes. But the amount of emotion and character this little box emanates is an astonishing testament to the animators: he's not just a cute-looking little robot, but a cute-looking little robot with a personality. Right from the opening shots of the film we are won over by WALL·E's cuteness and irresistible charm. He brings a little lunchbox with him to work in which he collects all sorts of trinkets and treasures from the endless sea of garbage covering our planet. He treads indifferently past a graveyard of hundreds of long-deactivated WALL·E units  the last of his kind. At home, it's his little pastimes that keep him happy: adding today's lunchbox content to the revolving shelves containing all his treasures, spending time with his little cockroach friend, watching his favourite movie, ""Hello, Dolly!"", on his iPod  after 700 years, imagine how many times he must have seen it.The film's true emotional punch, though, arrives along with its second main character, the heavenly robot EVE, who looks pretty much like something Apple would design 700 years in the future. On paper, two robots falling in love is a concept that shouldn't possibly work. It's quite mind-boggling then, and an incredible testament to director Andrew Stanton and the entire creative team really, that it works so exceptionally well in the film. It is difficult to use terms like this when it comes to robot characters, but the amount of human emotion displayed in this film is astonishing. If WALL·E wasn't cute enough based solely on his trinket-collecting antics, his robotic perfectionism and his film appreciation, then his shaky, nervous falling-in-love with EVE is absolutely heart melting. He's neurotic and shy and at first EVE doesn't seem to notice him, but eventually he wins her over and magic begins. I was nearing tears in the scene where WALL·E takes EVE home and excitedly shows her all of the things he's collected, climaxing with his rendition of a musical dance scene from ""Hello, Dolly!"" using a garbage can lid as a top hat  I just couldn't handle it, it was beguilingly adorable. Indeed, the risks and sacrifices these characters are willing to make for one another in the name of love are on such an epic scale, this film may go down in history as one of the great Romantic films.Then, there is the film's sci-fi aspect, underneath which hides a very strong cautionary message. The sci-fi concept of the formation of one giant corporation, which tailors to all of mankind's needs and services, eventually getting all of mankind on a perpetual vacation in a massive interstellar cruise ship while at the same time continuing the environmental destruction of our planet to the point where return to Earth is impossible, is very original and quite fascinating on its own. It certainly serves as an interesting contrast and a fresh approach to the usual dystopian, post-apocalyptic depiction of Earth we've been used to seeing lately. I loved how the movie didn't shove its environmental message down the audience's throats, but rather simply displayed a possible outcome of this path we are slowly going down without directly portraying that our current environmental conduct is what led to it.For many reasons, WALL·E is a crowning cinematic achievement and the peak of Pixar's output so far. It's entertaining, thrilling, tense and of course absolutely hilarious. It is a technological wonder and a landmark achievement in animation. It provides us with both food for the mind, with its powerful environmental, future of mankind message; and food for the heart, with its touching, charming, wondrous, beautiful story of two very different robots falling in love. The emotion, the characters, the drama, the humour, the technical execution  WALL·E excels in every possible field. And that it is animated, a genre in which producing shallow, simple material is extremely easy, makes it all the more special.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar now officially owns my soul,"I've been a die-hard Pixar fan for years. They spend an unbelievable amount of time and effort perfecting story, and it really pays off. I saw Ratatouille last year and, while it wasn't bad by any means, it just wasn't up to Pixar's unbelievably high standards. After seeing that film, I was left skeptical that Pixar could make up for it. Then I caught a glimpse of Pixar's 2008 feature film, Wall-E. With just a few seconds of the trailer, I was once again stricken with anticipation for what Pixar studios would bring. I found myself counting down the weeks until Wall.E's theatric release. When it was finally near, I was afraid that all my anticipation and hype would be in vain. The movie far surpassed anything I imagined.There's a gripping environmental message present in Wall-E, but this serves as a mere backdrop to the real center of the film, the love story. The love story, told from the perspective of two robots, is at once both timeless and new. It's especially moving because once again, Pixar has managed to imbue such human emotion in inhuman characters. There are times when you can practically see the emotions materialize on screen. Wall-E and EVE (the protagonists) are both ungodly cute, and their machine-made ""voices"" really add to that factor. This works so well in fact, that the various physical jokes in this film are actually... I didn't think it was possible... funny.As always, Pixar delivers on the visuals. Certain scenes (you'll know them when you see them) will cause every mouth in the theater to hang open. The soundtrack, composed by Thomas Newman, is epic and powerful. I highly recommend seeing this in a theater with a decent sound system because nothing compares to it. There are also a few other numbers, among them a Wall-E inspired song by Peter Gabriel and a couple of songs from Hello Dolly that actually fit really well in the context of the film.When Wall-E was over, I left the theater feeling fulfilled... at peace. It's now several weeks after seeing the film and it still lingers pleasantly in my mind. If Pixar keeps turning out masterpieces like this... I'll once again find myself counting down the weeks. I know I'm already excited about Up, Toy Story 3 and Newt.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
WALL-E : A Must Must Watch,"As the time progresses the machines are overtaking on human and replacing them in the area where we lack. While hatred over religion, race and colors is growing exponentially; the time has come to learn how to start love unconditionally from our WALL-E. If in one word I could describe WALL-E then it would only be ""Overwhelming joy"". A visual treat to watch with the characters so very mechanical yet so real that while watching you would like to be one of them. At least everyone would like to be so pure and genuine as WALL-E while they watch movie.Being alone and cast away is one hell of experience but even a small spark, a simple hope could give birth to that new and everlasting feeling to spend a lifetime as our beloved WALL-E goes through while he finds his hopes in EVE, a robot sent to earth for assessing if it is livable to the human species where the only two creatures staying currently are WALL-E and his cockroach friend, a blissful one.The storyline is set against the post-apocalyptic staggering climate, when the man made spectacular sky-scrapers of garbage awaiting for disposal, which shockingly remind us of true dilemmas of our time.In our world, while pollution, energy, and quality of life each make up an intimidating problematic in themselves, there is an underlying human tendency, a techno-savvy and chasing the comfort of lifetime which is shockingly mirrored in WALL-E's world. In this world, humans are saturated with information, over-connected through their internet devices, yet entirely unattached to themselves, each other, and the world around them, may be the future we are moving towards where the personal touch is only left with the remote control and to the mouse click, really shocking. But technology is in no way to be blamed. The robots are only built to service human needs, for their comfort. WALL-E reminds us creating a humane personality takes time, exploration, adversity, love, fascination, hurt, pain, sacrifice and a never-ending spirit of curiosity; the qualities which sets human apart from other living creatures on earth.I could not find enough words in my dictionary to praise the magnificent bit of art work put through by Pixar motion pictures; they are simply ""the best"". For the very first time I felt being short of that very hand which I would like to hold and watch the sunset while WALL-E sits next to EVE and tries viciously to hold her hand but couldn't succeed, to dance on a beautiful jazz piece toe to toe and hand to hand as WALL-E desired with EVE. I felt and went through all these emotions and I am sure everyone who was watching with me went through the same experience. I couldn't find a single moment while watching when I wasn't sad as WALL-E was or was overwhelmed as WALL-E was at that very moment. I looked the world and love through WALL-E's eyes and I must admit I had never seen life so beautiful and meaningful earlier. This is not a movie; it's an experience, of being loved, to love someone; which somehow is being getting erased from our lives. This movie isn't just an animation movie for children; it's a learning for all age groups.Next time when you tell someone ""don't be like a robot without feeling"" (Sometimes our Heroes in movies are called robot for their expressionless performance) ; please think of WALL-E and reconsider you statement. I now know that even machines have heart which bits for someone and everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Another Animation Classic...,"Lots of good things to talk about.First of all, realistic images... that I could not believe this is an animation film. Andrew Stanton has done it well again, like his earlier ones starting from Bugs Life. The memorable one being Finding Nemo. Wall-e couldn't just be an entertainment; may be due to the reason the plot lies in our irresponsible environmental attitude.The story. It's a love story and a science fiction told in animation. And it is beautifully told. It gets more interesting as the story unfolding with unexpected journeys into this endless universe. I wondered, in a century when even small kids turning into rigid hearts, this movie comes with a knock and says 'Hey..Think outside of you too'.I saw many people here sulking about the 'environmental warning' in the reviews. This story does not take a lesson to you about 'global warning'. It just has the story evolved from it. Worth of romance is not more than the fact ""we can't live safely anymore"".About the technique. It is very difficult to bring emotions like love, anger in a faceless, emotionless robot. In 'Cars' it was the headlights those make to eyes. Here Pixar guys found the way by drawing digital-eyes for Eva and robotic eyes for the face of Wall-e. Robots are made of metal faces; They don't change emotions. Here they overcome this restriction by changing the camera eyes of Wall-e and the eyes of Eva drawn in different digital shapes according to different emotions. My friend (an artiste) told they made the characters alive by giving jerks/bends and some flexibility in motion of the rigid robots. Tireless work behind this perfection is to be honoured. The robots talk with synthesized voice. How much emotion could be captured in a synthetic voice? The dialogs of the main characters are not much. They are simple sentences mostly single or double words. They made the emotions possible with these one or two word dialogs;poetically.And Imagination. Behind each and every scene I could see the imagination of the director probing into all directions and making it perfect and more interesting. The junk yard images of the New york city, the space, the robotic parts, its choice of movements, the wheels, the axiom space ship, people's life style there, characterization of Eva as a modern girlish robot and Wall-e as a old-styled male robot who gets love-at-first-sight. The initial no-dialog moments of the movie gives some meaning into the lonely-dry life of the Wall-e. As I try to make meanings out of this movie I keep on stumbling into new meanings. Are we living like the Axiom ship's captain?For kids, A definite watch. As the world nearing its end of prosperity and fertility, we let out such movies to at least have some awareness of where we are going.My best wishes to Andrew Stanton; Plus the artists crew who just moved us to live 700 years after.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A Futuristic Disney Animated Film,"This is a great animated film by Disney for all viewers to and enjoy. The crew did a fine job in creating this film.

The chemistry between the cast members was beyond great.This animated film by Disney reveals to viewers the importance and impact that the lives of everyone has on the world. My life has been defeated multiple times. In my lifetime, so many people have bullied and hated me. They have defeated that badly that my life has not made some kind of impact on the world. It really seems that all those people will have some sort of celebration when I stop living. I fear that will come true.

Awesome,"This...This is what movies are all about. I'm actually pretty speechless. The way Pixar has made all these animated characters come to life is miraculous. The feeling of loneliness and needing to feel love in Wall-E is a joy to watch. Sound design is absolutely awesome and Ben Burtt outdid himself with this one.Wall-E has a surprisingly sad story. The characters are great and full of life (Especially Wall-E who seems to spread life wherever he goes) but the backstory and Wall-E's loneliness make this film somewhat melancholy. The ending will drop a couple of tears from people, I know it did from me.This is the best movie I've seen this year. Tops all the basic blockbusters easily.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A movie you should check out!,"I remember watching this movie with my little siblings who loved it so much. My little brother in particular loved it so much he began to beg for all sorts of Wall-E toys! ^^ (We got him some, he still loves to play with it). My sister and I had a laugh a few times and they did feel sorry for poor Wall-E picking up all the trash. Although this movie did not have THAT much talking, my younger siblings did understand the main point. Its pretty touching movie for just about all ages and has a strong effect on people's views on the planet. Wall-E is such a sweet character! You just want to pick him up and hug him! Its a great movie on friendship. Its also quite creative; I don't always see cartoons or movies that children enjoy that are based around a robotic trash collector. Its a different movie to what I usually may end up watching. You don't need violence or all this horror stuff people usually watch to make this movie worth the time to watch. Its I think if you have not seen it already, you should try watch it if possible, perhaps with friends or family.

Even a real macho man will have a hard time to hold the tears back from time to time, I know I did. This is the first movie I've seen where I've felt ""Man, I have to buy this on Bluray"".Not only is it visually breath taking but the way the manage to move you with hardly any lines of dialog is brilliant, I didn't think any one could achieve something like that.

Ambitious and triumphant,"Pixar has one of the best reputations in movies today. They are known as a studio that does not make bad movies. All of Pixar's previous offerings are great movies in their own regards, but WALL-E is a masterpiece because of its ambition. WALL-E is among the greatest love stories, dystopian science fictions, dark comedies, and archetypical hero stories, all at once. None of these elements overpowers any other, nor does any fade into the background. WALL-E's success is in its balance. The film is so perfectly constructed that you walk out of the theater feeling as though it would be impossible to change a single thing about the movie.What WALL-E really does (and how it succeeds with so little dialogue) is that it boils down human expression and emotion to its most basic level. WALL-E and EVE's facial expressions and electronic beeps capture pure human emotion, untainted by words. As a result, absolutely nothing is overdone.And there's the greatness of it all: WALL-E is a movie about humanity, but its protagonist isn't even human. WALL-E shows us that makes us human is our ability to think and feel for ourselves. WALL-E is more human than the human characters in this movie because he has broken his routine of survival and has learned how to truly live.And while this notion is conveyed very clearly, it is not overdone. WALL-E does not overdo anything or beat the audience over the head with any of its themes. It captures the essence of all of its elements, rather than attempting to string them out too far.I can't remember the last time I walked out a movie theater without a single criticism, no matter how small. But even so, I found it hard to put into words exactly what made this movie great. The thing is, WALL-E taps into the essence of our humanity so deeply that we have trouble expounding upon what makes it great; we just know that it affects us. Maybe we should leave it untainted by words. WALL-E did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

One of the best animated films in recent years,"For adults and children alike, WALL-E is an absolute necessity. This is proof that Pixar is not losing their touch and still has the ability to make a beautifully animated, sweet, fun, socially relevant, and laugh-out-loud funny piece of visual storytelling.The story revolves around a small robot, a showtunes-obsessed and sentimental WALL-E unit, designed to clean up and organize the trash on the completely lifeless planet Earth hundreds of years in the future. His curiosity for life in the past leads him to discovering a lone plant specimen under a pile of trash. Soon enough, a robot unit from the stars falls to Earth to research and retrieve it and WALL-E finds himself partaking in a strange, intergalactic adventure that determines the future of planet Earth and mankind.All of the digital characters are immediately lovable, actually the robots more than their human counterparts (adding to the insightful but not condescending social commentary about a possible future for the human race) and there isn't a moment wasted on any of their screen time. The Pixar team has an unmistakably spot-on eye for great detail, humor, and just downright cuteness in virtually every scene. There's something for everyone: comedy, drama, action, science fiction, even romance. I'm a big fan of animation and cinema from all over the world and I sincerely think WALL-E stands out as possibly the best film of the year thus far. It's definitely a must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Johnny 5 would be very proud of his little bro.,"It's so clear. So painfully clear that Pixar Studios are making the absolute best movies out there. Each and every time I see a one of their new movies, I come out of it with such a happy and vibrant feeling. And with Wall-E, the results are the same. Maybe even more so.Wall-E is about a little trash compacting and collecting robot whose sole directive is to clean up Earth. And I'll tell you something, he's fantastic at his job. With his little cockroach pal at his side, the two are the only living and functioning things on planet Earth.One day while Wall-E's about to finish up work, a rocket ship lands, and out emerges an impressive little white robot whose purpose is to search for vegetation. What follows from their initial and humorous meetings is what great stories are made of.Wall-E is superb film-making and story-telling at the family level. Hell, it's fantastic on all levels. With humor, emotion and adventure ruling the day, this Pixar gem surely is a must-see film. I know these Pixar films may seem kiddie, but this is pure family gold.

Best Pixar Of All Time.,"To begin with, I had pretty high expectations for this movie. I tend to feel that way about Pixar movies, given their track record for great films. But this movie exceeded any expectations I have ever had for a movie by light-years! Every aspect is perfectly woven together. It is most certainly a love story, but it does touch on themes symbolizing economic/environmental things happening today. I mean come on, this movie has everything you need: robots, love, space, future. What more could you ask for? But seriously, the love story is my favorite part about the movie. The interaction between Wall-E & Eve is so great. I think Pixar was able to make me care more about the characters having so little dialog. Characters would then use more expressions, and the human imagination is wonderfully accurate at depicting these expressions. I want to say more about this movie, but I fear I am just rambling. But if you are planning to see a movie, and you aren't sure what to see, you absolutely MUST SEE THIS MOVIE! Every age group will appreciate this movie. Unless you are just someone who doesn't like movies because other people like it, heed my words, I guarantee that you will have a lot of trouble convincing yourself you don't like it.With all this being said, and with what others have said about this movie.

"Tender, Funny, Sweet!","One of the best movies I've seen lately! Every scene was so well crafted. The graphics of WALL-E on Earth are incredible. You can tell that Pixar THOUGHT about what they were creating, as opposed to just thinking about how to make a buck. Funny thing is, they are going to do just that. This is going to be a blockbuster! Instead of filling their movie with snappy, sassy or suggestive one-liners (as virtually every other movie company would have done) Pixar filled it with sweet and simple emotions, conveyed through tiny gestures, eye movements, sighs and vocals. There's virtually no dialogue whatsoever. Don't think for one moment you'll be bored with that, though. You'll be hoping WALL-E can win the girl (robot) and rooting for him all the way!

What wall-e told me,"Humans land a raw deal when it comes to animations. We upright, two- legged creatures regularly have to give way to the superior intelligence or endless fascination of a deer or a dog or a penguin. It's part of the bargain: we draw them, they make us look stupid. And so it is with 'Wall-E', except this time we have only ourselves to blame. Pixar has drawn inspiration for this bold, bleak and often very beautiful film from the worst approximations of the future we're shaping for our planet.In Pixar's last film, 'Ratatouille', it was a sewer rat who brilliantly grabbed our attention and revolutionised French cuisine. For 'Wall-E', humans again take a back seat, and it's a robot with a cube for a belly and binoculars for eyes who's bleeping for our love. When we do, finally, encounter humans – living on a self-sufficient spaceship, waited on by robots, sucking on straws – they're fat, sedentary, greedy and unpleasant.Plus ça change: from Cruella de Vil to our fellow folk in 'Happy Feet', cartoons have always held a mirror up to our selfish instincts.This time it's 2700, and we've polluted ourselves out of existence. The only humans left live a sterile, bloated life high above earth, where we decamp for the second, more frenetic and less inspired half of the film. But everything that comes before is magical. The only animate object left in the lifeless, rust-coloured, dusty landscape of urban desolation that we used to call earth is one tireless mechanical waste-collector called Wall-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth Class). He lives in a cluttered container and spends his days buzzing about, piling up junk to look like skyscrapers or Mayan temples and sucking up sun for his solar panels. His only company is a lonesome cockroach.So that's one robot, a cockroach and a vision of earth gone to pot. This is a cartoon that offers an uncompromising, imaginative, angry portrait of the future. It's daring in its simplicity: for the first 40 minutes, we watch in wonder as Wall-E goes about his business in near silence; it's the sharp intelligence of the detail, always so painstakingly rendered, that most amazes. At one point, Wall-E finds an abandoned diamond ring in a jewellery box. What does he do with it? He throws away the ring and plays with the hinges of the container. Of course he does: hinges should fascinate more than precious minerals. Shame on us for not realising that before.By rights, Wall-E shouldn't be cute in the Bambi or Dumbo sense of the word: he's battered and fading and the only noises he makes are computerised drawls not dissimilar to ET's limited lingo. But Wall-E is alluring, and not because he's got big eyes or dangling eyelashes but because he's smart, hard-working, with a romantic side, and is hopelessly addicted to watching clips of Michael Crawford and Barbra Streisand in Gene Kelly's 'Hello Dolly!' on a video screen. He's everything we should have been if we hadn't put all our energy into destroying the planet. But none of this is preachy or obvious.Environmental destruction is only the breathtaking backdrop to the film and it's more the minimalism of Wall-E's existence that fascinates. By the time a sleeker, feminine robot called Eve – who looks like an iPod shaped into a pepper-pot – arrives, we're craving her company in sympathy with our mechanised friend. Pixar has done it again. I wonder a little what kids will make of the long silence of the first half followed by the disorienting mania of the second, but there's nothing here that's not wonderfully imagined and lovingly presented.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The Best Movie Ever. Wall-e. Thanks Pixar.,"Wall-e , I have to say , the Best movie ever. Its story line , it's CGI animation and its characters Wall-e And Eve were the best ever. I enjoyed the movie so much , and no wonder the movie has received universal acclaim. I would regard this movie the best ever. I would really advise to watch this movie. It teaches and disciplines your children , I would also advise you to take your whole family with you to this movie.I've already watched this movie a few times , and I still want to watch it.Thanks Pixar.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Great Movie,"Pixar has yet again proved that they can do no wrong. I was there with my family, and it was the first time I had actually heard an entire audience clapping when the film ended. The only disappointing part of the whole thing was the runtime. I wish they had been able to do more, maybe flesh out the humans a bit (not that they needed it) or explore what had happened on earth and how the current situation had developed. Now for the positives. The characters were wonderful. They make the tiniest sound or move a little and you read their expressions perfectly. The robots were extremely real as characters. I personally think the fewer words worked, because it was easier to focus on the action. The animation is beyond belief. Every little bit of trash or random wall is a work of art. I really like the story (being big on post-apocalypse stuff) and there was never a time where I thought something was just filler. It's completely appropriate for kids (of course, there are a few small jokes, but it would go completely over their heads), but it's interesting for adults as well. Of my family, ages 54, 16, and 12 liked it, so it's pretty much good across the board.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Best Pixar Film EVER,"Imagine for a second a movie with barely any dialogue, about a lonely computer generated robot and his quest for love. Now how could a movie like that generate a 97% positive tomato reader on rottentomatoes.com? Or be number 20 on IMDb's top 250 movie list? Well, to find those answers you'll just have to see it for yourself. What you will find is one of the sweetest and funniest family films ever made. And the best Pixar film to date. What? Better than ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Toy Story"" you say? Oh yes, I wouldn't lie.""Wall E"" has a very simple yet effective plot about a cleaner droid left on earth to tidy up our very dirty planet while the humans go on a ""space cruise"". After many, many years Wall E is the only droid left and his only companion is a little bug. That is until an investigator droid named Eve comes and leads him on a grand adventure.Something about this movie really connected with me. Everything was so well done, like the film was made by ultra high strung perfectionists. The filmmakers convey a world of emotions from Wall E, yet all he ever says is ""Eeva!"" Sorry R2-D2, I have a new favorite robot. They have gotten so good at the CGI that everything looks like it's completely real. You will laugh so hard at parts that you might fall on the floor. Like a scene on an immaculate spaceship where Wall E makes a mess and an obsessive-compulsive robot throws a fit.And don't even get me started on the short film called ""Presto"" which opens the film. It's about a hungry little rabbit and his magician owner who refuses the poor bunny his carrot unless he does tricks. I will warn you not to partake of any popcorn during this short lest you want to choke and have to call an ambulance and miss the amazing movie.Pixar just keeps stepping it up movie after movie and they never fail to please and enchant with quality films that kids and adults alike will adore for ages. ""Wall E"" will go down as one of the greatest family films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Proof that a Pixar is worth a thousand words,"Wall-E, Pixar's newest blockbuster, is more than merely a feel-good summer flick with cute robots and a happy ending. Surprisingly, a whole lot more. Its message is both superb and sobering, a haunting and starkly beautiful view of one possible future. With graphics that do for earth, air, and space what ""Finding Nemo"" did for water, it is a visual delight for all ages. Wall-E, EVE, and their pet cockroach are unbelievably cute (even the roach). The storyline is clever, quick, and accessible at every level, from a fun space adventure to a hauntingly sad--yes, sad, at least at first--story of what humankind lost when we left earth. And also how we can find it again, through the help of one little machine who has learned how to love. But perhaps the most amazing part of this film is not the incredible graphics or the tight, heart-string-pulling plot.It is the complete lack of dialogue. With the exception of the few scenes featuring humans, the movie is carried out by showing, not telling. The titular character Wall-E and the love of his life, EVE, ""speak"" each other's names, but little else; the only humanizing sounds present in the first fifteen minutes of the movie come from a recording that Wall-E plays to keep himself company. His loneliness is palpable and heartrending in the extreme.And he doesn't have to say so. The folks at Pixar have outdone themselves here; Wall-E's message is not shoved down our throats, but is both subtle and poignant. Something about this little machine embodies what it means to be human: to long for companionship and something beyond what we can see. The fact that the film can create such an emotional 3-D-ness about Wall-E without the need for words is truly proof of Pixar's genius. Such a tactic could have failed utterly, but here it succeeds in brilliantly transforming a good film about cute robots into an amazing visual and aural feast. Ratatouille's Remy would be jealous.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
it's a rare thing nowadays...,"Pure emotions put on screen!!! That's a rare thing nowadays. It blows my mind that it comes from robots. I haven't even begin to philosophise on that idea...And that's the beauty of this film, it has many dimensions, it is a love story first and foremost, biting satire, a social commentary, a call to action, and many other things you want it to be.Too much good has been said about this movie...modern masterpiece, chaplinesque, pure poetry. So I'm not going to indulge in that exercise...The film has so many amazing moments: poignant, funny, joyful, that I'm going back for the second time (and third), to pick my favorite wall-e moments.Having said all the praises, the movie is not pitch perfect (gasp!!), the second half of the movie gives us one of those clichéd let's-save-the-world plot. At times, the chase/adventure scenes pander too much to mainstream, the ending was a little rushed. But the second half also gave us the dancing in space scene (it's divine!!)All in all, the movie was redeemed by the hearts and beauty of the two robots in love. Any technical glitch with the story or the pacing (though not with the animation, it was perfection) is easily forgiven. I'm looking extra-extra forward for edgy and envelope pushing new releases by pixar more than ever...just don't give us Toy Story 3 or Cars 2 (which they are working on!! wtf pixar??)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Piiiiiiiiiixar Iiiiiiiiiin Spaaaaaaaaaace!!!,"I'll admit my primary motive for viewing this flick was to see what Pixar would do with a genre for which I'd thought it eminently suited from the get-go. In this regard I wasn't disappointed, and noted that ""live-action"" was seamlessly integrated into the animation. I suspect Industrial Light and Magic had more than its customary input into the production.I'll also admit surprise at, of all things, the choice of music. One result was a spooky introduction, and even Peter Gabriel complemented the estimable end credit sequence. There's one piece of Thomas Newman's score I'll have to listen to again, involving, I would think, ""looped"" guitars, and you don't hear that every day.The story is direct and for the most part unencumbered, and perhaps best regarded in two discrete parts. To run for as long with nothing more said than Ben Burtt's electronic warbling and Fred Willard's Presidential impression is a gutsy move. The overall action is not conducive to blinking.Face it, if you try to entertain everyone and Say Something in the same breath you'll walk a tightrope no matter the message or choice of delivery. ""The Art Of"" book depicts what this flick could've been, and I think that would've sent audience members scurrying.But to those who think this a ""green"" manifesto or propaganda, I suggest they read more science fiction, starting with Jonathan Swift and H. G. Wells. Or perhaps just read more.It's a fable, friends, plain and simple, and if the viewer recognizes anything, even him- or herself, for the briefest of moments, then--it all works.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"WALL-E is relevant, intelligent and terrifying. And great for the kids, too.","I am thrilled to think children across this great land have dragged their parents to see what seems a harmless kid's movie, but what really is a searing and frightening critique of our way of life. That said, believe it or not, WALL-E is a delightful animated movie, probably among the best I've ever seen and certainly the finest Pixar has yet produced. The tale of robotic romance holds plenty of comedy - from guffaw-inducing slapstick (reminiscent of the masters of the silent screen) to splitting satire, WALL-E is a funny and entertaining film for both kids and adults.But onto the deeper side of this fun animated film, WALL-E is the only mainstream movie that hits exactly what's wrong with America and exactly what will happen if things don't change quickly (only there's no G-rated interstellar second chance for us). Beyond the befoulment of Earth, however, WALL-E offers its most pressing lesson in space. Pixar envisions a Corporation-State whose omni-convenience has turned men into jelly. This process has even reached the person running the show, the ostensible captain. In WALL-E, the machine is no longer the servant of man, the man is the slave of the machine. With homage to Kubrick, the film gives us a much more disturbing and relevant Hal. Do we even have the capacity to change course and prevent the environmental devastation that awaits? Or is Buy N' Large at the controls - not a person, but a machine?",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Worst Pixar Movie ever!,"I am a huge fan of Pixar movies. I loved the two Toy Story movies, all the Shrek's, and Finding Nemo. So, when Pixar announced another movie about a little robot named Wall.E (who looks a lot like No. 5 from Short Circuit), I couldn't wait to go see it. I got my chance this past weekend at a drive-in, no less, which is my favorite way to watch a movie. 15 minutes into it, I was ready to leave. What a disappointment. Although the character Wall.E was cute and did some funny things now and then, it was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. If it wasn't for the fact that the drive-in was showing a double feature with Get Smart, I would have left with the other dozen or so cars that pulled out after about 15 - 20 minutes. I kept watching and watching, hoping it would get better, but it seemed to just get worse and worse. Maybe I need to see it again to try to see what others got out of it, but I will have to wait until I can rent it for $1.00. I'll be damned if I am wasting more than that to see it again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wonderful movie for all,"I took my 4 year old son to see this as his first movie in a theater- I wanted Kung-Fu Panda, he insisted on ""the robot movie."" I could not have been happier with the outcome. While perhaps the plot was a little over his head, it kept his attention and was a treat for me to watch. The characters were enchanting, the backdrop incredible and every scene was well thought out. I didn't realize beforehand that it had such a strong environmental message; it was at times a little preachy, but it wasn't in an obnoxious way at all. I hope people will not avoid seeing this movie because of that strong message. In the end, it is a sweet, romantic, funny story that people of every age can enjoy. Wall-e is one of the most endearing characters I have ever seen in a movie. Congrats to Pixar on a winner!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Kung Fu Panda can't match with Walle.,"The beginning was probably the most boring part of the movie, it was so boring that I could've fallen asleep but the sounds kept me awake. The funny part of Walle were the fat people on hover chairs like the captain of the Axion space cruiser. There wasn't much talking but that's what pictures are for. The interesting part of the movie was the hi-tech cruise, so much new technology in the movie. Along with the hi-tech cruise there were so many robots with so many abilities. Overall this movie movie was great but it proceeded slow at some part.Kung Fu Panda cannot match with this movie! Kung Fu panda was to short Dream works cut off to many parts.All Pixar movies are great but WALLE is a new type f movie format.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
This film should be seen by all,"This is a kid film for certain. With goofy characters, lively animation, and dialogue and action aimed at that demographic this film further shows Pixar's ability to deliver brilliant kid films. The animation is a technological marvel; this will be studied by art students in the future even more so than Toy Story and Shrek. But I would recommend this movie for all ages because it will appeal to everyone who's ever been to a land fill, played a Massively Multi-Player Online Role Playing Game, or used a sensor to flush a toilet. For it's also a film that will horrify you and make you laugh all at once. It depicts a very possible future for humanity and, because of this, is probably one of the most important films of the year, if not of the age. There were times when I just sat, mouth agape, in awe at the horrifying nature of things while all manner of goofy adventures occurred on screen. And yes, I can guarantee that this film is still a kid film, since the sensibilities used in it are still aimed, even with such a reaction as I had, at that demographic first and foremost. This will change how you view a recliner and remind everyone who sees it how much danger over consumption really poses to the planet, all the while in a package well made for kids of all ages. I predict this movie will be on the next list of AFI's Top 100 Films of All Time and is a very strong candidate for all awards that deal with film/animation/and the like. This is a film that is well worth the ticket price, even of the most expensive variety. In short, see this film regardless of how old you are and even, if you must choose, over other blockbusters like Iron Man and Batman: The Dark Knight. It's simply that good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
An Amazing Triumph!!! 5 Stars!,"Yeah, I bet you have seen the trailer, the graphics are super-amazing and the characters look really cute.

Very few times, you have a chance to go to the cinema and have the opportunity to laugh, cry, feel thrilled and after wards, take home not only a smile on your face, but also an important message about us, as human beings and as a community in this huge cosmos, a community that everyday gets more alienated and self destructive.

I couldn't be happier with this movie,"It's not just that Wall E is cute, but the way is story is introduced. The storytelling is perfectly done- the robots don't talk and nothing is explained to you, yet by watching you quickly learn the entire history of this world, why Wall E exists, why he does what he does and why he is the way he is.You also feel for Wall E like almost no other movie character I can think of off the top of my head. He oozes with emotion every second he is on the screen and every second builds up his character. Every move and sound he makes is endearing, every hardship he goes through pulls at your heartstrings. I was always impressed how they made R2D2 such a lovable character in the original trilogy even though he just wobbled around and gave little beeps and boops every so often. Wall E however is on a different level.The other aspect of this movie is the entirely unsubtle social commentary on our own existence as people- the way we live, what we do to this planet and the so called 'solutions' we find to our problems. Without giving away too much you are going to laugh and cry a little at how this movie depicts us and the planet earth.Instead of describing this movie more I suggest you go out and enjoy it yourself, its definitely my favorite movie of the year so far and I look forward to seeing it again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
7.4/10 - Such A Great Main Character,"WALL-E is one of those movies that I watched several times as a kid and really liked, but haven't rewatched in quite a while. So, that was nice. And what do you know, this movie is still pretty good :)WALL-E follows a cleaning robot that stayed on Earth to clean after humanity (which left to a long, long cruise on space 700 hundred years ago). As he encounters a new robot and quite immidiately falls for her we see the interactions between them and what it all leads to.So, as per usual, let's start with the stuff that did it for me here.I think that the obvious thing to mention is WALL-E's character, which is probably one of the sweetest, most adorable, relatable and fun to watch characters that Pixar Studios have ever created. We have a decent amount on time here almost without any dialogue, but this is honestly the best part of the movie in my opinion. Just watching WALL-E interacts with stuff is enough to keep me entertained.But you know what, beyond just being cute, funny, entertaining and whatnot, this segment of the film actually does a lot of things in quite a clever way. I really dig how this film shows us stuff rather than telling it. We're given the exposition, an extremely likeable main character and a relatable crush on another robot with practically no dialogue, but with a lot of heart, subtlety and memorable moments.And well, as for the things that I liked less...well. I can't say that I really despised anything here, but the second half of the film is significantly worse than the first one. Yeah, it's still fun, some characters here are pretty enjoyable too, but it just turns from a heartfelt, sweet film about a lonely robot that falls in love to a statement about how we should treat nature well and...yeah. I can't elaborate too much about the second half cause spoilers, but let's say that I feel like this film loses here a significant amount of what made it work so well on the first half. It's still nice overall, but I prefer the first half by far.Also, 2001 did it better, this character is kinda dumb here and it doesn't add a lot to the film. (if you get it you get it, I keep my reviews spoiler free so I can't explain in depth XD)
As a note, I'd like to emphasize that I don't have any problem with films that have some environmental take (I think that Princess Mononoke does it in a great, creative way) but here it just kinda falls flat for me.Yet, overall, this film is still worthy of your time. It's a classic, WALL-E is an awesome character, and the latter half of the film is still fine overall so y'know. It's also pretty short, only 98 minutes long, so you may as well just give it a shot. I'm feeling a 7.4/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
More than you could've ever expect,"Kind and serene, yet strong and meaningful.These are the feelings you'll definitely get by viewing this movie. No need to speculate over its similarities with the masterpieces from the past. There are always things one may not like (one may be even bothered by the Mac sound WALL·E does when charging, although quite a deserved tribute to Steve Jobs and his effort to bring Pixar to all of us). But besides the beautiful details, there is something more. The idea, and what's even more important - the atmosphere of WALL·E will fascinate any viewer, whether he is a child, a teenager or an adult. For sure this animated movie will run for at least another Oscar, but it doesn't even matter as long as seeing it time after time is still an enjoyable activity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"First part is incredible, second part less interesting","First, I must say that the animation is amazing. Pixar as it's best. The scene that looks like New York made from pile of garbages is stunning.About the story, I really like Wall-E character. He's likeable. The first part (before him escape to join Eve) is amazing. It's like poetry. After this, it looks like a social satire. It's funny but the message is predictable and it seems more like one action scene after another.So, I still find about animation that it's a amazing piece of art, but about the story, it lacks something in the second part.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Disappointed,"While the animation was very good, the best that Pixar has done to date, the story line was poor at best. It must have taken all of a lunch to some up with that story line.While it is a fantasy, there is no reason to distort reality. A plant survives in a discarded refrigerator? What does that tell our children?Other issues: What economic model is this based on? Who in the heck does any work? Robots with feelings? We have little idea were ours come from, much less creating them in a robot.With the ease of turning out movies there seems to be fewer folks that can write a good story.Don't spend your money at the theater. Wait to rent the DVD.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Well done. Nice and clever work again from Pixar. Marvelous feature.,"I for one have never been a big fan of animation or cartoon type films, yet something just interested me about ""WALL-E"" it just seemed like a nice and cute touching tale of a lonely moving robot about to start his journey thru the planet. I must say after seeing it that I wasn't letdown either overall it was pretty impressive work everything from graphics to the style of it's story with the fantasy characters living in cool settings. Starting in a rusty desert of junk where the only living thing that moves is square robot ""WALL-E"" who has such catchy and droopy binocular eyes. Much of the first parts of the film we see the robot as stubborn and alone as the action and journey of discovery doesn't really take off till he meets up with a landed spaceship and another ray eyed robot ""EVE"". This movie is clearly a film of discovery a new type of journey that involves future themes of space and saving humans with the central hero being a robot a lifelike possibility with the technology of the future as machines and droids may soon rule the planet.

WALL·E is a Bad Movie,"Please do not waste your time on this film.The movie is even more flawed on a fundamental level. Should children even be watching animations about robots (as apposed to animals and fairies?) In the past Pixar has produced deeply human tales such as Finding Nemo, Toy Story, and Ratatouille. In WALL-E, the robots are intelligent, sensitive, and courageous; the humans are obese and imbecile at their best, manipulative and evil at their worst. The concept of a social satire disguised as a children's animation is as disgusting as a vanilla ice cream with a topping of foie gras gone sour.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Great Family Entertainment,"Once again Pixar has created a great G-rated film for adults that children also enjoy. Much of the comedy in this film is reminiscent of silent films of the past. I saw this at the drive-in during a fourth of July fireworks display. Even though I did not hear much of the film over the fireworks, I do not think I missed much. It was still hysterical.My children laughed as much as I did. I do not think they will be pondering how scary this film actually is though. After burying the earth in so much trash that the planet has become uninhabitable, humans have become hi-tech couch potatoes in space. This film is just as frightening as it is funny. The laughs come instantly. The message sinks in a little later. While highly entertaining, this movie is more than the usual audio-visual candy for the ears and eyes that has become the standard of summer entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wonderful and Amazing.,"I haven't had such a good time at the movies this summer since Iron Man was released back in May. Pixar has done it again, and this time it easily surpasses many of their previous attempts such as Cars and The Incredibles. I find now that Walle, Toy Story and Finding Nemo remain in a dead tie as to which is my favorite, but they are all great films. In Walle, Pixar manages to convey a large amount of emotion with very little dialog. Of the robots that appear on screen most say one or two words tops, everything thing they feel comes out through their eyes and actions. There is eventually spoken dialog in the film from other characters but not until after easily spending the first 30 to 40 minutes of the film with Walle alone on whats left of Earth.In his time alone on the planet, Walle (who reminds me a little of the robot from Short Circuit) has become somewhat of a packrat, picking up little odds and ends and then taking them back to his home to add to a large collection. Many humorous situations arise as he explores the trash left behind by the humans hundreds of years before for more things to add. Walle seems to have also developed a soul in his time alone as we bear witness to his obvious loneliness since the other Walle units shut down or malfunctioned in some way. He has only a single friend to keep him company in the form of a tiny cockroach that often journeys with him on his collecting voyages. One day Walle meets a new robot Named Eve. Eve seems to have been sent to earth to find something as she is always searching the surface. The two eventually form a relationship, but when Eve's automated ship returns to collect her Walle stows aboard in an attempt to stay together. The two then are returned to the giant spaceship that houses what remains of the human population. All that ensues as the two attempt to reunite and then escape is a fun and exciting romp throughout the rest of the film. One which has Walle meeting his first humans as well as several other new robots of various design. I won't go into to much more detail for fear of spoiling the fun but long story short this is a great animated romantic comedy/space adventure that I think everyone can enjoy. Pixar really knocked the ball out of the park on this one!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
WALL-E is what the world needed,"walking into Wall-E, i knew very little. the trailers were vague and i relied solely on that fact that it has some cute looking characters and some masterminds of the business behind it. walking out of Wall-E, i had never been happier to have known so little in the beginning.it was a pure, innocent, yet harsh and eyeopening wake-up call to the world of today. it was the perfect blend of cute characters and cute story lines, with what we could soon face, and what we have to be aware of. we fail to notice at times how much we take for granted and how much we could do more to ensure our home will stay our home, and Wall-E is that kick into the reality of things.Wall-E is a perfectly executed, adorable and much needed film. it is perfect for the whole family, but doesn't fail to hold a strong message. it had hints of 2001: A Space Odyssey and apocalyptic themes, along with the cute touch of Pixar. Wall-E is the kind of hope that could save our world from ruin.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Magic in the screen,"Pixar lives up to his name...always making movies and stories that are great and above all ,about important subjects.....but what's most universal than love....nothing....and now pixar showed us that in this great film.I say this because when i saw it there were people from 5 to 70 years old and everyone enjoy it. This movie will take you from happiness to sadness very quickly and you really feel the same as the characters,few movies can make that happen....(at least to me). The story show us wall*e,a trash compressor robot that has been alone for 700 hundred years and has developed a personality....he is curious ,he feel loneliness,and he want to be in love.(enough of the story) The quality of the animation has reached another level...the level of reality will shock you...it's just beautiful,the textures ,the colors,the camera that sometimes is out of focus....and a lot of others things..everything combine gave life to this pixar's masterpiece called WALL*E.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"""I don't want to survive...I want to live!""","Pixar's latest endeavor comes out on top, as should be expected by now from the likes of these animators. While a large portion of this movie contains no dialogue whatsoever, you would be hard pressed to even notice. Wall-E the eccentric but lovable protagonist conveys 99% of his emotions and intentions through movement and electronic sounds alone. Which was wonderfully done.I'll admit that for the first 40 minutes of this movie I was becoming skeptical about how complex the story was really going to be, but out of Pixar's cleverness you realize that the beginning; which portrays the budding love between two robots is meant to symbolize the simplicity, but importance of such an emotion, and how the humans portrayed in the movie have completely lost touch with the most important and simple things in their lives. This beautiful contrast is a subtle but very meaningful social commentary.Like many of the great science fiction stories of our time this movie does not slanderously preach about environmental and consumerism issues, but gently conveys a message that we may very well be destroying ourselves as human beings if we continue to be blind to such problems.This is most certainly an Oscar worthy film, for it is not only a charming and often hilarious children's movie, but a wonderful story that can be appreciated by all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
See this movie ASAP!,"My family went to see the movie this afternoon. Being the girls first movie at the theater, I didn't know if I was going to be able to get them to sit through the whole thing. The attention span of a 4-year old isn't that long, as parents know. They sat through the whole thing.Being a kid at heart, I have waited for this movie to come out since I saw the first previews. I was not disappointed! From the time you first lay your eyes on WALL-E, you fall for the little guy. Most of the first 20 minutes or so show what has been previewed in the trailers. When you see it on the big screen though, you never pay it any mind.The ending of the movie actually put a lump in my throat and brought a tear to my eye. The movie shows that love does conquer all and that maybe the human race isn't doomed to be a bunch of couch potatoes and mindless beasts.A Must See!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"I'm guessing that after people see this, the number of views on Hello Dolly will increase.","I'm guessing that after people see this, the number of views on Hello Dolly will increase. Nevertheless, I had just returned from seeing this and have to say I am impressed. Pixar has made 8 flicks and this is their 9th flick. 5 of those flicks have their own position in the IMDb's list of 250 of the greatest movies ever made. Of course they made 3 bad flicks: A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., and don't get me started on Cars, even though me and fans of Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends like that movie. Anyway, the visuals for this movie are stunning. I'm a movie maker myself and have to admit I never ever learned how to do 3D animation and visual effects, even though my movies, or episodes, consist of model, blue screen, and computer-generated 2D effects. You can find my production site here at http://www.sampsoninc.com. Pixar, however, excels at this and makes the incredible world of Wall E beautiful. Oh, and the great cinematographer Rodger Deakins worked as a visual consultant on this film. He worked on great films like Assassination of Jesse James, No Country for Old Men, and In the Valley of Elah, all of which contain content that is not for kids because they are R-rated. Now onto the characters. WALL E, the title character, is downright incredible. Such charm and cuteness goes with this robot that it makes you laugh along with his antics. It works best when you are watching this with an audience and not alone. EVE, the lovebird of WALL E, has a futuristic touch to her and does whatever she can to help him out. Both robots turn out to have hearts and feel emotions whenever the script calls for them. The character development between them was done to an all out excellence. The scenes where they are both together you can actually see their personality. I think the major film critics will do better at admiring this flick than me. By and by, Wall E is an instant classic, and this is why today's kids will enjoy growing up with this company because they had the same awesome gig going nonstop for 13 years. I say that because Toy Story was their first flick. Oh, and don't forget to watch Hello Dolly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Interesting,"I thought this movie was just OK so obviously I am in the minority on that, because most people definitely seem to love this movie. I thought parts of it were boring and the movie was kind of predictable but I guess if I was a kid or had kids I would have liked it a lot more. I didn't think the fat people in space were very funny, it just seemed like people were laughing at fat guys. The voices were pretty good. I liked how Wall- E looked but it reminds me a lot of the Johnny Five robot from the old Short Circuit movies as far as how he looked. Not sure what else to say, it's all just personal opinion I just didn't like this as much as Toy Story or older Disney movies.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
WALL-E - Pixar's finest film so far - one of the best film achievements of all time!,"Having expressed over the last few months how badly I wanted to see Pixar's new film I just hoped that it would live up to my high expectations. Well, it exceeded them to say the very least. This film is audacious, deeply moving, has a beautiful score, the lead characters Wall-E and Eve are just brilliantly conceived and the animation is the finest that the studio have presented thus far. I am not ashamed in the slightest to say that this film moved me to tears. It caters for adults and children and is a mixture of both light and dark (in places uncommonly dark for a film that essentially is marketed at younger audiences - SPOILER Wall-E perceiving the other dead Wall-E machines on the rubbish site is one particular poignant example). The level of detail brought to this story is astonishing on every level. Not in a very long time have I walked out of the cinema feeling drained from smiling and crying. This really is an important film for our time, not only a demonstration of the progression of computer animation, but also a true story of discovery and love. This gem of a film is the finest film of 2008 so far and certainly one of the most vital films of the 21st century. I urge you to see it, even if it's just to see the adorable Wall-E pronounce his name! Absolute genius. Move over It's a wonderful life and The Shining, Wall-E is soaring to the top of my list. If this film doesn't win any Oscars I will be speechless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Different...but in a good way!,"I just saw this movie last night, and I've got to say, I can see why people have rated it so high. After I walked out of the theater this man told me ""It was sure different that's for sure,"" and he was exactly right, it was different but it was different in a good way.Part of what makes it different is the fact that there is very little dialogue. The movie forces you to pay attention to the action rather than what they are saying. This isn't very hard though because the action and the scenery is very intriguing to watch. For example when the robot named Eve is first introduced she floats around the land in such a way that is very beautiful, and very pleasing to the eye.What makes this movie especially great is the amount of character development it has achieved with the lack of dialogue. Wall-E never talks except for when he says his name or the name of Eve. This movie shows rather than tells, and that is quite an accomplishment. Rather than Wall-E telling someone what he desires, this movie uses various ways to show it.With this character development comes the concern for the characters. Throughout the movie you are concerned about what is going to happen to Wall-E and his robotic friend Eve, but mostly for Wall-E because he is so fragile. In the beginning, Wall-E makes friends with a cockroach, who's name is never given, but despite this, I often felt concern for the bug, and I wanted it to survive.Another thing that makes this movie different is that it is a social commentary. The thing I liked about this is it's not all about environmental issues (though there were some), but it is also about social issues that we as humans are headed towards-though they are shown in the extreme. I won't reveal what these issues are, because you will have to see it for yourself.Wall-E is certainly different from any other Pixar movie, but that is what makes it great! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar has amazed many!!!,"Its Saturday and its very hot so me,my older brother,and my little sister decides to go watch Wall E. I was suspecting it to be like an ordinary animation,but I was wrong...ITS BLEW ME AWAY!! This film shows great example of heroism,love,and comedy.Some parts were sad that I nearly wept.Definitely when this film comes out on Blu-Ray and DVD,if I wanted to I would buy Blu-ray AND the DVD yes thats how much I love it.I don't want the memory of this movie to end in my head it just makes me happy every time I think of a particular scene.I loved everything about the film except for the fact when I got my special Wall-E watch from the theater it broke on me!

Fall in Love with Machines Falling in Love (again!),"WALL-E is the third love story in a row from Pixar, and they just keep getting better at it, as it seems with everything they do. It's only been 2 years since they first made us fall in love with machines falling in love in ""Cars,"" yet they have outdone themselves this second time around, pairing two robots separated by centuries and light years of space.As with ""Cars,"" the folks at Pixar have gotten us to care so deeply about a pair of machines that during the most touching, romantic moments, the audience was absolutely quiet. At several points in the film I could sense the baited breath and hear the sobs.I'm sure that by now you are familiar enough with the storyline that nothing needs to be said here about its particulars. I will add that it was amazingly unique and quite strong, even though there was barely any dialog between the main characters.What I think was best about the film was the depth of involvement I had with the characters (which the audience clearly shared). I had just come from a more packed showing of ""Hancock"" and though it was fun, I just didn't care for the characters nearly as much, even though they were human---well, sorta.The visual effects in ""WALL-E"" were as brilliant as any CGI to date, and there is an imaginative ""dance"" that is fun to watch. As always, Pixar has done a great job of mixing the very realistic & gritty with the soft & cartoonish.If you have to choose only one movie to go to for the next few weeks, ""WALL-E"" is hands down the pick to make, even over ""Hancock.""And, if you are just coming around to collecting Pixar films on DVD, in my opinion, this is a tie for first with ""Finding Nemo.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Greatest Animated Film of All Time,"One of the few films in history which could universally be called a masterpiece. Wall-E had everything every Disney/Pixar movie did, but in vastly larger quantities.Graphically, this is perhaps the most beautiful film ever made. Every sequence is stunningly realistic (so much so, I thought to myself several times, ""How did they build a robot that could do all that?""). The sequence where WALL-E and EVE are ""dancing"" is one of the more spectacular visual sequences in recent memory.The story, as is Pixar's habit, is touching and deeply sad throughout. There are quite a few ""tear-jerker"" moments, but for extremely right reasons. WALL-E, it turns out, is one of cinema's more ""human"" characters. The plot is very simple and there is almost no dialog, just each robot's strange, endearing way of greeting each other.This film has set the bar for animated film-making and will be used as an example in every graphic design textbook made from now on. WALL-E touches briefly on matters of a pseudo-political agenda dealing with large corporations, but the statement is made with crystal clarity and for the right reasons.Everything about WALL-E screams ""Oscar"" at the top of its lungs. If this isn't nominated for Best Picture, I'll be terribly surprised.WALL-E now holds the unique place of being what I think to be the greatest animated film of all time. I place it above Hayao Miyazaki's marvelous films. This is a perfect movie. It's beautifully well-shot and will be remembered as one of the most treasured films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Best movie of 2008,Need I say more? The film gives credit 2001: A Space Odyssey where needed so all the hardcore fans of that movie rest assured that it wasn't a ripoff.

Easily the best G rated film ever made (including none animated ones). Dark and heartwarming at the same time with excellent visuals.

"I keep waiting for PIXAR  to let me down;alas,it hasn't happened yet","I've seen practically all of the PIXAR productions for the big screen,and I am drawn to them for the exact reason that I'm convinced that,sooner or later,they will fail me:namely,beautifully crafted imagery and stories with memorable characters and the belief that they will,in their lack of uniformity or decreasing inspiration,become disappointing.It hasn't happened yet,and in fact this may've been an up-tick.The title character,a garbage collecting drone,has spent seven centuries performing the lonely and depressing task of cleaning up the unimaginably voluminous waste left behind by a futuristic mankind that has been consuming cheaper and cheaper materials and disposing them at an inequitable rate. As Earth has become uninhabitable due to this accumulation,there is precious little able to function in this world(save the cockroaches,of course),but this does not,somehow stifle WALL-E's ability to gradually become sentient,developing thoughts,emotions and longings that he doesn't fully understand but is oh-so-familiar with. His encounter with a exploratory droid named EVE will not only change his destiny but will create a ripple effect on the world he's been(and mankind's descendants have not been) familiar with.Director Andrew Staunton is more like the team project leader on a large-scale animation project that defies description. Very limited voice-work(with choice cameos by KAthy Najimy and PIXAR reg JOhn Ratzenberger to back Jeff GArlin's turn as the captain of a traveling space habitat)is able to fill in mostly gaps where the robots cannot fill,which isn't much.I won't go into which PIXAR films are my favorites and which aren't,but suffice it to say that even the weakest of their creations is still some of the best animation out there and could stand up against even some NON-animated films out there. This has an appeal that can stretch generations and a quality that is unique despite any of its flaws(i.e. preachines,cute,hidden agendas and standard ""happy ending"" canards you find in animated films,PIXAR or no). And while I feel like PIXAR's next offering may be the one to finally really disappoint,after this film,it wouldn't surprise me if it didn't.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Not really very good.,"I really thought that this would be a very good animated movie considering the 8.6 star rating on IMDb when I watched it. I'm glad I got the DVD from the library and didn't see it at the theater or paid money to rent it.It was all quite boring. I don't know what people are raving about. I feel that people are giving it high ratings because they have been brainwashed into thinking that it's a great movie from reading all the other comments. Maybe people see some deep meaning or profound message in this movie, but I thought the whole thing was quite shallow. I'm trying not to include any comments that might be considered ""spoilers"", but as far as I'm concerned, just watching spoiled it for me. How can you have one scene after another solely for the purpose of trying to make these characters seem cute and lovable and human?It was a real waste of my time watching this movie and I just don't feel like I want to join the rest of the flock of sheep on this one.

Wonderful! Pixar does it again!,"We moviegoers just love cute robots--think of the little Coke machines in Silent Running, Robbie from Forbidden Planet (well, maybe not so cute)and of course C-3PO and R2-D2. There's a tiny bit of all of those guys in WALL*E, along with a healthy heap of Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp.WALL*E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth class) is a small robot left behind on Earth to clean up the place after humans have covered it with trash and absconded to a starship. It's been 700 years since the humans vanished, and WALL*E stays behind, doing his job, with no company except a VHS tape of ""Hello Dolly"" and his pet cockroach. But then, a new kind of robot appears on the trash mountains--a kind that WALL*E has never seen before . . .All I have to say about this movie is that Pixar continues their streak of great films. These guys just can't seem to make a bad or even mildly disappointing film (sure, Cars wasn't quite up to their usual standard, but even Cars was better than 75% of the films released in any given year). As the digital wizards at Pixar have refined and improved the technology they use to create their imaginary worlds, their films have become deeper and more thought-provoking. This film looks sensational, but the masterful story-telling is what will hook you, draw you in, and have you alternately laughing out loud and surreptitiously wiping away the dampness from your eyes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pixar DOES IT AGAIN!,"Hands down, this is a legendary picture. Never has so much genius gone into the creation of a film, animated or live action. In WALL-E, Pixar has created two robots that fall in love. Remember when Allan Arkush gave us the unforgettably abysmal Heartbeeps? Same concept, yet WALL-E is on the complete other end of the spectrum. For all of the reasons we hated Heartbeeps, we now love WALL-E. The two stars are barely humanoids, yet their fantastically subtle gestures are so human that I was once reminded of a mannerism of a friend. The plot is appropriately ecological (we ARE living in the green decade, after all) and much of the script follows that of a traditional children's film. Yet Pixar's unmatched ability to mix unreal visuals with simple, hysterical wit shines through and gives us the greatest masterpiece in the history of animation.

Personalities of the characters give the film its life,"For those who have been out of touch, Pixar is the company responsible for some of the most popular, highest-grossing and memorable animated films from the past few years. What you must bring with you (along with your kids) to the theater, however, is a suspension of disbelief. In films such as Toy Story, Babe, Finding Nemo, and others, dogs, pigs, rats, toys, bugs, and fish can talk, have feelings or fall in love. The new Pixar film Wall-E is no exception. Robots talk like Mac computers, have deep feelings, and even kiss each other. Although it probably will not be a film I will become personally attached to in the same way as ET and Short Circuit, Wall-E is a strong film that entertains while telling us it is past time when we must pay attention to taking care of our planet.In the film's premise, Planet Earth has been uninhabitable for hundreds of years because of some undisclosed catastrophe, yet mounds of trash remain uncollected on the ground and a single robot remains functioning, methodically collecting the junk and piling it into stacks of neat boxes that rise high enough to become indistinguishable from the ancient skyscrapers. Like ET, Wall-E creates creatures that do not exist, that do not even speak, yet gives them life and personality and makes you care for them (the sounds for both characters were designed by Ben Burtt). Wall-E, a Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class bot, grudgingly goes about his assigned task, the last surviving robot from a failed program, collecting trinkets of an age long past like the video of a song and dance sequence from Hello Dolly.Wall-E's ""life"" changes, however, when a spaceship containing the remnants of the human population that left Earth a long time ago brings Eve, an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, to search for evidence that Earth can once again return to life. Wall-E is smitten with the much sleeker robot and their ""love affair"" takes them on a journey to the spaceship Axiom where humans are more robotic than the bots in the film. Human activity consists of what you would expect on a cruise to the Caribbean: playing games, talking on video cell phones, watching programs, constantly being waited on and fed messages through a propagandist using a huge screen. Nurtured by the Buy-N-Large Corporation, humans have grown fat and passive. Without any detectable ambition, they just accept what is put in front of them to make their lives easier without thinking or noticing what is going on around them.When Eva and Wall-E arrive aboard, however, the film changes pace and becomes full of hyperkinetic activity with lots of bangs, chases, and explosions. The Captain in charge must battle the defenders of the status quo, the computers who do not want their order to be compromised, telling us to ""stay the course"" (where have I heard that before?) rather than look for a new possibility. Like a Chaplin or Keaton film, Wall-E is a mostly silent film in which the actions and personalities of the characters give the film its life. The two main characters cannot speak to each other in a language we understand, yet they bond because of a shared yearning to give and receive love, demonstrating that our relationships are rooted ultimately in our feelings and connections, not in our language.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Pretty-Perfect Film,"WALL-E................WALL-E, WALL-E, WALL-E, where to start, where to start? First off, the animation was incredible. I don't think it better then other 2D or 3D movies because of animation, because that would just be pointless. But I thought it was just brilliantly animated, at times even tricking my eyes into thinking it was a real live action movie. Not often, but enough.Now, as everyone SHOULD know, good animation does not a decent movie make. It gets points, but not A's. The plot was good. It was sent into space and punctuated by emotion and a message but overall it was just a standard love story. But most entertainment stories are love stories. The Matrix was part love story for God's sakes. It was a unique love story in that it was put together with only two near-mute characters and how they function together.The most interesting part of this movie is ow well emotion was worked into it. By using the animation, yes back to the animation, the animators intricately make it so that WALL-E's eyes move up and down like eyebrows and one can see that deep inside the frames there are metal circles that go over his inner eyes similar to eyelids. It's interesting when EVE freezes and WALL-E works with her like that. A very ""Twilight-Zone-Last-Man-On-Earth"" kind of scenario. Usually the only emotion shown on a Disney movie is the helpless girl crying over her love leaving or how how much she screwed up. (Sorry, ladies, it's just how stories have historically gone.)The voices are good being that there is more audio dialogue in an early Charlie Chaplin film then there is in this movie. I like how there we're several intricate and important characters that had so much to say that really couldn't say ANYthing. Pretty gutsy move for a kids film. There are really only four normal characters that use normal voices.Message.... The movie was really good, but it just got really preachy. People are L-A-Z-Y and nobody, I repeat, NOBODY, can deny it. But really, Disney? Did we need the ending to be the animated version of ""An Inconvenient Truth""? I love the message, but maybe not so heavy in a kids flick, alright? There has to be some irony in the global Disney corporation having an anti company message in a movie.To cap it all off, one can't really say that the ending was realistic. Yes, I know it's a Disney flick. Yes, I know it's a movie about us living in space, which ain't gonna happen, sorry Trekkies and Star Wars losers. But come on, everything is hunky dory and the world continues on with humans for the better? Doubt it.Overall, good flick. It's hands down no questions asked going to win the Oscar. Sorry, Kung Fu Panda. Is it better than Beauty and the Beast? No. Lion King? No. Shrek? No. Finding Nemo? No. But is it a really good film that deserves ALMOST every bit of praise it gets (as long as critics keep their heads on)? Yes. So overall, I give this film a B+ to an A-. Which is higher than most other films of today. Probably because it's better than most films of today.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Magical,"When it comes to movies, kid flicks aren't my cup of tea. For all the folks out there that love 'em, I generally loath them, and I particularly despise being immersed in an audience of hyperactive munchkins who can't sit still, much less remain quiet. So it comes as somewhat of a surprise that I found myself sitting in a theatre surrounded by antsy children waiting for WALL-E, the latest animated effort from Pixar, to begin.Things weren't looking good as the trailers started to roll. Dancing hippos and super dogs failed to stifle the little monsters as promos for the latest Madagascar and Bolt movies rolled by. But then the main feature started to run, something magical happened. You could hear a pin drop. The munchkins had been wrapped in enchantment, and I found myself absorbed like never before in a movie designed for the sandbox set.WALL-E, an acronym for Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth-Class, tells the story of a little garbage compacting robot who silently toils away fulfilling his programming of neatly piling up waste, long after Earth's inhabitants have abandoned the garbage-strewn planet for a life in space aboard the Axiom starliner.His routine among the trash, accompanied by his lone friend, a cockroach, is suddenly broken one day by the arrival of EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), a space probe sent by the Axiom to periodically scour the Earth for vegetation, as a sign that life is returning to the planet.Told with minimal dialogue (the robots don't say much beyond their names) and relying heavily on pantomime and the conveyance of expression through mechanical means, the folks at Pixar have truly created a gem that is as much a work of art as it is entertainment. Because much of the story is told through mime, even the youngest of kids can follow the story. As an adult, there's plenty of substance here too, as the film explores the consequences of human dependence upon all-serving technology. The animation is also something to behold. WALL-E's sequences on Earth have a hyper real look to them, breaking down the barrier between what appears natural and animated.Thanks to WALL-E, my faith in kids flicks has been restored but you'll still have to drag me kicking and screaming to see Madagascar.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
I cannot believe this piece of trash ranks above movies like V for Vendetta in IMDb top 250,"No spoilers here. I tried twice but simply could not continue after 30 mins both times.There is nothing going on in the movie.. In bad movies, at least there is dialogue which you can cling on to in the quest to finish the movie; but this movie doesn't have that either. Animation is great though, maybe thats what other viewers loved so much.I cannot believe how this movie can be in the IMDb top 250. This movie should be the worst movie amongst ones ranked above 6 in IMDb.BTW i found UP to be equally painful and boring, very unlike Finding Nemo and Toy story from the same creators.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Shockingly depth romantic comedy from Pixar,"Words can not describe how adorable this movie is. First and foremost, I should warn you that if you are expecting a comedy in the realm of Finding Nemo, then you'll be disappointed. This is not a comedy, it is more a family romance with comedy thrown in. It has its hilarious scenes, don't get me wrong, but this movie is more of a film that tells a surprisingly deep story more so than it is one that passes a simple moral story with comedy. I was shocked at the depth, honestly. It is obviously for all ages, but there are so many satirical subtleties in this movie that relate to us, our society, and our perception of government that it caught me off guard.There are also quite a few references to 2001 that only fans of Kubrick's work will recognize, and most certainly not children.Overall, if you're looking to laugh your ass off, don't go, it is insanely cute humor that is impossible not to smile and laugh at, but it is a very deep story at heart and doesn't contain much dialog at all so you don't get any wit in the form of that.There's also a 7-8 minute Pixar short movie before Wall-E starts involving a magician and his rabbit that make this worth the admission alone.The only thing that keeps this from being perfect in my opinion is that, at times, the lack of dialog really did make it feel like a very extended short film. Wall-E and his entire life and job is summarized in the opening credits, which I think increased the difficulty in finding something for him to do while building up to meeting Eve and boarding her shuttle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A brilliant dose of imagination,"The '·' in WALL·E is an 'interpunct', used to separate words in classical Latin long before a 'space' is even thought of. With it being in the film's title, a sense of nostalgia with a blend of mystery and sci-fi is invoked. The decision to combine a futuristic sounding title with an extinct punctuation definitely sets this film apart from any other animated films. Unlike most current films, much personality is already given out by only reading the title itself. Having said that, it is also unsurprising to know that the film's achievements greatly mirrors the purpose of the title.WALL·E stands for 'Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class' and WALL·E is a robot. The directive for WALL·E is to do what his name says, cleaning up trash on a post-apocalyptic (not in the usual sense) Earth habituated by absolutely nothing at all except for WALL·E's only friend, a cockroach. WALL·E showcases sapient behaviour unprecedented for a machine in our time. Despite being a machine, WALL·E clearly exhibits emotions which endears him to viewers and gave him much more of a personality than most cartoon characters can dream of. Out of nowhere, EVE, an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, appears on Earth and drives the brilliant plot of this film forward in a delightful pace.The plot (which I am not spoiling here) of WALL·E is an amazing, imaginative and original ride that will make absolutely anyone laugh, cry and think. If one has a very short attention span and is unable to work their thought process, this film is definitely a pass for them. Fortunately, this film works on almost all levels (except for the select few that I mentioned) and is definitely a joy to watch for anybody of any ages. Like every other Pixar film, imagination is abundant in this film and it is surprising to think that those at Pixar possess such vast amount of it.Pixar outdid themselves in every aspect of film-making again. In particular, visuals are a main composition of an animated film and WALL·E trumps in this aspect. From the rubbish towered landscapes of an isolated Earth to the vast sea of space, WALL·E is a visual feast for the eyes. Live-action shots in this film are also a first for Pixar and they are utilised to great visual and dramatic narrative effect. Unorthodox for an animated CGI film, depth of field shots (and other cinematography techniques) are littered throughout the film inciting tension and drama in scenes that demands it. Dull, colourful, bright and vibrant are words to describe the colour palette used for this film and they are used to great effect in terms of creating emotions and depth. Various feelings of delight and melancholy are displayed wonderfully in WALL·E just by the visuals itself making this film another of Pixar's finest efforts.Atmosphere is abundant throughout the film with perfect use of music. The score is evidently the main component for a film like WALL·E which exhibits silent films' characteristics. Tension, joy, calmness and humanity are ejected with ease into viewers through the use of music. This film's achievements in the audio department greatly rival musical efforts by Disney such as Fantasia 2000. Classic and lovable songs are also inserted at poignant points of the film invoking a sense of nostalgia much like the title itself. All in all, the score is such a wonderfully refreshing experience that anyone can go through over and over again.To call WALL·E a cartoon greatly diminishes the quality of the film. Social commentaries are a main part of this film that most people will overlook. With obvious themes like mass-consumerism, globalisation and degradation of humanity, this film is no longer a cartoon. It is a film that rivals any live-action films in terms of intelligence and heart albeit in the form of an animation. Viewers will be given a choice of either thinking or not thinking when undergoing the process of experiencing this film. Needless to say, the viewers' minds will not be taxed that much for the themes present are all laid out easily for anyone to follow. With intelligence infused linearly for the viewers, the joy of watching a film can be undertaken without much confusion.In a nutshell, WALL·E is the film of the year that everyone should absolutely catch. WALL·E is a film that appeals to anybody and will definitely give everyone a great time. For those complaining about the film being too slow, it is because the visuals and the themes are overlooked. There is also not one ounce of popular culture that is present in this film (unlike Kungfu Panda which strives on that and sacrifices quality) and that makes WALL·E a refreshing watch. Therefore, WALL·E is highly recommended by me and it should be the film everyone watches while it is still playing.PS: A great short by Pixar is also present before WALL·E begins ala Pixar's other films. This allows us to watch a feature length film and a short film for the admission price of only one feature length film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A film that has heart as well as a brain.,"It isn't often these days that you find a movie like Wall-E. It isn't a film that asks much of you, that strongly tries to force a particular opinion, or makes you feel like a cheated idiot after you have paid however much to see it. All it asks really is for you to be a human being. It asks you to feel. It asks you to relate to and understand the entire spectrum of emotions that we possess.You become familiar with a machine which has been built for one purpose only, like many before it. Yet somewhere along the way, this machine became aware to the point of having a conscious. Ultimately the only thing that separates Wall-E from being anything other then what he was built to do is his ability to love, desire, want and appreciate. Much like us really. Though I think the fact that we can relate to that is the main point of it all. The entire movie visually is breathtaking and the animation so subtle and clever. There is hardly any dialogue throughout with the protagonist saying not more than one word. But to be able to understand when he is sad, happy, elated, scared, depressed or in love from the slightest movement, noise or action he makes. And to respond with my own emotion and empathy, well, that just makes me very proud to be human. Nothing can dampen a strong will, and only love can fix a broken heart. This film is fantastic, and you should see it.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
How did I miss this?,Decided to give this movie a shot on D+ and watch it with my kids. And I was completely blown away. What an awesome movie. How can it have such a low score? I actually think this is the best Pixar movie I've seen so far.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"A few minor weaknesses, but otherwise an inspirational masterpiece!","The first half is pure movie magic. Thought provoking, funny, touching, hilarious, romantic, etc. WALL·E is a truly lovable character. The way he and his environment are introduced to us is just beautiful. It's immediately clear how much thought and hard work PIXAR have put into this film, just like all their others, except somehow they still manage to do the ""impossible"", which is to get better every time.Possibly a slight weakness with these otherwise marvellous scenes is that at times they actually feel a little rushed. This may sound unlikely for a film with virtually no dialogue and so few characters for about the first hour but at times, Andrew Stanton seems to doubt himself just the tiniest bit. There are more than a few successions of short panning shots from various angles that seem to function solely as awe-inspiring (which they are) and to show off the location. They aren't bad per se, but they don't seem very original in style or in the way that they fit into the movie. It becomes a bit of a pattern and it feels not like Stanton's running out of ideas, but that he's afraid people will lose interest if he doesn't artificially keep up the pace. Possibly it's just his personal style in which case time will tell whether his approach is ""right"" or if this is indeed a weakness that (because he works at PIXAR) he'll soon fix up.The best moments have an exquisite timing to them and come across as effortless. They are more than the sum of their parts because they're so inspiring and original; it was almost disappointing for me once I got to find out more about the characters and wider situation. It ended up being much more limited than what I'd had in mind; what the first half had triggered. I don't think this is because the second half is weak so much as that the first half is great and that perhaps the second doesn't quite match up to it.I can't go much further without mentioning what is for me the biggest flaw of the movie: Thomas Newman's score. Without exaggerating, I felt that the film would have been substantially better if his score was replaced by silence. I thought the use of music and footage from ""Hello, Dolly!"" was inspired (although I haven't yet seen it). It's just some musical, right? But WALL·E sees and hears something in it and so do we. Also, the times when silence *was* used were very effective, especially because they add to the sense of isolation and encourage one to listen more carefully (rather than covering one's ears).But Newman's score was far too often intrusive, distracting and obvious. What made the first half of the film so incredibly touching was it's simplicity and sense of wonder. A large part of that is achieved by suggesting things rather than explicitly showing them. Newman underplays the action and emotions too linearly (and ineptly or at least unimaginatively) much of the time and this hinders the film's potential (even destroying some of it). This is especially the case towards the end where some slightly more derivative and even clichéd elements appear in the movie (Finding Nemo had some similar issues I thought). John Williams' score for E.T. The Extra-terrestrial (which does bear some comparison to WALL·E, having the common theme(s) of being alone in the universe, childlike wonder and the need to connect, etc) is full of unexpected tension and surprises which keeps the audience guessing, looking closer.Overall, I think the story itself is incredibly original and yet with universal appeal. For the most part, it is transparantly and passionately expressed but especially in the second half, the moments of more clichéd and forgettable material become more and more frequent. Luckily, they are always very brief and don't intrude upon every aspect of the movie. For example, the visual style and sound design are consistently awesome. In any case, the plot is always very easy to follow and the audience is constantly engaged and entertained. PIXAR are so far ahead of virtually everyone else in this area and yet they make it look so easy, the bastards ;)So, taking all that into account, WALL·E is a just about a masterpiece in my opinion. Andrew Stanton's possible weaknesses as a director (which are very slight indeed and only really noticeable because the overall technique is so transparent) aren't much of a problem because this is clearly his personal vision and I guess without the ""flaws"" we couldn't rightfully ask for all the other wonderful aspects of his humanity. As for the music... It's as if PIXAR have mastered the art of storytelling and animation and all the other aspects of film-making except for music (which isn't what they do anyway) and all they need is someone of similar ability and imagination. Don't get me wrong. *Randy* Newman's scores are awesome. But if they'd considered and then convinced, say, John Williams to do WALL·E, I reckon it might've probably've been the greatest film ever made. So far, that is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Very Exciting,"After hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for -- cleaning up the planet -- WALL·E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers a new purpose in life (besides collecting knick-knacks) when he encounters a sleek search robot named EVE.EVE comes to realize that WALL·E has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future and races back to space to report her findings to the humans who have been eagerly waiting aboard the luxury spaceship Axiom for news that it is safe to return home. Meanwhile, WALL·E chases EVE across the galaxy and sets into motion one of the most incredible comedy adventures ever brought to the big screen.Joining WALL·E on his fantastic journey across the universe 800 years into the future is a hilarious cast of characters, including a pet cockroach and a heroic team of malfunctioning misfit robots.

Near perfect.,"I just have to bite the bullet and come to accept that CGI animation just has a place in cinema. I've always said it looks incredible when its robots, animals and environments, but when you introduce the human element, it just doesn't come across as 'human' as traditional animation. Same occurred here. Some parts I was amazed how it looked like the action was being filmed _by_ a camera. But then the humans came. Which I was willing to actually not nitpick, but it doesn't help visually when in a scene you're establishing a shot with a CGI human and goddamn Fred Willard in the same scene. It's just jarring and it reminds you the people are just fake, no matter how real the robots look.BUT, as far as the story goes, it's near flawless. If you wonder how could tell a story with almost no words and just actions, this is how you do it. I had wished there were less 'people' interaction at the end.

However, a ship drops off a robot looking for signs of life. When the worker robot, Wall-E, lay eyes on her for the first time, that is when the magic begins.This is one of the best Pixar films I have seen better than all of them with the exception of the Toy Story trilogy.

"The movie begins in the year 2700, and the earth has been considered","Wall-E (2008) Film Review Directed by: Andrew StantonWall-E is a film for the ages. It was made to enrich the minds of its viewers, all while allowing us to enjoy the adorable tale of two robots that save the world. With a few underlying, environmentally friendly messages, this movie tells the story of two robots from two entirely different worlds, falling in love and finding a new haven in our old home.The movie begins in the year 2700, and the earth has been considered uninhabitable. Wall-E is a robot sent in order to take the trash off of the earth, and collects little knick-knacks while doing so. While collecting, however, he stumbles upon a knick-knack that's worth saving. It isn't until Wall-E meets the highly advanced robot EVE when he realizes the importance of his discovery. She runs back to the humans in order to let them know of Wall-E's finding, and that there is still hope for their home planet. After centuries alone, Wall-E couldn't stand the thought of losing his new and only friend, so he follows her deep into space, onto a spacecraft that the humans are forced to call home. On this grand adventure, Wall-E , who has always known what he was made for, gradually begins to understand what he was meant for.First and foremost, what is the ambition of this film? What is it trying to explain to its viewers? Well, that answer is quite evident. EVE enters the movie as a character in hopes of finding a way for humanity to survive as it did before. She personifies every man and woman out there hoping to restore this planet to its natural beauty, and give humans the chance to bask in its glory for many, many centuries. Wall-E represents the curious aspect of human nature, and the adventurous side of us that has yet to discover or release itself, until it finds a force to push it (in this case, love). Together, these characters explain the entire objective of this film. As humans still roaming this earth, we're losing the grasp we had on nature, we're deteriorating and forgetting how important our earth really is. We have to remember why we're here, we have to open up to curiosity and actually enjoy the adventure of saving our home.It's easy to say that the film has succeeded in getting its messages across. It uses its characters in a very clever fashion in order to create and depict certain concepts or ideas. For example, as inhabitants of this planet, it is up to us humans to really keep the earth alive. However, as technology advances and helps us live our lives with the very little need to be active or intelligent, we begin to care less about everything else around us. This concept is portrayed in the film by the actual humans within its diegesis. They have forgotten the concept of time, they spend their days eating and watching a floating screen in front of their faces. They live on the chair which they sit on, and have everything else done for them. They even learned to depend on robots to save THEIR home. However, these robots become a representation of our essential nature.The collision of two opposing forces created yet another sweet love story. Wall-E was the nervous, shy robot while EVE was the stern, intelligent, and stoic character in this film. They help create a concept of love between two entirely different beings. It tells the viewers how easily we can find companionship in someone who can be our total opposites. It demonstrates the unpredictable beauty of love, and how blind it is to one's social class, one's appearance, and anything that is not a part of one's soul.The relationship between Wall-E and EVE also depicts how a simple, innocent bond can be enough to open one's heart to any adventure. It can be enough to help us lose whatever fear we've held in our hearts, and actually go after whatever it is we find important. It shows us that one single person can be enough to make us fight for what we believe in, as well as what they believe in. Such as Wall-E and the plant. Wall-E had no idea why EVE needed the plant, or how it could possibly interest her. Nevertheless, Wall-E fought off the superior humans (owners of the spacecraft) and risked his life for that plant, only because he knew it meant something to EVE, who meant absolutely everything to him.This movie may seem like a silly, G rated Pixar film. Just another movie aimed at children, about two adorable creatures on some journey. However, there is more that meets the eye. This film hopes to bring to our attention the fact that our planet is slowly wasting away due to our oblivious attitudes. It shows us how the advancement of technology may actually hinder the advancement of the human race. Wall-E bring us to tears with a love story strong enough to reach the stars and back. Strong enough to face any fears and risk the lives of our two main characters. This movie is yet another Disney classic, a funny tale, and definitely a tear jerker. All of these elements combine to create a memorable and amazing film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wall E surprise me and proves that animated pics are still in my future,"I didn't think I wanted to see Wall E. I kept seeing ads and wasn't impressed and was very disinterested. I don't want to see some kids movie. So the movie is out, does great and everyone is talking about it and I get a little interested and finally go see it with little or no expectations. Then out of nowhere, 3 minutes into the movie I'm LOVING it. I was thoroughly entertained the entire time, laughing, enjoying myself and totally engrossed in the film. It really was so fun and a real gem. Wall E couldn't have been a cooler, more affable protagonist. I mean this was an adventure movie, love story and sci-fi flic all thrown into one. It just so happened to be animated...and VERY well done I might add. I guess I need to be more open-minded about these animated features because you know what else I loved...Kung Fu Panda.

Excellent animation movie with a message...,"1st watched 10/10/2009 – 8 out of 10 (Dir-Andrew Stanton): Excellent animation movie with a message. The story revolves around a world left in ruins to be cleaned up by robots(aka. Wall-E's) while the humans find refuge in an outerspace station where they are pampered and grow fat. Wall-E is getting a little bored of his routine where he day-in and day-out turns refuge into blocks and disposes of it. He gathers relics(similar to Ariel in ""Little Mermaid"") to make his time more interesting and has a friend in a roach with antenna's. Then arrives another robot searching for plantlife for the humans named Eve. Wall-E becomes infatuated with her but her prime directive is notifying the humans when she finds a plant and then staying in the spot until they return to pick her up. The idea here is when she finds it, they can come back to Earth to re-colonize. There is very little dialogue in this movie yet we understand the emotions of the characters, which shows us how amazing the animation is by the Pixar people here. There is a lot of slapstick similar to old Warner Brothers cartoons giving us plenty of laughs with a plus being a message about us taking care of our motherland, the Earth. This is a real step up for a cartoon studio and it's all done really well. It's amazing how such a small idea was expanded out to make this very well done movie.

Occam's robots,"The robot WALL-E, much like HAL 9000 in Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", did evolve through some sort of unknown higher order logic. While HAL's program paths started to differ from the calculations of his twin machine on earth, WALL-E develops emotional reactions and keeps going while the other machines of his make are long defunct.There is however one big difference between WALL-E and HAL: while HAL shows rather verbose responses, WALL-E does not or cannot talk much at all. And EVE, the other robot that comes into play later, is about as monosyllabic as WALL-E. Also, their gestures are quiet limited, WALL-E can shake his telescopic old-school binoculars a little and EVE displays a high-tech screen with one color bitmap eye-like silhouettes.However, this is enough for Andrew Stanton and his team to express a relationship between WALL-E and EVE which is deep enough to repeatedly move the viewer to tears. While the movie works best on the emotional level, it also contains intellectual surprises. It deals with similar topics like Spielberg's A.I. - but in a lot purer and (even) more intelligent way by almost completely leaving out the concepts of good, evil and unnecessary melodramatic elements.It is simply amazing how the robots in this movie were stripped from every unessential gadget and how these machines grow into the heart of the viewer only by the doing of their deeds. The movie does on top of this display a very high degree of artistic visual perfection and simply contains a story told well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Great movie with lots of questions,"I remember seeing this the first time and didn't really watch it as closely as I have now with my son. First, I would like to say the movie is great! One of Disneys best films. With that said I just noticed some things that got my mind curious.First was the timeline, 700 years I know the writers are giving the more time to clean up and become sustainable again, but 700 years is so much time that you have to question some things in the movie that don't add up. 700 years go by on a planet with harsh conditions would have destroyed most items the movie shows. There is no way paper would be legible, batteries to be able to work, (wall-e s place, paper money and news papers on the ground, video monitors working, Wall-E being able to survive, metals deteriorated, car alarm chirping, just to name a few). Then there is the aging, did you notice all the captains were over 100? There is no way they could live that long on the diet they eat.The trash, in this money is an eye opening experience to the way the world is heading but I don't understand why stacking them high would be helpful? Also side note, why would Wall-E not take two cubes of trash up the high rise trash building, one in hand and other in him? Trash on the ship? Why so much and why dump in space? But think about it, the ship appears to never dock for supplies, so where is the trash coming from?How space works. When Wall/e takes the plant out of his chest to give to Eve would destroy the plant instantly.Aging if people. Anyone else notice how people looked normal in the beginning to later become cartoon characters later in life. Was this some hidden prank by writers?Type of movie that gets your head spinning is all, but in the end a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wall E is one of the kind cartoon movie.,"To date, this is the most unique movie produced by Pixar so far. Unlike the more hyped Brad Bird's two movies(Incredibles and Rattatoule), this one really delivers a new classic.I think it's a one-of-the-kind cartoon because: 1, it's so hilarious fun to watch the most impossible event happening on the big screen: robots' romance, which naturally leads to the conclusion that Wall E has a really good script, a script that is so freely written that it ignores all the common senses and scientific notions. It's virtually a futuristic comedy version of Romeo and Juliet, presenting the forbidden love between robots(supposedly forbidden). Prepare to have some revolution in your mind if you are going to see this one because this is the most romantic sci-fi so far.2, concerning the script, you can argue there are plot holes: for example, if Eva's mission to the earth is to search for any life form on the earth rather than destroy them, why would she have such a mass-destructive weapon, which detonates so many times when she sees something moving around? Secondly, if she was searching for any form of life, why would she ignore the cockroach? Furthermore, Eva's spaceship, which traveled through several galaxy systems to reach the colony ship, didn't perform a super-space jump, which means it was traveling very fast. But Wall-E was able to hang on it all through the process, how did it happen? Well, I still want to argue...But stop! Nobody would spoil the fun when watching this movie because they are all caught up in the lovely characters and obsessed with this greatest inhuman love ever presented. This is how Pixar writes a screenplay, we should all bow and learn from them.3, The technical perspective: easily flawless. The abandoned earth is so beautifully decorated that you would believe it's real, which reminds me of I Am Legend. The physics, mechanics of robots are all convincing enough, and have been a carnival for eyes.Wow, there are so many great things to say about the movie, really can't say them one by one. But believe me, if Wall-E doesn't get Best Animated feature for Oscar and best screenplay nomination, kick my butt!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
