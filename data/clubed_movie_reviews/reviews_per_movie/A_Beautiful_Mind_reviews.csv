"Powerful, quiet, effortless Crowe","A Beautiful MindDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says ""Russell Crowe"", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a ""hunk"" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Direction makes it beautiful,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is an exceptional story, but it is only and exceptional film because of its director.  Ron Howard does an amazing job of engaging his audience, introducing a brilliant main character, and making the audience experience the reality of mental illness.  This could have been an unbelievable story to which very people could relate; however, the directorial mastery Howard exhibits throughout allows the audience to accompany Nash on his journey and awareness of his illness.  Anyone who has been close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate how respectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject.  Howard is able to portray all the complex reactions to mental illness while maintaining the humanity and dignity of the patient.  Superbly directed, wonderfully acted by Crowe and cast, this film succeeds on every level.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Crowe Does It Again!,"The more I watch Russell Crowe, the more I am becoming a big fan of his acting talent. Here again, he demonstrates his skills in a role that had me spellbound. Of course, mentally-ill people are usually fascinating. Look how popular the cable television show ""Monk"" has become.Crowe's character, mathematician John Nash, is not nearly as eccentric as ""Monk,"" but his schizophrenia makes for a fascinating portrait of a very troubled man. This is another of those Ron Howard based-on-a-true-story films, so don't take everything here as gospel truth....because it ain't so. (One example: in real life, Nash's wife was anything but as supportive as Jennifer Connelly was portrayed here.)The first time I saw this film I was disappointed. Maybe I expected more, maybe I felt the story was unfair to the viewer and I felt like this was just one more attempt at Liberal Hollywood to make fun of those in the 1950s who were opposed to Communism. Well, on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago, I didn't have a problem with any of those things, just enjoying the performances and the classy-looking cinematography, thanks to one of the best cameramen in the business, Roger Deakins. I'm not always a fan of director Ron Howard, but his films are usually interesting and pleasing to the eye. He and Crowe seem to be a good pair, too, as witnessed by 2005's ""Cinderella Man.""For those who enjoy a cerebral thriller, this is a very intriguing film. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas and Anthony Rapp all deliver solid supporting help and, if you haven't seen this, this story will deliver a big surprise. If you know the ending, a second viewing is even more interesting as you trace Nash's actions from the beginning.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A movie with a difference - It's realistic.,"I went along to the movies not really wanting to see this movie, thinking it was a 'girly' movie, one which had more technical skill rather than a storyline. I was surprised more than anything I could imagine.I have seen a lot of movies in my time, but this movie just took me by storm. Its uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation was a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood blockbuster. This movie provided a brilliant (pardon the pun) insight into many aspects of a genius at work.This movie touched me on many levels. The psychology of the movie was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually realistic from my own experience, and the icing on the cake making the movie stand out was surprisingly the humanistic side of Love. While love is a common basis in most movies, the interaction of this theme with other aspects of the plot was planned phenomenlly.As for the cast, I have never noticed the actual difference in skill between many actors/actresses before. I like Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise etc, but I wouldn't be able to pinpoint a classic actor's performance. But Russell Crowe in this film showed me what it was like to act in a way where I was in awe of his skill in playing this character, especially when considering the extreme difference from characters in his other movies such as the Gladiator and The Insider. Russell Crowe was one of the big reasons this movie was so brilliant. Added to that the stellar performances of Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Adam Goldberg, and this made for the 'perfect' movie.A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original, intelligent and entertaining movie I have ever seen. And this from a movie I didn't expect big things from. Kudos to Ron Howard, the cast and the crew of this movie. It was truly worthy of the Oscar, and Russell Crowe was definately the most deserving of this production team to miss out on the highest accolade. Perhaps politics played a bigger part than I previously would have thought.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Admirable and extremely well made, if just missing the mark of a ""great"" film","'A Beautiful Mind' had a lot going for it. An intriguing story based on an interesting man, a great cast full of talented actors, the involvement of James Horner and Roger Deakins (perhaps one of the best modern cinematographers in the business) and Ron Howard as director (a very competent director with some great films under his belt, directing always with a lot of quality and polish if not always distinction).Finally seeing it, always wanting to but never quite having the time, 'A Beautiful Mind' was to me a good, often very good, film, if not quite great. Of its four Oscar wins, Connelly and adapted screenplay (on the most part) were worthy wins, though there were better contenders in the Best Picture and Director categories, 'Fellowship of the Ring' for Best Picture and David Lynch for 'Mulholland Drive' for director. Again, from personal opinion, 'A Beautiful Mind's' Oscar nominations were worthier of wins generally, especially Russell Crowe for Best Picture, make-up and the film editing, cinematography also should have been under serious consideration.There are a few things that stop 'A Beautiful Mind' from being great. Pacing can be messy, feeling rushed in some spots and then dragging in others. Admittedly though there were other places where it was perfect.Do agree with the portrayal of schizophrenia being problematic, it is a sensitive and courageous subject to address but those with schizophrenia and mental illness in general will find problems with how it's portrayed. It is a complex and often frightening illness, that the film tries to take seriously and sensitively, but it just felt too clean and like it was being careful not to offend but ended up being too careful. Other aspects are heavy-handed.The espionage subplot was intriguing mostly and gave some powerful conflict, at the same time parts not quite gelling with the rest of the film and feeling a little confused.However, 'A Beautiful Mind' for want of a better word looks absolutely beautiful. The cinematography with the vibrant colours and seamless fluidity was one of the best of its year, and the period detail remarkably evocative and a joy to look at. James Horner's score has garnered mixed views, mostly leaning on the positive, personally though it added a lot to the emotional power of the film, swelled thrillingly and was beautifully and cleverly orchestrated, didn't think it was melodramatic at all.'A Beautiful Mind's' adapted screenplay really makes one think while also capturing a wide range of emotions, more than making up for the lack of accuracy. The story is compelling on the most part with a spot on portrayal of mathematics, something that was praised by the maths community at the time including John Nash. It is very moving and uplifting, many scenes dealt with powerfully.Ron Howard's direction is some of the best he's done. As ever from him it is rich in quality and polish but it also is some of his most distinguished and shows that he can direct with distinction (even if he doesn't always elsewhere.Can't praise the cast enough, along with the visuals it is the best aspect of the film. It is impossible to find fault with the powerhouse and perhaps career best performance of Russell Crowe, while Jennifer Connelly is touching in a loyal and sympathetically written role (even if not as challenging as a few of her other roles such as in 'Requiem for a Dream'.Ed Harris is chillingly malevolent, while the rarely less than game Paul Bettany and Adam Goldberg charm and Judd Hirsch and Christopher Plummer also not putting a foot wrong.In conclusion, admirable and extremely well made, directed and acted with a sizeable range of emotions, if missing the mark of being a ""great"" film instead of a good and often very good film and not doing enough justice to a great man and his life. The divisiveness is understandable. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Le génie frise la folie / genius is close kin to madness,"A poorly tailored trailer does not begin to describe what is one man's journey from the heaven of clear thought to the hell of schizophrenia.Russell Crowe does an excellent role as John Nash, a mathematician who revolutionizes Group Theory, only to have his mind crash into confused and split views of the world.Jennifer Connelly is superb as his wife. It is through her that we begin to understand the range of problems and pittfalls Nash is facing, most of his own devising. She deserves an Oscar, period.The director has arranged beautiful 'red herrings' to kept viewers guessing and it works suprisingly well.

Superb Acting and a Gem of a Film,"Ed Harris, Russel Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, and Paul Bettany were terrific.The film had great balance and is worth a viewing.The story boldly addresses mental illness as a handicap.Because of the quality of the acting and directing, this movie is a beacon of hope for people of all disabilities. The film illustrates to the viewer how deeply a handicap can infiltrate the domestic, professional, and personal lives of those unfortunate to have these types of issues. I hope Ron Howard and the acting crew can get together again for something similar. This was a great film, that also serves an important role for awareness to people that might not understand how deeply debilitating these issues can be, and also gets the message across that not all should be marginalized.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"John Nash, schizophrenic genius.","John Nash is something of a mathematical wizard. Constantly searching for something with which to make his name, he finds his calling by code breaking for the government. But with that comes a sense of paranoia and pretty soon John is sliding desperately into schizophrenia.There is a school of thought that says any decent film about the mentally ill or afflicted is a sure fire way to attract the awards givers. Personally it bothers me that it bothers me that people view these films in this demeaning manner. If a story is worth telling then lets get it out there for all to see. Would the cinema world and all those stuffy film lovers really be happy if film makers didn't tell these remarkable stories? A Beautiful Mind is one such picture that divides opinions, although exemplary made and well put together, it doesn't adhere quite to the facts of Nash's life-it's an interpretation that smooths out the drama by way of delivering a safe and watchable biography. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning four for Best Film, Best Director {Ron Howard}, Best Supporting Actress {Jennifer Connelly} and Best Adapted Screenplay {Akiva Goldsman adapting from the book by Sylvia Nash}. Yet as great as that roll call is, the big surprise is the omission of a win for Russell Crowe in the Best Actor category. For as tidy and engrossing as the film is, and it is folks, it's because of the big Kiwi that the film breaks free of your standard emotional heart tugger. It's a superlative performance from Crowe and him not winning is probably more to do with his much publicised dust up at the BAFTAS a few weeks before the Oscar ceremony: than his undoubted acting ability.The film as a whole should not be viewed as a representation of John Nash's life, many important things from Sylvia Nash's book have been omitted. But crucially it's important to note that in making this film, the makers have brought Nobel Prize winner Nash to the public's attention, whilst simultaneously giving awareness to the sadness of those suffering with schizophrenia. OK, so it's far from perfect in its portrayal of Nash the man, but ultimately the cinematic world is a far better place when the likes of A Beautiful Mind are being made and the film lovers are flocking to see it. And then some. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
seeing russell crowe in different view,"for some unknown reasons, i almost never liked crowe until i saw this movie. He played the role so beautifully and totally absorbed into being john nash rather that just a typical Hollywood actor. I bet he must have done his homework thousand times before finally bring it to the screen. The way he walks, the way he slide himself between the gate at the abandoned warehouse where he thought was a Russian secret movement operation center, the way he talks, in fact, everything, was portrayed perfectly that it actually concealed that very russell crowe that i never actually liked.The movie was somehow close to me as my uncle, who was a genius,also suffered from schizophrenia, but passed away years ago. I cried when nash was seen sitting on his house balcony because i remembered that was how my uncle used to sit for hours, solving puzzles. the only difference is that, nash had all the chances and supports from peers and the society but my uncle never did. It was a shame.Connelly was good as ever, and she had always seen carrying this type of role. Loving yet not so mushy, smart yet vulnerable at time.Despites all the comments about the movie not being so realistic and not really based on the facts of Nash, i still think it deserves one the of the most beautiful movies i had ever watched.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

A beautiful snow job,"The movie is supposed to be the life of Nash. It is not. It is a sanitized air brushed fallacy. Part of a beautiful mind is a mind that cares about others, doesn't abandon women he impregnates of a ""lower class"", doesn't get arrested in bath house raids for public indecency and of course no mention of the long divorce. Not so beautiful a mind. A beautiful snowjob.The acting is good, and the production excellent, but I harbor a particular contempt for movies that lie about real historical people.

A Beautiful Story Told Poorly,"While I deeply appreciate the contribution of Mr. Howard and the other contributors to this project to deal with difficult subject matter, I find there are many critiques I would choose to offer.  The license the film maker takes to entertain us leaves many truths of this story stretched far beyond the reasonable.  It troubles me that a serious film maker would make such flaws as are made with issues relating to facts that are easily verifiable.  For example, lectures are given prior to the awarding of a Nobel Prize, and acceptance speeches are never given.  Dramatic license is one thing, but his speech could have been written into the script in hundreds of other places, rather than leaving the masses with blatant misrepresentations.I adored the performances of the two main characters, though Ms. Connelly could have been given so much more.  Mrs. Nash is half of the story of Mr. Nash,  and yet her character was reduced to being two dimensional at best.  Mr. Howard and the screen writers all but ignored secondary characters, letting them stand merely as bridges to move from one main point to the next. This is completely irresponsible film making.  Has Mr. Howard become so comfortable and confident that he has forgotten what it's like to take risks?  I think he's the epitome of everything that is wrong with American film.  It's long on safe choices, short on quality of development.I enjoy Mr. Howard's films for basic entertainment and storytelling value, and he does have a wonderful eye for background detail, among many of his other unmentioned talents.  I think he has promise, but his films are beginning to cater so much more to the masses than to true and honest work.  This leaves me both sad and bitter, because he could be a great director if he really allowed himself to take chances.He plays it safe, and for that audiences adore him and he makes a studio very happy.  No doubt he will be regarded as one of the top directors of our time, but this regard does not make the fact true.  He could be so much more, and I for one keep paying to see that happen because I have hope.  Yet with each passing film, I find the same tired tread of someone who wants to make a spectacular commercially successful film, that I want to ask him to please do something incredible.  Ed Harris looks like he's becoming bored with his one dimensional sideline characters in all of his Howard films, and this is not fitting for such a wonderful talent.   Only two characters were allowed to really shine, and certainly they deserve their acclaim, if for no other reason than the direction is stale.The script was decent, but left so many incredible wholes that I can't imagine why it took nearly two and a half hours to tell this wonderful story of John and Alicia Nash.  It's taken me a few days to digest how unsatisfying I felt.  I became too dazzled by the two main characters o see the incredible flaws, and I can only feel sorry that this important story was not only a poor representation of Mr. And Mrs. Nash, but much fictionalized for dramatic license.This film should have been given to a more capable team, such as Steven Soderbergh or P.T. Anderson, or even Hal Hartley.  I think the film wouldn't have been as successful commercially, but artistically and for story content, this would have been a much better movie.  To Mr. Howard, I give the big raspberry.  Boo, I say.Boo.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

I am losing count.I first watched it at the recommendation of my abnormal psychology professor, maybe in 2010? I did not watch any trailer nor read anything about the film - I just dived in blind and watched it. Having done this paid off, which I still do today.I was so glad I did not watch any trailer nor read anything about the film because by doing this was able to avoid the biggest two twists in the story, especially the ending. Learning about these twists live as you are watching the film for the first time is much more effective than if you already had them spoiled by reading about the movie.

Jennifer earned her Oscar and Russell should have won the Oscar instead of Denzel Washington. The supporting cast did fine too. Everything in this movie was good.

Mathematics & The Higher Truth (or) You Can't Hold A Madman Down,"If you can look well-beyond this bio-film's exaggerated sentimentality, its ""schizophrenia"" whitewashing, and the fact that its story was only very loosely based on the real-life genius/mathematician, John Nash, then, yes, you just might find it's worth sitting all the way through its 135-minute running time (which did, indeed, wear on this viewer's patience more than once).From my perspective - A Beautiful Mind seemed to be more interested in spotlighting Nash's mental illness (and his imaginary friends/alter egos) than it did about concentrating on his amazing ability to crunch all of those numbers.As well - The focus on Nash's relationship with Alicia Larde (unconvincingly played by Jennifer Connelly), who eventually became his wife, certainly had a tendency to become an irksome ""soap opera"" bore, which grated on my nerves, often enough.A Beautiful Mind covers approximately 40 years of Nash's life, from the 1950s to the 1990s, when he was co-awarded the Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences. Nash is still alive today.Anyways - Regardless of my beefs and believing that this film has really been so over-rated, I still give it a 6-star rating.*Note* - If you have the time - I suggest you Google images of John Nash just to see how his looks compare to those of Russell Crowe's, the actor who portrayed him in this film - And prepare yourself for something of a mild shock-eroo!",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Unprecedented Genius Often Times Goes Unnoticed!!!,"It is difficult to acknowledge anyone who is above and beyond the run of the mill!! People possessing ability or prodigal genius are often times, not even aware of it!!Russel Crowe is sensational in this movie, as he plays Nobel Peace Prize winner, John Nash!! A critical prerequisite to an actor or actress executing a role effectively, is that he or she can astutely grasp a thorough understanding of the role itself!! This film has a performance by Russel Crowe that can be compared with Tom Hanks performance in ""Forrest Gump"" and Matt Damon's performance in ""Good Will Hunting"". All three actors in these movies established a noteworthy precedent in the cinema industry by portraying characters who had an intense comprehension of the character's adamant convictions!! In all three cases, these characters had a self worth which exuded an unintentional greatness!! ""A Beautiful Mind"" deals with an individual named John Nash, a hermit with an unassuming cerebral charisma who is considered gifted (i.e. not normal). The denotative explanation of normal is ordinary... This individual is extraordinary!! Not normal is often times referred to in these precarious terms... strange, different, or unusual!!! A person who drives a Rolls Royce is strange!! A baseball team that wins the World Series is different!! A person who becomes a CEO of a Fortune 500 Company is unusual!! An exceptionally brilliant mind is not normal, this movie depicts the ramifications of such a blessing in disguise!!! Reality becomes a rude awakening for John Nash (Russel Crowe). His brilliance is not always easy to empathize with because his actions are so reckless!! He perpetually demonstrates a relentless affliction with formidable schizophrenic influences!! Many people who deal with John Nash encounter this illness with trepidation, and it throws them into a tailspin!! For John Nash, this is an obsessive preoccupation which requires a necessary detachment!! The producers of this movie want the audience to view John Nash's (Russel Crowe's) mental handicap like you are from the outside looking in!! It is for this reason that this movie manufactures a succinct obviation of emotional security for John Nash as a way of giving the movie audience a thorough conception of Professor Nash's dilemma!! Ultimately, he attains a noteworthy recognition from Princeton's prominent academia!! This is an accolade which most of us only dream about!! Ronny Howard and Brian Grazer do a remarkable job at directing this film, as their creativity homogenizes!! Their cooperation with the coordinating producers, as well as the actors and actresses in the movie, was not perfunctory, rather, they engaged in a rudimentary commiseration with virtually everyone who was involved in the creation of this film!! The acting in this movie is terrific!! Why the acting is so terrific in this movie, is mostly on account of the fact that all of the performers in this film were mutually challenged!! ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a marvelous film which left an indelible impact on the intellectually sensitive movie viewers!! Perhaps many of them painstakingly pondered the statement of ""I need to believe that something extraordinary is possible"". What is normal is ordinary, and, what is not normal has the potential to be extraordinary!! If you stop and think about it, it is truly enlightening when something extraordinary occurs!! If you can thoroughly conceptualize this, than the directors of this film have attained a zenith in artistic gratification which is absolutely spectacular!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Amazing portrayals, editing, cinematic style and chemistry","This movie is just brilliant. The acting is brilliant. The portrayals of that period in time is brilliant. The directing is brilliant. It's brilliant. The movie may not be as accurate as the reality, but it displays the effects of schizophrenia on the mind and of those around in a way that is accessible to everyone. I would really like to read the biography of John Nash now.Russell Crowe does a fantastic job getting into his character, that he pretty much becomes John Nash. He is like Eddie Redmayne in Theory of Everything, or rather Eddie Redmayne is like Russel Crowe and Theory of Everything is like A Beautiful Mind of 2015. Jennifer Connelly (who seriously looks like Demi Moore) is great in this too. I won't get into how her character is entirely centred on being a care taker, but perhaps that's how it was. Anyway, her acting was great and the emotions she portrayed could be felt. The rest of the cast too were brilliant and you could really feel how in character they were.Ron Howard did a great job directing this to be a masterpiece. I would expect that it would be hard to connect with this kind of character and to keep the audience involved in the film, but Howard does it perfectly. Also, Crowe portrays Nash in a semi-charismatic and witty way and as the audience, we are just drawn to him. Great job on both their parts.The editing and make-up are pretty phenomenal too. The editing of time passing and cuts of scenes make the film engrossing to the viewer. The scenes during and after the revelation of his mental state mimic his inner turmoil as the mood of the film tones down from there to one that is more sober. The make-up is especially noticeable as the characters age and there is a dramatic difference between their appearances – in a good way. It's incredible how make- up can do wonders.I don't really find this a problem in the movie, but it did add and or change events from reality. For one instance the ending scene with the pens is not a custom at all, and the relationship between John and Alicia was much more rocky than was portrayed. As a portrayal of real life situations and people, I feel like they should have respected what happened instead of 'Hollywood-izing' it. I still love the movie though.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Exceptionally written and acted movie.,"A beautiful mind was another superbly directed and acted movie both by Russell Crowe and directed by Ron Howard. The way Howard normalized Nash's schizophrenia and tried to get the audience to understand it more was an achievement in itself. At first it is hard to realize Nash's condition with all his eccentricities, abruptness and his incredible intelligence it becomes hard to know he is crazy. The way his delusions seemed so real it became hard to know when it was real and when he had his delusions. Some may criticize the movie because of the spy stuff and other stuff added as just another Hollywood thrill. This just shows the skill of Ron howard to create a picture of insanity identical to reality. While Russell playing nash you never question how realistic the portrayal is, he doesn't rely on makeup or anything elaborate, his walk, words and voice is what makes the character more alive. The performance of Jennifer Connelly was a very added addition to the movie. The chemistry between Crowe and Connelly really gel and you feel that they belong to each other. Every part of the movie came together perfectly and they all complimented each other that made it a more inspiring piece of work. A lot of people should see this movie not just cause Crowe is in it or of who made the movie but because of what you can learn by watching it. Hopefully learning compassion when dealing with the mentally ill. By new found knowledge the next time you see someone talking to themselves or someone you know has a disorder you might understand what they might go through and that they will be needing your continued love. Since they will be just as frustrated and confused as you might be. If you wanna see a movie where everything fits and everyone is at the top of their game then this is a movie for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Mental illness- Ron Howard style.,"Mental illness has never appeared so snuggly and warm. Watch Russell emote, tics a' flyin!  Watch lovely Jennifer Connelly start her descent into Calista Flockhearts diet zone! Listen to the heart tugging strings as the Ronnie Howard team schmaltzes up a good story and makes it all shiny and happy! The saccharine level was tough, but with enough salt from the popcorn counter I just about made it through. Never mind that the true story of this man is amazing, like Disney before him (and the glowy sitcoms that informed his 'early work') Mr. Howard takes a tough and beautiful story and grinds it down so that it's almost unrecognizable.

Russell Crowe proves his acting versatility,"This movie starts in 1947 Princeton where John Nash (Russell Crowe) is trying to start his career. He is not impressed with anybody else there, and searches for an original idea. He is awkward and very peculiar. Then one night at a bar, a tall blonde and her friends walk in. It gives him an idea to overturn Adam Smith's theory. This allows him a placement in the Wheeler Labs in MIT. Years later working at MIT, he meets student Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) who would eventually become his wife, and the mysterious William Parcher (Ed Harris) from the DOD.Russell Crowe has been a leading man for awhile but this one proves once and for all his versatility. He is amazing throughout giving a praise worthy performance. Jennifer Connelly makes a great entrance as she shows her brains as well as her beauty. Director Ron Howard is spot on with this movie. He allows Crowe the space to lead. It's a very human character. It's the best picture Oscar winner for a good reason.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Splendid job turned in by Crowe and Howard,"Ron Howard brings forth one of his best and most serious films to date, A Beautiful Mind.  It examines a mathematical wizard named John Forbes Nash Jr. who created a discovery in game theory that is still used today for a number of things.  But the film isn't so much about math (what film is?) as it is about the man's struggles with a disease in his mind that drives him to madness yet somehow is able to try and fight it to the best of his abilities, which aren't always as high as they could be.  This man is played by Russell Crowe who gives another top shelve performance to add with The Insider, L.A. Confidential and Romper Stomper (Gladiator I don't really count as a top shelve performance), and he plays Mr. Nash so well it doesn't need to be thought that he's immitating him as much as being him.Crowe's Nash starts off in the film at Princeton university where he wants to distinguish himself with an original idea and soon comes up with one that defies 150 years of mathematical practice.  Things look good, especially since he starts dating a graduate student (Jennifer Connelly in an Oscar caliber performance to be sure) who is smitten with him.  But then things start to get troublesome- Nash is asked by a member of the defense depot to break codes that could be in newspapers, magazines, etc to help out the government.  Soon he feels paranoid the Russians are after him, and this leads him into a mental hospital (under Christopher Plummer's care) where he learns the entire consipracy is in his head (schitzophrenia).  Then the plot thickens as Nash battles with his disease, medication or not.Sometimes it's almost too much, but Howard delivers overall a great and compelling tale throughout nevertheless and Crowe shines (the rest of the cast, real or not, are also quite credible) with all the talent he has. Grade: A+ or A.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Beautiful Mind,"A reasonably typical example of Hollywood's continued fascination with the complexities of the Cold War combined with a nostalgic recreation of the period. The achievement of 'A Beautiful Mind' was acknowledged to the tune of four Academy Awards - the total would almost certainly have been five if Russell Crowe had behaved himself at an earlier ceremony.The development of John Nash from lonely introvert to advisor on Work of National Importance made for an engrossing experience, while the final revelation (SLIGHT SPOILER COMING:) when it finally came of the true nature of his companions certainly came to me as a complete surprise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Endearing (if slightly hammy and exaggerated) biopic,"O John Nash's story should be more widely known; however, I think dramatizing and over-exaggerating these biopics does more harm than good. The life portrayed is no doubt interesting, but there is a Hollywood tendency to latch too much on the other aspects of a film in order to draw in the less focussed viewer. Russell Crowe does his bit to rescue this production as the star, and Connelly, Harris and Bettany are also excellent, but their scripts allow only so much scope for personal talent to shine. It is also worth noting that this movie is so late 90s/early 00s in its style that its slightly laughable at points. There is a soft light filter over the entire film, and the music is dramatic to say the least. The origin of the story is good-natured (and Crowe does do an excellent job as Nash), but by the end, I wondered what the real Nash would have thought of his life story's trivialisation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Moving depiction of schizophrenia,"A Beautiful Mind tells the story of Nobel Prize winner John Nash and his struggles with paranoid schizophrenia.Always antisocial, Nash possessed a brilliant mathematical mind and made contributions to geometry, game theory, and equations.Around 1959, he began exhibiting signs of schizophrenia and was eventually hospitalized. His disease nearly ruins his academic life and his marriage.Ron Howard has made an amazing film here, one that brings us into Nash's illness and gives us an idea of what it feels like - and be unaware of it at the same time.Russell Crowe approached his role with sensitivity, humor, and honesty as Nash becomes increasingly ill and gradually learns to ignore his hallucinations and benefit from treatment. Jennifer Connelly as his loyal and caring wife gives a wonderful performance.

A Compelling Movie,"I was nearly 20 years younger when I saw this movie. However, it's impact on me is still fresh! The movie first makes us admire the protagonist and empathize with him so completely. It is only towards the end of the movie that we discover an unpredictable twist! The love story woven into the plot is also very moving. All actors but especially Russel Crowe and Jennifer Connelly draw you into the plot with excellent performances! Want to watch it again!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Russell Crowe's finest hour,"The plot of A Beautiful Mind is relatively simple, as we follow a brilliant math student who climbs the academic ladder but also dives into the dark waters of mental illness.The way this story is told, though, elevates the movie to the next level. It's not easy to fit an entire lifespan in two hours, but the movie flows naturally and handles the various changes in mood (it jumps from comedy to romance to thriller to drama). Any trick or technique used isn't meant to show off, it feels like an organic part of the story. Another thing the movie achieves is offering us a glimpse of schizophrenia's effect on the human mind, making us question what's real and spreading a sense of doubt that can't be shaken off.However, all the above is secondary and the elephant in the room has to be addressed, namely the absolutely mesmerising performance delivered by Russell Crowe.Apart from the increasingly disturbing scenes that show the development of his state of mind, there are many other memorable scenes as well, for example his social awkwardness when flirting with a girl and informs her that intercourse is merely an exchange of body fluids, or his first date with Alicia where he creates any shape with the help of the star system and of course the scene where he receives the pens of his peers and with them their recognition.As it often happens with biographies, it isn't 100% accurate, there are some changes for dramatic effect. The most obvious example is probably his relationship with his wife, which was way bumpier than portrayed here and actually led to a divorce at some point. Also, the fact that his son suffers from similar issues could have been brought up, but the movie was fully invested in a feel-good ending, declaring love as the winner that overcomes any problem.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"""A Beautiful Mind"" is a terrible thing to waste your time on","I cannot believe the people that rave about this movie.  ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a terrible thing to waste your time on.  The movie's direction is manipulative and the screenplay is horrid.  I thought this was suppose to be based on the true life of John Nash.  Didn't his wife divorce him in real life? Yes, she did.  Wasn't Nash a homosexual? (Nash says no, but.) Yeah, right, Mr. Nash.  Let's not use truths here let's just make up some stuff that an audience will like.  Well, Hollywood, I might have liked the movie more if his wife had divorced him or if there was a homosexual tinge to the film.  I needed to feel for the character and all this character was is a jerk.  Hell, he says it himself, ""I have a chip on both shoulders"".  The movie makes him come off as a womanizing jerk.  How can I care about him. Well, because Hollywood says we should feel for him and the media says it is a great film.  That's why we like it.  Give me a break.  I know this day will never come, but, I sure wish it would, when will people learn to make there own decisions about movies, music and tv shows, etc. instead of allowing themselves to be conned into liking something just because the media says it is good.  And, don't get me started on the Academy Awards because all that is now is a popularity contest.  The best films or actors or screenplays, whatever, might get nominated but they don't have a chance in hell winning, ie.  ""Memento"", ""Ghost World"", ""Mulholland Drive"", etc.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Mind's Complex Tapestry,"'A Beautiful Mind' stands as a cinematic portrayal of both the power and fragility of genius. At its core, this film is a biographical narrative about John Nash, a Nobel Laureate in Economics. The movie navigates through Nash's intellectual triumphs and the tumultuous journey through his struggle with schizophrenia.The narrative structure of 'A Beautiful Mind' is both intricate and engaging. The screenplay adeptly introduces us to Nash's mathematical brilliance and gradually peels back layers to reveal his mental challenges. The transition from his academic achievements to his psychological battles is seamless, maintaining a balance that keeps the audience invested in Nash's journey.Thematic depth is one of the film's strongest suits. It delves into the themes of perseverance, love, and the thin line between genius and madness. The depiction of Nash's schizophrenia is handled with sensitivity, avoiding sensationalism and instead offering a window into the struggles faced by individuals with mental health issues.On the technical front, the direction by Ron Howard is noteworthy. Howard manages to bring out the emotional depth of each scene without over-dramatization. The cinematography complements the narrative, using visual cues to distinguish between Nash's reality and his hallucinations. This subtle yet effective technique adds to the viewer's understanding of Nash's internal battles.The performances are a crucial element that elevates the film. Russell Crowe, portraying John Nash, delivers a nuanced and compelling performance, capturing the complexities of Nash's character. Jennifer Connelly, as Nash's wife Alicia, provides a strong emotional anchor to the story. Her portrayal of unwavering support and love in the face of adversity adds a profound layer to the narrative.The film does have its moments where dramatic liberties are taken, which might not completely align with the actual events of Nash's life. However, these liberties do not detract from the essence of the story but rather serve to enhance the emotional impact.As the review progresses from a neutral analysis to a personal sentiment, I must express that 'A Beautiful Mind' left a deep emotional imprint. It's a film that not only entertains but also educates and evokes empathy. It's a poignant reminder of the human spirit's resilience and the power of love and support.In conclusion, 'A Beautiful Mind' is a beautifully crafted film that succeeds in capturing the complexities of the human mind and the unpredictable journey of life. It's a film that resonates long after the credits roll. Rating it, I would give it a solid 8.5 out of 10, for its profound storytelling, exceptional performances, and its sensitive yet powerful portrayal of a complex mind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"Thank you, movie. People are stupid.","Here is the problem: People fail abysmally in foreseeing simple things. And in factoring in that other people might easily foresee simple things. As an example: Banks can't go bankrupt. Governments will rescue all depositors. Banks have nothing to worry about. Banks can foresee bailouts. Governments can't. Too stupid. Strangely enough, governments actually refuse to foresee that banks implicitly rely on them, at all times. Nash invented a theory called 'game theory.' Which works beautifully. And is extremely simple. But it's only simple if a) you foresee simple things and b) appreciate that others might foresee simple things. It's soooo weird that 99% of global population fail at a).

What does it take?,"In this incredible tour-de-force for Russell Crowe, he embodies the complex emotions and brilliant mind of John Nash, a mathematician at Princeton. It's a heartbreaking true story, and one of the tragic things about it is that Crowe didn't win his Oscar for his performance. What does it take? He'd already won his the previous year, for a comparatively overrated and watered-down performance in Gladiator. Don't throw anything at me. Watch both movies during a weekend and admit that I'm right.This is a very heavy movie, so even if you watch the preview and think it's a heartwarming romantic drama, you won't be prepared. No offense to the Oscar-winner, but Jennifer Connelly's part is pretty much parsley to Crowe's main dish. It's his show, plain and simple. It's his question of, ""What does it take?"" to the Academy Awards. It makes Good Will Hunting look like a knee-slapping comedy. Keep an eye out in the supporting cast for Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Josh Lucas, Adam Goldberg, Austin Pendleton, and Judd Hirsch.

Into the mind of a genius. And madness.,"This is a true story of a mathematical genius. John Nash (Russell Crowe) has made mathematical solutions that were never thought of and are used all over the world today and won him the Nobel prize. A man who was far ahead of his time, but a brilliant mind can border on the edge of madness. In John's younger years, he began having delusions of secret agents and being on a mission to protect his country by cracking hidden codes set by the enemy, hidden in newspaper clippings and magazines. The question is, is John really schizophrenic, or is he really involved in an operation to stop nuclear war?I am not a fan of Russell Crowe. As a matter of fact, I think his ego is way too big for his public stature, but in this movie, he is just brilliant. It's a superb piece of acting. It's one of the best I've seen in my life. Crowe delves deep into the mind of madness and genius so well he has you wondering what is real and what is delusion. Later in the movie you find the truth. Great performances by Jennifer Connelly as Nash's beautiful and understanding wife Alicia. A woman in whom Nash may never have collected some sense of sanity without. Ed Burns is also great as the hardlined CIA operative who almost convinces John to commit the unspeakable and John Bettany as Charles. This is a great piece of cinema about the nobel prize winner John Nash and his amazing yet incredibly difficult to control life that is moving. You must watch just to see Crowe at his best. He is truly amazing in this!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Not perfect but a typically polished and professional story that is well told,"As a young man, John Nash is antisocial, arrogant but quite the mathematical genius. After months of failing to live up to expectation due to focusing on trying to find formula within the mundane. However a major finding brings him to the attention of the Government and sees him set up within a secretive department looking to crack the code that will lead them to a Russian bomb hidden somewhere within the US. Starting as just a series of problems, John's involvement deepens as the Russians move to stop the code breakers and only John's handler Parcher can protect him. Meanwhile the secrets start to affect John's personal life.Despite all the hype and awards I didn't feel that fussed about seeing this film and just decided to wait for television to bring it to me for free. Having finally seen it I must admit that, while not being anything brilliant, it is certainly a very professional and engaging product despite some big flaws. The story is based on reality (if you pardon the irony of that) and it doesn't matter too much if it skims over some issues and omits some very well-publicised aspects of Nash's life. The story is well written and is the better for focusing on the confusion within Nash between reality and imagined because it does help move the film forward all the time. Conversely the weakest moments are in the rather mawkish and sentimental moments within reality  fortunately these are not that often and generally the film moves forward well and I did find myself quite engaged by it.Howard's direction is up to his usual standard, by which I mean that it is polished and professional even if it does lack anything in the way of flair or unique talent. Crowe is very strong though. Much better than the ego and the headlines would suggest, here he delivers a performance that convincingly changes across the film and does the tricky thing of making the audience feel and understand a character in a way that was very difficult to pull off. Connelly is nearly as strong in a smaller role and Ed Harris has fun with a powerful character who noticeably lifts the pace when he is on screen. Bettany is his usual self and good value for it and support is generally good from Plummer, Lucas, Goldberg and a few others.Overall a very polished drama but one that is engaging for the majority. The pace is generally good despite sometimes being a bit too sentimental and laboured, and the delivery generally pulls off the difficult task of putting us into Nash's world and allowing us to feel for him and understand him.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
a beautiful movie,"Prior to ""A Beautiful Mind"" coming out, I had never heard of John Nash. Then, this movie blew me away. While most critics panned it, the viewer gets completely absorbed by every performance. Russell Crowe does an excellent job as Nash, starting out with his days as a student at Princeton. As the movie progresses, we see his schizophrenia evolve. His wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) is virtually the only person who can understand him.""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of those movies where you are surprised as you learn various things about the characters. Also, maybe the movie's timing might have helped it. After September 11, 2001, we needed something to show us that human nature is not inherently evil. This movie, released a few months later, did a great job reminding us of that. All in all, I consider it very appropriate that this movie finally got Ron Howard a Best Picture winner (plus a Best Director Oscar).

In fact, the best picture SHOULD have gone to LORD OF THE RINGS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING instead.In the beginning of A BEAUTIFUL MIND, I found myself thinking, `Wow, this really IS going to be good!' Because I, myself, thought RUSSELL CROWE shouldn't have won best actor for GLADIATOR 2 years ago, and now I was thinking that this'll make up for that. Wrong! After Crowe's character starts becoming paranoid-an effect of schizophrenia, the movie just got weird. Something about it just was out of place, and though I know this film is based on the real JOHN NASH, I personally feel RON HOWARD messed up chances at possible good film. Among many other weird sequences with his `friends,'  at the end of the film, though it may be a true story, I actually felt depressed-the OPPOSITE of what Ron said he tried to create at the end. I felt that out of his whole lifetime, all he did, all the terror  All John Nash got was one Nobel Prize?. And the other weird thing is, that he STILL sees those people -- the man, the girl and the spy. While this may be true, I got more of a horror vibe at this thought, rather than a ` wow, what an accomplishment.' Ron could've presented this fact better than showing an 80 year old Nash, walking the college floors, and peering behind him, revealing the people, still standing there. I got a very, very weird feeling seeing this.The movie itself, wasn't that great either. Sure, it's good material, but not Oscar worthy! Jennifer Connelly didn't do that great at acting in this film, either. She did better in THE LABYRINTH! Don't take me wrong, this film's good, but not Oscar worthy. And like I said before, this film feels more like a horror picture than anything else, much less a drama! See it, like it, whatever. But don't tell me it deserved an Oscar. Why does everyone like Ron Howard films? All I've REALLY likes so far were APOLLO 13 and RANSOM. Other than that they're okay. NOT Oscar worthy though. This year's Academy Awards were given to the wrong people, and pictures. I'm sorry, but that's just my view of this film. Sue me, but I'll let you know, I'm giving A BEAUTIFUL MIND a good rating, just not a great one. 3/5 stars-If you've got some points to point out, r just to say something about a movie I reviewed, or even to agree with me, you can email me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

A great character study.,"Ron Howard is certainly a prize. There is such a danger when one plays with the audience's sense of reality, that things will become so confusing as to destroy any consistent engagement. The story of John Nash is remarkable. First of all, we have this brilliant man, this genius. He carries on daily discourse and is a success in every endeavor. However, underlying everything is the hallucinatory world of his disease. How do you respond to the correct reality when there are so many. How do you go on when you know that some of the people you speak with aren't real; that some of the issues dominating your life are objects of paranoia and fear. Howard and Crowe pull this off in full view of the audience. When the movie is over, we understand. Then there is the fact that there are people who wake up every morning and face the type of day that this man does. If he were a raving lunatic it would be one thing. But he continues to make his way through life. Those around him are constantly off balance because they have to recognize that what he says may have not foundation. You look for the evidence, not the word. The direction takes us on a journey that hasn't been done before.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The BD Spotlight,Going in blind to the story almost makes it better. Not knowing what was real and what wasnt was a major trip as a viewer.

So I'm not going to say a thing about the story.  I'm just going to say that this is a fascinating story beautiful told and acted. It's funny, dramatic and touching but it never feels manipulative (well, maybe once near the end), letting the emotional effects come naturally from the actions (unlike other Ron Howard movies).  It is a movie that starts good and gets better and better as it progresses.  The story is told simply; the director doesn't let himself get in the way of the material.  So trust me, stop reading these little reviews and watch it.  I rate it 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
You've seen a summary many times,"Although I very much enjoyed the movie, there were a few things that held me back. Russel Crows unlike in ""The insider"" is too much Russel Crows for my liking and I probably would appreciate more an unknown actor for the part. The other drawback, I have spent most of my working life in mental institutions as a nurse; although I do appreciate RC's effort to mimic schizophrenia it did not work for me and I had to imagine it was OK to go with the story. I remember having similar feelings for Jack Nicholson in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. Mental illness is not often very glamorous or entertaining (but nonetheless, yes it has its moments!) I wonder though if the movie had any influence on mental illness services anywhere in the world? I would guess, probably not. Mb",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
I Can't Believe Crowe did not win best actor for this,I can not believe Denzel Washington beat Crowe out for best actor on this. Russel Crowe acted circles around Washington.  I believed this is his best role.  It will be hard for him to beat this.  He was great in Gladitor but even better in A Beautiful Mind.  It was a sad movie where one overcomes one's disability through one's special gift.  They aged him through out the movie and did a fantastic job doing it.  I found the movie very inspiring.

Hollywood dumbs down a fascinating biography,"Checking the requisite Oscar boxes, Ron Howard sanded off all the actual cruel edges of a genius suffering with very real and horrendous paranoid schizophrenia in a largely fictitious tale of how love can conquer all. Unfortunately, the Hollywood treatment conveniently ignored the hard realities of what was actually a fascinating biography of a man struggling a lifetime to balance his genius and madness, leaving viewers with an abundance of sanitized movie madness scenes, very little glimpses of genius, and a romantic relationship with no apparent basis.

Very good movie,"I think that it is a very good movie. I really think that Russell Crowe does a great job in portraying mental illness as a very real and harsh thing to have to live with. I think that One problem that I did have with it was that it really did not accurately portray schizophrenia very well. In the movie John Nash was clearly having visual hallucinations, which is really not that common in real life and the real John Nash even said that he never had visual hallucinations. However I guess that this just to make the movie more interesting. It would have been more boring if he was just having auditory hallucinations. I think that my favorite scene is when he first meets Dr. Rosen (who is my favorite character) at the math council and John Nash things that he is a Russian spy.

A Beautiful Movie,"John Nash is a quiet, introverted man. A brilliant person who doesn't quite fit in. His roommate Charles is always there to help him get through the difficult times in his life at university. Russell Crowe is, again fantastic in portraying John Nash. With Jennifer Connelly as his wife Alicia and Paul Bettany as his roommate Charles, this film sets up to be a great film about the success of a gifted person. Unfortunately that is not how things progressed. John Nash's mind leads him down a self-destructive path that neither friends or family can save him from. With espionage and government intervention around every corner it is impossible to know which way to turn. Ed Harris is excellent as Parcher, the dark government agent who, it seems, hires Nash to work at a secret government facility to help decode vital information. Directed by Ron Howard ( Robin Hood,3:10 to Yuma and Apollo 13 ), A Beautiful Mind is one of the few movies based on a real life, that actually translates into A Beautiful Movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Though designed to be prestigious, the beauty does manage to come through","Academy Award winner for Best Picture begins at Princeton, 1947, where mathematician John Nash (played by Russell Crowe) is flailing away at an economics theory while all his male classmates just want to get laid (the film equates the average Princeton male to the type of guys usually found on TV's ""Happy Days""). Five years later, Nash is working with the Pentagon on numerical formation patterns and appears to be pulled into a conspiracy plot to thwart the Russians from detonating their H-Bomb on American soil. It isn't surprising that ""A Beautiful Mind"" won the Oscar; it has been designed specifically for prestige (i.e., awards). However, it's a sentimental, dramatic package which gives its time-worn movie theme--mental illness--a few new twists courtesy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, adapting Sylvia Nasar's biography of John Forbes Nash Jr. (the Academy normally frowns upon edgy concepts, yet this one has an old-fashioned set-up, which they welcome, plus a lead performance preconceived to be a triumph). After a rocky first hour, the picture does improve. Howard methodically sets up the plot mechanisms, but gives us a fascinating main character who is disconnected, a failure at social interaction, and a really bad first date. Nash's future-wife (Jennifer Connelly) isn't particularly intriguing or enchanting (she has dim thoughts, such as ""God must be a painter, why else would there be so many colors?""). Still, by the second act, Nash's personal crisis has become more clear to us, more involving and gripping, and Crowe isn't so much deliberately one-note as he is intensely focused (the actorly tics come later...and, when they do, they are almost endearing). The film has that slick look of ""grand entertainment"" that makes critics bow their heads, yet there are indeed miraculous moments: Nash neglecting to take his medicine and discovering an entire covert operation going down in his backyard shed; Nash, recuperating, riding his bicycle in an infinity pattern, scribbling numbers in the air with his finger. The mental institution stuff is the cinematic equivalent of treading water (and wastes Christopher Plummer as a doctor), but the last half of the film is quite good: a brilliant but disturbed professor working his damnedest to overcome his demons, helped along by a loving woman and receiving the kind of respect he never dreamed of. Howard isn't always graceful or sensitive (especially in the electric shock sequence), but he does resurrect a tired genre and ultimately makes it a moving experience. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Highly overrated,"This film gets tremendous amounts of credit for being very real, and for Russel Crowe's supposed brilliant performance as the lead. I say these people are missing a few things. First of all, Crowe's role may not have been easy, but he certainly isn't masterful at it and is often either over-the-top or just not entirely credible and never seems completely ""in"" the film like some actors can make you forget they are paid actors with lives outside a film. Another thing is the film is very much a plain account, a mere biography, of some brilliant mathematician who had to struggle with severe schizophrenia. Nothing earth-shaking and not much to work with besides retelling the story, this film deals a lot with just events rather than a cinematographic interpretation of those events, and the parts that are indeed rendered movie magic are over-celebrated, emotionally void and subtlety-deprived moments that engage the audience forcefully with overdramatic music and classic thick cinematic methods rather than through a strength built through heart and genuine emotion. This film painfully lacks heart and an authentic atmosphere. It is just a mechanically carried out drama affair that collects gratuitous amounts of credit, it doesn't deserve. Hollywood in the works, industrially produced, executed and sold. No art or personal touch found here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Ron Howard has no right to change the history of Game Theory,"This movie is a premium example of hollywood taking a wonderful real life story, changing it altogether to make it edible for the general public and coming up with a movie full of lies. As just a movie, I can see some people will find it interesting. But the movie presents rubbish about Economics and Nash and, of course, game theory. Nash didn't invent game theory as the movie kind of tried to portray. He came up with a notion of equilibrium whoich is simply brilliant and he more than deserves the Nobel.  I think coming up with the equilibrium notion is more of a contribution than iventing game theory. But of course they had to change it to make it sexy enough. The movie is full of lies like this. I understand that most people will not enjoy the movie as much if it were truthful. Nevertheless, that doesn't change the fact that the movie lied about game theory.

a thing of beauty,"Gripping true story of John Nash, a brilliant but troubled and introverted mathematician who astonished people with his uncanny code-breaking ability, but also baffled them with his aberrant social skills.

Aided by his long-suffering but deeply devoted wife, he goes on a journey of self-discovery to conquer his demons and once again become the man she's always loved. Director Ron Howard's biopic of the bizarre, socially inept mathematician pulls you in emotionally and never lets go, creating a surreal, startling world of science and imagination, with unforgettable characters and jaw-dropping makeup effects. Connelly, in an Oscar-winning role, is sincere and believable as a strong-willed woman who refuses to leave her husband's side, while Crowe is simply shattering as the antisocial Nash.

Mathematics Does That,"I am an electronics engineer and during the course at first I felt I had enough time to explore mathematics to its entirety, and it was proved so awfully wrong in such style by the most basic patterns and behaviours--real numbers. Disgruntled, I watched this movie and Oh, my Gosh! Mathematics makes so common and simple things so overwhelmingly profound. What more do you need to know that the fact that there is an infinity in between any two numbers! In fact, when you think of any two numbers, or any number for that matter, it is somewhere from the infinity between any other two... continuity is made discontinuous instantly. Jhon Nash is a figure who lives it. Alisha makes love infinite. Nash drowns and develops gills. Alisha swims in the sky. The Noble prize in the end is often seen as belittling most of Nash's so called Rough work, which must not be. Well, I hope it helps you understand that there is an infinity within everything, more so in what we feel. It's a lovely story.

Hypekill.,"There's little doubt that ""A Beautiful Mind"" is an excellent film. There's also little doubt that it was buoyed from buzz to Oscar acclaim by hype, strategic PR, and a gullible public. Taken in and of itself the film is rather ordinary among excellent films and not worthy of much of the critical acclaim it garnered. I personally found much of the film uninteresting, tedious, and downright boring. After all, how does one relate to someone whose accomplishments are so abstract as to be buried in esoteric symbolism and someone whose illness is so intangible as to be a state of mind? The beauty of mathematics and the war with the demons of delusions were not brought sufficiently into focus by the film which spent too much time trying to develop a rather uninteresting character, making his delusions our delusions, spicing it up with a car chase and shootout, fleshing out the mental ghosts, and showing the principal's eccentricism with endless scribbling on window glass.

Too handsome for its own good...,"While this film is very moving in its own right a more daring film that didn't ignore the thornier aspects of Nash's life would have been better. Nash's delusions were more outlandish than the film suggests; he thought he was in contact with aliens for example. Likewise, he had affairs (and was arrested for public indecency), was quite mean at times and was possibly anti-Semitic. Nash in the film is too pitiable and awkward to really capture the tenor of this stuff. The resulting film isn't bad but it lacks real weight as a result.I do rather like the trick the screenplay and direction pull off in regards to Nash's delusions vis-a-vis the viewer's expectations. It is an effective, through probably inaccurate, way to capture what paranoia feels like. Howard stages the action in that classic Hollywood way that makes the story involving.The film largely succeeds on Crowe's and Connelly's winning performance. For the type of role he is in Crowe is rather understated. Connelly is just sensuous and heartbreaking in this film.This film has grown on me over the years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"""A"" for Acting, ""B"" for Story, ""C"" for Accuracy  that adds up to a ""B"", right?","It feels pretty paltry and dry to grade a film on accuracy  especially since ""A Beautiful Mind (2001)"" is a dramatization and not a documentary. But when the director not only chooses to omit significant aspects of its biographical figure but richly glosses over almost everything in his life in a lush Hollywood coating up for Academy praise, then I as John Nash, would feel pretty stiffed at seeing the end result. But then I am not John Nash  I'm just a movie-goer looking to be entertained, touched and inspired in some way, and I was 2 out 3.These two points are difficult to pinpoint, but I would attribute one of them to the acting in the film, which is sensationally layered and realistic from all parties. Russell Crowe may be a jerk in real life, but he clearly knows his stuff on screen and he is very convincing as genius-mathematician-turned-schizophrenic John Nash. We follow his career and his life starting out at Princeton, getting married, and ending up in Stockholm, heartily accepting the Nobel Prize. He ages 47 years in the film but Russell Crowe is perfect at every stage.So the film makes it clear to us that John Nash is a genius man. Yet I was never mesmerized by his 'beautiful' mind  not in the same way I was with other cinematic geniuses in films like Good Will Hunting, Pi, Enigma and Amadeus. This is because you cannot trace his mathematical thoughts, we do not get to follow his genius pattern ideas and oh, when he draws an umbrella-shape in the stars for Alicia (Connelly) IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE AN UMBRELLA. At all. It looks like a couple of dots, sorry. Very romantic, poignant moment though.While this sounds like a happy and acknowledged life, it is everything but for John Nash. He is the victim of schizophrenia, which makes him paranoid, delusional and insecure. He is never at 'the height of his career', but always a bruised man plagued by his own mind. It just takes him a while to realise it and shake him from his paranoid state. This part is handled superbly in the film -- the break-down is perfect and heartfelt and Jennifer Connelly is there as a supporting wife all along.That actually bothered me somewhat, and it is where the glossy Hollywood autopilot is switched on and Ron Howard leans back in his directing chair. While Russell Crowe is great and Jennifer Connelly is great, their marriage is TOO great. The real Alicia Nash wasn't the pretty little devoted wife to a troubled husband all these years; she divorced him in 1963. Another polished detail that irked me (moreso than the perfect marriage) was the Nobel Prize culmination. The real John Nash shared his prize with two others, but in the film Russell Crowe appears as a sole winner giving a poignant, sappy speech about ""the equations of love"", and the audience cheers, claps and stands up at the end of it.So in summary, if you do not mind the occasional lofty Hollywood approaches to drama, then this is a very good film. Russell Crowe carries it, Jennifer Connelly supports it and Ed Harris and Paul Bettany add further weight to an already respected cast. It is a well-sewn together product with nice cinematic harmony and my favourite aspect was the subtle nuances in John Nash's delusions that distinguished them from reality. You can spot this at the beginning if you pay attention.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Complete Rubbish!,"This film is despicable garbage.  It has the bare-faced cheek to use a mental illness as an excuse to switch up cinematic genres and it's deeply offensive.  The first hour is completely incomprehensible filmmaking--why does no one, except the viewer, realise there's something wrong with Crowe, I mean, aside from all his bad acting?  Howard straight-jackets all the other actors to prolong his device of dual realities that once revealed, makes no sense whatsoever.  Why don't we as an audience view the sets as any normal person would and focus on Crowe's bizarre behavior?  Just so Howard can make us think we're watching a bad espionage thriller?  Why does every other actor in the film just stand around dumbfounded, forced to give maximus (erm, I mean, maximum) room to Crowe's showboating performance? And what were the details in Jennifer Connelly's pact with the devil to make this wretched film?  Her's is a great beauty that can be used to tremendous effect when a director knows what to do with (like Aronofsky in Requiem). Howard just heaps on the mascara and probably made her wear curlers to bed every night. I can only thank God there was a fire alarm in the cinema so I missed the wretched ""old age make-up"" scenes that looked likely to rival those in ""For The Boys.""

"A Beautiful Mind"" is a captivating and thought-provoking film","""A Beautiful Mind"" is a captivating and thought-provoking film directed by Ron Howard and released in 2001. Inspired by the life of Nobel Laureate John Nash, the movie tells a powerful story of brilliance, struggle, and triumph over adversity.The film follows the journey of John Nash, portrayed brilliantly by Russell Crowe, a brilliant mathematician with a remarkable mind. However, Nash's life takes a dramatic turn when he is diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mental illness that challenges his perceptions of reality. As Nash grapples with his condition, the audience is taken on a rollercoaster ride through his hallucinations, delusions, and the impact they have on his personal and professional life.What sets ""A Beautiful Mind"" apart is its ability to merge elements of drama, romance, and psychological thriller. The film expertly captures the audience's attention by creating a compelling narrative that balances Nash's inner struggles with his external achievements. The portrayal of Nash's relationship with his wife, Alicia, played by Jennifer Connelly, adds an emotional depth to the story, highlighting the power of love and support in the face of adversity.Russell Crowe delivers a remarkable performance as John Nash, portraying his complex character with depth and authenticity. He successfully conveys Nash's intelligence, vulnerability, and the internal battles he faces. Crowe's portrayal earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor, and it is well-deserved.Director Ron Howard does an excellent job of immersing the audience in Nash's world. Through clever cinematography and visual effects, the film effectively portrays Nash's distorted perception of reality, blurring the lines between truth and illusion. This technique enhances the audience's empathy for Nash and provides a glimpse into the challenges faced by individuals with mental illness.""A Beautiful Mind"" not only sheds light on the personal struggles of an individual with schizophrenia but also explores the importance of human connection and the power of the mind. It challenges societal stigmas surrounding mental health and offers a message of hope and resilience.One potential criticism of the film is that it takes certain liberties with the real-life story of John Nash. While the movie does capture the essence of his life and struggle, it deviates from some historical facts for the sake of storytelling. However, this artistic license does not diminish the impact or overall quality of the film.In conclusion, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a captivating and emotionally charged film that delves into the life of John Nash and his battle with schizophrenia. With exceptional performances, skillful direction, and a compelling narrative, the movie provides a moving portrayal of the human spirit and the triumph of the mind over adversity. It serves as a reminder of the power of perseverance, love, and the resilience of the human mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
An Extraordinary Movie!,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of the most wonderful films I have seen in a long time.  It tells the story of mathematician John Nash and his rise to Princeton, to his fall with mental illness, to his rise as he overcomes his condition.  Russel Crowe's performance is certainly Oscar-worthy, becoming Nash on screen and realistically and emotionally portraying this character that is so different from others he has played on screen.  Ron Howard deserves a big nod, as well for successfully allowing the audience to get into Nash's mind and share with him his fears and relationships due to his mental condition.  Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris were also at their best in this film as supporting roles.

Overall, this movie nearly brought tears to my eyes in multiple scenes. The success of Nash in the beginning of the movie set it up to be happy-feel good movie, but devolving into mental illness turned the film on its head and gave more life than what I originally expected. The ending brings tears to my eyes. Sadly, the only thing I was frustrated with was that I only discovered the movie now, instead of years prior. Amazing movie, would definitely recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A well acted Biopic and an interesting take on a life.,"A well acted Biopic and an interesting take on a life.How could I put this, is it the best display of a schizophrenic patient or a biopic of a mathematician who went on to win a Nobel against many odds of his own hallucinations. This is both, and indeed this movie is of John Nash (Russell Crowe) and his story of becoming one of the finest mathematicians ever who has influenced a big deal in research of various subjects.Now, 5 minutes into a film we know there is mysterious, he fights with a friend whom others don't see now this very figment of imagination is blown out of proportion by his own mind and he goes through too many things. Now, that interesting, so there is a man who has hallucinations of seeing people, he is a real man and he has a story that is interesting nevertheless. So, Ron Howard picked it up and transformed into a better one using the screenplay which I must say is engaging in most parts as those hallucinations keep coming back. The other part is naturally mundane as those are the regular events which might happen to anyone.Here, I mean wining Nobel prize does not happen to anyone, yet winning a nobel having such delusions is what made Nash special and that's what made this whole film special. It's tough to be understanding what Nash actually is and why is Nash, the way he is.We are not shown of his birth nor his upbringing, we see him walk into a college as student and begin his journey there. So, there re still few questions unanswered but I would still say this a great watch and better leave those unanswered questions behind, coz the answers might have killed the interest.The cinematography is great and so is the sound and the art design, all are at their place and there is an impetus given by the screenplay itself which I must say is near to something of masterpiece. Yet, it may have its shortcomings as I felts some scenes are overdone just to create an impact. So editing could have been crisper.Above all, a memorable performances by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly take this movie into a different altitude altogether and that's the reason both have deservedly won many awards. Also, a word about the wonderful blu-ray that provided such remarkable details.It's a 4/5 for a movie that I must say is great and if not anything watch Russell Crowe alone perform John Nash and its worth all the time and money.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Better Than Average Genius Movie: A Beautiful Mind,"I love math, and I love intelligent films about intelligent people, who do intelligent things. But I don't like watching someone suffer on film. The reason I didn't give this film a higher rating was the excessive amount of time and excessive number of scenes depicting John Nash's obvious disabilities. OK , we get it; the guy is sick and suffers schizoid and paranoid delusions. So did my mother, but I tended to overlook her problems because of her wonderful outstanding qualities. They should have done the same in this film.Russell Crowe is exceptional for the second year in a row (He did Gladiator the year before). Ed Harris is always right on the money, and Jennifer Connelly does a wonderful job as his the steadfast wife of Nash.The scenes depicting Nash's talents and accomplishments were far more inspirational than the cheesy attempts to include us in his delusions. We know he is delusional after the first few scenes with the bogeyman from the CIA or NSA. I understand these scenes are necessary to show his pain and difficulty with these afflictions, but there is no need to hammer it with extra scenes that prevent us from discovering all of the wonderful game theories and how they were discovered by Nash. Still a very impressive film, however.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The mind can never be understood.,"Frighteningly deceptive. I'm not sure what to think about this one, but maybe that's what makes a good film. My eyeballs couldn't stop watching this once it started.

If you don't shed a tear, then you either weren't paying attention to the film, or you haven't been through life.I'm sure this is one of those movies which many people flick on when they feel life struggles getting heavy.

Don't mind the inaccuracy. It's just an average entertaining.,"For the entertaining aspect, this movie surely enjoyable. It has an easy plot, good performances, with movie goers directing style. Besides that, the cinematography is a little bit above average. But i'm sorry to say this but, this movie is just an average. 70-75 rating no more.The one thing we must appreciate is Ron Howard himself. He was really versatile as a director. He can direct such many kind of genres. Early 21th he made such a good entertaining drama-biography movie ""A Beautiful Mind"". Later, he made a mystery ""Angel and Demon"" and ""Da Vinci Code"". Another time he made a sport ""Rush"". Far before them, he made sci-fi ""Apollo 13"". Wow that was bunch wide genres.This movie has been weaken by the director himself in some way. Hollywood has a culture to change the way the plot goes on. And that happened in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Maybe Hollywood want to change this movie into something more enjoyable and light. It's alright, we definitely can't judge a movie from the inaccuracy of it's plot. But they change it into something uninspiring, a little bit melodramatic, and untemperament. That was really not good for this kind of genre (drama biography based on true story). It's not match at all, it's blunt.Although Ed Harris and Crowe's performances were good (not superb). And also the cinematography. That's all that rise this movie rating into 70+. My recommendation is, just try to enjoy this movie.

"I finally saw ""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001), and I really liked it.","It had a fantastic script with great performances by Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany and Adam Goldberg. I'd give it a 9 out of 10.I had no idea that Crowe was this good of an actor. He had a ""Rain Man"" role in this film, in which an established actor can show his range by portraying a mentally ill person. Yet even his terrific performance here was maybe outshined by Harris'. I don't know what it is about Harris  but he grows on you. He's a great actor, even in a somewhat one-note role like the one he has here. He can be forceful and intimidating, and even genuinely frightening, but also sympathetic at the same time. (See his performances in ""The Stand"" miniseries (1994) or that Saturday-afternoon, guilty-pleasure standby, ""The Rock"" (1996).) Plus he's just got a damned cool voice. And those crazy-ass eyes that bore right through you. Seriously, if Ed Harris were your Dad, would you ever f%#@ up as a teenager? Ever? I would never come home late with beer on my breath, EVEN IF ED HARRIS WERE AN OUT-OF-STATE UNCLE.Ron Howard's directing was good – very good. Still, I couldn't help comparing him with other directors who have a genius for this kind of source material. This is a movie where the main character comes to doubt his perceptions of reality – when I think of films like ""12 Monkeys,"" ""Vanilla Sky"" or ""Jacob's Ladder,"" I couldn't help but wonder if their directors really would have given a tour de force with this story's fantastic elements. Think about it  if Terry Gilliam had directed ""A Beautiful Mind,"" wouldn't this great movie be even better?All in all, though, this was an excellent film. I cheerfully recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"Good movie, great acting, but inaccurate","For those who don't know, the poor rating will not make sense. For those who've heard but think its no big deal, I disagree with you. For those who know and care, please help stand up with me.It is fact, not speculation, that John Nash was at very least bisexual, and the tendency to suppress this fact only adds to the stigma of shame thrust upon those of us who are not happily heterosexual. The people who write the scripts insist on changing facts to make the movie more mainstream and profitable, to make it more palatable for those whom share distaste for people who don't fit into how their egos require.It is a shame, because this movie could have been groundbreaking beyond its intriguing portrayal of a brilliant man's inner turmoil, done so well otherwise. You cannot use an excuse that revealing a complex man's complex natures would only give the story too much distraction.I would have enjoyed the movie otherwise but found the omission disgusting. Much like 'The Martian Child' by David Gerrald that was successfully translated to bigscreen, but because it would be 'unacceptable' to have characters 'marred' by so-called character-defects that would reduce their likability, well we certainly can't allow children to have such role models, can we?I am fortunate to be well-educated and well-read, to have known that gay or bisexual men can be awesome and powerful, not just amusing.

sometimes confusing but very good,"What Ron Howard did to this movie is what no other director could.

The movie actually goes inside Nash's head and we can see how much suffering he is going through and how people don't understand him and the other way around. It was confusing at first, because I couldn't tell whether Ed Harris's character or the others were real or not and if the world that he was living in was a fake, just like the Truman show. However, it is a true story and the world that he lived in was real enough. Russell Crowe gives his best performance ever, even better than Gladiator. You can see his emotions and his fight to overcome those struggles. Ed Harris and everyone else do a great job with their roles.

As the story might have offered some interesting possibilities the film shows us Russell Crowe overacting as bad as he could possibly do. At no time through this 134 minute piece of boredom the viewer can actually believe that John Nash is supposed to be a mathematical genius. We rather get the impression of a clumsy, slighty overweighed farmer strolling around campus.

Especially when John Nash gets approached for winning the Nobel Prize and some scholarly gentlemen give him their pens. It was emotionally stimulating, especially since we saw him in awe watching another Nobel laureate receive these gifts.As for dealing with the sickness is concerned, I find it substantially real.

"A beautiful film, rich with able filmmaking and gripping storytelling","A Beautiful Mind is an outstanding cinematic achievement. On one hand, that is because of truly Oscar-worthy filmmaking in every possible aspect, but on the other, graver hand, this is due to it introducing a mass audience to mental disorders. As all but an expert on this topic, I'm in no position to assess whether the film is realistic and respectful to actual patients, but bringing people closer to the minds of schizophrenics and other mentally ill by making a star-studded Hollywood film out of their perspective is rating praise already.Ron Howard realized a great mixture of drama, romance, action, and humour with A Beautiful Mind, something many directors attempt to do nowadays, clearly resulting from the award-winning prospect it brings along, but only very few succeed in. Story-wise, the film is immensely entertaining, touching, and just as beautiful as its title suggests. Another major merit of the four-time Oscar winner is its lead actor Russell Crowe, going from heroic action star in Gladiator to socially awkward genius in just two years. He performs extraordinarily in both productions, but his portrayal of the real-life figure John Nash is a far greater achievement. His on-screen partners do wonderful work as well, even if some of the characters do conform to stereotypes.The film's cinematography is of no lesser quality, capturing the past times the story is set in in gorgeous colours and imaginative shots, such as Paul Bettany defenestrating a desk out in Princeton's snowed campus or the seasons passing outside while John is working on the theory of his lifetime. All of that is accompanied by a James Horner score as melodic and fitting as hardly any other in film history and one that is also a pleasure to listen to on its own.Thus, A Beautiful Mind is a more than deserving Best Picture winner at the Oscars and a film worth watching more than once.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Beautiful Dream,"Russell Crowe said the following winning his academy award: ""You know, when you grow up in the suburbs of Sydney or Auckland or Newcastle like Ridley Scott or Jamie Bell or the suburbs of anywhere, a dream like this seems vaguely ludicrous and completely unattainable.

The intelligence of Nash is obvious, and therefore it is no surprise that he discovers groundbreaking theories (his own original idea). However, the development of Nash is the centre of the entire picture, and Ron Howard has done a great job making these images possible. It's a great mystery to me that Crowe didn't win an academy award for this movie, his performance is excellent and flawless.

However, much harder to investigate what part the severe illness played in his decision making, especially at the time just before his most serious term of hospitalization.As for the movie, it's a wonderful record of a man's struggle with schizophrenia, which (Yes) highlights his a academic career and success.

But his work of performance in 'A Beautiful Mind' takes him to a place only a Cinema-Fanatic can merely imagine!Based on the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a Nobel Laureate in Economics, 'A Beautiful Mind' unfolds wonderfully. Some lives are worth hearing about, talking about, and Mr.John Nash is one those very-few gifted people, who prove the evil within us wrong. A Legendary Man, his ups and downs, his strengths and weaknesses come alive in 'A Beautiful Mind'.In my opinion, There are some films that entertain, There are some films that enlighten & There are some films that simply motivate. 'A Beautiful Mind' is a rare combination of all the three genres mentioned above!Mr.Howard won each and every award possible for his work-here, and that isn't a surprise at all. As mentioned above, this film takes this Genius to a level only a few people make it to. Akiva Goldsman's adapted screenplay is marvelous. Roger Deakins Cinematography is awesome. Music by James Horner, is excellent.In the acting department, Russell Crowe is fantastic as Mr.John Nash. The star/actor sinks his teeth into the part and delivers a performance that can silence even his worst critics. To state this as his finest work, would truly be an understatement. Jennifer Connelly is superb as Nash's Spouse. She performs like never before, and is at par with Crowe in several scenes. Paul Bettany is effective. Ed Harris is, as always, note-worthy. Josh Lucas is good. Christopher Plummer is restrained.On the whole, 'A Beautiful Mind' is a Remarkable Film in all respects! One of the Greatest True Stories, translate, into becoming, One of the Greatest Films of it's time! Two Big Thumbs Up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Beautiful Melodrama,"This is a wonderful film in many ways. The mental struggle Russel Crowe's character endures is heartbreaking. What a powerful mind, too much so even for life, relationships, and happiness.There are a few twists. Most folks will be able to predict one or even all, but, nevertheless, you are along for the ride with Crowe's character. Even if you are not as surprised by certain story breakthroughs as some will be, the connection you feel to John Nash is undeniable. You want to see him succeed and you want him to just get better.Either way, I consider this film melodrama, with some truly outrageous occurrences that push it into the realm of silly, but, not enough to ruin the overall impact of the film.This film requires your attention for full immersion into the story, but, you will not be disappointed if you put in the effort.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
It's just not very good.,"This movie was so overrated and boring.  If I wasn't loaded with sugar filled skittles I would have completely fallen asleep.  Russel Crowe was passable, and that means a lot coming from me because I loathe Russel Crowe. Jennifer Connoly did NOT deserve that oscar.  She wasn't that good, what is wrong with you people!  Dreamworks again bought out the Academy Awards just like they did last year with that overrated Gladiator starring that person I despise.  Ron Howard did NOT deserve the oscar either.  He shot the movie in order, why is everybody praising him?  One thing I learned in Media Class is to never shoot a movie in order.  It wastes money and creates time problems. That was stupid of him.Moulin Rouge! was completely robbed for best picture!  Robert Altman was completely robbed as best director for Gosford Park!  God, I hated A Beautiful Mind.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"John Nash, Indeed a Beautiful Mind","How can a schizophrenic be of such genius and function at such a level that he commands the highest honor given to human beings, the Oslo awards given for work that progresses mankind, the Nobel Prize for Scientific Excellence. The judges there go to great levels to prevent the awards from being denigrated by going to some charlatan, as the knighthoods of England have become.Having now seen the documentary on this exceptional man's life, I understand more about the particular life a schizophrenic lives. Even the physical structure of his skull somehow creates the 'voices', which of course is Mr. Nash speaking to himself. Just as we are often beset by temptation, with cartoons showing the devil on one shoulder and an angel on another, such was the form these voices took for him.What is even more amazing when we see his 'recovery' in the movie, is from his own admission, a product of his fantastic intelligence. He uses the 'faulty' organ, his brain, to figure out how to 'be sane', foregoing the drugs of the early years that caused him much psychic pain. The description of the experiments performed on him and his treatment in the New Jersey asylum are disgusting,much as the shocking treatments (literally and figuratively) being given children today in Canton, Ma. The mothers of his sons were given proper credit for staying with him, despite his increasingly weird behavior, and his inability to be a nurturing father to his sons. However, that did not preclude the older son from accompanying his father on trips in his adulthood, to keep him from being lured off by his illness to wander Europe, as he did earlier.It is also an indication of how physiological his mental illness, how congenital, when we discover that his 2nd son is also a Math whiz and also schizophrenic. What is even more amazing to me, as a Math major, is the support he received from his fellow math students and teachers at MIT and Princeton, who..instead of viewing him as a rival and a weirdo....stood by him and gave him the support so many victims of mental illness fail to receive. For any of you who have friends or kin who suffer from some form of mental aberration, I strongly suggest this movie, both ""A Beautiful Mind"" and the documentary on the man himself, John Nash.What is left out of the Hollywood movie, but included in the documentary gives us much insight into what movie producers think the public wants. Quite frankly, I believe ""a Beautiful Mind"" would have been much more nuanced and yes, enjoyable, had we been shown the whole story.You will also find interesting the revelation you hear from him: ""I stopped taking the medicine, because it inhibited my work, and decided to refuse to listen to the voices, knowing how they were generated."" My son has ADHD and is now a computer professional with 3 beautiful children. He says, ""I wish you had not given me Ritalin, because I felt like I was 2 people in one body. If one of my children shows hyperactive tendencies, I will do ANYTHING before I try drugs."" Food for thought. Do we drug our children for THEIR sakes, or our own?",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A magnificent film from the Howard/Crowe duo!,"A Beautiful Mind directed by Ron Howard, starring Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connely, Ed harris, Paul Bettany, Christopher Plummer, Josh Lucas, Adam Goldberg, Anthony RappHowards A Beautiful mind is well written bio-pic about John Nash, a delusional genius. Crowe shines in the lead role, carrying the film, however Akiva Goldsmans screenplay and Howards direction perfectly matched the film. A Beautiful mind is a classic example of great acting and an all-together great production.

It's absolutely a masterpiece and the best film of 2001.,"So well deserved for its Best Picture category award along the rest awards.Ron Howard did a great job here, his directing was flawless.The way the story and the whole film was edited was fantastic. You maybe find some parts of the first half of the film a bit strange but when you know after all that what was it all about, you will say, oh, OK, wow!Cinematography was done by the genius Roger Deakins. Although, he played a bit safe here.James Horner tried to add enough feelings and tension to most of the scenes.Casting was magnificent, esp. Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany & Russell Crowe.Make-up artists did a good job, but it could be way better.I lived for so many years who have paranoid schizophrenia. I saw how complex, weird, horrible, dangerous, unbelievable things can get with someone who is struggling with this.We are witnessing the vulnerability of the mind on this film esp. A genius mind like John Forbes Nash Jr.This film is just based on his life, it's fictionalise it on some parts. After all it's not a documentary or a perfectly accurate biopic.I think writers have the liberty to change some parts for dramatising effects, as they always do. This shouldn't be done for some key people in the history who did some extremely major actions, because this way we are doing harm to the history and changing the face of it.8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A little rant on a great movie,What can I say I like movies about Mental Health. This movie is about Professor John Nash who currently teaches mathematics @ Princton University. This man is one of the greatest minds in the world even winning the Nobel prize for his efforts.So what separates this story from any other boring biography piece? Well that would be the fact that Dr. Nash has a Mental Health Disability. Now I'm not going to ruin things for you if you want to see the movie but I will say this...it is really well done. Ron Howard engineered the film in such a way to keep you guessing even when you feel you have a handle on things. Russell Crowe definitely gave the best performance of his life here. I still have a hard time believing that he gave the performance in the film. Jennifer Connelly also gives a good performance winning her the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. In the end I have to say there is little wrong with this movie....From a Mental Health Therapist point of view I still have some hesitance in showing it to the population I treat as the tendency to glamorize things and even seems to point of even saying that the man managed to beat things by taking care of himself and not accepting treatment where the book shows the opposite effect. I do try and point out that the man still takes medications to this day. Either way there is no better illustration of mental illness in my eye so if you haven't seen this film then you really should.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Beautiful Movie,"The movie is not a very accurate biography of Nash's life. Nash's life was very painful according to the book. The movie only touches the outskirts of the pain his schizophrenia caused. The biggest problem of the movie is that Crowe portrays Nash probably far more likable than Nash actually was durng his illness. Crowe has a charisma that the real Nash probably does not have. The movie is a Hollywood movie. It is glitzy and stylish. However, I think Howard has done an admirable job in storytelling. Crowe portrayed Nash well. Nash was althletic looking and handsome when he was younger. Howard had synthesize the whole story in a couple hours and I think he told the story in a very powerful way. Schizophrenics are delusional partly because their view of the universe makes them the center of the universe. Their role in their universe is very important to them. The movie also reveals the torment of the treatment and the drugs they used back then to treat schizophrenia. Connelly was beautiful and very convincing as the wife. I enjoyed the movie immensely. The movie touches on the nature of reality and our dreams. The DVD extras are good as well. There is an interesting interview with Howard talking to Nash.

schizophrenia,"It is difficult to evaluate a film about mental illness.I watched this movie thinking that it was not realistic and that schizophrenia is not like this, but at the same time, I was conflicted because movies are entertainment and we should not expect consistency.First of all, it's impossible that such a beautiful student would come on a date with a professor who is a math idiot...or is it that in the U. S., men in science can actively ask women out?The rest is home treatment. I was almost ticked that he didn't take his medication properly, even though medication is the basic treatment for mental illness.I think Russell Crowe did his best.However, I felt that the role of a schizophrenic must have been too difficult for him.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Definitely an intelligent moving film, even if it does betray its Hollywood origin","I watched this DVD at my son's recommendation. I had no idea what to expect. As a university professor I was interested in the picture of academia in the 50's. The film then started to lose it's way. It threatened to deteriorate into a Hollywood spy thriller. The brilliant mathematician (John Nash) hired by dumb spooks. Just as my interest waned it turned out that the secret undercover work was actually a paranoid schizophrenic fantasy. Having being confronted by this debilitating mental dysfunction at close hand (my sister) for most of my life, the film became suddenly captivating. Here and there stereotype Hollywoood sentimentality prevents the film from becoming a really great film, but it remained stimulating and moving right through to the end. The next day I checked out the movie content with a genuine biography and interview with John Nash himself. The movie is not entirely accurate - Nash never actually had visual delusions, but he did experience voices. In the movie Nash is stabilizes and continues to take medication. In reality he has not taken medication for the last thirty years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
They,"They managed to make it so that, indeed, until the middle of the movie nothing is clear (I speak for myself, maybe someone is smarter). It's even strange how many years his wife lived with him and even she couldn't notice how creepy his veneer whistles are! In this movie, you can beautifully see how limitless talent Russell Crowe - for two years, such a great game in such different movies (I mean Gladiator again.) Again, this movie can be traced in the desire and the outcome of their great American dream (yet he won recognition - Nobel Prize is not the weakest confirmation of that). I'm getting sidetracked again!Of course, you can say something bad about the movie, by and large, you will find no one to mark except for Russell Crowe in the movie, but again, this is just my opinion.

Yes, Nash was/is nuts, and figuring out a way to explain the inside of a crazy genius's head is a difficult challenge, however, I think they were way off the mark if the biographical book is to be believed.Also, the hollywoody way that the film makers kept his wife constant out of her great love and pity for him was also a ruse. Once again, Hollywood whored up history for a buck. I will concede that it might have been entertaining without prior knowledge of the subject matter, but why call it true then? Why not just make a made up movie about a screwed up mathematician and not attach it to the life of a real person?As a venue for pitying the beautiful and distraught it is top drawer, but nothing more.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Flawless.,"It's a stunning tale of perseverance and quite possibly the finest character study of all time. The film does a great job of exploring every single aspect of John Nash's mind and when we finally see him for who he truly is, my heart breaks. A heartbreaking film that becomes almost unbearable to watch as Nash combats with his own mind between what he knows is right and what his mind tells him is real. The fact that he had such a beautiful gift for codebreaking but along with it came an unimaginable curse is terrifying. I believe it's impossible to understand what possibly could go through John Nash's head on a daily basis, and the experiences he had to endure throughout his life really are unimaginable but this film does a flawless job of bringing us as close to understanding him as possible. A big help in creating it's brilliance are the phenomenal performances from Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly which are two of the best of their career (probably is the best of Jennifer's), the decade and, I dare-say, of all time.

A Princeton State of Mind!,"The cost of brilliance might be madness. You don't need to look further than the brilliant math genius John Nash played here by Oscar Winner Russell Crowe. He should have won another Academy Award for Best Actor in this role. It's not easy at Princeton University. They probably didn't flinch an eyeball in their ivy digs over the Oscars. It's the kind of university where it takes a whole lot to impress those ivy geniuses. After all, they have Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, author Joyce Carol Oates, and Nobel prize winners on their faculty as well. Ron Howard said he loved filming in Princeton, New Jersey which doesn't seem to fit in the rest of stereotypical New Jersey. It's like another world of it's own where geniuses discuss politics, history, economics, math, and literature. It's hardly believable that some of them probably don't own television sets because they think it's waste of time and a distraction but they probably have computers instead. Princeton is a state of mind and a place where the mind is valued more than the body. With brilliance comes madness for John Nash. Ron Howard creates a beautiful film based on John Nash's story of suffering and demons that battles his mind for control. I like the casting of Judd Hirsch and Jennifer Connolly as the loving, devoted wife. John Nash will be remembered for this film more than his brilliance but that he was human just like the rest of us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Not everything the film shows is exactly true but if we except the writer's creative and narrative freedoms, the film is close enough to reality for a biopic.

Extraordinary,"I have not read the book, and I had not even heard of the people it revolves around. Therefore I cannot compare the events depicted with reality, though I understand that this takes liberties, and allows itself a lot of dramatic license. I have wanted to watch this for as long as I have known it existed. When I finally got a chance to, I was delighted to find that it was every bit as amazing as I had hoped. I will not reveal a lot of the plot... and I urge you, if you do not know much about Nash or what happens in this, *please* do what you can to keep it that way until you have seen this. What I will say is that the protagonist here is a mathematical genius. The acting is simply astonishing. I would list the superb performers, but I'd wind up including everyone. They are simply flawless. Two that must not go unmentioned are Russell and Connelly, both of whom deliver a powerful and unforgettable portrayal of their respective roles. The characters are well-written and credible. This is impeccably well-written and psychologically accurate. The plot is interesting and develops marvelously throughout. I could not take my eyes off this for a single moment at any point. The pacing is spot-on. This is brilliantly directed, though I cannot specify why without spoiling it, and I intend this, as all my reviews, to be open to anyone. If you are not certain what I am referring to after a viewing, feel free to contact me and I will tell you. The music is excellent and fitting. This has incredible production values, and deserves every award it won. There is some rather disturbing content, a little violence and occasional, moderately strong language. The 2-Disc Award Edition DVD comes with 2 interesting and funny commentary tracks(one with Howard, the other with Goldsman), 27 minutes of deleted(at times incomplete) scenes with optional thoughts by Ron, various informational featurettes(four of which have pages here on the site, and I will review them separately), footage of the receiving of prizes, a theatrical trailer and a commercial for the soundtrack.

Beautifully done,"You know, I haven't seen ""Gladiator"" yet, and I honestly don't know why. I have seen this movie as well as ""Cinderella Man"", and Russell Crow has this acting thing down. I'm a sucker for biopics as it is, but honestly Ron Howard did a great job directing and Russell Crow did an equally great job acting. The story was touching. John Nash (Russell Crow), ironically enough, was incredibly brilliant, but he also suffered from hallucinations. He was stuck in a difficult quandary: he could take his medication which would suppress his illness and effectively erase his identity, which was his brilliant mind. Or, he could refuse his medication and keep his superiorly sharp mind, but also risk his sanity. Just being afflicted with the illness and having to succumb to it would have been a story in itself, but Nash actually living with the illness without taking inhibitors made his story that much more spectacular. He made a daring bold move to deal with his condition without the aide of his medication so that he wouldn't be without what made him -him. In fact, he proved what a powerful mind he had to deal with the hallucinations and still continue to operate normally. This was truly a wonderful story about a beautiful mind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Russell Crowe is a Beautiful Mind,"In any movie the stars always take control of our lives for a couple of hours.

For in art and in literature, as it is, yes, in sports, it's the difference that really counts. In The Gladiator, Russell Crowe was all hunk and is ready to kill or die anytime, giving his life for the justice. He was all the raw rippling power of a professional warrior, all that a man could ever want to be. He fears neither man nor beast. Filled with faith for God and Country. In The Beautiful Mind, Russell Crowe was the unlikely nerd in college, sexy professor, and - lo and behold! an old man-Crowe as John Nash.

I found neither Nash nor his wife interesting, the math and numbers angle was dull, and the schizophrenic plot felt unresolved  And how Connelly won best supporting actress is beyond me. She adds nothing to the picture beyond a devoted wifely duty role that any of a hundred actresses could have fleshed out the same way. Where one should be moved, one is attempted to laugh, and Crowe just seems miscast. I thought this was one of the Academy awards biggest mistakes, next to voting Lawrence of Arabia and the even more over rated The Greatest Show on Earth best pictures. If you want to see Opie direct a much better flick, check out Apollo 13. This one will just put you to sleep. The only decent characters are the ones Nash imagines in his intense paranoia.

A Moving Portrayal of Genius and Struggle,"A deeply moving biographical drama that explores the complexities of genius, mental illness, and the power of love. Directed by Ron Howard, the film is based on the life of Nobel laureate John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who battled schizophrenia. With its combination of intellectual depth and emotional warmth, the film manages to be both inspiring and heartbreaking.Russell Crowe delivers one of the most nuanced performances of his career as John Nash. He masterfully captures Nash's journey, from his early years as an eccentric and driven scholar at Princeton to his later struggles with paranoia and delusion. Crowe's ability to portray the internal torment of a man grappling with his own mind makes Nash both sympathetic and relatable. It's a portrayal that is as intelligent as it is vulnerable.Jennifer Connelly's role as Alicia Nash, John's wife, adds an emotional core to the film. Her performance is quietly powerful, showing the strength, patience, and sacrifice required to stand by someone battling mental illness. Connelly's portrayal won her an Academy Award, and rightly so, as she brings depth and tenderness to a role that could have easily been overshadowed by the film's focus on Nash's genius.Ron Howard's direction is both sensitive and gripping. He balances the technical complexities of Nash's work in mathematics with the deeply personal and emotional elements of his life. The film uses visual cues and storytelling techniques to immerse viewers in Nash's delusions, allowing us to experience the world from his perspective. This makes the reveal of his mental illness all the more shocking and tragic.The score, composed by James Horner, beautifully complements the narrative, evoking the wonder of Nash's mathematical mind and the emotional weight of his struggles. The music enhances the film's more profound moments, making them resonate long after the film ends.""A Beautiful Mind"" succeeds not only as a biopic but also as a testament to the strength of the human spirit. It portrays the hardships of mental illness with sensitivity, avoiding stereotypes while highlighting the personal toll it takes on individuals and their families. The film's ultimate message-that love, resilience, and understanding can guide us through our darkest times-resonates deeply.In conclusion, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a masterfully crafted film, anchored by an unforgettable performance from Russell Crowe and a sensitive, thoughtful narrative. It's an inspiring story of perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, making it a must-watch for those who appr

A Superlative Acting Film,"I have viewed ""A Beautiful Mind"" a few times now and I can say with great confidence that in addition to being a tremendous piece of drama, Russell Crowe gives one of the great acting performances I have ever seen.  Many films have been made with actors aging quite convincingly, but no 30-something-year-old has ever pulled off the aging process better.  Watch the scene where Russell is given the Nobel at Princeton.  As a man now in his seventies, his speech to the committee rep is masterful;  no contemporary actor commands the screen like Crowe.  This movie owes a great deal of its success to its lead.In the tradition of great films, Mind also benefits from strong supporting acting with the likes of Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, and a thankless, yet crucial role by the always great Ed Harris.  As good as some of Ron Howard's films have been (Apollo 13, Parenthood), he buries the quality of his previous work with this one.  Kudos to those that had faith that a movie about an antisocial mathematician's life could be so engaging and moving.

A Beautiful Mind is a spectacular portrayal that love IS blind!,"I find that usually movies based on true stories are more appealing to watch. A Beautiful Mind was quite enjoyable to watch because although the story seemed so far-fetched, knowing that there were aspects of truth to it made the movie very interesting. Two things about the movie that I appreciated most were: 1)Alicia's love for John Nash and 2)the representation of a paranoid schizophrenic's world through their eyes.People of the general public are often afraid to LIVE WITH(or near) schizophrenics, but are unaware of how much more frightening it could be to LIVE AS a schizophrenic. A Beautiful Mind provided a great depiction of the difficulties which a paranoid schizophrenic might have to endure. Russell Crowe's character, John Nash, provided viewers with a look at the scary world through the eyes of a paranoid schizophrenic. Crowe's character help others better understand that those who are ""insane"" are still human and are very well capable of feeling some of the same emotions that the ""sane"" people feel. Nash was able to relate and share the most important part of all human factors and that component was love. In subtle and indirect ways, love helped Nash realize that he was ill and love gave him the support to make it through his days. Nash was able to rebuild his life after schizophrenia through love and that makes me admire Alicia's strength to truly love him unconditionally.I did some research on the real John Nash's life and it was not as beautiful as portrayed in the movie. However,on the plus side, he and Alicia are married and he is still a mathematician at Princeton.I highly recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Best Picture?,"When was the last time that you saw a Best Picture award winner that you really thought deserved the title?My guess is that you will not be impressed with this latest recipient.Before watching a Beautiful Mind, I read all the press about how the movie was not an accurate portrayal of the life of John Nash; that it left out several important but ""inconvenient"" or ""unattractive"" facts.  I told myself that I would put all that aside, however, and try to see the movie as simply a good story.So much for that approach.I found this movie to be pretty boring and unfulfilling.  They spend very little time on character development and even if you haven't read about the parts of Nash's story that were left out of the movie, it still feels like something is missing.Nash is supposed to be some kind of unrivaled genius, but aside from watching Russell Crowe stare at many terribly complicated equations (no doubt written onto library windows and chalk boards by graduate students who happened by the set during filming) we get very little sense of what it was that this guy did that was so earth shattering.If they had bothered to go more into Nash's game theory work, the movie could have been a lot more impressive and interesting.  As it is, we are left to take on faith that Nash's theories about maximizing his and his friends chances of getting laid must have been Nobel caliber stuff.Furthermore, there is no explanation at all about what on earth it is about Nash (a confirmed misanthrope) that could possibly make his wife fall in love with him, much less spend her entire life as the care-taker of the nuthouse that is Nash's life.  Note: had they felt inclined to include the fact that Nash and his wife were separated for a while, it might make the picture a little more believable.Maybe she knew that she would win Best Supporting Actress if she stuck around long enough.Once again, I am disappointed in the Academy's Best Picture selection.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Makes me want to read the book,"Being a mathematician in a previous life, I was looking forward to seeing this movie to see how they could make the life of a mathematician interesting enough to appeal to a wide audience. Well, they did it. By way of high production values, an intelligent screenplay, and excellent performances.I have the feeling that the story was romanticized a fair amount for audience appeal. On the other hand, you get a feel for the pain of mental illness, from the perspective of the ill person as well as those who know him.I am hoping that Nasar's book will give me a more in depth understanding of this man and his illness. In particular, the movie failed completely to give a good idea of just what Nash did to deserve the Nobel Prize.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
An Unlikely Masterpiece,"When I went to this advance screening of A Beautiful Mind I expected a strong film due to Ron Howard and Russell Crowe being associated to this movie.  My expectations were high and they were more than met, the preview for this film is kind of misleading there is really a strong story at the heart of this film.  It's not like a biography of John Nash it is merely based around some events that took place in Nash's life.  I predict that this film will grad a best picture, best director, best actor, and best supporting actress nomination when the academy awards nominees are announced in february.  The same way that other recent movies have had success by helping the viewer to escape this film helps you to escape but into a more realitic setting.  Crowe's performance could actually win him another oscar I know it's hard to win back to back but his performance is really THAT impressive.  But what really holds the film together is Jennifer Connelly who stole every scene she was in, in the harsh independent film Requiem for a Dream.  Connelly is the balance to the film because it's hard for the viewer to always understand Crowe's Nash.  Connelly gives the same kind of supporting balance to the film as Marcia Gay HArden gave last year in Pollock.  A Beautiful Mind will be remembered as the film where even Crowe's harshest critics will have to admit that the he's talented.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Great, if you've never heard of John Nash.","Gotta love those bio-pics that features five percent of a person'slife.  would have loved to see more of his ""real"" work. The actingwas beautiful, the costumes were beautiful.  The directing was alittle over sentimental, but I expected that going in. Great web site.Over all, a perfect film for the mass audience.  (As long as youdon't know anything about John Nash, who is one of my heros)",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Wonderful and classy film, a must-see on DVD, in my book a  ""10"".","First I want to comment on some of the unworthy criticism regarding the ""accuracy"" of this film. The writer and director state plainly that this is a semi-fictional story using the essential ""architecture"" of mathematician John Nash's life, namely his genius, his schizophrenia, his relationship with Alicia, and his winning the Nobel prize. It was NOT intended to be a complete biographical sketch. Plus, since much of Nash's work with the government was top-secret, all that had to be fabricated for the film. As were many of the characters, the delusions, the code-breaking simulations, the speech upon receiving the award. They sought to take a very captivation story of a genius who overcame a debilitating illness, with the help of a special companion, to survive and win a most high honor, and they have done it very well. It deserves ""Best Picture"" and Opie (I mean, Ron Howard) deserves ""Best Director.""Second, I want to comment about the acting. Russell Crowe, as difficult as he may be at times in public, is THE consummate actor working today. Just to see what he does with this role of John Nash, to see how he captures the character, how he evolves as the film unfolds, is worth a viewing all on its own. Without getting into the politics of The Academy, nor criticizing anyone else's performance, Russell Crow deserves ""Best Actor"" for his role in ""A Beautiful Mind."" As well as he is regarded, I still think his work is under-appreciated by most. I found myself forgetting that I was seeing an actor, that's how good he is, and that seldom happens with me. All the others are good in this film, but Crowe is the sole reason for its greatness.And third, anyone still watching movies like this at home on VHS are missing so much. This DVD, two disks actually, is one of the very best I have seen. Not only are the sound and picture just perfect, disk one allows you to play the film with either the director's or the writer's commentary. Both are among the most interesting of any commentaries, adding real value to understanding some of the finer points of the film. After I saw the whole film, I went back and re-played certain scenes with each commentary turned on, and essentially doubled my enjoyment of the whole movie.Disk one also has some production notes and deleted scenes which are interesting. But disk two has a wealth of extras for those who like to study the whole creative process of movie-making. Included are the choice of the writer, a taped interview with John Nash where he tries to explain his prize-winning theory to Ron Howard. Scoring, special effects, etc, the whole process. I own the DVD.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A beautifully crafted winner,"Russell Crowe as the mathematics Nobel Prize winner John Nash fights schizophrenia and wins. Jennifer Connelly as the gorgeous love of his life.

Best movie seen at the theater in a long time,"A Beautiful mind was by far the best film I have seen in the theater for a little bit of time now. Before that I would say that the Sixth Sense was the best--although there were excellent movies that did come out after. (I had just seen those at home). Nevertheless, ""A Beautiful Mind"" should not be ignored and should be viewed by those who feel out of place with themselves and try their hardest to show their potential..but never seem to be able to get it across to someone. As a person, I do not particularly care for Russell Crowe. The whole hoopla behind the Academy might have done him in for an award, but nevertheless, Crowe shines as John Forbes Nash, Jr. in ""Mind"". His performance was that of how the old times in cinema used to be--very in touch with their characters, and flawless in their performances. Russell Crowe is comparible to Tony Curtis's portrayal of Albert De Salvo in Richard Fleischer's ""The Boston Strangler"". Although they are complete different performances, Crowe delivers his with the same impact of Tony Curtis's character. Mr. Crowe was phenomenal, and to my wishes, was not overlooked by the Academy but simply given a close race against Denzel Washington. Many people disagreed with Nash's schizophrenia not being unveiled until the middle of the film, and I will admit that it was upsetting to me, but the good aspects of this film really overshadowed the slight flaws of dislike within the movie. I was more disappointed that Nash was not in fact doing all these things for the government and aiding us at the times of the Cold War. However, Nash's true genius made up for this factor and allowed the viewer to see that he truly was a genius but just one that simply had to overcome an obstical that was so slight compared to the intelligence he possessed. Along with Crowe's magnificent performance, we were given a marvelous music score by James Horner. (I think that had Randy Newman not won simply for breaking his losing streak, Mr. Horner would have scooped up the award). The music added a beautiful tone to the movie and showed what Nash's mind must feel like within--eerie, confused, and beautiful. On a last note, As wonderful as Jennifer Connelly was in her role, I really think that her Oscar was uneccessary. She turned in a decent performance, but was certainly not Oscar caliber compared to the great Dame Maggie Smith's comic performance, and the ever charming Marissa Tomei's performance. But nevertheless, her Oscar just added to the movies list. :) If you intend on seeing a compelling movie with one of the best male actor's performance's in a long time, pull up a seat and watch ""A Beautiful Mind"".

Couldn't have been a better cast,"Russell Crowe certainly proved his acting ability in this movie.  I heard many, many people disagreeing with his winning of best actor for Gladiator saying that there wasn't much acting involved. Russell being a primarily muscle actor...but this movie, A Beautiful Mind, Crowe nailed perfectly. It was absolutely incredible watching him play such a complicated character, and the story was so fascinating.  I think the movie is definitely Academy material, and all my money goes to Russell winning best actor.  That'll make it two in a row for him.  Ed Harris and everyone else were so great, I couldn't have spent my five bucks better than buying a ticket to this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Crowe shines, but the supporting casts rises as well","For his performance in ""A Beautiful Mind,"" Russel Crowe deserves every award he gets.

Uninspired & flat...,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of those ""Oscar(tm)-aimed"" films like Gladiator that pretend to transcend Hollywood, and in the process appear eminently ""Hollywood"" (and mostly forgettable after the Oscars (tm)).Uninspired performances, unrealistic and oversimplified portrayal of schizophrenia and (unforgivably), a dull screenplay.  I kept looking at my watch through this one, and wasn't for one moment drawn into the story. There are no characters we can really empathize with in this film, and so it becomes an exercise in tedium.The film does a good job in creating the general paranoid atmosphere one would attribute to schizophrenia, but doesn't succeed in conveying the 'reality' of it.  Nash's ""delusions"" are obviously hallucinations(look up the difference if you don't know already), and the character is not sharply drawn or particularly interesting.  Jennifer Connelly's acting is rarely better than ""by the book,"" and nobody really seems very passionate about whatever characters they're playing.Sorry guys, try again.  Yes, I do like movies in this vein, as long as they're well-done... this one hardly qualifies as ""medium rare."" 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Russell Crowe MUST win the Oscar!!!,"Not since ""Rain Man"" have I enjoyed a movie about mentally challenged individuals this much. Russell Crowe gives the standout performance of the year as well as his career in the part of John Nash. He simply goes from one great role to another and yet he makes the job look so effortless. Ron Howard has made yet another enjoyable film... I've yet to see him make a bad one. Jennifer Connelly is Nash's steadfast wife who defies all the conventional rules and stands by her husband as he fights a nightmarish battle against schizophrenia. She gives a good performance but I don't think it's Oscar material. It's basically like Gwenyth Paltrow's popularity campaign a few years ago for ""Shakespeare in Love"". But Russell Crowe is brilliant in his performance and it will be a grave mistake if someone else walks off with his Oscar on March 24.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
genre: tear jerker,"Classic tear jerker film, the interesting thing being that the lead is a schizo/genius and played by the charismatic Mr Crowe. Has some unusual plot devices (for it's time, although these plot devices have now become common).The romantic relationship lacks credibility as Crowe and Connelly just don't seem to 'click' and for me, this lets the whole movie down.

"Well made film, but ultimately not my cup of tea.","Regarded as one of the top rated movies, I must be honest, I was bored. Not because it is a bad movie, but because the premise simply did not interest me.Let's face it; I hated mathematics at school. So, watching a movie about a brilliant mathematician is not exactly my idea of a good time with a movie. Throw in the spy element with mystery, action and adventure, and there's a twinkling in my eye. Sadly, this was merely our hero's mind playing tricks on him. Or quite bluntly, losing his mind.Based on fact, I suppose it would not have made an interesting movie if it wasn't for John Nash's imaginary world. Once I realized it was all just his schizophrenia talking, I lost interest and it was ultimately boring. The ending was probably supposed to give me goosebumps, but unfortunately it did nothing for me. I was only toot happy it (finally) ended. This is a very long movie, and also a very slow moving one.Make no mistake, this is a very well made film with good dialogue and acting. Russell Crowe and Ed Harris in particular were very good.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

You are pulling for him to recover and then hit with the fact, he never recovers, never wins the struggle, but that he conquers and subdues his aliment.At the end I found a few tears creeping out of my eyes. The acting by everybody is good. There's one scene where a visiting old friend is at the house and a close-up shows he has a pierced left ear. Found this distracting and odd in the days when very few men had pierced ears.The direction is good and the movie moves along very well, fast enough not to dull you.

"Why ""MIND"" will win the TOP OSCAR March 24","The 2001 Ron Howard film, A BEAUTIFUL MIND, is more than a front runner in the race for a Best Picture Academy Award.  It's the most traditional, logical, and emotional Best Picture among the major feature-length films vying in the category for that Hollywood ""gold medal"" triumph.  This significant ""team product"" (Universal Studios, DreamWorks, and Imagine Entertainment) deserves the endorsement that only the top Oscar can convey! As a ""traditional"" pick, consider how this 2 1/2 hour film advances an invigorating ""happy ending"" format.  The episodic chronicle of a mentally challenged individual, John Nash, and his long-suffering, supportive wife, Sylvia, neither ends with gloom nor doom.  Some might object that such recent winners as AMADEUS and THE ENGLISH PATIENT ended with death by overwork, plane crashes, and euthanasia; however, their popular source material from novel or stage play dictated the outcome of their main characters, respectively.  The typical American outlook is one of victory despite obstacles of all sorts.  This winning depiction of a delusional schizophreniac even includes his Acceptance Speech at the Nobel Prize ceremonies in 1994.  Like memorable and typical Hollywood biographies, this film offers basically glimpses of an overall success story.  The Nash family remains held together despite extreme medical and psychiatric crises. Opponents of this film's sweep onto the 3/24 Victory Stand/Stage in Hollywood point out that the depicted couple actually divorced and separated, only later reconciling.  Tradition favors memories of an uncomplicated nature and this film has an ""uneasy"" connection to what's real and what's not real at all.  If it wins because of its comforting attitude, voters may sweep along to Best Actor and Best Director awards Russell Crowe and Ron Howard as they did when RAIN MAN, Dustin Hoffman, and Barry Levinson took home Oscars. Secondly, A BEAUTIFUL MIND is the most logical pick out of the primary competition (GOSFORD PARK, MOULIN ROUGE, and THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING).  The Academy will likely be supportive of American-focused material for this first ceremony after the national tragedy of September 11, 2001; they'd perhaps promote the New Jersey-set film over those set in England and Paris (GOSFORD & MOULIN ROUGE).  Other films with minor nominations have settings in the U.S.: MEMENTO, ALI, MONSTER'S BALL, and TRAINING DAY;  I predict that some of these will spoil the races in several of the categories with their strongest performances or technical accomplishments.  Voters of the Academy logically might be holding off any recognition of the first-of-three installments of THE LORD OF THE RINGS saga.  Two more films will debut at Christmas 2002 and 2003.  Like STAR WARS, STAR TREK, and INDIANA JONES, they might win at the box office while never taking home the Best Picture statuette. Thirdly, A BEAUTIFUL MIND packs an emotional wallop but yet doesn't fully flatten its audience.  When I recently viewed certain of its most gripping sequences (in Nash's padded room or insulin therapy lab and in the small family bathroom), I was amazed at the overwhelmingly effective nature of the film's depiction of the ravages of mental illness.  There was so much raw power on the screen; still, we cared about all the individuals involved without losing our connection to the story and its graphically depicted extremes.  To contrast, the independently produced nominee, IN THE BEDROOM, took its audience on a roller-coaster ride that did ""hit the solar plexus."" Its pure realism about modern-day violence, from a short story by Andre Dubus deserved full recognition in this mega-category.  Its chance to play ""David"" among the other ""Goliaths"" is hard to predict, at least right now. Older voters, a majority of Academy members, would favor some emotion without feeling immobilized and stunned senseless by it, in my opinion. In conclusion, A BEAUTIFUL MIND deserves the highest award on March 24 because of its conventional approach to an American success story, its logical preference to a ""Middle-Earth"" fantasy epic, and its emotional punch that moves us to terrain where we can catch our breath without wheezing in dire pain.  When all is said and done, this Ron Howard-Brian Grazer production may not win all of its nominations but it stands the greatest chance of taking home the ""gold"" -- the Oscar for Best Picture 2001.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

An Over Rated Mind,"I watched A Beautiful Mind a few hours ago.  I hand it to Ron Howard and his producers for assembling a great cast.  But this movie is nothing new in many ways.  It is a wonderfully crafted love story, expertly technical but methodically predictable.Some evidence that the film is derivative were the special effects used to reveal Nash's observations of pattern and code.  Numbers light up off of pages of text.  Similar effects were used in Jody Foster's movie Little Man Tate, at least ten years ago, when Foster's character's son ""sees"" mathematical equations in a highlighted neon light fashion.  It is helpful for the viewer to see what the character does in both films, though not new now.Crew note: remove the marks for wide shots.  I saw a taped ""T"" on the floor in the Princeton tea room foyer.  Judd Hirsch as Einstein tells Nash that he won't receive the Wheeler recommendation, then the camera pulls out and Nash exits walking backward.  As the shot widens there you will see the taped ""T"" marks on the floor where Hirsch and Crowe were standing.I grew up near West Virginia.  I've visited and stayed in West Virginia and had friends from West Virginia.  Crowe's West Virginia accent was not heavy enough to cover his Australian.Jennifer Connelly looked fantastic and her acting was ineffectual.  Let me compare: Both women in Mulholland Drive showed much more depth and range than Connelly's Alicia Nash.  They did things, and caused things to happen. Alicia Nash does not cause anything to happen, and that may be a flaw of the screenplay.  I can read into it that Alicia helps John to understand love to be a real thing, as real as the universe is infinitely large.  But don't read to far.  A second thought though, the only thing that could stand up to Crowe's presence and stature, since he's won the Oscars and the Golden Globes, is Connelly's stunning beauty.  No current A list actress could act in such a simple fashion and be so captivating at the same time.The script and some of the actions were predictable.  For example the over used ""throw the glass at the mirror,"" when Connelly used it to exhibit emotion after being rejected by an over medicated John in bed.  Take Harris's posturing in Nash's office as evidence of Greek Tragedy style acting.  Harris holds open his jacket by resting his hands on his hips, thereby exposing an ominous pistol in a shoulder holster.  It is a menacing stance, but it is almost a stereotypical threat by someone with a gun that we've seen many times before.A Dr. Seus book is used as a prop, held by a young character.  Maybe Howard is reminding us that he directed that live action Seuss movie.  And more on the subject of Howard recycling from his past, a host of Howard's family worked on A Beautiful Mind, see film credits, as well as Harris appearing in Apollo 13 directed by Howard.Thanks to James Horner's stirring cello music for pulling my heart strings, yes, I cried.  When you see that A Beautiful Mind is truly about love, like I did, you'll cry too.  Forgive me, I fall for the emotional manipulation tactics every time a cello plays!  I am a sucker for a good movie.  And though it may be nothing new, A Beautiful Mind is a very good movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Pathetic,"A completely dumbed-down and whitewashed version of the life of John Nash. The really interesting part, namely the Nash Theorem and the Nash Equilibrium, are just mentioned, no one actually cared to explain why these contributed to game theory and economics and earned him the Nobel prize. Instead of that, we get a ridiculous and unrealistic depiction of his schizophrenia, Crowe babbling as an idiot, Conelly in the most unbelievable, sexist, dumb role they could ever write for Nash's wife and clichés of academic life, institutions, interpersonal relationships etc. Only Christopher Plummer, Ed Harris and the make-up department were actually worth their salaries. A film destined to please brain-dead people, I guess that's why the Academy liked it anyway.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Inspirational,"This really is a great film, a supremely intelligent and well-made picture that deserves to make a mint and possibly scoop the top Oscars.I didn't think that Ron Howard was capable of a mature and clever film like this one as much of his work to date has been pretty light-eg The Grinch, Parenthood, EdTV etc. He had a go at 'serious' cinema with Apollo 13 in 1995, but I felt that the popularity of Tom Hanks and the naturally dramatic nature of the Apollo story carried it to its box office and critical heights.That said, A Beautiful Mind is full-on clever and mannered film-making. Howard is totally on top of his game. His craftmanship and care subtly drives every scene. The film is not cluttered or over-complex, nor is it preachy or patronising while tackling its quite difficult subjects-schizophrenia, the nature of misunderstood genius, the Cold War etc.Russell Crowe is a God in this film, its his best work to date. He doesn't overdo John Nash's mannerisms or accent, he BECOMES Nash, dominating the movie with an endearing mix of honesty, comic understatement and heartwarming naievety. Jennifer Connelly is sexy and smart as Nash's wife, too. Ed Harris is wonderful as usual.All in all, a brilliant film. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Possibly the best acting performance i have ever seen.,"Forget what you think about Russel Crowe , forget that he is not the friendliest of people if you believe the papers.Just watch A Beautifull Mind and see what is in my opinion one of the finest acting performances i have ever seen if not the the best. Very rarely does a film have an affect on me like this. I defy you not to have tears in eyes at the end and any film that can affect a cold hearted sod like me like that deserves as many accolades as it can get. It's not action packed , it's not funny and its not modern but what this film is is unique. Very rarely has anybody been able to portray madness on the big screen as brilliantly as this and you do have a fantastic insight as to what can go on the mind of a genius who is on the edge.

A cliché,"I wished so much to like this film. I ended up very disappointed. Was it a bad movie? No. Was it a bad story? No. Was it bad handling by producer and director?

The bicycling routine, the desk out the window, the stereotype mannerism, the ubiquitous self referencing (the board game, the pen gifts e.g.). And the international Hollywood symbol of ""crazy"" is walls plastered with papers and photos. Yawn!The acting is downright hammy. It suffers from the Hollywood illness: heavy handed hammering the sentiments down our throats, no elegance at all. And the dumbest Hollywood standard of them all: let the actor speak out what has just been acted out! When even the dimmest of the viewers has seen ""they did it"" the actors MUST say ""WE DID IT"". Right, yes, why take the trouble of showing it on the screen when you tell us anyway? Does American directors think the viewers are too dumb to believe what they see? Are they planning the soundtrack for broadcast as a radio play on the side?An English project would have created a much more subtle, intelligent movie which would have explored the story and impacted so much harder. I can't help compare with Shine. It's a totally different movie but the same story. It's done with elegance. I am quite unsentimental by nature but the tears forced their way out when I saw that.

Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, made a great film.  I'd love to talk to anyone and here their opinions who think overwise.Also, sure their were some plot holes, but every script always have them. The truth is, it was a great script with great emotion and drama, and Akiva Goldsmen deserved his awards also.So, I don't see any reason why this film should be bashed for being the good film that it was.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
An Awful Movie,"This was one of the worst films I have seen in recent memory. It was a human interest tale with no soul. The plot was deeply flawed. How can you have a biopic with a deeply flawed plot? I don't know but somehow this movie managed to make no sense. Russel Crowe plays Nash the way he plays every other character. This character works as a gladiator, not as mathematician. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate this movie because of any glaring factual errors, although I have been told there are many. No, this is a work of fiction, and it fails as such. There is nothing to connect to on a human level in this film, except Jennifer Connely, but one strong performance cannot save the bad script and uninspired direction. Avoid this film if any sort of internal consistency or humanity are important to you in film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Hollywood Cheese,"The actors are good, but if this film did not pretend to be a true story, it would be completely ridiculous.  Think about it, if there was no John Nash in real life for them to borrow 1% of their story from, and the filmmakers went in to pitch this story:  We take a hot actor, pretend he's a Goodwill Hunting-like genius, pretend he's not bi-sexual, illustrate his ""beautiful mind"" by dumbing down the field of theoretical mathmatics to a bar-room level, then give him a disease of the week, steal the ""these people aren't real"" plot twist from ""Sixth Sense,"" allow him to conquer the disease of the week through ""love,"" ""humility"" and ""a lifetime of teaching the young who idolize him,"" along with the superhuman support of his wife (whose character is ENTIRELY unmotivated.  WHY does she stay with him?  She is a total MYSTERY...) and in the end, give him a huge award because he has finally stopped demanding to be considered ""important.""  Who the heck would watch that?  The film departs so much from the real life story of this guy that what remains is only pointless nonsense about How to Beat Schizophrenia Without Really Trying.  It should actually be titled ""Jennifer Connoly Is Beautiful"" and let it go at that.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Russell Crowe--AMAZING!!!,"I had to see this movie for my Sociology of Mental Illness class. Russell Crowe is AMAZING and I hope he wins the Oscar..he deserves it. He made the movie as good as it is.

I was so fooled, I was afraid his friends were delusions.The only thing that disappoints me is that some of the things that took place in the movie never really happened and that disappoints me. But I do understand that it's a dramatization of somebody's life.

A Bunch of Garbagge!,"I have the illness of schizophrenia and I find this movie misleading propaganda. I do not see imaginary people. I may hear things that aren't there at times.

At least the world allowed John Nash some semblance of dignity in his illness. His neighbors nor the police ridiculed him. I am not an important scientist like John Nash. I had a nervous breadkdown in graduate school my senond year. I spend my time in independent Bible study as a part time Christian writer. As a matter of fact, I had once sent a resume to Univerisal Pictures years before that movie came out on a lark thinking because of my superntural dreams that God might be calling me into character acting-maybe I might play a ""heavy"" in a drug movie or something. Did Universal pick up on my resume and cover letter and decide to make this movie about Schizophrenic genius John Nash? I had bought the PBS American EXPERIENCE video A BRILLIANT MADNESS chronicalling the life of John Nash, too. Because of my illness the subject interested me. The real life of John Nash is a bit different from Ron Howard's fairy tale story. John Nash actually quit taking his meds after awhile and got better!

Exceptional Story Whose Slow Start Still Finishes Strong,"Russell Crowe delivers a powerful and moving performance in Ron Howard's heart wrenching, heart warming film. Following the whole of John Nash's life, the creators clearly know and demonstrate how to play the middle and end games of a film, yet it must be stated that their opening was subpar, with scenes and character setups that were somewhat done necessarily rather than artistically. But it would not be right to deny this film a watch based on that alone; A Beautiful Mind has a depth that can be plunged into over and over again by viewers. With James Horner's moving and subtly plot revealing musical composition, this film is a must-watch since Crowe, yet again, is invisible within his loving character.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Best Movie Ever,One of the greatest movies ever made. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly both give the best performances of their careers. Ron Howard will definitely get an oscar nomination.

A typical movie...,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is typical Hollywoodized claptrap designed to jerk the heartstrings of the average viewer, with Russell Crowe overacting like a fool.Hopefully this film will drop out of the IMDB top 250 soon, as it's one of the more overrated films in movie history.  To be honest, I cannot imagine most of the ""real life"" occurrences actually happening anything like the way they did in the film.  Crowe is one of the most egotistical and psychologically messed-up actors around, and it's clear here that he thinks he's another Marlon Brando.  Hollywood has done little to disabuse him of this notion.  Who knows what further silliness and excesses we can expect from Mr. Crowe in the future?The film isn't too bad if you ignore the blatantly manipulative elements. The story is engaging enough thanks to decent acting (particularly from Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer), and the film is watchable on a more ""mindless"" level -- it's fun to watch these top-list actors doing their stuff.  However, rest assured that this is not an accurate portrayal of schizophrenia, or of the real-life John Nash's life.Anyway, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is worth a watch if it comes on cable (currently playing on HBO), and you should make up your own mind.  From where I'm standing, it's pretty much one of those flicks designed to attract Academy voters at Oscar time and tug on the heart-strings of gullible viewers.  You may see things that are not really there, of course.  6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"A good film, but a terrible biopic","Simply put, a biopic about John Forbes Nash Jr., a mathematical genius who went on to win a Nobel Prize after years battling his many problems, including his schizophrenia.'A Beautiful Mind' is good, that much I'm not questioning. It is very engrossing, at times moving more like a thriller than a drama; likewise, the emotion actually feels natural and effective, without the usual sappiness of Hollywood dramas. The acting is superb: Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly shine here, and deserved the awards that year. Others who shone in a very good cast included Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer and Paul Bettany.My complaint comes in that this is supposed to be a biography of John Nash; however, it is anything but. This is Hollywood sugar-coating at its finest: it shows Nash as a troubled individual, having to fight against his illness and overcome his own shy nature to succeed; it completes ignores his more thornier history and changes it all to make him an impossibly sympathetic person.They flat out make things up as they go for the sake of turning this into your typical 'underdog fighting against all odds', formulaic and not unlike 'Rocky' or 'Good Will Hunting' (those other two, though, do not attempt to disguise themselves under the cover of a true story).This is partially fault of Nash himself, who refused to let a biopic of him unless they took out all the 'shadier' aspects of his life, and partially of screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, who extensively makes use of emotion over actual storytelling to win over his audiences in pretty much every film he does (I know what to expect when I see his name on a film, and it is never to expect a great one).In the end 'A Beautiful Mind' is a very good film, with a great cast, and a rare one which manages to make its emotional moments effective without melodrama or cheesiness; even the more cheesy moments, like Nash's 'Nobel Prize speech' (yet another non-truth), work better here than they usually. On the other hand, being labeled as a 'true story' or as a biopic is not only misleading, but distracting for those who know Nash's real (and far more interesting) story.I never understood Hollywood when it comes to their sugarcoated biopics. If they are going to change and make things up so his lifestory can support the theme they want to, why still insist with the 'true story' label? Just to fool the viewers/critics?",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
blah...,"I put off seeing this movie for quite some time because I didn't want to get caught up in the ""Beautiful Mind"" obsession.  But now that I have seen it, I wish I had used the time to do things that have more meaning, like reorganizing your sock drawer.  This is a manufactured film made expressly to win Oscars.  I have never seen as self-centered performance as Russell Crowe's.  Throughout the entire movie he might as well be saying ""I'm going to win an Oscar for playing this freak.  HA!""  He has no respect for the amazing man that he is playing, you can see that in his incredibly cliched movements that look like he read a book about what crazy people do, marked exactly where he was going to do these movements, and then executed them without thinking if this is the right time or if it makes sense for the character to do them then.  I was so relieved when he did not win the Oscar, but I didn't think Denzel Washington's performance in Training Day was all that spectacular, but it was more of a career award for him.  Russell Crowe, however, has had a career about as impressive as a box of hair.  Jennifer Connelly was just okay.  I didn't see anything spectacular or Oscar-worthy in her performance, she just sort of screamed and looked worried and disheveled.  The best picture Oscar could have gone to a much more deserving film like Moulin Rouge, instead of this heartless award trap.

Worth watching for fine acting despite being somewhat misleading and overtly sentimental,"This was a very well acted drama but it is very misleading in it's portrayal (MINOR SPOILERS) of schizophrenia. The direction by Ron Howard is conventional but what makes this film worth watching is the chemistry between Jennifer Connely and Russell Crowe. Their relationship seems genuine and I loved the tender moments between them. The film becomes overtly sentimental towards the end but never crosses over completely into full flown melodrama. Some of the attempts at explaining mathematics seem too clever by half. Still recommended, though scarcely deserving of its Best Film Oscar.Overall 7/10",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Surprise by Jennifer Connelly,"A fantastic film with fine performances by all its actors, A Beautiful Mind keeps you both entertained and amazed by both the intricacies of the plot and the stellar performances of its actors.Russell Crowe turns in a magnificent performance as John Nash, a mathematician with an amazing set of problems ( both in real life and mathematics ) that he is forced by circumstances to solve.While I am used to seeing stellar performances by Mr. Crowe, what I was amazed by was the absolutely stunning portrayal of Nash's wife by Jennifer Connelly.  While many have often stated that Ms. Connelly was talented beyond her previous screenwork, she proves that without doubt in this film. So often in the past Connelly has been used as a pair of breasts to be seen struggling against fabric or more often bared to titilate male viewers. Here, however, she shows for all time that her talents transcend the physical beauty she embodies.Jennifer Connelly is the anchor for this film and I truly hope we see more of this kind of work from her in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Just when I thought I had a handle on the plot and was convinced I knew exactly what was going to happen, reality would drop from beneath my feet. Nothing was given away.

The films start is all about what is real and what is not. Is Nash really a part of secret government code breaking group or does he just imagine all it and so on and so forth. That really is the best part of the film. After the reality and fiction become separated we are shown so mush syrup, that only Ron Howard is capable of doing that.This film wouldn't work without Crowes performance as disillusioned Nash, but he has great supporting cast.

He saw secret codes everywhere, including many that weren't there. I haven't read much about Nash, so am not certain how factual this is. This is Russell Crowe's best work yet. It's difficult to play an insane person, but he pulls off playing John Nash very nicely.

I also got the same reaction with the movie ""stranger than fiction"". But as I was watching it tonight again, identifying with the ache to be somebody significant and the hunger to understand it all (the governing dynamic), I finally saw a huge connection in the movie. To make it easy, run the film backwards in your head, Charlotte Church singing about someone who will protect, nurture, and ""see you through the night"", and then Nash's comments from the podium that his wife's love was what made all the logic possible. In every scene with Nash's wife she is in the guardian/caretaker role. Remember how smart she was- attempting to solve that unsolvable function - Nash said how elegant her work was.... The truth of the film is that Jennifer Connelly's character IS the Beautiful Mind - hers is the one that ordered his universe and her love that made his mind possible to carry on. Listen to the last 5 mins of the movie again.. It is clear. Now on the other hand - Howard is a great director and, as I said above, I see connections others don't - I always have. Maybe he didn't intend such a connection - but her steadfast, continual (in spite of her doubts) love and devotion (remember what she says when asked how she is doing)was the centering, pivotal presence in the movie.

Lesser Than the Sum of Its Parts,"As a critic and student of film myself, my first look at the poster for this film brought mixed emotions: directed by Ron Howard (yes!), written by Akiva Goldsman (oh no!)A simple glance at Mr. Goldsman's filmography gives a very nice look at a list of movies that range from the non-threateningly mediocre ('A Time to Kill'), to the atrociously horrible ('Batman and Robin,' 'Lost in Space'). I looked forward to this film with the sort of morbid curiosity one usually reserves for a pet with a terminal illness.The film is not at all horrible.  On the contrary, about 70-75% of it is quite good.  Ron Howard remains one of the most talented directors of our time, and Russell Crowe gives an outstanding, nuanced performance.  Also, there are charismatic and enjoyable performances from supporting players Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Paul Bettany.Despite the best efforts of the supporting players, however, none of them really have much to work with.  Ed Harris almost does, but by the time Goldsman yanks the rug out from under Nash (and the viewer) halfway through the film, I developed an animosity toward 'A Beautiful Mind' that I never recovered from.Howard does wonderful visual work, as does cinematographer (and Coen Brothers staple) Roger Deakins.  Relating the unique, ulrta-logical way Nash's mind works is no easy task, and Howard rises to it.The mediocre writing, however, does nothing more than tell a good story badly, and I don't think Howard's visual flare ever makes up for it.  I'm all good and happy that Goldsman saw ""Fight Club,"" but he's not nearly as talented as anyone involved with that film will ever be.Note to the viewer-- when Christopher Plummer shows up, do yourself a favor: get up, leave, take a bathroom break, or fast forward about 20 minutes into the future.  This bungled plot device fails, but the rest of the film is really about an A-minus.Ultimately flawed, but a nice homage to the real John Nash.  If those who knew him liked the film, then what else is there to say?",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Enthralling but flawed,"I guess my main problem with this movie is that it has tinkered to much with the real John Nash, his life, and illness. Probably if the movie had been a documentary it would have been to boring, but great liberties are taken around his personal life etc to cast doubts over its overall integrity.That said, it is a movie that forces the viewer to engage, and even might demand that critical viewers reflect on their own mental issues. As a recovered (hopefully) alcoholic I never underestimate the power and nature of the deranged mind.It was an interesting choice for Russell Crowe to play the part of Nash, and certainly the support crew is superb. Crowe does a good job but coming so close after Gladiator I do wonder if there might have been another choice.At a personal level I find this challenging and while I watch it about once a year sometimes I need to turn it off. Not perfect, but challenging, and pleased to see it hanging in to the IMDb Top 250 list.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Ron Howard manages thriller, suspense, romance and drama just right. The plot exalts the mathematician's painful and edifying trajectory","Making science look like an interesting topic to the lay public may not be the easiest task to achieve. We only have to look at the scarce filmography that deals with the life and work of great personalities of any science to discover how difficult it is to strengthen the ties between the common public and the distant (but fascinating) scientific world. Those who gained cinematic notoriety did not achieve it only for their genius and their scientific contribution to humanity. Stephen Hawking has won at least two biopics - driven largely by the fame he gained as a genius who overcame the physical devastation wrought by his illness. Other personalities from the scientific and technological world already had their media appeal well established before their stories were taken to the big screen. Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg are good examples, portrayed in Jobs and The Social Network, respectively.Making a biopic is a task of the gods. After all, there is no perfection, because there is always someone who will complain about the lack of some important fact, or that not everything was faithful to what really happened, etc. In the case of A Beautiful Mind, winner of the Oscar for Best Picture, what you see is a well-made production, but one that suffers from not addressing an important part of the honoree's life, demonstrating a lack of courage (or will) on the part of its producers in touch more painful topics. In this case, the ""gay side"" of John Nash that took him to prison.Still, perhaps the most popular and critically successful example in this universe is A Beautiful Mind, directed by Ron Howard. The choice of director and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman for the story of the famous mathematician and professor - John Nash - was, once again, influenced by the disease that the American genius developed. The fascination provoked by the idea that such a genius mind had to live with a mental illness as serious as schizophrenia certainly contributed to thicken the dramatic broth of the film, which allows itself to recreate Nash's story without worrying about great historical precisions. A Beautiful Mind makes a lot of use of this argument - the productive mind of the famous mathematician had to live all his life between reason and delusion, between intellectual rigor and the disarray of his imagination. And the duo Howard and Goldsman knew how to balance this duality well to attract their audience.As in The Insider, Crowe re-interprets, in A Beautiful Mind, a real character: mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr., who in the late 1940s developed a theory that would revolutionize economics in the following decades., but who, years later, ended up being diagnosed as schizophrenic due to his persecutory hallucinations and delusions of grandeur. With the failure of the treatments used at the time, Nash bet on ""self-conditioning"" as a way to fight the disease - and his struggle culminated in receiving the coveted Nobel Prize in 1994.Always versatile, Crowe manages to compose the character through the use of relatively subtle nervous tics and other equally important details, such as the habit of tilting his head down when talking to other people, in a mixture of shyness and apparent insecurity (I say ""apparent"" because, as the plot unfolds, Nash reveals himself to be a guy absolutely confident in his own talent, even showing signs of extreme egocentrism - an early indication of his illness, obviously). Despite this, the mathematician is never portrayed in a stereotypical way, as Crowe is successful in addressing other aspects of his complex personality, such as his intellectual frustration at not being able to develop an ""original idea"" and, later, his heartbreaking embarrassment at being forced to medicate in front of a former colleague.Meanwhile, Jennifer Connelly (undoubtedly one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood) does not let herself be overshadowed by her co-star and creates an equally strong and moving character, as her Alicia Nash is a woman determined to support her husband in every way possible. - even if it means living in a constant state of tension (it is precisely for this reason that their participation becomes more effective from the moment the mathematician's illness is discovered).Ron Howard's film is more related to these three periods of Nash's history exactly as classic cinema proposes: the hero's journey divided between the beginning of the apogee, the difficulty faced and the happy resolution. Not that the mathematician's life wasn't that way, but as stated in the biography written by journalist Sylvia Nasar and on which the film is based, Nash went to prison in 1954 for indecent behavior. All because of his ""deviations"" from homosexuality. In the feature this is almost 99% excluded, although a scene at a dinner suggests an exchange of looks almost sexual between him and another man. Not that this affects the work as a whole. Perhaps the film's main problem is the extremely romantic view of the story, as if Alicia were the perfect wife who loves her husband so much that she almost silently suffers from his disorders. Jennifer Connelly ends up standing out precisely for having so little in her hands and transforming this woman into a well of deep and sometimes ambiguous emotions. Her performance won her the Oscar for Supporting Actress.Ron Howard, who had shown himself to be a director with some talent in films like ""Subject of Fire"", does a good job of painting a fascinating portrait of John Nash, managing to turn even math into something exciting (I'm from the Humanities, remember...). Howard's direction is quite dosed, knowing how to balance the drama involving Nash's delusions with his redemptive romance with Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). When John's psychosis comes to a head, Howard chooses to close his plans in her ever-watchful eyes and startled mimicry.The director has the intelligence to know when to use fast cuts and fast tracking shots to portray the moments when Nash's visual hallucinations reach their peak. Two other great characters are also part of these moments - the secret agent of the US government William Parcher (Ed Harris) and the charismatic roommate Charles (Paul Bettany). Despite all the catastrophe of her illness, not everything she produces is negative. Part of this world even creates true affection. The only caveat to his work in this film is the overly comical focus given to its protagonist's social inadequacy, which ends up leading some viewers to the mistaken notion that Nash's psychological problems are an amusing eccentricity, not a serious illness that deserves our regret. (and the soundtrack composed by James Horner is efficient in this sense, as it moves without becoming too sugary).But if A Beautiful Mind is effective as fiction, there are some facilitations in its script that are unnecessary. The film could, for example, have given its audience more credit at times. Even without any connection to science, he could understand well enough that scientific work is more rigorous, demanding and expensive than the film suggests. John Nash certainly didn't elaborate his entire economic theory, which won him a Nobel Prize, with a simple insight on a bar table. He also didn't make a living writing his equations and calculations on windowpanes. All of this demonstrates an effort to romanticize the plot that goes a little too far. It's not just a lack of historical accuracy - a goal the film never had.Using James Horner's magical soundtrack, the director adds to the basics with scenes that know how to blend imagination with reality, neither hiding nor hastily revealing the true nature of some of their characters. Special effects and editing tricks also help Howard give identity to a common storytelling format. Some scenes stand out, like Nash's trip to the Pentagon or the one that creates an immediate theory about how to win a girl.The film's success is essentially due to its clever use of proven tactics. A straight-forward director responsible for the success of Apollo 13 (1995), Howard manages thriller, suspense, romance and drama just right. The plot exalts the mathematician's painful and edifying trajectory, always with a very happy ending. And the novel is based on the classic ideal of unconditional love. Allied to the inspired interpretations of Crowe and Connelly, the film proves to be exemplary within its own traditionalist perspective: without innovations or historical responsibility, but with a high level dramatic plot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Fabrication,"First off, the movie was not true to facts at all. I just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasn't anything like it. First of all Nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on. Also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong - the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it. In my opinion Russell Crowe didn't fit to this part at all since he doesn't look the intelligent/individualist type, therefore he really couldn't play one. It would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics (similar to Pi) and not the over-dramatized lovelife. At this level ABM was too hollywood-ish and too superficial to be great. Personally I think he wasn't mad nor paranoid and he was onto something since people of that caliber tend to know more than we ""lesser mortals"". 5/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"If you can believe it, this is a love story. a maddening and seductive one.","The credits rolled and immediately my inner me said, ""Best Picture."" I say this a lot, of course, technically I'm allowed to say it five times a year. But I added, ""Winner. No doubt"" this time around- Never said that before. But, A Beautiful Mind is an Oscar darling. And it's appeal has never been so obvious- Character frailty, heroism, a powerful love story, resonant acting and writing and despite all the backlash from critics and purists regarding it's sexual ambiguity, something Blockbuster can carry. Remember American Beauty, in comparison, had subtle references too (actually to me they were blatant, but hey this is a general forum) and it still snagged the big statue.Which leaves me to Russell Crowe, whose performance in The Insider was as close to perfect as an actor can get (He 'vus robbed!). Of course, the voters knew their mistake (although it took him a year- see Gladiator- to get it right). To the film: Crowe's versatility simply baffles me here, once again, reaching deep within who knows where to become the math genius and Nobel Prize- winning John Nash. His preparation has to be extremely unique to continually put forth this much passion into each role. I'd love to know what he does- anyone?The film doesn't work, though, without Jennifer Connelly. As Nash's wife, she provides a potent chemistry with Crowe and an energetic calm that slowly creeps up on you. Not sure how, but I swear she steals some scenes away from Russy- but that's real, real chemistry folks, not the Meg Ryan-Tom Hanks kind. Anyway, all the sudden, after all the math wizardry, the psycho-babble and surprises (everyone knows this about a schizophrenic I'm sure, but there is an awesome shocker in here too) you come to realize. damn this is a love story!Thus, we steer are way to the captain of the ship. Ron Howard's direction here is, again, impressive- almost seducing you into understanding and thinking along with Nash's motives and emotional battles with himself and his relationships- the will-he or won't-he's are jarring and paradoxal, fun and draining all at once. A Beautiful Mind is by far Howard's most complete and compelling work  as well as his most important. Of course, he's working with talented actors who helped drive the films dramatic and emotional ranges. and a solid script. or should I say book. I'm not completely sold on Howard as a great director. I believe most of his films are largely in the IMDB 6-7 range, but this is definitely one that he deserves a 9 for. How much all this praise and these awards to come are a credit to him remains to be seen. Either way, A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful and unique love story.

"Good acting, boring film","I am not a Russell Crowe fan, but found his a good performance, along with Jennifer Connelly's and Ed Harris'. But, in spite of this, the film turned out to be a little dreary and too long. Why on earth the current trend is making films as long as possible? Can't we have a good movie whose running time doesn't go beyond two hours?Being a little sensitive when it comes to the same old political references, I got the willies when the ""Russians-are-out-to-drop-a-bomb-on-us"" quote came first. I thought we'd had enough of that bullshit in the past, but apparently not. To be honest, I didn't know the film's action was set in such a large period of time, starting in the early stages of cold war and ending in the nineties, but anyway that remark made me lose interest real quick. Plus the movie drags on too long. Any good film can be flawed by an excessive running time, like happens to be the case and, despite Crowe's great performance, his character is boring at times. I could not care less for John Nash if he is that dull.To sum up, the film is not bad but, as for deserving so much hype, I sincerely doubt it. Not that this year there is a lot of Oscar-deserving movies as far as I know, aside from Lord of the Rings, of course.

Ron Howard Hooey,"John Forbes Nash Jr. was a mathematics prodigy won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1994. He was also a troubled bisexual who was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The true story of his life is hard hitting stuff, too bad barely any of the nitty gritty made it to the screen in Ron Howard's puffy bio pic. A Beautiful Mind cleans ups Nash's story, softening the edges and failing to provide any insight into the inner workings of this complex man. By the time we get to the third act things have degenerated into true Ron Howard hooey. The saving grace of this movie are the performances of Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly.

"A Beautiful Film, Story, you name it.....","A Beautiful Mind covers the life of master mathematician John Nash starting with his tenure in college and ends with his winning of the Nobel Prize in 1994.

All of which are figments of his imagination. The hallucinations never leave him throughout his life, but he learns to deal with them, due in part to the patience and love that his wife(played by Connely) for him.

The first half hour reminded me of quality British dramas (like Chariots of Fire), and had a few marvellous scenes. Just as I was starting to think this would be a good movie, it started to go drastically downhill.The filmmakers (Ron Howard, Akiva Goldsman) get drawn into what appears like two subplots - one about Nash's love affection and one about his paranoia of communist spies - and lose the conception of the film. There's been comments of the film as a tear jerker... Sorry? I didn't find anything emotional about this movie. Towards the ending, it just keeps getting more and more like a bad TV-movie. All characters are poorly written, there is not one single good dramatic scene; a *lot* of the screen time is stolen by imaginary characters (they actually feel more lively than the actual people in the movie).The acting is hopeless; the dreadful direction makes all characters except Nash seem like cameos and the screenplay really feels as it is written by the fellow who wrote Batman & Robin (dah).And the fact that the film isn't thruthful to its subject doesn't make it any better, either.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Most Dominant Best Picture Winner in Years.,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is easily the finest best picture winner since ""Titanic"" and was a dominant movie during a year where several films could have been honored just as easily. John Forbes Nash (Russell Crowe in an Oscar-nominated performance) comes to Princeton in 1947 determined to make a name for himself in the complicated science of mathematics. The young mathematician struggles though as his mind and body are consumed with theories and amazingly complicated formulas. The torture and hard work do pay off eventually as Nash comes up with a game theory which leads to bigger and better things. Fast-forward a few years and now Nash is continuing research at Princeton, teaching and falling in love with one of his students (Oscar-winner Jennifer Connelly). All seems to be going well until he is approached one day by a mysterious government agent (Ed Harris in a cryptic performance). Now Nash is doing top-secret work as he becomes immersed in code-breaking to stem the tide of communism against the Russians. But ""A Beautiful Mind"" goes much, much, much deeper than that. The film takes a dramatic turn during its mid-point and the subject turns 180 degrees as Nash is diagnosed with schizophrenia which causes paranoia and skewers what is reality and what is reality to John Nash. What then follows is a story about mental illness and the complications which accompany that sickness to those affected and those who care for those who are affected. John Nash becomes a could-have-been mathematician then as he is placed in a mental health institution in the 1950s where he must go through intense insulin-injected electro-shock therapy and then must take medications to fight his illness. The medications destroy Nash's ability to think properly and affects his physical demeanor as well. Nash then takes it upon himself to stop the medications and try to use his mind to cope with his illness. While Nash does somewhat succeed in that regard, it is his beautiful heart and the love and support of those closest to him that enable Nash to continue his work and eventually receive the Nobel Prize for his Game Theory in 1994. Of course all of this is based on a true story and the real John Nash still teaches today at Princeton. The film is a Hollywood project though as it has become apparent that the film-makers took many liberties to tell this important story. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is director Ron Howard's (Oscar-winning) masterpiece by a mile. Very few could have directed this film with the style and dignity that Howard displayed. This movie was all shot in chronological order, a rare feat by any director. The Oscar-winning screenplay by Akiva Goldsmith proved to be the really important thing that made the film work as well as it did. This is the best film hands down dealing with the subject of mental illness (I do not consider ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" a film about this topic because I question whether or not Jack Nicholson's character really had anything wrong with him mentally). However, I must warn all that the scene leading up to Nash's insulin-injected electro-shock therapy and the treatment itself are disturbing sequences that are difficult to get through. The film achieved a PG-13 rating, but those scenes could have warranted an R just as easily. All the aforementioned performances are super and Judd Hirsch and Christoper Plummer (who has an imperative role that basically explains all that happens) both give excellent supporting turns, but this is Crowe's show as he gives his greatest performance to date. Excellent film from an excellent cinematic year. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Beautiful....,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is an exceptional story, but it is only and exceptional film because of its director. Ron Howard does an amazing job of engaging his audience, introducing a brilliant main character, and making the audience experience the reality of mental illness. This could have been an unbelievable story to which very people could relate; however, the directorial mastery Howard exhibits throughout allows the audience to accompany Nash on his journey and awareness of his illness. Anyone who has been close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate how respectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject. Howard is able to portray all the complex reactions to mental illness while maintaining the humanity and dignity of the patient. Superbly directed, wonderfully acted by Crowe and cast, this film succeeds on every level.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
It's a beautiful achievement...,"Russell Crowe's stunning performance in A BEAUTIFUL MIND has to rank among the greatest screen portrayals of all time. He convinced everyone of his talent in previous film roles (GLADIATOR, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL), but this has to be his crowning achievement--actually becoming, in voice, gesture, nuances, another man entirely.No less brilliant is Jennifer Connolly as his loyal, frightened wife who has to deal with the knowledge that her husband is a paranoid schizophrenic who may never be completely cured.Ed Harris, as Parcher, is impressive in basically a sidelines role that he turns into an outstanding cameo. Christopher Plummer is quietly effective as a psychiatrist who has John Nash (Crowe) institutionalized when his breakdown goes into full gear.Clever is the way the screenplay has Nash interacting with characters that only he sees--with the viewer unaware that they are part of his delusions. A fine script, intelligent direction and heartfelt performances by Crowe and Connolly place this among the best films in recent years--offbeat and thoroughly absorbing from beginning to end. If Oscars were awarded for true merit, Russell Crowe would have won as Best Actor in 2001--instead of Denzel Washington. But we all know the games Hollywood plays in these politically correct times with Crowe being punished for his ""unsuitable"" private behavior and Denzel being awarded for all the wrong reasons to prove that Hollywood is color blind.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Beautiful Film,"As we go about our daily rituals and routines of living, in our own individual way, whether we are conscious of it or not, we are conforming to what we know to be the reality of our existence; a tangible, substantive reality we recognize, understand and trust.  And our senses provide the proof of that reality.  If we can see it, we can believe it-- which we do, and with good reason.  It's real.  But then again, what is `real' to one person isn't necessarily real to another, because there are instances in which an individual's `reality' exists only within the boundaries of his own mind, in a shadowland not unlike what many would think of as the Twilight Zone.  Only this place is not the creation of Rod Serling, but a very real place which exists-- with parameters set according to the individual-- within the mind of a schizophrenic.  And it is to that place that director Ron Howard takes us in `A Beautiful Mind,' starring Russell Crowe.Crowe plays John Nash, a mathematical genius, who since the late forties has left his mark on such prestigious bastions of knowledge as MIT and Princeton, and whose `Equilibrium n-tuple' is perhaps the most important idea in noncooperative game theory ever conceived; equilibrium strategies being the things we predict about people.  It's not been an easy road for Nash, however.  As he himself puts it, he doesn't like people much; nor do they, in general, like him.  And it's made constructive social interaction something of a problem for him throughout his life.  Beginning as early as his student days at Princeton, he was noticeably `different,' not only in his relationships with others, but in the way he conducted his academic pursuits.  Even within his small group of friends-- fellow students-- he is a challenge.  He seems able to open up only to a select few:  His roommate, Charles (Paul Bettany), being the first and foremost, and later the somewhat mysterious Government agent, William Parcher (Ed Harris), whom Nash first encounters while involved in a project at the Pentagon, and eventually one of his students, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly).  Nevertheless, his future is filled with promise, but in the early 50s, while doing some covert work for Parcher, the mental illness which will devastate his life becomes apparent, and his life takes an unexpected turn into that shadowland that will test the loyalty of even those who love him the most.One of the reasons for Ron Howard's success as a director is that he understands human nature and has the ability to convey his insights to his audience.  He knows how to express the inner-most feelings of his characters in a way in which the viewer will be able to identify and relate.  And this film is no exception.  In bringing John Nash's story to the screen, he concentrates on the man, rather than the illness, and it's that which makes this such riveting drama.  While we get a glimpse of the physical horrors of schizophrenia, it's in witnessing the devastating and debilitating effects of it on Nash and those close to him that makes the film so emotionally involving.  Howard seems to be saying, this is a man's `life' we're dealing with, not just an academic case study; it's the humanity of the story that's important-- and that's exactly what he delivers.  He tells the story in a way that allows the viewer to empathize with Nash, as well as those around him, and he makes Nash a sympathetic character without resorting to any mawkish sentimentality.  Howard gives you Nash as he is, an individual of extraordinary ability, with achievements and problems to match, and presented within a framework that is very real and entirely effective.As Nash, Russell Crowe once again demonstrates that he is so much more than just a celebrity or a `movie star,' but an actor in the truest and purest sense of the word.  When you can watch an actor doing a part and completely forget that what you're watching is a performance, you know the work is exceptional, which is exactly what Crowe is here.  The story follows Nash through a span of close to fifty years, and the aging process is presented seamlessly by Crowe, who takes his character from youth to old age quite naturally and so subtly, that as you're watching you don't even give it a thought until, at the end, you suddenly realize that you've just experienced a man's entire life.  Howard and some outstanding makeup work must take some of the credit, of course, but beyond that it's Crowe who sells it, who makes it so real and brings Nash so credibly to life.  It's a performance that has Oscar written all over it, and deservedly so.After a string of outstanding performances in a number of films (like `Requiem For A Dream' and `Waking the Dead'), Jennifer Connelly should finally receive some of the acclaim she is due with her portrayal of Alicia. Early in the film she effectively plays to her natural, dark beauty, but this is decidedly not a glamorous role, and as the story progresses Connelly successfully manages a much deeper expression of who her character really is and what she is made of.  It's an emotionally challenging role, and she certainly rises to the occasion.  And, like Crowe, she develops her character quite naturally, not only physically, but through a maturity of manner and perspective, as well.  It's a good piece of work, and if justice prevails she will receive the notice she deserves for it, because it's definitely one of the many strengths of the film.The supporting cast includes Christopher Plummer (Dr. Rosen), Adam Goldberg (Sol), Vivien Cardone (Marcee), Judd Hirsch (Helinger) and Josh Lucas (Hansen) .  Thought provoking and emotionally stirring, `A Beautiful Mind' is, in the final analysis, a beautiful film, rich in it's humanity, and a journey that should not be missed.  I rate it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A very warming experience with a very heartbreaking story.,"The story of professor John Nash is incredible and the movie was just very good in portraying his tragedy and what he had been through was only his beautiful mind that is facing the impossible and was good in expressing his wife's struggle , love and patience with him and both was performed incredibly well by Russel and Jennifer , both deserved the Oscar not only Jennifer. However Ron Howard did a good job in the movie but I think he didn't really deserve his Oscar cause the movie really could have been a lot better with lots of tears and of course a lot of other meanings from that genius person's story and only depending on the warm music and performance of the leading actors wasn't close to what this story could have become with another more intelligent director. By this I don't mean to Underestimate his good job in the movie but I guess many other awards agree with me that he did a good job but didn't do his best only the Oscars that refused to give it to Peter Jackson. The story too didn't focus on his smart and the people around him more than it focused on his problem and tragedy that I felt he was a genius person his tragedy prevented him from using his mind and his family suffered to make him better. The whole cast was superb and the music was the feeling of the movie very warming and passionate. Don't miss it. 7.5",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Beautiful Mind or maybe something else??,"Russell Crowe was a good choice on portraying John Nash, but he should have done his research on Schizophrenia or the type of therapies that were done on patients with schizophrenia. This was the basic ""Hollywood"" view on people that have schizophrenia, even though Russell Crowe did a good job acting wise, there was a lot of information that wasn't told about John Nash, that would help the background of the movie, for instance that schizophrenia was shown in other family members, so it was genetic. I feel that the movie could have been set up a little differently, but movies that are based on true stories always hold things out. I guess no one really wants to watch a five-hour movie.

"That was nice, what's for dinner?","I've just come back from seeing ""A Beautiful Mind"" and I can report that it is truly a remarkable film.  To tell the truth, I can't recall seeing a film that is so overwhelmingly and consistently bland.  You can't hate it.  It tackles a worthy subject, and does an OK job of it.  The acting is OK, nothing outstanding, and Russel Crowe obviously has the Oscar Glint before him as he gets his hair styled in a very unattractive way for it.  The direction is, well, there.  Subtle, I believe is he word.  In the two and a half hours, I only had the urge to check my watch once, so that wasn't too bad.  There were absolutely no surprises, or twists, or memorable scenes, really.  It was just one of those films that you come out of and go ""Well, that was a film.  What's for dinner?""I am perhaps hampered in my appreciation of this in that I did Mathematics at Uni, and don't think there is anything intrinsically cool in it. I do, however, know that there are other, bizarre people who DO think that Maths is in some way funky (Oh, you did MATHS!  You must be so SMART!). Which probably influenced me a lot because without the ""You must be so SMART"" bit, you end up with the story of a very unattractive man, with a mental problem, which never gets resolved, but moves nicely into the background.A good policy for the film itself.

The story of a genius dumbed down for us yokels.,"It's the usual problem with a film about someone whose accomplishments are less easy to demonstrate than touchdowns or legislation passed or wars won: How do you convey even a taste of what makes an artist an artist, or in this case, a genius a genius?Let me say right off that I don't particularly care about possible factual errors in a biopic, unless they're so glaring as to oppose the spirit of their subject (i.e., depicting Muhammad Ali as a Nazi or Himmler as a Muslim).What really bothers me about this well-acted (by the leads) but safe and pat movie is that the filmmakers had plenty of access to details of Nash's accomplishments, but decided not to let us in on the secret(s).  Perhaps the studio just decided we movie-going yokels wouldn't be interested in that kind of thing... and judging from the mega-box office success of the film, maybe they were right.The film is called ""A Beautiful Mind"", and Nash is a Nobel-winning mathematician, but rather than delve into exactly what made his theories so revolutionary, screenwriter Akiva (the Batman series, Lost In Space) Goldsman and director Ron (Night Shift, Apollo 13) Howard feed us the glowing comments of others & a cute but not entirely plausible explanation of Nash's revolutionary work.  Instead, the film focuses on (fictional) paranoid delusions in order to pander to the sympathies of some.  Why not show (rather than tell) us what made this man so brilliant?It's very difficult to create an artist, much less a genius on screen (""Pollock"", ""Amadeus"", and ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" are among the notable exceptions), but in my opinion that is what would have made this a special film.  Instead, it's the usual bland button-pushing, lifted by Crowe's extraordinary performance and strong work by Harris and Connelly in support.This one's not as hilariously undeserving of the statue as ""Gladiator"", ""Out Of Africa"", and ""Braveheart"", but it will settle in nicely with the likes of ""Chariots Of Fire"" and ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in the bland and forgettable bin, should this heavy favorite win Best Picture in 2002.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Total Garbage!,"This is another hit for Bettany, and another dialed-in crapfest from Crowe. I do NOT GET the adulation awarded this film by critics.

He came up with a notion of equilibrium, which is simply brilliant and he more than deserves the Nobel. But Crowe does NOT. This was supposed to be a historical film, but due to Crowe's lackluster performance, backed up by his aggressive contractual negotiations, his character has been given credit for things he did not do! In a learned person's opinion, this is an irresponsible, and disgraceful film mainly due to Crowe's contractual screen time, which necessitated giving his character credit for things he should not have been portrayed as having done, and his totally crappy, dialed in performance.This was a typical Hollywood whitewash of the truth, and a typical Hollywood performance by Crowe.

A beatiful Mind,"A film about the life of mathematician John Nash, starring Russell Crowe with his excellent performance. The real John Nash is not shown completely in the movie, which was shot while John Nash was still alive and tells his life from his university life to the year he won the Nobel Prize. The life of Nash, whose actions overshadow the positive atmosphere of the film, is described in a simplified manner. Russell Crowe's performance as the famous mathematician was outstanding, and Jennifer Connelly as his wife and Ed Harris in the supporting role were also very good. After graduating from university, Nash gradually loses the connection between reality and dreams, and his illness becomes increasingly severe. Nash, who oscillates between genius and madness, will begin to fight this disease by using his mind, and his wife Alicia will do her best with patience and sacrifice in these moments.

"John Nash, a master mathematician","I have to say wow, a Beautiful Mind, directed by Ron Howard, is more than just a biographical film about the life of John Nash, the brilliant mathematician and Nobel laureate. It's a profound exploration of the beauty and complexity of mathematics, intertwined with the fragility and resilience of the human mind. The film takes us on a journey through Nash's extraordinary mathematical genius, his struggle with schizophrenia, and his eventual redemption and recognition. It is a story that captures the poetic elegance of mathematics and its power to illuminate the deepest corners of the human experience.This film presents mathematics not as an abstract or mechanical discipline, but as a living art form capable of revealing the intricacies of the universe. The film begins with a young Nash arriving at Princeton University, driven by an obsession to discover something truly original. His passion for mathematics is palpable, and the beauty of his pursuit shines brightly as he embarks on the journey that leads to his groundbreaking work in game theory. His development of the Nash Equilibrium, a concept that revolutionized economics and social sciences, serves as a testament to the elegance of mathematical thought.The cinematography amplifies this appreciation of mathematics, visually representing Nash's thought processes in stunning, almost magical ways. Equations and patterns appear in the air around him as he visualizes complex problems, transforming abstract concepts into something tangible. These moments emphasize that mathematics is not merely an intellectual pursuit, it is a way of perceiving and interacting with the world. Nash's ability to discern patterns in chaos highlights the extraordinary power of the human mind to uncover order and beauty where others see none.However, the film doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of Nash's life. His battle with schizophrenia creates a stark contrast to the clarity of his mathematical work. The hallucinations and paranoia that plague him are portrayed with unsettling intensity, offering a poignant glimpse into the chaos of a mind at war with itself. These moments remind us of the thin line between genius and madness, and the immense challenges faced by those who live with mental illness.The film culminates in Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize, a moment that transcends personal achievement to become a celebration of the human spirit. His acknowledgment of Alicia's support during his acceptance speech is profoundly moving, encapsulating the essence of the story: the delicate balance between logic and emotion, mind and heart. This moment mirrors Nash's mathematical work, symbolizing his journey towards harmony in both his professional and personal life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

I really enjoyed all the performances, from his funny roomate who you can't help but completely adore, to his wife Alicia who stands by him and is so faithful no matter what- and of course John himself.

Perhaps the most overrated big Hollywood movie ever,"First of all, let me say that the featured comment on this movie cracks me up. ""A movie with a difference - It's realistic""? Ha. This movie is hardly realistic. It totally misrepresents the nature of Nash's delusions, and it criminally oversimplifies how game theory works. For example, schizophrenics never experience visual hallucinations, only auditory hallucinations, and Nash's delusions were hardly as quasi-patriotic and noble as the movie made them seem.This is your typical Hollywood movie, but perhaps because the eponymous mind was so brilliant, the movie has intellectual delusions of grandeur. Sure, the tolerably good plot makes it watchable, but this movie continually irritated me all the way through, primarily because it maintained a constant ponderous gravitas in an apparent attempt to suggest that there is some profound meaning deeper than the movie's plot. And that meaning just isn't there. The movie's huge mathematical, psychiatric, and biographical distortions were also frustrating. Competent acting and production are this movie's only redeeming qualities; the script is heavy, condescending, pretentious, and shallow.

3.5 stars,"I saw this on 2/19/2002. The title refers to the mind of John Nash, a brilliant but eccentric mathematician played by Russell Crowe. This film, which is based on the real life of John Nash, opens in 1947 when he arrives at Princeton, and continues through a period of 47 years. During this time his eccentricity is seen to deepen into mental illness, and we see his struggles against it in a way few others could attempt.Crowe's performance here is quite remarkable, both in terms of portraying the changing phases of his life, but also his ability to show us what he is feeling in his early encounters with his schoolmates and his future wife (played very well by Jennifer Connelly) and his later battles with mental illness. Ed Harris, on the other hand, is under used. The direction, by Ron Howard, is quite good in its ability to show us the inner workings of Nash's mind, both in its mathematical brilliance and in its struggles with sanity.The biggest aspect that holds this film back from greatness is its simplification and Hollywood-izing of Nash's life. For example, Nash's bisexuality is left out of the film. But even if the package is just a little too neatly wrapped, this is a film that is highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Russell Crowe as John Nash was really great . Other cast very well supported . It was good that they didn't dumb too many mathematics and completely focused on his life story ( I hate maths 😅 ) . Overall a well made movie , must watch . No adult contents .",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"An entertaining film of substance and delight. Not at all morbid in spite of the 13-letter 's' word. There's dashes of humor, bemusement a-plenty.","To tell a story about a schizophrenic person is a challenge in itself. Yet director Ron Howard delivered a literally entertaining suspenseful film with equal sensitivity, revolving around the backbone storyline of the love relationship between two persons - John and Alicia Nash, fascinatingly portrayed by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly. It's a heart-warming film, ultimately uplifting. It affirms that with tenacity and persistence, loving and steadfast supportive companionship, hope - life's staple, will thrive and grow. Do not just give up and be overcome by other's opinions of you.It is a beautiful mind. Such fascination with the world he sees, envisions. It captivates, enchants, delights and bewitches. Confuses, too. Is it for real? Is it only fictional in his mind? Nevertheless, it's a beautiful mind. Period. Infinity. It's a Möbius strip. Reminds me of the world of M.C. Escher - it's science and fiction, mathematical and sensational. The nurturing of such a beautiful mind, as director Howard points out, is the robust element of love, tender & care.To go to a movie with expectations of accuracy and truth in its delivery does set oneself up for disappointment. A movie is a movie is a movie. It is not a factual documentary, an A&E Biography, or E! channel's Scandal for that matter. Drama, in every sense of the word, is not real. It mimics a situation, its emotional characteristics, and actors give performances for our viewing pleasure. We are fortunate to have passionate filmmakers who produce films of substance. It's best to take the film for what its worth and enjoy the creative talents of the collaborative effort. Filmmakers may try to be as close to facts as possible, but they all have disclaimers at the end of credit roll for any fictitious injections in the film. So why stop yourself from appreciating the film with nagging doubts of accuracy and truth. Like the ever changing/generating molecules, truth is but for the moment it existed.The excellent performances by the two leads, Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, truly deserve the Golden Globe Awards, along with Akiva Goldsman for his screenplay, and longtime producing partners of Imagine Entertainment, Brian Grazer and Ron Howard. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is further graced by fine supporting performances: Ed Harris - never disappoints, be it light in ""Milk Money,"" heavy in ""Third Miracle,"" all-encompassing in ""Truman Show,"" passionate in ""Pollock,"" intense in ""Enemy At the Gates"" or vulnerable in ""China Moon."" Christopher Plummer - a stroke of genius casting him as we can't tell for sure if he's playing the nemesis again as he often does. Paul Bettany - the brilliant Geoffrey Chaucer of ""A Knight's Tale"" who can be tongue-whipping and subtle. Universal Pictures and Dreamworks certainly luck out in joining this endeavor by being distributors of the film, U.S. and worldwide. The eight Oscar nominations included film score by the inimitable James Horner, film editing, makeup (indeed!) besides best picture, director, actor, supporting actress, and screenplay. Cinematography was by master Roger Deakins, whose superior photography quietly complemented the varying moods as the story unfolds. Deakins was behind the two recent Coen Brothers films ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" 2000 - deftly subtle & dim lighted color, and ""Man Who Wasn't There, The"" 2001 - indisputably exquisite & artistic black and white.Give yourself a chance to see ""A Beautiful Mind."" Clear your mind and go see it without expectations. Simply enjoy. Yes, believe that ""something extraordinary can happen"" in your life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

One of those movies...,"Have you ever been to one of those movies that is just so powerful and breathtaking that it leaves you utterly speechless after the movie lets out? Well, this certainly qualifies as one of those films.  Although the story was a bit of fiction (they somehow left out the real reason Nash left Wheeler Labs), it was actually a beautiful, inspiring and powerful story. In addition to the excellent story and directing, the acting was fabulous. When we sat down in the theatre, I said to my girlfriend ""Russell Crowe has a monumental task ahead of him: convincing me that he's a math dork, not General Maximus or Officer Bud White.""  I have to say that if anyone deserves an Oscar this year it is Russell Crowe.  He makes the audience compassionate for his character in a way that is not often seen.  Paul Bettany, Jennifer Conolley, and Ed Harris were also excellent in the supporting cast.  Overall, I gave this movie a '10.'  It is rare when Hollywood puts out such a wonderful movie.

"thoughtful, intelligent, wonderful","I thought the film was a magnificent piece of work on the story of John Nash Jr. The emotional aspect of the film, and the ability to see into the man's mind and experience what he saw, thought, and felt was truly, truly remarkable. To think that we only use about 10% of our brains is sad in one aspect, that being what if we were to use 50% or 90% of our thinking potential where could we go? What could we do? But on a high note, now knowing what we do know, isn't a glorious thought that maybe we can try and find ways to tap into our minds? Imagine the rewards we could experience as humans, and what we could share w/ others.

"Some moments of Hollywood sentimentality make this a very good, but not great film.","'A Beautiful Mind' is one of those inspirational films about a troubled man struggling against the odds and winning. The kind that do well at the Oscars, like 'Gandhi' or 'Forrest Gump'. Russell Crowe plays John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who developes schizophrenia and loses touch with reality. He deals with his illness with the help of his wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). Fashionable cynicism aside, it is a wonderful story, because it's true. Of course some of the nastier things Nash did when he was nuts - like slag Jews - are ignored for the sake of a tighter script and a more appealing hero. This is an example of why the movie is good but not great - director Ron Howard ('Apollo 13', Richie in 'Happy Days') can't quite trust the story. He has to overplay his hand, showing Alicia's nobility and Nash's courage a little heavy-handedly, letting the music soar a bit too much, in short making a Hollywood movie. It's not that 'A Beautiful Mind' is sickening or earnest - there's a surprising amount of laugh-out-loud moments relating to Nash's delusions and some gripping scenes - but there is enough schlock to keep it from being really outstanding.The performance that sums up how overrated the movie is belongs to Jennifer Connelly. She was widely praised by critics and picked up Best Supporting Actress at the Baftas and Oscars, but frankly she's too beautiful for her role. There are no lines of care on her face, not enough weariness or pain. It's pretty hard to see why she falls for a self-centered, socially inept nerd like Nash. Connelly tries hard, but gives us an angel when we need a real woman.It is Crowe on whom the movie stands. As a man he may be little more than another Aussie yobbo, but on screen he's a class act. Look around a campus, particularly the Science blocks, and you'll see his young Nash: twitchy, not quite meeting the eye, a little hunched, very smart, the social skills of a hermit crab. Later, in Nash's prime, he becomes more aloof, arrogant, contemptuous of 'lesser mortals'. then the schizophrenia sets in, the nervousness returns and his eyes become sunken and desperate. I can't imagine a more different role than Maximus in 'Gladiator', which shows that Crowe has one hell of a range as an actor. Some may find his performance mannered, but as he spends most of the movie portraying a man on the edge of sanity it works, and works terrifically well.In the end we are left with a fine film: 'A Beautiful Mind' is well directed with a good script, a solid supporting cast and a great lead actor. But best film? Give me the grandeur of 'The Fellowship of the Ring', the cleverness of 'Memento' or the charm of 'Amelie' any day.7 1/2 /10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Yet another triumph over adversity tale,"'A Beautiful Mind' tells the real-life story of mathematics professor and genius John Nash who also suffers from schizophrenia.  Included in this account is John's time spent at Princeton University where he chooses to skip classes entirely in pursuit of an original idea with which to make his name.  Thus, we see John spending much of his time scribbling complex mathematical formulae on the windows of his room and the university library.Despite his illness, John's work eventually results in him being awarded the Nobel Prize.  After leaving Princeton, he accepts a couple of assignments which involve code breaking for the government, one of these being provided by the mysterious Parcher (Ed Harris).  As he undertakes this assignment, John is filled with paranoia as his condition of schizophrenia becomes more apparent to his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and the audience.Although 'A Beautiful Mind' doesn't make for light entertainment, there is some humour to be found.  John's lack of social skills is evident in the way he handles women and his frankness in confessing to them that he would like to undertake intercourse as soon as possible as part of his chat up is quite endearing.  John's room mate Charles also provides welcome comic relief in the film's few lighter moments.One downside of the story telling in the film is the skipping of several years at a time which may leave you wondering what's been missed out in the account of this man's life (the upside is that the passing of time is accompanied by very convincing make-up!).  The end of the film seems a little rushed in the way John seems to make remarkable progress in his recovery and the fact that his wife sticks by him during his prolonged mental illness is a little unconvincing.A film dealing with mental illness is never going to be comfortable viewing but the fact that the film is based on a true life story does make it fascinating to watch.  What impressed me the most is the first class acting on display: the two leads Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly produce engaging and Oscar-worthy performances which are at times heartbreaking. In fact, Crowe could quite possibly be the new Tom Hanks in his ability to gain yet another Oscar nomination.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Sanitized plot and dreadful acting,I am afraid to say that this is yet another example of Hollywood creating their own sanitized version of someone's life. What purports to be a biography is not - all the parts which may upset an American audience have been left out.

So emotional,"""A Beautiful Mind""! This visually stunning film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster through the life of John Nash, brilliantly portrayed by Russell Crowe. The cinematography beautifully captures the contrast between Nash's genius mind and the chaotic world around him. The use of light and shadows adds depth to the storytelling, reflecting the inner struggles of the protagonist. And let's not forget about the mesmerizing score by James Horner. The music perfectly complements the film, enhancing the emotional impact of each scene. The performances in this movie are truly outstanding. Crowe's portrayal of Nash is both heartbreaking and inspiring, showcasing his incredible range as an actor. The supporting cast, including Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris, delivers powerful performances that add layers of complexity to the narrative. The screenplay is masterfully crafted, seamlessly weaving together Nash's mathematical brilliance, his personal struggles, and the suspenseful elements of the story. Ron Howard's direction brings it all together, guiding the audience through Nash's journey with sensitivity and precision.

Fabulous!,"I went because a colleague, who is not a particularly young colleague either, told me that this was quite possibly the best movie she had ever seen in her life.  It certainly was excellent.  If it did happen to be the one movie you ever got to see, it would not be a bad choice.  It has intellectual stimulation, suspense, love, surprises, humor, and great acting.  It never drags, and is always convincing.One thing I appreciated about it was that I did not feel over-stimulated. Sometimes I think Hollywood just tries too hard to make you go ""wow!"" Instead, this movie chose to take on the pace and character of reality. It was like floating along on the river of this man's life.Russel Crowe was the height of the movie -- not the least of the performance was an Australian doing a West Virginia accent, which I thought he pulled off most credibly, at least most of the time.  The woman playing the wife was not as good, though exceptionally beautiful, which is not a bad thing in a movie.  Also the man playing the roommate was very good.I didn't realize that Ron Howard, whom I can never stop thinking of as Opie, was the director until the closing credits.  Well little Opie grew up and done good!  It's funny how I almost feel like he was a childhood friend, albeit from a different state.I have read that in some ""primitive"" societies, schizophrenics are treated quite differently from here.  They can be regarded as religious mystics and are encouraged to talk about their visions.  Some people think that this treatment actually works better than what we do.  This movie certainly makes one wonder whether that might not be true.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Both leading actors deserve the oscar (why is Jennifer Connely nominated for a supporting role?

The story that is told in the movie is extremely different from the biography of Nash (communism instead of aliens, son from another woman, divorce, etc...)!

Like all awardscoopers overrated.,"It's got the Golden Globes and it's got the Oscar nominations so it can't be that good, right? The tendency I have is, frankly, to be very sceptical about this kind of award-winning film because the Oscars tend to be little more than a popularity contest. And if you look at a list of the big Oscar winners of the last decade(s) you'll see it hardly ever is the year's best movie getting the Best Film award (see for example American Beauty beating the likes of Magnolia and The Insider while Fight Club wasn't even nominated). Usually the awards are given to some babyboom-appealing toothless film about triumph over adversity with massive studio backing. Well, when you read A Beautiful Mind's tagline, you pretty much get the idea it's purely aimed at forking in the Golden Baldies. So, is it as good as the award ceremonies would have you believe or it as bad as I thought it would be?The answer is: it's neither. There's a lot wrong with this, A LOT. I haven't read the book either (although the film's, uhm, 'cinematic' portrayal of Nash has brought reading it to my interest - when I get around to it, I'll read it) so there might be more wrong with it. What I do know, is that a lot of Nash's unpleasant sides have been left out of the film. We get the paranoid schizophrenia but his personal relationships (apparantly, Nash divorced his wife, only to remarry her forty years later) are sometimes skipped, as well as his bisexuality (this could have been about a bisexual genuis schizophrenic? - I would have been SO there). The point is, although the filmmakers, for some (cowardly?) reason leave out his bisexuality but do decide to insert a car chase (of all things). A Beautiful Mind is a crossover movie somewhere halfway a thriller and halfway a drama. Had they made it a mere drama by enriching the relationships in the film (the one between Nash and his wife is far too one-dimensional) I might have bought it. Had they made it a full-blown conspiracy/ schizophrenia thriller, I might have bought it. I don't buy the mixture perse. The thriller elements seem thrown in for audience entertainment alone and the human drama, under the decidly lightweight direction of Ron Howard, doesn't hit home hard enough. Plus, anyone (especially anyone who's seen one particular movie mentioned in this comment) will see the big twist coming and the movie drags toward the end. And one question continues to bug me today: did Nash, a brilliant man, really give that schmaltzy speech at the Nobel prize ceremony (if you know, please email me)?Russell Crowe's performance is one that's there to please the Oscar audience. He's a genuis schizophrenic and Crowe does almost everything a role like Nash's requires. Every little gesture is there, the accent is near-flawless and he even acts well while in heavy layers of make-up. It is a fairly self-conscious performance, on the other hand, aimed directly at nabbing the awards. Give Denzel the Oscar. No, the real deal is delivered by Jennifer Connely, possibly Hollywood's most underrated actress. Anyone having a role as cliched as hers and anyone having to deliver those horrible lines and inject some real human emotion into it, really does deserve an Oscar. Ed Harris is good, but has an even more thankless role. Paul Bettany is great fun and injects some much-needed spirit into a film about, frankly, a bloody rude man.The strange thing is, even though it's a straight and simple story about a brilliant man coming to terms with his environment and, far more importantly, himself, I didn't dislike it at all. I can break it down like any other Oscar-friendly far-too-feelgooder, but in the end I did care for the film's version of John Nash and his wife. I thought the scientific concepts were adequately handled (it's not trying to be a history lesson, and not a maths course either) and you can't go wrong with a cinematographer like Roger Deakins.All in all, the movie may be a mess of historical trivia on Nash's life and some narrative trickery more suited to a more surreal film, but it is entertaining. So, please, give the awards to some really good films and accept this film for what it is: average.Rating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Beautiful Motion Picture,"I was shocked not to see this film in the IMDb Top 250. This is arguably Ron Howard's finest work to date. Based on the true story of John Nash, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is an entertaining, enlightening and passionate drama which tackles the tribulations of a mathematical genius suffering from schizophrenia.Nash is played by Academy Award winner Russell Crowe (for his portrait of Maximus in ""Gladiator""). In my opinion, this is Crowe's finest performance up to date, in which he was nominated for the ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" Oscar but only being beaten by Denzel Washington's flawless work in ""Training Day"". (Actually, Sean Penn was even better in ""I Am Sam""). Jennifer Connelly also gives us an honest portrayal of the confused but devoted Alicia Nash, which earned her the Oscar for ""Best Actress in a Supporting Role"". The rest of the cast was superb.The amazing work by Howard, Akiva Goldsman and Brian Grazer enabled the movie to have an excellent screenplay and of course, a film is only as good as a screenplay would allow it to be.A true masterpiece. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

This is not a light movie it has a little bit of a heavy story that will make you think some.Ron Howard has done it again!

A Top Notch Film,"Ron Howard will finally get his due.  He has outdone himself - again.  He has put forth some very nice films, but this one tops them all.  I went into this film undecided about Russell Crowe.  I was not caught up in all the over the top praise that was handed out to him and the Gladiator film and the over praise for that outing caused me to wonder about his ability.  The combination of his performance in A Beautiful Mind together with his very nice showing in The Insider clearly display his credentials as one fine actor.  Whether this is the best movie of a, hopefully, high quality year of good films or it is the best movie coming out at the end of a particularly lousy year for Hollywood - it qualifies either way.  I wonder if we won't see Crowe miss out on an Academy Award for this one since he got the one he didn't deserve for Gladiator.  We really ought to see Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor Oscars and at least a nomination or two for Best Supporting Actor (both Harris and Bettany are very good in this film) out of this Beautiful Film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Good film, but over-hyped","Don't get me wrong - I thought that this was a well crafted and interesting film, which covered a difficult and sensitive subject extremely well.Nash's battle with his own mind was a fascinating tale, and the doctor I went to see it with said that he thought that all psychiatry students should see it as an introduction to the reality of Schitzophrenia for the patient.However, I was expecting something....more. THe acting was good, everything was good, but it didn't have that extra something to raise it into the realms of the great.I enjoyed this film, and would recommend it, but best film....

Disappointing,"This movie is really not very good.  Russell Crowe is not believable as a nerdy young Princeton student; very forced.  The one twist half way through the movie is interesting for about 30 seconds, then it drags on to a anti-climatic conclusion.

How can this not be the best movie of the year?,"Do not listen to others who say schizophrenia cannot go into remission, for John Nash, in real life it did just that.  The best movie of the year and one of the top movies of all time. Written beautifully, with acting that is truly outstanding, the movie is unsurpassed in giving viewers an insight into the horrific chasm one faces with this type mental illness. Russell Crowe accurately lives this character. Equalling or topping Dustin Hoffman's performance in ""The Rain Man"". (If you ever see any youthful pictures of Nash he even looks a lot like Crowe)This is a story of an affable but quirky young mathematician   destined to be one of the top two or three scientific minds of the twentieth century slowly losing reality to schizophrenic delusions. Crowe's portrayal of this character's struggle with the demons, and his emotional relationship with his young wife Alicia, played by Jennifer Connelly, will leave you on the edge of your seat. Director Ron Howard's suspenseful crafting of the torments and delusions plaguing Nash are both masterful and insightful.Go see the movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Ron Howard's Best Film Since Apollo 13,"A Beautiful Mind is directed by Ron Howard and star Russell Crowe as John Nash, a brilliant man that attended Princeton during the late 1940's and early 1950's. He is eventually recruited, in secret, by the government, to break codes involving an atomic bomb hidden somewhere in Europe. Soon after, things take a psychological twist, leaving John to wonder what's real, and what's not. Now, I can't talk about this movie too much in depth, because there's a plot twist about halfway through that I don't want to spoil, but I'll still review it.To start with some pros, this movie is amazingly directed, much like Ron Howard's other films. It also looks great, with an ever changing cinematography based on the decade the setting is currently in. The movie is mostly set in the 50's, but it also shows some time in the 40's, 70's, and 90's as well, and all these time periods are very distinguishable from one another, thanks to the cinematography and directing.Also, the acting is amazing. Russell Crowe as John Nash is a perfect casting choice. Crowe does great as a man in Nash's situation, and really fits in the role. Paul Bettany also does very good. Bettany plays Charles, John's college roommate that quickly becomes his lifelong friend. This character was a perfect comic relief for the dark tone of the film. Jennifer Connelly as Alicea, John's wife, is great too. All of the acting is really great, and holds this movie up.The last great thing I'll talk about is the score. James Horner makes yet another amazing score that pulls you inside of John's head every time it plays. It really helps the audience see through his eyes, and understand the way he feels about certain subjects.Now, the only negative I had with film is the plot progression. Some people can see this film as very boring for the first act, yet also unpredictable. I thought the movie was going to go one way, until it took a 360 about halfway through and really threw me off. I actually had to sit and process it a little before continuing on with the film. This a good thing, once the credits role, but for the first portion of the movie, and when the twist occurs, it makes you wondering whether or not the film should've played out this way.Overall, A Beautiful Mind is a great film, and a must see for most people. Ron Howard does amazing again, especially with Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, Jennifer Connelly, and James Horner working with him to create his best film since Apollo 13. A Beautiful Mind gets an A-, or a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"decent Hollywood drama, nothing more; typical Ron Howard fluff","somewhat disappointing; the movie never reached the strong emotional impact that I expected after all te praises it got. It's an often powerful movie, and the acting is strong, but it's really nothing to put in a top 100 like this site's users have. Maybe if you know nothing at all about the movie you'll like it, but you only need to know that he eventually wins a Nobel Prize to know exactly how it will end, ruining most of the suspense. Still, I enjoyed the scenes with Ed Harris, he's wonderfully creepy as the mysterious agent. I also liked the way the movie showed how the guy saw strange patterns everywhere, that was pretty interesting. Jennifer Connelly is not near as good in this film as the reviews make her out to be. Her performance is not that big a deal. Russell Crowe was mostly convincing but often overly mannered as Nash.

Excellent Hollywood-ized version of the man and his madness,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This resulted in four well-deserved Academy Awards in 2002: Best Picture for Brian Grazer and the people at Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard for his direction, Jennifer Connelly for her supporting role, and Akive Goldsman for his script adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography. It is a beautiful and touching movie, uplifting and full of a lot of things that Hollywood does very well.Russell Crowe is believable as the arrogant yet vulnerable mathematician John Nash who fell into paranoid schizophrenia while an undergraduate at Princeton University. A philandering and selfish man who is paradoxically almost as lovable as Albert Einstein, Nash can also be humble and exhibit a wry, self-effacing sense of humor. To me he is a great hero, not because of his work in Game Theory for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, but because he is one of the very few people ever to conquer, as it were, schizophrenia.In the outstanding documentary from The American Experience PBS series, ""A Brilliant Madness"" (2002) Nash explains how he did it: he just stopped listening to the voices. The voices that the paranoid schizophrenic hears are inside his head and they are amazingly persuasive; the delusions are as compelling as monstrous personages come to life, vivid, demanding, in many ways more ""real"" than the reality we normally experience. So it really was heroic of John Nash to come to grips with his delusions and to mentally shove them aside. The vast majority of paranoid schizophrenics can never do that.Yet the movie merely resembles his life and his singular experience. Goldsman's script and Howard's direction take the life of John Nash and distill the essence of his triumph while brushing aside many of the unpleasant and non-heroic details. I don't object to this because this movie is clearly aimed at the widest possible audience, and I appreciate the wisdom of that approach. But for those of you interested in a more comprehensive and objective picture of the man I can recommend both the documentary mentioned above and Nasar's biography. I especially found it valuable to view the one-hour documentary because to actually see the man and to hear him speak allowed me to better appreciate the fine performance by Russell Crowe.I found Jennifer Connelly absolutely mesmerizing as Alicia (not to mention gorgeous). Ed Harris was a hardcore graphic nightmare as the unrelenting Parcher while Paul Bettany was intriguing and clever as Nash's nonexistent buddy. Howard's direction not only got excellent work from everybody, but he was able to bring the pathos and exhilaration of Nash's life to the audience in a very satisfying way emotionally. If you can watch this without shedding a tear or two you may want to check your synaptic connections. Incidentally the makeup work on Crowe and Connelly to allow us the illusion of the passing years was outstanding (and got an Oscar nomination).The key to the movie and to Howard's vision is the way that the real world and the Nash's delusional world are meshed. It's clear he wanted to compel the audience to share the paranoid schizophrenic experience. While not a paranoid schizophrenic myself I have known people who are, and I have had similar, limited experiences myself under certain, shall we say, circumstances. The sheer terror that can sometimes be felt came through in the car chase scene (yes, Howard managed to get one in) while Nash's obsessive energy was revealed on the walls of the rooms that he had completely covered with pages from magazines that he had frantically searched looking for secret Soviet codes.Some quibbles: while undergraduates loved beer then as they do now, they did not in 1946 go out for pizza, and if they had they would have called it ""pizza pie."" There were no pizza parlors and no pizza at the market. If you went to an Italian restaurant you had spaghetti or ravioli, and the pizza that was served was mostly bread with a thin topping of cheese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today.New Zealander Russell Crowe's West Virginia accent faded in some scenes only to return strong in another. Incidentally he is not to be confused with Cameron Crowe, who wrote the script for Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and directed such films as Jerry Maguire (1996) and Almost Famous (2000). Russell Crowe has starred in a number of excellent movies including Proof (1991), LA Confidential (1997), The Insider (1999), etc.Also, no mention in the movie is made of Nash's homosexual experiences nor of his running away to Europe or his desire to renounce his US citizenship. I understand that Howard decided to leave out the homosexual angle because associating homosexuality with schizophrenia would open a can of worms that would detract from the theme of the movie. Also left out was Nash's other paternity with a woman he never married.Nash is not a saint, but he is a hero, and this beautiful movie is a fine tribute to him and to his accomplishments.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

John makes a few friends at the school. But John's problems are about to increase in his life big time. John graduates from Princeton and moves on to bigger things.A few years later( the mid-1950's) John is working for the Dept. of Defense at MIT. John is recruited by a strange man in black to decode stuff for the government. John meets a beatuful woman who understands him.After John and Alicia(jennifer Connelly) get married, John's life seems pretty normal.

The resilience with which he faced schizophrenia while publishing outstanding works time and again then going on to win the ultimate Nobel prize simply mesmerizes me.This movie apart from shahrukh khan inspired me to take Economics as a subject and I haven't regretted any moment after that.Instead of the mundaneness attached to mathematics by many he gives an artistic value to it simply admirable. I love the way he asks what are the other things people do in their lives while giving a questioning look to his friend a fellow mathematician.

Look at it from that point of view and not a ""Big Brother view of John Forbes Nash"" and you'll see it as a well crafted feature.I've seen all too many movies where mental illness is put in a very camp way and over exaggureated (Think: Girl, Interrupted) but the way John's Schizophrenia was portrayed in this movie was realistic and heartfelt.

Although Crowe did a good job overall, his West Virginia accent was very poor and at times he lapsed back into his native Kiwi accent.  Many times he attempted to cover his poor accent by mumbling his lines. Denzel Washington definitely deserved to win the Oscar over Crowe.

Russell Crow is indeed amazeing,"**********************SPOLIERS****************** I had to right this paper for school about Schizophrenia and since i love this site i decided to submit. The movie, A Beautiful Mind, deals with the difficulty of living with schizophrenia. John Nash is a schizophrenic who attends Princeton University and is able to solve math problems that baffle even the greatest minds. Right from the beginning we noticed that social interaction is extremely tough for John. When John has to make conversation with other people we realize some of the first symptoms with his disorganized speech and disorganized thoughts and behavior. Throughout the movie we continue to notice he has much difficulty talk with others except when with one person. When John is with his `roommate' Charles we notice that all trouble talking and thinking is eliminated. From there we might understand that Charles isn't real and just a figment of the imagination. Later on when schizophrenic images have driven John to the edge Dr. Rosen confronts him at a math speech John is giving. Dr. Rosen gives John shock therapy and we see John having convulsions while strapped down on a medical bed. Besides the shock therapy Rosen also gives John a heavy dose of medicine and asks Alicia Nash, John's wife, to watch out for him. Dr. Rosen also has to face the hardest part of telling John that people he thinks he knows are not real. John has a tough time getting a grip on reality and sometimes can't even turn to his wife. During a schizophrenic episode while attempting to knock away `William Parcher's gun' pointed to his wife but instead hits his wife. This and John's forgetfulness with his baby so how hard it can be to care for someone with schizophrenia. With these two episodes Alicia even has to move out until John can understand what is real and what is not. A moment occurs when John comes to grips with reality with himself and tells Alicia that he knows that the images are not real. He says that Becky never got any older the images are not real. From this point we know John we fight these illusions until he is `better.' During the movie we become attached to his illusions and just as it is for John it is tough for us to let them go. Near the end John tells us when he is asked if the illusions are still there, he says that they are never gone I just don't answer them. Unfortunately at this time that's all that could be done. In the end John has triumphed in the biggest way, he has put the images out of his mind and wins the Nobel Peace prize. He then gives an emotional speech crediting everything that he has done to his wife, and rightfully so. What makes this so much more realistic is that it is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Excellent movie,"One of my friends suggested me this movie. I wasn't aware of the plot beforehand. Neither I knew about the person on whom this movie was based. Which fortunately turned this to an even more intriguing for me. Maybe that is why my first recommendation would be do not research anything beforehand in order to avoid despoiling the surprises of this movie. These types of movies expect nil information about the plot on the viewers part. That is how they will successfully bind you.A beautiful mind is an American biographical drama film based on the life of John Nash, a Nobel Laureate in Economics. In this movie, John Nash was suffering from a disease schizophrenia. Now the question arrives, What the hell is Schizophrenia? Imagine if you suddenly learned that the people, the places, the moments most important to you were not gone, not dead, but worse, had never been. What kind of hell would that be? This movie is the answer. It shows, How John Nash proves that psychiatrists were wrong about schizophrenia being a brain disease like Alzheimers and Parkinson's. How he refuses to hospitalize himself and courageously decides to tackle with the imaginary people inside his mind. This is the plot on which this movie is based.According to me, what makes this movie different from others is it's extraordinary attention to the details. There is nothing mentioned in the movie which could come in conflict with your common reasoning. There are no violation of nature's law, no preternatural intelligence, no ostentatious scenes which could be refuted by my reasoning skills. For example, When Parcher implanted IC inside Nash's hand which he used while unlocking the doors (by scanning his hand on the scanner). In the next scenes where movie reveals Parcher was a fictional character because of Nash's disease. I was in between devils and the deep as my mind was continuously asking why the hell he was not checking his hand for the IC? That would be the biggest proof whether the characters are imaginary or real. Guess what? Within few moments I see Nash scratching his hand for the IC. which made both of us believe that he was suffering from the disease. Again, when Parcher meets Nash and tries to maintain his credibility of his real existence. He said the IC which was implanted vanished because it was made of Radium which decayed completely. I was enthralled by this scene and for the second time along with Nash, I believed Parcher is no more a fictional character.I think, the rationality of this movie is what makes it so great. While watching this movie, I placed myself at Nash's situation, and was trying to figure out how I would deal. Believe me, the things which I thought I would do to solve these conflict, the same solutions Nash used in the movie. The only thing which I think only Nash could do was the finesse with which he dealt with such characters.Furthermore, the way this movie tries to explain things with rationality which themselves are irrational is simply beyond one's approach. Quoting one scene from the movie.When John Nash Proposes Alicia.Nash: Alicia, does our relationship warrant long-term commitment? I need some kind of proof, some kind of verifiable, empirical data.Alicia: I'm sorry, just give me a moment to redefine my girlish notions of romance.Alicia: How big is the universe?Nash: Infinite.Alicia: How do you know?Nash: I know because all the data indicates it's infinite.Alicia: But it hasn't been proved yet.Nash: No.Alicia: You haven't seen it.Nash: No.Alicia: How do you know for sure?Nash: I don't, I just believe it.Alicia: It's the same with love I guess.There are still a lot more to say about this movie which I found highly admirable. Things which can only be observed and that's why you should watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"Brilliant filmmaking, superb acting","Ron Howard (Splash, Cocoon, Backdraft, Apollo 13) has done excellent work as a director for which he has gotten little credit over the years.  With this film comes a best director Oscar and a best picture Oscar and finally the recognition he deserves.  Howard has always been good at presenting human stories, be they comedy or drama.  He has a intuitive understanding of character motivation and is excellent at making his characters elicit strong emotions in the viewer.  This is particularly true in this film.The story is based on the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a mathematician and Nobel laureate who suffered from schizophrenia.  The film gives us a unique first person perspective of the disease, drawing us into his world and allowing us to see what Nash sees.  Howard's presentation is brilliant.  At first Nash is presented as a bit eccentric, but lucid.  As we experience his world, reality and illusion are so perfectly intertwined that we are not sure where the world ends and the mind begins.  By fooling the audience Howard makes the subtle point that to the schizophrenic it all seems real. In attempting to evaluate Nash's world we get a distant understanding of the confusion that results when a rational person attempts to cope with a world that is part real and part hallucination.While this is a biopic, it is more fiction than fact.  A great deal of dramatic license is taken since Nash freely admits that he has little recollection of the years when he suffered from the disease.  The powerful speech at the end of the film where he thanks his wife after receiving his Nobel Prize is pure Hollywood.  Included in the DVD is footage of the actual Nobel ceremony and no speeches were given.  Yet, we can forgive the latitude taken because the story is so inspirational.From a production standpoint, special note must be given to the makeup department, which ages Russell Crowe so magnificently.  As the movie progresses through four decades, Nash is realistically depicted and aged appropriately.  Likewise, the art department does a fine job rendering four different periods, matching costumes, props and sets to the times.Yet, with all the fine production values, this film excels most in the acting.  Russell Crowe turns in a career performance in a career abundant in great performances.  This character is the antithesis of the Russell Crowe we've come to expect.  Instead of strong, tough and balanced, with a sharp worldly intelligence, he plays an eccentric and convoluted man with quirks, nervous habits and a psyche obviously out of balance.  Crowe completely immerses himself in the enormous volume of the role, effortlessly moving between its elements from audacity to paranoia to tenderness to genius. This is an accomplishment that is light years beyond his Academy Award performance in `Gladiator', good as it was.Jennifer Connelly puts herself on the map with an Oscar for best supporting actress.  It is always difficult to avoid getting lost in the presence of an actor as powerful as Crowe, but Connelly stays right with him, delivering a moving performance as Nash's steadfast wife.Ed Harris was my favorite to nose out Crowe for best actor in last year's Academy Awards.  Harris gave a brilliant performance playing Jackson Pollock in `Pollock' (also featuring Jennifer Connelly in a small role) that was trampled under by the `Gladiator' Oscar juggernaut.  As if to say, `If you can't beat him, join him', Harris goes toe to toe with Crowe in some of the most intense scenes in the film.  Harris lends significant energy and intrigue to the movie with an urgent performance as the operative who recruits Nash to break codes for the government.This film is nothing short of fantastic.  It is expertly directed, superbly acted and meticulously crafted.  It presents great drama while also bringing insight into a stigmatizing disease to a wide audience.  I rated it a 10/10. It rightfully ran away with the Best Picture Oscar.  If you see only one motion picture this year, make sure it is this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
in awe of a performance,"Simply one of the best acting performances since De Niro in 'Awakenings' or Hoffman in 'Rainman'.  One of only a few 'actors' who could actually pull of a performance like that.  For the oscar to go to Denzil Washington and 'Training Day' was a crime.  Forget the problems in the media and there is no way that the oscar should not have went to Crowe.Well written, directed and produced but without the lead performance the film would fall.

The best film I've seen in quite a few years,"In these times of weak screenplays, below average direction, and sub-par acting it is refreshing to know some movies can still impress and inspire me. I have seen ""A Beautiful Mind"" twice already and was mind boggled by the power and quality of Russell Crowe's portrayal of the brilliant and troubled John Nash Jr. His performance ranks right up there with the other performers who portrayed troubled or disabled individuals, most notably Jack Nicholson in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man"", Robert De Niro in ""Awakenings"", Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"" and Al Pacino in ""Scent of a Woman"". Ron Howard's direction is superb, blending acting talents by not packing a lot of superstar punch into this film but by unleashing the power from his lead character and supporting figures. The movie is very-well made, extremely touching and very rewarding in the end. This is the best movie I have seen since ""Braveheart"" and I certainly hope it will grab awards for acting, directing, and best picture of the year.  9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

His performance was sensational.Generally, I'm not that fond of straight drama, being more attracted to action or fantasy/science fiction.  This movie was an exception.

Naaah...we've seen all this before.,"I didn't like Beautiful Mind and I think it's a terribly overrated film. Crowe's performance is the only things that saves it for me.Basically this movie is one more Hollywood cliche - with the character depiction and development, the generic ending, the BORING generic music in the exact moments as expected. Perfectly tailored for mass consumption. The peak of all predictability was prof. Nash's speech when he receives the Nobel Prize - ""love is the essence"" - what a boring and unimaginative thing to say at the peak of your life.

Good biography movie,"A Beautiful Mind is an impactful dramatic work that draws inspiration from a true story, brought to life on the silver screen. It narrates the life and inner journey of real mathematician John Nash. The film delves deep into the characters' inner worlds, drawing the audience into a captivating narrative.The movie explores the challenges faced by John Nash, a brilliant mathematician, as he copes with his mathematical genius and diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. Nash's inner world navigates the delicate balance between his mathematical brilliance and his mental disorder, revealing its complexity. Russell Crowe's performance skillfully reflects the character's internal struggles.In terms of storytelling, the film adopts an intriguing approach in conveying Nash's mental state, playing with the perception of reality and characters to immerse the audience into the character's psyche. This technique effectively allows us to delve deeper into Nash's intricate world.The challenges in John Nash's life and his relationships are key elements that keep the film engaging. His wife Alicia's (Jennifer Connelly) support and Nash's friendships play significant roles in his internal journey. These relationships offer insights into his reality and inner world.A Beautiful Mind presents a powerful narrative exploring the intricacies of the human mind and the interplay between reality and imagination. Focusing on characters' inner worlds, the film highlights both John Nash's mathematical prowess and his internal conflicts. Crowe and Connelly's performances perfectly convey the depth and emotional nuances of the characters. In conclusion, A Beautiful Mind stands as a masterpiece that reflects both the darker and brighter aspects of human nature.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
This is a great story - even if it is true,"I'll start by admitting that I don't like Russell Crowe.  Thought he was overrated in Gladiator and certainly not the best actor that year.  So who was playing Russell Crowe in this movie.  This performance shows a true acting talent, not the usual Russell Crowe character looking like every other character.And it's a (mostly) true story.  Despite other comments I've read about this movie, I find ""based on a true story"" usually means ""expect mediocrity."" But not this movie.  The characters were believable, the story was fairly well paced, just a little slow at a couple of points.Paul Bettany has put together two very entertaining character in succession, Charles Herman here, and Geoffrey Chaucer in A Knight's Tale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Lives up to the hype,"Life is a long, subtle and complex entity riddled with ambiguity and questions, without neat little dividers or convenient scenes. In short it is often a frustrating and confusing experience, which is one of the reasons why motion pictures have become as successful and as ubiquitous as they have, because they offer an escape from the problematic nature of our circumstances and allow us to dream for a few hours.If you wish to see a balanced and intelligent portrayal of either the life of nobel prize winner John Nash or the effects of Schizophrenia then A Beautiful Mind should be well down your list, if even on it at all. However if you want 2 hours of well produced and well acted drama, and have it in you to forgive a few oversights then Ron Howard's multi Oscar winner succeeds.The film follows the life of John Nash from his obsessive and turbulent time at Princeton university where he writes a groundbreaking paper on an economics related subject, through to his study at Wheeler labs where he becomes embroiled in top secret government work as delusions start to take over his life.The strength of A Beautiful Mind is in how powerfully it evokes Nash's delusions, to the extent that you not only starting questioning exactly who around him is real, but wishing that some of his fantasies really were real, and as such, if you let it, the film draws you into the characters tortured world, where he is torn between impossible decisions because of his confused judgements.The performances are all excellent and aided by the scripts wise decision to restrict tearful emotive speeches to a minimum instead of soliloquising the audience into submission. The supporting roles from Ed Harris and Paul Bethany are crucial and well delivered. Even Russell Crowe's Forrest Gump accent is forgivable due to the general restraint shown in a part that most people would have showboated throughout in. Whilst it still pales next to his remarkable performance in The Insider, this confirms that Russell Crowe's ability remains undiminished by the corrupting effects of Hollywood stardom.Where the superficially similar Iris struggled to impress with an intricate flashback structure and dreamy abstract visuals Ron Howard keeps things relative basic, with only some fairy dust special effects trying to add a little too much saccharine to the tale (whenever Nash cracks a code it seems as if Tinkerbell is pointing the way for him with the amount of sparkles on the screen). The result of this is that whilst A Beautiful Mind may function only on a simple and restricted level, with little for the intellect or artistic eye to feast upon, it succeeds as potent storytelling where the performances and direction do their best not to obstruct or inhibit the fingers of the film plucking at heartstrings, which is what has made American cinema the most popular in the world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Crowe's Nash role slays Maximus,"I found Russell Crowe's acting in this film to be superb. I think he did a more than adequate job as Maximus in Gladiator, but his work in Beautiful Mind is much more worthy of an Oscar win for Best Actor.I know there are some hardcore critics that are upset with Ron Howard taking ""liberties"" with John Nash's real story. However, it did not take away from this being an OUTSTANDING film.Howard did a stellar job in making Nash's paranoid-schizophrenic characters seem real. The chase scene and his paranoid trip to his backyard hideout were especially well done.In the end, this film was much like Nash's theory which eventually won him the Nobel Prize- brilliant in parts, but not perfect. However, in the end the process of the theory and the process of the movie come together in the end to create a spectacle of a film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Enough is enough.,"I don't really dislike this movie, but giving it Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay!!! Come on, Academy, snap out of it: let's try giving the award to something that really deserves it and not something that is merely worthy.Although A Beautiful Mind is well made (Roger Deakins' cinematography in particular being a standout), it is not in the same class as fellow nominees In The Bedroom, Lord of the Rings, Gosford Park and Moulin Rouge. All of these other movies take enormous risks, inflame passions and debate, and look like labours of love. Ron Howard's movie, regardless of the makers' intentions, comes over as a well intentioned but flatly earnest big budget made for TV issues movie. At it's worst, the movie is more about emotional manipulation than it is about producer Brian Grazer's aim of opening a window on understanding mental illness.Russell Crowe has done much better work than on show here (and, deservedly, lost out to Denzel Washington for Best Actor); and Ron Howard himself has produced better movies like Ransom and Apollo 13; even his underrated The Paper is much better than this. That Howard at his least effective has beaten directors like Altman, Jackson, and Scott at their peak does not reflect well on the Academy's judgement.When all is said and done, however, what does it actually mean? The history of the Oscars is littered with movies which lost out but are more memorable than the winners: Raging Bull, Jaws, It's A Wonderful Life, Psycho (hell, Hitchcock never ever won an Oscar - what does that tell us?), The Searchers, etc, etc, so it will not surprise me when, in a few years, this movie has been largely forgotten or reevaluated for it's true worth (a la English Patient) while Rings, Rouge, Bedroom and Park will stand unblemished as the true master classes in making stimulating cinema that they really are.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Ignoble portrait of a Nobel laureate,"The scene in ""A Beautiful Mind"" that haunts me  most is not the shock therapy delivered to mathematician John Nash, not his infant son left to drown in the bathtub, not the implantation of a radioactive ID number in Nash's arm. None of these. What I keep wondering about is how Alicia, a young math student at Princeton in the1950s, had the savvy to wear a strapless black evening dress on her very first date, which turns out to be a black-tie Princeton do.If there were an Oscar for most valiant performance under hostile conditions, then Jennifer Connelly, who plays Alicia -- and who, incidentally, looks great in the strapless black -- would surely win.  Ms. Connelly bares up under awkward editing and awful dialog, as when she, now Mrs. Nash, tells him and us that love and faith will cure him of his schizophrenia.  In the New Testament, perhaps; in Hollywood, by all means. All that's missing is a new-age crystal.Dodging a story about ordinary humans, director Ron Howard has chosen to chronicle genius, but the product is the same old inflated confection: a romantic night sky in New Jersey that holds  more stars than any Arizona desert; a ghastly Nobel prize award ceremony; and worst of all, the progress to that prize based on one academic paper, scribbling math formulas on window panes, and a lot of frenzied magazine clipping. The pudding is bloated and sweetened by yet another ""uplifting"", swollen music track. So predictable and so unbelievable.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

8.3/10 - A Well Done Film with Unique Characters,"Damn, Russell Crowe killed it! What a fantastic performance. I also like the fact that Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany have met here for the first time, during the filming of this movie. Quite cool.Anyway, let's talk about the film a little bit. It's based on the true story (well, based on a biographic book about the true story) of John Nash, a socially-challenged Mathematician who's struggling with schizophrenia. We're shown how it affects his love life, his job, and generally how it made him such an interesting figure.First, I'll get this out of the way: this film doesn't have any big problem, actually. Maybe it feels just a *little* bit too long, but I don't think that it impacts the watching experience that much.So now, I'll tell you why this movie is so decent, people. I think that the actingof every actor is at least good ,and Russelle's acting is pretty much fantastic here. He captures Nash in such a unique, emotional way. I also like Connelly and Bettany here, they're both great. The film, mostly in its first half, has this charm about it, and I really think that it does a great job in getting the viewer emotionally invested. The cinematography is quite creative at times, especially when it's related to the schizophrenia, but nothing that blew me away. It was enjoyable, tho, and I liked it a lot. The relationships between the characters, the actors and the characters themselves are what makes this film truly good and special.So, to sum it up, it's a good, well done film with great acting and unique, lovable characters. Nothing that blew me away, but yet undeniably good. I'm feeling an 8.3 on this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Something extraordinary,"Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"" is an extraordinary movie with a powerful performance from Russell Crowe as John Forbes Nash. John Nash is the Princeton mathematician who wrote the founding paper on game theory, and has battled schizophrenia almost his entire adult life. In Crowe's acceptance speech at the Golden Globes, he said that ""...Hopefully, we made a movie that made you believe that something extraordinary is possible."" Director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, and a talented cast have done so.Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman created a story about humanity, and a touching love story. Goldsman streamlined some of the events of Silvia Nasar's book, and maintained coherence. Howard does not compromise on the perception of the young John Nash, who was a genius, and also an arrogant loner-- not good with people. At the same time we have compassion for Nash's plight given an enlightened view of schizophrenia. The scene in which we discover Nash's condition is purely masterful on Howard's part. Nash's journey is amazing.Russell Crowe is simply awesome. He can convey what is in Nash's mind with either a look or in dialog. Crowe has such a range of intensity, and is always believable. Crowe's Nash ages 50 years over the course of the movie. At the core of the movie is a great love story. Jennifer Connelly is a revelation as Alicia Nash, John's wife. Connelly as Alicia says that John ""transforms into the man that she loves."" Connelly's Alicia has such a capacity for courage and doing what is right. She loves John. She stands by him and raises their family. Her Alicia suffers and remains strong. There are also great supporting performances from Christopher Plummer as Nash's psychiatrist, and from Ed Harris and Paul Bettany.John Nash won the Nobel Prize in 1994 and continues to teach at Princeton. He still accepts and deals with schizophrenia. This is very touching and truly a triumph of the human spirit. Ron Howard and Russell Crowe have created something extraordinary. They move, touch, and inspire us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A well crafted fiction,"It has to be said that this would have been okay if it wasn't a patronizing fiction about schizophrenia. Sadly, Ron Howard has made a film which is a complete bastardization of the real story of John Nash.Let's forget that Nash's form of the mental illness was merely misinterpreting radio messages, as opposed to having 'imaginary' car chases from secret agents. Forget that he actually was quite good with women, having numerous relationships with them, as well as men. Let's even forget that the man was actually divorced from his wife, whilst also being a brilliant scientist with numerous accomplishments, and you might enjoy this film. Of course, that would take away the whole point of it being a 'true story'. Just remember that you are watching make-believe.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Beautiful Mind offers a unique way to recognize the luck and misfortune of genius.,"In a sense, Nash is lucky, whether it is according to worldly standards or according to Nash's own standards-great career achievements, beautiful affectionate wife, handsome and promising at Harvard Son.

This misfortune does not come from physical poverty, nor from the human affairs that geniuses suffer most often, but from the deep loneliness deep in his soul.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Go in blind, don't even look up John Nash online if you haven't already done so","The reason why I got interested to view this movie was, that it won a bunch of academy awards in 2002 over LOTR the Fellowship of the Ring. I have seen no trailers, have read no plot synopsis, I barely even knew who stared in it and I think that for the greatest impact that is the correct way to view the movie. Don't even read anything about the real life John Nash, it'll just spoil things. As such, I will not go over the plot in any detail. All I will say is that if you watched about the first third of the movie and are a bit confused as to what's actually going on, where is this heading, and what is the point... just hang in there. It'll become very clear eventually.The technical aspects of the movie are all very well done. The acting, and direction are very good as you'd expect though I don't understand how a movie receives best picture and best direction without the lead receiving an award for acting. I think Russell Crowe did a very good job such that you can emphasize with his situation to the point that the movie might jerk a tear or two during its' runtime.Do I think it is better than the Fellowship of the Ring in any of the categories where it won though?

The film also inspired me to read the book which I enjoyed very much, even tho the technical language was above my understanding.  I am at a loss to understand all the criticism regarding the movie not following the book very closely - after all it's a MOVIE, folks. The book did not entertain me, it gave me an in-depth look at Mr. Nash's life.  The movie allowed me to enter the heart and mind of Mr. Nash and the people who surrounded him at the given times the director chose to explore. Possibly the only scene not necessary was the car chase - yet, the fear portrayed by Mr. Crowe redeemed even that particular moment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"From Book to Screen, Drastically Different","After seeing this film multiple times, it took me years to buckle down and read the book. It was is I was reading a different story. The film ""A Beautiful Mind"" starring Russel Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris was a gripping real life story of Nobel Prize awarded mathematician John Nash and his out of the box way of solving problems and learning the greatest lesson of life. Director Ron Howard did an excellent job of selecting the right team to bring the story from book to screen in a way that would keep viewers inspired, intrigued and with the ending wanting to learn more about the real life of John Nash. Watching this film one time is not enough as there are many scenes and sequences packed with the building blocks that tell viewers how John Nash played by Russell Crowe how he went from an being normal to discovering his unique abilities. What's also inspiring John Nash's wife Alicia played by Jennifer Connelly and her undying dedication and loyalty through John's severe struggle of separating the real world from fantasy. William Parcher played by Ed Harris is a fooler in this film as we think he's one thing, but turns out to be another. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of those films that you will never get bored of watching as it's not only inspiring, but you may catch a detail that you didn't pick up the last time around. As mentioned before, watching the film and referencing the book was shocking as so many details were left out that it seemed I was reading a different story and John Nash was more complex than the movie portrayed, in which the film character was a very complicated person. What both the book and the film did accomplish in sync was telling a story of a genius who wanted to discover the complex answers and found the simple solution.

It´s a realistic psychologic movie about a man who´s suffering from schizofrenia. There are a couple of thing that makes this movie great. First of all, the movie makes you understand a little bit how someone who has schizofrenia experience the world. Second, the two leading actors performance (Nash-Russel Crowe-and his wife) is really outstanding. By my opinion Crowe deserved a second Oscar for this performance. The third reason this movie is excellent is that the movie really does something with you; watching this movie certainly should be an emotional experience witch takes you in the life of John Nash, former Nobel price winner. Last, it´s a true story, which gave me an extra dimension to this movie. So, I can recommend this movie to anyone who´s kind of good movies, with a great script and excellent actor´s performances.

She does a good job, but her character degenerates into awfulness.

"""Imagine if you suddenly learned that the people, the places, the moments most important to you were not gone, not dead, but worse, had never been.""","So the first time I watched this was a few years ago after I absolutely adored The Imitation Game (2014) and was immediately looking for anything similar, and I found this to be the best match. I went in all hyped up and excited, following what I considered to be at the time my new favourite movie, but I ended up being really disappointed. Why? Well looking back on it in hindsight, it's purely because 13-year-old me was too young (and therefore stupid) to comprehend what was going on, and then proceeded to get mad when he realised he'd misinterpreted the concept of the movie. But unexpectedly, yesterday (at the time of writing), this was shown to us for our psychology class, so that was the day that I finally gave this film another chance, a proper one this time now that I'm not as much of an idiot as I was before. Even if I ended up not liking it, at the very least I knew it would be a nice change from the Saw marathon I've been doing recently!And straight away, one thing I didn't remember from last time was the fact that it pretty much opens in medias res, which usually I complain about since it means we get zero character building, which can typically lead to us feeling an extreme lack of care for the protagonist, but here it works amazingly as John Nash is so likable right from the very start that we instantly feel a connection with him (plus it helps that the guy playing him is the remarkable Russell Crowe).And speaking of the main man, Russell Crowe was astounding. I am immensely shocked that he did not win Best Actor at the Academy Awards. I may not have seen Training Day (2001) yet but I cannot fathom Crowe's performance truly being topped by Denzel Washington's portrayal of a narcotics detective, even by a legend such as himself. He flawlessly becomes more and more mentally & emotionally broken in an unfaltering illustration of what suffering from this illness is like. Additionally, Jennifer Connelly was also a complete showstopper, as there are certain moments towards the middle and end of the picture where she is just staggering, & utterly captivating. And although it didn't cross my mind because I was so awe-struck by Crowe, she was fully deserving of her Oscar.As for the story as a whole, it's fairly tremendous. It's not just as simple as a disadvantaged guy succeeding at university whilst climbing over several hurdles along the way (which is actually what I thought this was going to be about since it's been such a long time since I watched this that I forgot what even happened) as that is merely the first act alone rather than the whole movie. This definitely can be a slow burner though, and you really notice that in act 2, as that's where the film feels incredibly aimless until you find out the big twist. As a result, this is where it really drags.(This next paragraph includes somewhat minor spoilers, so skip ahead if you wish.) According to my psychology teacher, for a Hollywood depiction of schizophrenia, this is a very accurate one, so I'll take his word for it. Only thing is in reality, instead of visions, it's actually voices, but I understand the filmmakers' reasons for not choosing voices since they wouldn't at all have been as impactful to the audience, as the use of visions allowed us to truly feel what it's like from the perspective of the sufferer, otherwise we would've known right from the off what John was suffering from, and at that point we would've had an outsider's point of view instead. This feature can only be as fantastic as it is if we are able to feel what the main character feels. And the execution of that here is perfect.Now technically this is a biopic, but I have a major negative here which is that this movie paints John Nash in way too good of a light. It's funny how it goes on so much about love, to the point where it essentially becomes the main plot rather than a subplot, because believe it or not, John actually had a 5-year affair with the nurse that took care of him, and even had a son with her, and this led to a divorce between John and Alicia before some years later in 1970 when she took him in to her home, only this time purely as a lodger, before eventually remarrying in 2001 (presumably after production had finished, so it baffles me as to why they made it out as if they lived happily ever after by the end of things). Also, Alicia wasn't the iron-willed, resolute wife who always stood by his side as the film portrayed her to be, as part of her reasoning for divorcing him was because she simply couldn't take it anymore. Taking care of John, it was all getting too much for her. And I totally get that, that's not the issue. The issue is that the film paints a wildly different picture to what truly happened, to the point where I would consider this to be *very loosely* based on a true story, as there's a lot more fiction than fact.I was sat behind a classmate who, for the first two acts (mainly the first), was going on non-stop about how tragically abysmal the cinematography was, to the point where he even complained when the camera was off-centre! Personally, I do agree to a small extent that the editing & cinematography were rather weird, especially in that earlier stage of the picture. Those scenes where he's spellbound by an attractive girl & imagining all his friends disappearing into puffs of smoke and visualising numbers on a screen coming out and lighting up were unbelievably daft I have to say. But while it was a downfall, it wasn't something that wholly irritated me like it did the guy in front.Towards the end of the movie, my friend turned round to me and said, ""this sounds like Titanic music"". Well, now that I've seen that it was James Horner behind the composition, it doesn't surprise me how similar this score was to his other work. However I have to say, I wasn't the biggest fan of this soundtrack, as it sounded like they just kept repeating one song for the last hour or so of the movie. Whether or not it was just one song I don't know but either way, I do feel there was a severe lack of variety within the music itself. It got boring fast, and honestly a bit annoying. Judging by the Oscar nomination though, it looks like I'm in the minority on that.Finally, I want to end on a small positive, which was the phenomenal makeup, which faultlessly showed the gradually aging look of the likes of John, Alicia, etc., over the years. Unlike other films I've seen where that aged appearance looks quite fake & unrealistic, here, it appears to look so natural. It's genuinely an extraordinary job well done by the make-up team.To conclude, the primary reason I'm giving this an 8 is due to its dire inability to stick to the facts, but also I do believe my feeling towards this movie is still influenced by my first impressions those few years ago. As I was watching this yesterday, I was thinking to myself, ""even though I can't see any big drawbacks at the minute, for some reason something is compelling me not to give this a 10/10"", and I'm not sure what that something was other than my initial disapproval of this film playing in the back of my mind throughout. Unlike my first viewing, where I had high hopes for this to be a masterpiece, here in my second viewing, I had low expectations. But all in all, it's still a special movie nonetheless, and one that I would highly recommend to those of you who love biographical films, especially ones that heavily involve the theme of ingenuity. But avoid watching this when you're too young. I'd say if you're at least 15 you surely won't be dumb enough to perceive the film like how I did first time round.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

But, as luck would have it, it was on Canadian TV the other night... unedited (broadcast TV in Canada is soooooo cool)... and I figured maybe it was time.  Well, the movie started to lose me at first... it started out a little too predictable and then took a few implausible turns. Just as I was about to give up on it... some major plot developments had me looking at the movie with new eyes.  By the midway point, the movie had me hooked.  Not a perfect movie though... Crowe's performance does seem a little too ""act-y"" at times... and Jennifer Connelly is... well, she does the same thing she does in all her movies... some people seem to like it... me, not so much.

"A Beautiful Mind, a beautiful film","I love this movie--it's difficult to come up with the right words, but it is almost perfect.  Russell Crowe's performance is brilliant, as usual, giving us insights into a character that I believe no other actor today is capable of. It will be a crime if he does not receive an Oscar for this role just because he won one last year.  Ron Howard has crafted a film of such emotion and power, it will also be criminal if he does not receive the recognition he deserves at Oscar time.  Jennifer Connelly is fantastic, as are the other supporting characters.  My only complaint about the movie is the choice of Charlotte Church for the vocals on the soundtrack; I'm not sure what it is, maybe her voice is just too ""instrument-like,"" but I was very disappointed in her performance of the love theme, ""All Love Can Be.""  Her voice blends into the music to such an extent that I can't hear or remember all the words, even though I have seen the movie more than once and have listened to the soundtrack several times.

Jennifer Conelly's performance was beautiful and seemed a bit awkward to me (me being someone who is mostly on reserved mode).

Speechless!,"""A beautiful mind"" couldn't been better film then it already is, I can't say nothing bad about the movie. In short, the movie is about dealing with mental illness with emotion. The Plot of the movie is very interesting, touching. Great as a Biographic film, Great as a Thriler film, and also as a Romance film. A beautiful mind is very different than most of the films in the genre- psychological thriller (for example - ""The silence of the lambs"" , ""Black Swan"") mainly because of the use of emotional to solve the mental problem and find a solution for the illness. The Direction in the movie is extremely professional, Ron Howard definitely made his best work in the film, he pays attention to the small details. The screenplay is even better than the direction, clever and very original. The Acting in the movie is absolutely great!

Obviously it was intended, but I felt that tricking the viewer into a spy/mystery flick and then pulling us into a mental disorder flick was disruptive. I also would have prefered the biography to be more accurate near the begining of the film. His character was a bit less likeable that the film portrays.

"Astonishing story, well acted","No-one would dare write a novel as far-fetched as John Nash jnr's life. A prodigy, a mathematical genius, a paranoid schizophrenic, a Nobel laureate. With raw material like this, ""A Beautiful Mind"" was always a short-priced favourite to be a good film. Well, it is, but I don't think the Academy was right to call it the best film of 2001.Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly deliver exceptional performances. I'm again frankly mystified why the Academy firstly nominated Connelly as a supporting actress when she gets enough screen time to be rightly regarded as a co-star. And as for Crowe not winning Best Actor, well... People who view this film superficially could write Crowe's performance off, dismissing it as thespian sleight-of-hand, a bit of hunching, stillness, some drool and hey, presto, paranoid schizophrenia. They would be wrong. There is so much depth to Crowe's portrayal. He plays Nash in the early years superbly as a self-acknowledged genius, arrogant but just a bit detached from normality, the accent just right. Then the years of Nash's illness, the terrifying delusions, the pain in his eyes during his insightful moments. This is incredible stuff, and Connelly is not overshadowed, she plays the role of Alicia masterfully.It is interesting how Nash's delusional episodes are portrayed as real in this film, which is reasonable, given that they were real enough to Nash at the time. To tidy the film up, a couple of elements of Nash's life are neatly excised - the mistress, the early divorce from Alicia and their subsequent remarriage. Nash's 30 long years imprisoned in his illness are skimmed over in the final reel, which to my mind unbalanced the film a bit. It seems rushed in the last few minutes, as if Ron Howard has noticed that the film is already quite long and he's cramming the last bits in.Finally, could it be that Ron Howard has constructed this film to draw parallels between Nash's life and that of post-war USA? Initial brilliance, unlimited potential and boundless optimism. Then a catastrophic fall into paranoid fantasy, stagnation, impotence and paralysis (for the USA, the Cold War years, culminating in Vietnam). Then a rebirth and recovery, slipping into comfortable autumn years with an acceptance of self, but at the same time an acknowledgment of the troubled past.

Only after the first hour, I was amazed how Akiva Goldsman (and it IS the screenwriter who deserves credit as much as Ron Howard)told this story with such clever execution! (And he's no mathematician, either!) NOW THAT IS STORYTELLING!But it was also the resilience of Jennifer Connelly's character that also gave me a sense of hope that there are still compassionate people in this world who still love others despite their flaws.

Stunning performances that avoid the worst kind of schmaltz,"Yes this is high Oscar-fodder: it's the kind of material that makes the awards judges go weak (and look, nominations galore and wins for all concerned... except of course, in the final analysis one fears, for Ron Howard - like Michael Mann, the system rarely forgives popular TV origins).And let me say first off that it would be foolish to deny that a goodly portion of the audience for this are going because they long to see something to erase the critical disaster that was ""Proof of Life"" from their memories (because, facing facts, this would make a great movie anyway, but Russell Crowe is what will have drawn most of its audience).  And, thank god, it succeeds in that.  In POL we had that body in a black vest struggling to act in an incredibly formulaic action drama.  Here, RC is back to what he does best - ACTING - and we get a white t-shirt... well, I'll definitely settle for that.I dreaded that this would be a real schmaltz-fest: don't get me wrong, I liked ""Apollo 13"" and I'll cry at almost anything, but I was rather wary of how much ABM would be wringing my tear-ducts.  In the end it's an incredibly tempered depiction of mental illness and what directoral/camera trickery is done is subtle and nuanced - in keeping with the performances.  Knowing as much as I do about mental health issues and the experiences attached to them, I felt moved - but not in an obvious way - by the way this was dealt with.  Jennifer Connelly (as Alicia) does a magnificent job in portraying the quiet, and then raging, frustration and love felt by a partner in such circumstances.It seems unfair to pick out individuals from the cast for comment - above and beyond Crowe's touching performance which truly inhabits the character of John Nash - since each makes such a great contribution to the overall storyline.  However, Harris and Bettany especially could have found themselves caught in the worst kind of roles, yet they lend the film immense solidity and depth.Given the storyline there is not much that is radical or previously unseen, but what is done is done very well and avoids the worst excesses associated with this kind of film.  And it is not exactly about 'overcoming' schizophrenia (which implies 'cure') but rather 'dealing with' it.Ultimately though it was a pleasure to see such a return to form for an actor who deserved better than dross like ""Mystery, Alaska"" and ""Proof of Life"" (note these both followed great critical/popular acclaim pieces like ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Gladiator"") as ludicrously entertaining as these may have been in their own right if Crowe had not demonstrated such immense talent elsewhere.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

A Beautiful Movie,"Amazing, beautiful, touching, interesting.These words can be used to describe A Beautiful Mind.

As the master of rich, dark, beautiful, music, they could not have picked a better composer to score the film.The thing that I was most impressed with in this film was Crowe's performance as John Nash. Although he did not act exactly like John Nash, he certainly didn't act like his typical tough-but-sensitive character. His acting was brilliant.I was not sure exactly who Jennifer Connelly was, but after a little research I found out that she was the start in the old Lucio Fulci horror masterpiece Phenomena (a.k.a Creepers) and I had such a crush on her when I was around 12 or so. Her performance was stellar as well, but somewhat lack-luster next to Crowe's. I have seen I think all of Ed Harris' movies and though I think he is pretty good at acting, I can't see what all of the fuss is about. Did anyone see The Stand?

It has cost me my job, home, wife, friends, etc. Little did I know 90% of marriages end in divorce with one partner that is bipolar. I'd wake up every morning with terrible stomach problems not even realizing it was anxiety. I guess as a man you just suck it up, but it caught up with me as work became more demanding. Thankfully with the help of medication it is managed somewhat although it makes me lethargic, tired, have memory/concentration issues, and not be as coordinated.Thing is, it is also a gift. Without sounding like a prideful person I am very intelligent. Certain things just come easy to me. Definitely not mathematics, like the movie, but in using logic, reason, and discernment.

Ron Howard Movies Are Sooooooo Uninteresting,"Maudlin, paint-by-numbers biopic about math whiz John Nash that makes mental illness and marital strife look as pretty as a magazine cover.Russell Crowe does give a good performance, I'll give the film that, but I wonder how much better a performance he could have given if under the guidance of a more interesting director than Ron Howard. Every Howard movie I see makes me feel like -- no matter what the subject matter -- he's determined to create a movie that would be o.k. for eight-year-old kiddies to watch. Works fine when you're dealing with mermaids and firemen, but not so much when dealing with material like this.Jennifer Connelley proved that Joan Allen no longer necessarily cornered the market on mopey suffering wife roles, which turned out to be a good thing for us, because Allen was then free to play a hot CIA agent in the Bourne movies.Grade: C",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
slow and simple but a heart touching character.,"I was moved by RUSSEL CROWE'S acting,when i first watched this movie.i'm a great admirer of his acting,which shows his class,and seems a genuine character in movies like this.I like his movies with less actions,where the pivot of the movie is a character.That's why i love his movies like 'the insider' and 'L.A confidential' more than 'the gladiator. Now,i come to explain his character in this movie.A mathematician genius,who is surrounded by some jealous mates,who always try to humiliate him,but he never loses his temper except once or twice.He keeps on working with a great composure and proves his mettle.

Why this movie is for everyone,"This movie was absolutely phenomenal!I went into the movie thinking it was going to be all about John Nash's math ability. I was totally wrong. This movie is about life, love and overcoming obstacles that seem insurmountable.At its best this movie was funny, sad, touching, heart-wrenching, inspiring and beautiful. It will evoke every emotion possible out of you and leave you feeling drained...and you will love every second of it. It is skillfully written and there is never a dull moment. At times you are on the edge of your seat saying ""Oh, God, no..."" (I really heard that in the theater), and at many other times you run out of sleeve to cry on.At its worst the movie is a little confusing during a short time...but that is almost what makes it so great. It's confusing, and that's why you can relate to the characters so well...because they are confused, too. And, you will definitely want to see it again. Sort of a ""Memento"" want to see it again feeling :)Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Beautiful Film,"Though this movie looked pretty good in the previews, I wasn't entirely anxious to see it until Oscar time was approaching.  Until then, I felt ""In the Bedroom"" deserved the Best Picture Oscar, Tom Wilkinson for Best Actor and Marisa Tomei for Best Supporting Actress.  I just had the impression that ""A Beautiful Mind"" would be one of those overblown melodramas that suck up to the Academy.  Well, after finally watching this film, my opinions were altered completely.  I'm sure if Russell Crowe didn't start any emotional outbursts, he would've certainly won for Best Actor.  I love Denzel Washington, and he was great in ""Training Day,"" but he played a ruthless villain and his role didn't have many dimensions.  As Richard Roeper said, Denzel had the opportunity to ham it up a little.  But I guess the Academy wanted to be PC this year and have two African-American actors--him and Halle Berry--step up to the podium.  But I'm still grateful that the movie won Best Picture and Ron Howard (finally!) won Best Director.Crowe not only had to fake an American accent, but also fake a West Virginian accent--one that I imagine even an American actor would have difficulty with.  He is incredible as the schizophrenic John Nash, who you feel a deeper sympathy for as the film moves along.  Lots of actors have played mentally challenged characters, but schitzophrenia is a disorder with many dimensions and Crowe was entirely believable.  I'm sure he did tons of research for the role, and it shows.  Jennifer Connelly is a charming, slightly underrated actress who many are unfamiliar with simply because she's starred in mainly independent works.  She is not only beautiful to watch, but gives the best performance of her career, and her Oscar is well-deserved.The film is long, but never overlong.  I was so fully engaged, journeying through the brilliant but troubled mind of John Nash, that time ceased to exist.  And of course, anytime a brilliant film like this is released, there's always going to be a cult interested in reducing the hype by pointing out minor flaws in the story.  According to these people, the film failed to include certain elements of Nash's life, making it not entirely accurate.  This a movie!  Not a documentary!  Have you ever seen a biopic that was ENTIRELY accurate?  I don't know much about Nash's life.  All I know is his life inspired a wonderful motion picture.  Hell, I can point out certain flaws myself.  The speech Nash gives at the end was obviously doctored for dramatic purposes and I'm pretty sure the librarians at Nash's college would've kicked him out the library for marking up their windows. But this is such an amazing, touching film that I really don't care, and I'm sure most audiences will feel the same way.My score:  9 (out of 10)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Russel was something else!,"This is the classic work upon which modern-day game theory is based. What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John won Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory-- has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the New York Times, the American Economic Review, and a variety of other publications.

ALREADY SEEN H'WOOD FLICK...,"...surprisingly, with some great acting (superb Jennifer Connelly and Russel Crowe).So, do we have a classic here?No. Sorry, Ron, you've should done better here. Needless to say, that I got nearly bored in first half an hour, but what I resent this movie the most, is the fact, that this is just another Hollywood ""love-can-conquer-all"" type of movie, what reminds me of a poor Pearl Harbor.The movie should provide more, especially for the more demanding viewers, than just a simple love story. I had the feeling that the director just haven't enough courage, to show us the real John Nash. Like Oliver Stone did in magnificent J.F.K.But, all in all, there are some bright things, which brings this movie above others (especially in this era, when H'wood is in crisis).

Unbalanced,"This film had the potential to be one of the all-time greats.  The way the story drags the viewer along into the confused perspective of the main character is engaging and effective.  However, with such poor dialogue, such forced acting, and such unbelievable characters, the end result is a film that is incapable of drawing-in much of its audience.The dialogue was trite, unnatural, and forced, and the characters were developed in such a way that as a viewer, I felt I had seen each of them before in countless school-boy films.  From the first second you were introduced to these characters, you knew what they represented.  It is incomprehensible how a writer could develop such a multi-dimensional plot, but fill the story with such simple, stagnant characters.Crowe's Nash came across much like all of Crowe's characters: aloof, unfeeling, and detached.  Once again, I found it difficult to empathize with him.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Did John Nash make that speech at the Nobel Prize award ceremony?,"To answer to the question John Nash did not give the speech at the Nobel Prize ceremony that is in the film A BEAUTIFUL MIND; the only Nobel Prize winner that gives a speech is the Peace Prize winner (or the Literature winner -- there's only one that is allowed to speak, and I can't remember which -- I'm not losing my mind, just my memory). Nash gave no speech at all; he held a press conference. The speech is a fabrication of the screenwriter.Nash won the Nobel MEMORIAL Prize in Economics, which is not a true Nobel Prize, by the way. It is not funded by the Nobel will (which is the reason the guy vetting Nash for the prize explains that money has to be raised for it). I read the book when it first came out and barely remember it (though I remember it being a good read -- that darn memory again), but I believe it had covered the extensive politicking behind the prize which was fascinating in itself.I thought the film was horrible. One leaves the theater not knowing anything about John Nash (the real John Nash), mental illness, or life itself. Love did not cure John Nash -- the best explanation for the spontaneous remission of his schizophrenia is hormonal changes that began when he reached his 50s. Love does not cure schizophrenia, folks, outside of a Hollywood suds fest.What is so egregious about leaving out Nash's bisexuality is that the ""Red Scare"" and purges in the U.S. in the late 1940s/1950s targeted homosexuals as security risks. (This explains why Nash in real life was fired from the Rand Corp. -- the ""think tank"" so intertwined with the Vietnam War -- after allegedly making a pass at another man.) Homosexuals were considered ""mentally ill"" officially by the American Psychiatric Assn. until the early 1970s. They were, and continue to be considered, security risks by the military-industrial establishment.The film is nearly a constant lie from beginning to end.  One mourns for the great film that could have resulted from such material put in the hands of a great director with a taste for the duality/perversity of life as truly lived, say Atom Egoyan. Ron ""Opie"" Howard's direction is abysmal. This is a child actor morphed into big budget Hollywood director that has no point-of-view/take on life other than the box office. Schmaltz equals box office, so that's what we get. ""That's entertainment!"" I don't believe Opie knows anything about what it's like to attend a university such as Princeton, let alone what it is like to be afflicted by genius-cum-schizophrenia or to live life in the real world. It is a movie with a profound deficit in wisdom.I found the performances to be incredibly over-hyped; Jennifer Connelly is fine, but she does not give a performance of award-winning caliber unless the award is such hype-driven ""Let's honor the latest B-movie bimbo morphed serious actress"" awards as as the Oscar. I was also not disappointed to see her breasts, or her in revealing outfits. (It's the 1950s -- why isn't she in a girdle or some other foundation garments? There is not attention to detail in this film; it's all softened to evoke the year 2001 through a nostalgic filter. ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" in contrast, masterfully evokes the feel of the '50s. I could remember the feel starched shirts, tiny sports jackets, clasp-on ties and faux-fedoras my brother and I wore to church in the early 1960s while watching ""Man."" ""Beautiful Mind,"" in contrast, evokes the 1990s, what with portable nukes, the word ""meds,"" the digital readout implant, etc. Soft focus filmmaking, geared towards not challenging the audience even minutely.) I mention Connelly's assets as after watching her over many years, including her wonderful turn in ""Waking the Dead,"" one comes to expect seeing her breasts, or oogling her in something sexy. You're disappointed when it doesn't come off.The one-note performance of Russell Crowe makes me doubt my earlier assessment of him as a very talented actor. There is no development at all in his characterization of John Nash, and while I would like to blame the director, I think back on his performances in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and THE INSIDER (the latter of which I liked enormously) and see his Nash is just a variation of his ""wounded"" shtick. It was monotonous, to watch Nash as a loon from beginning to end. None of Crowe's characterizations, on second thought, show any development at all.While I will concede with Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind"" that I was watching an actor of some talent (though not greatly gifted), but I was watching an actor ""acting"" rather than an actor as the character (as Tom Wilkinson, who gave the most outstanding performance in English-language film this year, does in ""In The Bedroom"" -- you forget you're watching an actor acting and are watching the character himself). There is no fluidity at all in Crowe's characterization, nothing of the seamlessness of when a great actor becomes the character her plays. we're watching a cobbled-together performance, something more akin to elocution, ""gestures"" that will convey to the ordinary mass ""My -- aren't I watching 'great acting.'"" Crowe could have used semaphores (as opposed to the lazy or bored actor ""phoning in"" his performance; I supposed the audience gives extra credit for extra effort in really getting out there and ""acting"").  Crowe gives us a herky-jerky nut-case who becomes almost laughable two-thirds into the film. While watching the film, I began to think that Tom Hanks would have done a much better job with the character.I have had a long-standing argument with my girlfriend over the merits of Tom Hanks as an actor -- I'm not a fan of his, she is -- but watching Crowe's ""good"" bad acting made me appreciate that Hanks is indeed a truly good actor. A hallmark of an outstanding performance is when you cannot imagine another actor in the role -- I can not only imagine other actors in the role of John Nash, but other actors giving a far better, far more believable performance than the over-hyped Russell Crowe. Apart from Hanks, Gary Oldman would have been terrific in this role. There's such a scent of ham in Crowe's characterization, all's I can think is -- if you're going to go that route, why not with the greatest slice of ham in the world -- Mr. Oldman? Gary never made it to star status and then began weighing roles by the size of his pay-cheque, but he is at heart a terrific actor, albeit a really full-bore, over-the-top one, but if that's the way the director wanted it played -- as an out and out looney tune -- why not go with a great actor that can give you a fluid performance that is not a bunch of cobbled together tics (and whose ""West Virginia"" accent wanes more than Nash's schizophrenia as portrayed in the film).This film is terrible -- it makes a caricature of a genius, a caricature of someone who is mentally ill. Fifty years from now, if there still is a good ol' planet Earth, people will look back and see Crowe's unenlightened performance (as orchestrated by Opie) to be the equivalent of Step-in-Fetchit.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

A Hollywood Illusion,"A Beautiful Mind represents so much of what is wrong with Hollywood and the Oscars.  Though this film is largely vapid, trite, and completely fails to delve into John Nash's psyche at all, it presents the illusion of a strong character study.  The beautiful cinematography, musical score, and close-ups all work to create, like a formula, the illusion of feeling.  The audience sees (close-up + sad music + frustrated Russel Crowe = sad reaction).  Ron Howard provided the audience with all of the trappings they expect to see in an Oscar-calibre film and most moviegoing audiences have been trained to believe that slow-motion and nice cinematogrgraphy are the elements that make a good film.  Yet, this film completely lacks the kind of character development and true inner conflict that thrives in a film like Monster's Ball.  It is a veneer and never even attempts to get below the surface.  Ron Howard went fishing for an Oscar and got two.  The fact that Howard won an Oscar is embarrasing.

Beautiful indeed,"Mathematical genius John Nash is a man whose life story seems tailor-made for a movie. Of course once Hollywood gets its hands on anyone's story true-life details are changed, things are jazzed up to make things seem more dramatic than they actually were. In A Beautiful Mind though the Hollywood treatment works and is actually quite understandable. In order for his film to succeed director Ron Howard had to somehow take us inside the mind of the schizophrenic John Nash. Howard pulls this off brilliantly and that more than anything else is what enables the film to succeed. It's not the entirely true story of John Nash's life but it's close enough. And the story that is presented here is undeniably compelling, dramatic and entertaining. It was a very challenging story to tell and Howard, helped no doubt by his stellar cast, pulls it off wonderfully. A Beautiful Mind is a rousing success.In order for this film to work the actor portraying the brilliant but troubled Nash would have to be rather brilliant himself. And Russell Crowe is definitely up to the task. He hits all the right notes, capturing the tremendous highs and terrifying lows of Nash's life. From the young man we first meet at Princeton to the old man who has accomplished and overcome so much it is an incredible journey for John Nash. And Crowe is dead-on perfect throughout. He makes you believe in John Nash and makes you understand what is going on inside his mind. What exactly is going on inside that mind? A very complicated question that but the film portrays Nash in a way that draws you in and makes you pull for him as he battles his own inner demons.Nash himself is obviously the film's most important character and thus Crowe's performance the most important and ultimately the most memorable. But this is a film in which the acting is uniformly terrific. After Crowe it is Jennifer Connelly who would be the next real standout with her portrayal of Nash's wife Alicia. Through all the ups and downs Alicia is right there with John and Connelly turns in a powerful, highly charged, emotional performance. The strength of both the actress and the character she portrays adds so much to the film. Also noteworthy is Ed Harris who gets to portray a mysterious, menacing character around whom much of the film's drama swirls. And the list of fine performances goes on and on. Paul Bettany, Christopher Plummer, Adam Goldberg, Anthony Rapp, Josh Lucas...every performer plays their part so well. All the performances combine with a great, fascinating story to make this a film which captivates throughout. Not every great story makes for a great movie.

One is they show a pacifier on the table where the scene should be late 1950's and is a nuk type pacifier which I believe didn't arrive until the 1970's.

Russel Crowe's acting nearly puts a tear in your eye because you actually feel for him in certain situations. Superb on Crowe's part. What prevents this movie from being anything higher than 7 is the fact that the majority of the audience will think its a yawnfest, kudos to you if you are a patient person.

"Right actor, wrong year?","I'm sure there are a few members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences who are kicking themselves for giving Russell Crowe the Best Actor Oscar in the wrong year. Crowe won last year for the costume epic Gladiator, although nominee Ed Harris was more deserving for his work in Pollock. This year, Crowe's stellar performance in A Beautiful Mind could be overlooked simply because he won last year. That would be a shame, because Crowe's portrayal of John Nash, the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician who has battled schizophrenia, is one of the top performances in film this year. Crowe covers 47 years of Nash's life, ranging from his grad school days at Princeton to his winning of the Nobel Prize. In between, he goes through hell.  In a role far removed from Gladiator, Crowe is utterly convincing as the troubled, socially inept Nash. From the film's beginning to the crisis point in Nash's illness, the tale is told from Nash's perspective-which gives director Ron Howard and scriptwriter Akiva Goldsman the chance to shine. Nash's delusions are apparent from the beginning-if you know where they are. They are interspersed with reality so well that they're bound to, at least partially, surprise the viewer when they are revealed. The result is a fascinating look at an illness whose hallucinations can seem all too real. Jennifer Connelly adds depth to her role as Alicia, Nash's long-suffering wife, who (at least in the movie) perseveres throughout Nash's illness and aids him to a gradual recovery. This film has been criticized for taking liberties with facts surrounding Nash. Some have argued that the film misrepresents schizophrenia and places it at the wrong time in Nash's life. Others have complained that the film fails to note that Nash fathered an illegitimate child, was divorced from Alicia for quite some time, and is allegedly bisexual.This is one of those movies where the results are powerful enough to justify a less-than-factual account.

A ""Beautiful Mind"" I believe now was the best film of the year it was released (think Space Odyssey score here).  I really liked this movie.  How often does one see a film about mathematician who is schizophrenic?Here are my reasons for liking ""A Beautiful Mind"": (1) Russell Crowe is a multi-dimensional actor and this is by far the best performance of his careeer.  He should have won the Oscar. (2) Jennifer Connelly showed some major chops as Crowe's wife.  Her Oscar was well-deserved.  (3) Ron Howard finally got his Oscar.  His direction of films has only gotten better over the years (last best example is Apollo 13). (4) You go into this film thinking you know what will happen but you aren't really prepared for it. (5) The writing and plotting were fantastic. (6) The action sequences weren't typical Hollywood cheese. (7) The make-up effects were entirely realistic.  Crowe and Connelly looked completely different and they didn't look overdone. (8) The two intellectual geeks from ""Dazed and Confused"" showed up as Crowe's friends and they weren't at all annoying. (9) The conclusion of the film nearly caused me to break down into tears. (10) THe middle third is unbelievable too.  Ten reasons give a score of 10!I think I have possibly found my all-time favorite film.  I think I should also readjust my favorite actors and actresses lists too.  Here ends my rant!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Excellent Performances In A Moving Story,"This is an extremely well-done movie. I must admit that when I started to watch it I was lost after the first little while. It didn't seem to make a lot of sense, and it was certainly not what I was expecting from everything I had heard about ""A Beautiful Mind."" But without giving anything away, let me say that even if you have the same reaction, if you stick with this you will find out why the first 45 minutes or so seems so strange. In fact, that first part of the movie is so well done that when you first watch it you're tempted to just dismiss this as a disappointingly bad movie. But don't do that. Stick with it; it's worth it.Russell Crowe's performance as Dr. John Nash - the brilliant Princeton mathematician who struggles his entire life with mental illness - is magnificent, and demonstrates his versatility as an actor. He portrays both Nash's brilliance and his personal angst perfectly, and brings to the screen a man whom we can all feel for. Equally powerful was the performance of Jennifer Connelly as his wife Alicia, whose struggle with Nash's illness is just as valiant as John's is. Connelly brings out the pain of living in this nightmare, but her love - while tested - is also the source of hope for him and eventually helps him to persevere and even triumph.Moving, and at times funny (I loved Nash's line: ""what's the point of being crazy if you can't have any fun with it?"") once the story really gets going it has you questioning almost everything that happens - is it real or not? One of the few criticisms I could make would be that Christopher Plummer didn't really seem comfortable in the role of Nash's psychiatrist, Dr. Rosen. At least, that was my sense. That aside, this really is a great piece of work from Director Ron Howard.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Too dramatic and wonderful for words...,"My words could never even begin to describe how wonderful, realistic, and dramatic this priceless movie is. I personally give it two(or more) thumbs up.

Overrated by plenty,"It took beautiful patience to sit through ""A Beautiful Mind."" I can't knock Russell Crowe's acting but if the flick had been cut by 30 minutes and sped up by 2 hours, it would have been perfect. How? I would have seen the 20 trailers, 'THE END' would have popped up, the candy was gone and that would have been it. I've seen SLOW MOVING pix but this baby takes the cake. Every word mumbled by Crowe as Nash was an effort. Every facial shot showed more agony than the poor suckers who paid for tickets. I liked the espionage factor but then if I went into details about it,I'd ruin everything for those lucky enough not to have seen it.

Unlike Any Other,"A Beautiful Mind has a tone and feel that is unlike any other film. There is a reason that it was nominated for eight Oscars, winning four of them.

Yet another example of why the Academy sucks,"A Beautiful Mind was not the Best Picture of the year.  I'm sorry, but that distinction goes to In the Bedroom.  A Beautiful Mind wasn't even in the top 20.  The story was, for the most part, predictable and not involving.  I won't even go into the many, many inaccuracies in the film.  The entire time I found myself just wishing the movie would end.First of all, Russell Crowe was far from convincing as a genius.  His accent was beyond inconsistent and he never, not for even the smallest moment, convinced me that he WAS John Nash.  I can find solace in the fact that he didn't get the Oscar for this overrated performance.  It's a shame they can't take back the one they gave him last year.Jennifer Connelly was decent in a role that I, among others, feel should not have been categorized as supporting.  Either way, it wasn't even the best supporting performance of the year.  That prize should have gone to Marisa Tomei.  I think Connelly is a very fine actress and if she deserved an Oscar it was for her performance in Requiem for a Dream in 2000.  She wasn't even nominated for that.  What a travesty.  But I digress...I saw nothing in the movie that would have warranted a Best Director nod for Ron Howard either.  He's a capable director, but this was nowhere near an Oscar-worthy job.  Take a look at what David Lynch did in Mulholland Dr. or what Christopher Nolan did in Memento or even Ridley Scott in Black Hawk Down.  These are examples of greatness.A Beautiful Mind is not an example of greatness.  It is an over-hyped, overrated, piece of fluff trying to sell itself as something meaningful. And way too many people bought it.  With such extraordinary pieces of work submitted this year, what a true shame that this refuse was given the distinction as the best.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"Yes, it's a very good movie. But the book is so much better.","This is a good movie. But if you enjoyed it, or were moved by it, you owe it to yourself to read Sylvia Nasar's biography of Nash. The book (also called A BEAUTIFUL MIND) is one of the most riveting and moving pieces of nonfiction I've ever read, and certainly one of the finest biographies published in the past ten or fifteen years. I took it with me on a trip to Asia about a year and a half ago, and my only regret was that it ended a couple of hours into my 11-hour flight home. It's a wonderful book.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Interesting (but predictable and inaccurate) portrayal of a brilliant mathematician,"Be warned, this portrayal of John Nash has barely any resemblance to the real figure. Although historical films take some creative license for the sake of storytelling, this one is almost entirely fictional. Accuracy aside, Nash as played by Crowe is a subtle figure, wavering between narcissistic bravado and shy analysis. His turn for the worse is genuinely shocking, throwing the entire film upside down and making the audience question everything they've watched. The acting behind the other characters is also lifelike, as they are troubled by his issues but warm enough to support him. As far as the film's treatment of mathematics, genius and schizophrenia go, this is nothing too original or complex, but it is told in an understandable, sympathetic and tragic way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A INTELLIGENT AND BRILLIANT FILM WITH A SENSATIONAL TURN BY CROWE,"Ron Howard's intelligent, fascinating true-life character study of John Nash, played brilliantly by Russell Crowe in an extraordinary Oscar nominated and Golden Globe Award winning performance. Nash is a genius West Virginian mathematician who flowers at Princeton in the late 1940s and then goes to work at M.I.T. where he accepts some secret work in cryptography for the U.S. government, but his marriage and his sanity are at stake because unbeknownst to him he suffers from serious schizophrenia. The beautiful Jennifer Connelly delivers a superlative Oscar and Golden Globe winning performance as Nash's devoted wife Alicia, and the chemistry between Crowe and her is genuine and rings true. Masterful Oscar winning direction by Ron Howard, and the film also benefits greatly from the exception supporting performances by Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Josh Lucas, Anthony Rapp, Judd Hirsch, Austin Pendleton, and Vivien Cardone, but it's Crowe's awe inspiring performance that completely dominates this sensational motion picture.

One of the most beautilful movies seen,"New review for A beautiful mindThis is the 3rd time and the final time to watch this magnificent movie , this time in netfix and on better hour together with my wifeHere is my older short review as noticed (from my site )Russel Crow iun a very nice but very long 3 hour movie with the history of a geat mathematician John Nash He was deprived by a strong fantasy of an anti- Russian tam tat followed him for vey long for decoding supposed hidden Russian messages in he newspapers .

Sentimental Mediocrity,"Like myself and probably hundreds of thousands of others we are all wondering exactly how such a mediocre schmaltz ridden film ever got nominated, let alone won an Oscar for best picture. It's certainly not a really bad movie it's just horribly middle of the road and only ever generates small moments of interest in an overlong plodding story. The subject should have been shown a lot more respect and also been given to a director with courage to show the whole story, rather than this sanitised version.Apart from maybe Apollo 13, Howard's films have frequently been too safe and bland and unsurprisingly this is no exception. What should have been a memorable fascinating story about a very complex man is littered with so much pap dialog, sentimentality and swirling orchestration, we end up not caring about anyone. Russell Crowe is a brilliant actor as he has proven in most of his previous incarnations, but with this role he really needed a braver film maker to let him loose again.For lessons in how to film the story of a troubled mind, remember gems like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Jacobs Ladder - both far from sentimental but both totally moving and un-forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Maths can drive you crazy, I've always known it! :-)","At first I had my reservations about this movie. I never liked mathematics at school, so why should I watch a movie with a mathematician as the main character in it? Well, it may not have convinced me of the use of mathematics, but at least it convinced me that maths is able to drive you crazy (as if I didn't already know that for years).No, serious now. It sure may seem a very boring movie and I'm not the kind of person that wants to see all bio-pics that have ever been made, but this time I was really surprised by it. I found it really intriguing to see how the schizophrenia took over the man's life. It was fascinating, yet also uncomfortable to see. This may well be the strongest as well as the weakest point of this movie. The strongest point because it gives you something to think about, the weakest because it seems to me (after reading some comments on this website) not many people still feel the urge to think while watching a movie. If there aren't any big explosions, guns and special effects to be seen, they are no longer interested in it.Personally I liked the movie very much. Russel Crowe did a great job as Dr. Nash, but the other actors' performances weren't any less. All in all I would recommend this movie to anybody who isn't afraid to use his mind for a few moments during a movie and who doesn't need any special effects in a movie before believing it was a good one.

Could do better,I can scarcely believe that this is in line for best pcture and best director Oscars.  For me it seemed to be an OK movie with a good movie trying to get out.

You can't tell what is real and what is not. And the acting accolades this film received are well-deserved.

Most Overrated Film of 2001!,"As a graduate film student, I watch hundreds of movies a year.  By now, I can tell a good film from a bad one.  A Beautiful Mind, as with most of Ron Howard's movies, is somewhere in between.  It has some satisfying moments, but just doesn't make it all the way to home base.  It's definitely an admirable effort and I did enjoy the film, but I thought it was lacking in dialogue, plot, visual appeal, and imagination. After watching A Beautiful Mind steal the Golden Globe, and quite possibly the Oscar, for Best Film from The Lord of the Rings, I have a new disliking for this mediocre film.  Anyone who has seen The Insider, also starring Russell Crowe in a drama about a real-life person, should know that it is a far more superior film in every aspect.  Go out and rent it now and you'll see that Michael Mann knows what he is doing.  And no recent film has better dialogue than The Insider. Getting back to ABM, the performances by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly are pleasing, but Russell's character just seems to be an overly quirky and confused version of his character in The Insider.  And will somebody tell me how Jennifer Connelly has managed to look the same for the past 10 years!  Now that's impressive. I keep hearing critics comment on how ABM does such a wonderful job in getting the audience inside the mind of a genius and schizophrenic.  How do they do it?  Special effects.  I was not impressed by this, with the exception of the code-breaking scene.  And the entire movie is about a character that I don't really like.  What caused his schizophrenia?  In the movie, it is apparently John F. Nash's inflated ego.  He refuses to go to classes with ""mere mortals"" losing their ability to be creative.  He drives himself crazy because he wants to be more important than he really is.  And no one even mentioned his bisexuality and divorce from his wife... Well, if you loved this movie, that's great.  It's a relatively good film, much better than some of the trash that comes out these days.  And I don't believe in criticizing films.  Film, to me, is a wonderful and powerful art medium.  I fully realize how difficult it is to make a good film and how there are an overwhelmingly large number of challenges and obstacles to juggle with when doing so.  The only reason I'm writing this is because of the surprisingly high-regard people have for this movie.  It's not that great, and it better not win the Oscar even though that haunting prospect seems very likely.  I should also add that I have a lot of respect for John F. Nash, Jr. and all of his accomplishments.  It's just that this film doesn't accomplish as much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

A Beautiful Mind,"A Beautiful Mind is a film about nobel prize winner John Nash. It shows his life with schizophrenia and math/science. It shows a detailed view of how life could be like with schizophrenia and how serious it can be. It shows Nash and his hallucinations from his schizophrenia and him trying to live a normal life through it. I feel like it really does increase awareness of schizophrenia and help clear some misconceptions. It is based on a true story and that makes it seem accurate to actual schizophrenia. I find that Russel Crowe did an excellent job as Nash. I find Crowe an actor like Christain Bale; they're both pretty good at their roles though some of the films they're in might not be the best.This film does delve into many subjects you would delve into in school. It is the story of a real mathematician, which ties into both history and math.

Great insight into mental illness...short on facts.,"A Beautiful Mind, if presented as fiction, would have impressed me more. A great film that suffered an unfortunate blemish of not being true to the facts of the life that it represented--that of John Nash.  Mental Illness needs to be understood, Beautiful Mind did a pretty admirable job of taking the often quieted nightmare of the former and portraying in a manner that seems comprehensible to the viewer.Still, the facts of John Nash's life don't match the story.

"A harsh and gloomy story told in a most beautiful way, Howard, Crowe, and Connelly help craft a fine film","Is a Beautiful Mind groundbreaking? No. Is A Beautiful Mind a cinematic achievement? No. Is A Beautiful Mind a drama that will change your outlook on life? Yes. Directed by Ron Howard and lead by an incredibly talented staff in writing, directing, acting, and musical score, A Beautiful Mind is leagues above the average drama and remains one of the few movies in recent years that actually did indeed deserve that Best Picture Oscar it had earned years ago. This film will make you laugh, will make you suspect, will make you cry, and will make you reflect on your life one way or another.A Beautiful Mind follows the life of mathematician John Nash. He is an extremely intelligent man but with his genius comes problems, issues, and situations that affect not only him but also the lives of the people he cares about the most. Throughout the film, there are many surprises and unexpected turns in plot that just reveals how his methods of thinking and attempting to find solutions ultimately eats away at his life. Russell Crowe plays Nash and pretty much nails it, one of the finest performances I've ever seen. You can even see him little by little break down emotionally as well as physically as he lived on with his problems. Jennifer Connelly is just as talented as she is beautiful, as she plays the loving yet frustrated wife of John Nash. Crowe and Connelly have excellent chemistry together, and their love for each other pretty much bleeds out of the film and into your heart, as you will have a lump in your throat during their best moments shared together. Another notable good job comes from Ed Harris, who plays a cold man hiring John Nash on a top-secret mission to help find out what the Russians are doing. The acting is basically what runs this film, but much credit should be given to the writing.Weaving a true-life story that needs to be told into a movie that can capture the interest of an audience is no easy task; especially involving the evil and cynical feature we all call mathematics. Fortunately for us, they kept the complicated, convoluted jargon that only true math experts can recognize to a minimum, even though there are times in which you are just better off zoning out as you see Nash engage into intricate arithmetic with other Princeton students. The story is paced well, as no section of his life is stretched way too long, nor does it ever become predictable. Ron Howard absolutely perfects his directing skills in this film, as he constantly leads the audience down one path, only to totally throw them off at the latest surprise. Kind of like Fight Club and Pulp Fiction, A Beautiful Mind may require more than one viewing in order to catch all the nifty details scattered about. Even the colors of the film are remarkably toned down as you dwell halfway into the movie.It is more than a biography; it is a love story, and a story about a man attempting to defeat a seemingly impossible task of daunting past his problems. While his dilemmas are far from normal, deep down, we all can sympathize and understand what he is going through, we all can see ourselves in him as he goes through his worst moments. But unlike most life-changing, eye-watering stories, this one didn't look like there was much hope, and as the viewer, you will almost deteriorate emotionally as badly as John Nash. Nonetheless, don't get the impression that this movie should be avoided if you are currently depressed or emotionally unstable, because underneath all the drama and chaos lies hope and anticipation, lies a chance that everything will be betterthis is what life is, an ever-changing quest for happiness that contains moments of darkness that seems to find no end. A Beautiful Mind is exactly an interpretation of life, that long, sometimes awful yet rewarding road that hopefully finds its way out of the bowels of rough terrain.Bottom Line: A Beautiful Mind should be viewed by everybody, as it gives a not-so-typical story about a man whose fears and issues threaten to get in the way of his first love, mathematics, and his main love, his wife. Acted out almost perfectly, and directed with few faults, this movie should change the way you view things or at least reflect a bit. While the dialogue does have its bits of slowdown, especially when the complicated math starts getting involved, this film is nothing short of spectacular. Highly, highly recommend.

Russell Crowe Should Have Won the Oscar,"A Beautiful Mind is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

Akiva Goldsman (Best Adapted Screenplay) and Ron Howard (Best Director) earned their Oscars for this movie.  The performances are also brilliant.  Russell Crowe should have won his second Oscar for his portrayal of John Nash.

A Celebration of Life,"Empiricists are prone to simply place a label on something that cannot be quantified or qualified by sense perception and then to construct a mythology around it. This is the case in the science of human behavior. Abnormal behavior that is not understood, such as schizophrenia is labeled and categorized per its attending syndrome. Its symtomology is then attacked by various therapeutic methods and chemical concoctions, some which are more harmful to the patient than the so-called illness itself.In this exquisite film the protagonist suffers from schizophrenia as diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Yet, the film is not about the illness as much as it is about an extraordinary man who is quite different from most of us, a man who has far greater use of his brain than perhaps 99.9% of the rest of us. It is about his triumph despite the ""malady"".However, this malady, as seen by some metaphysicians takes on a more interesting casting. After Albert Einstein the entire world we thought we knew came up for grabs. In this new arena where temporal reality is invalidated and matter revealed as pure energy, where time and space are inextricably bonded and labeled illusory the astute metaphysician has no alternative but to see some abnormal behaviors as perhaps something far more profound than a dysfunction of the brain.As seen here, in this very best work thus far of Ron Howard after a director's career of excellence we are given the latitude to question the nature of the ""illness"" called schizophrenia. We are also shown interweaving realities as perceived by an extraordinary mind and what happens when that mind meets the rest of us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Beautiful Performance,"Based on the real life of genius mathmatician John Nash, this film takes liberties with its events, but ultimately serves up a great movie about a man in madness.  Russell Crowe is fantastic as Nash.  This is a signature performance that will captivate moviegoers with a magnetic energy.  Nash's slow but steady decent into paranoid pscyzophrenia is troubling, puzzling and heartbreaking.  The character ages 50 years through the course of the film, weaving him in and out of delusions that are not made clear until the midpoint of the movie.  The first half is remenicent of the clever trickery and manipulation that the 6th Sense had, and until you realize he has this delusional disorder, you dont understand that half of what is one the screen is not real.  The 2nd half of the picture depicts Nash's struggle to overcome the illness on his own terms - using his ""beautiful mind"" to beat his degeneration.  He is a complex character, at times insecure, and others extremely arrogant and blunt, obsessed with his mathematic breakthroughs and fantasy life as a Pentagon agent.  Jennifer Connolley is good as his wife, who stands by John through decades of uncertainty and maddness.  The ending feels a bit too sweet and nice to feel very real.  It will leave you questioning how much liberty director Ron Howard exercised with the script. A good film nonetheless.  Final Rating = 7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Beautiful And More,"Beauty. The word every filmmaker wants to hear in relation to his or her work. However, achieving cinematic beauty is something else. Beauty lies in the emotion, dedication and passion of good filmmaking; beautiful films are the one's made for a purpose. This film falls into that category: it serves a purpose. It successfully investigates the implications of dealing with schizophrenia, from minor inconveniences to larger problems with the potential to deliver devastating consequences. Therefore this movie is not destined purely to entertain, but to educate.The story focuses around John Nash: A mathematical genius who attends Princeton in the hope of coming up with a mathematical theory which is 'original'. Under immense pressure to meet his ambitions as well as from his classmates, Nash eventually succeeds, working his way up until he became a professor at the MIT. Here he begins to notice the effects of his growing mental illness. He marries Alicia: one of his graduates but then begins to slip into a complicated world where he cannot differentiate reality from fantasy.Crowe pulls of the part brilliantly, delivering a merit- worthy performance. Equally as impressive is Jennifer Connelley with Ed Harris interjecting a solid part. The mood of the film swings, twists and warps the traditional pallet; enveloping the range of feelings of a true drama and packaging them into a complete thriller. This film is layered with emotion and passion: showcasing determination and proving that you can overcome your trials. It's pace fluctuates, making it exciting, dynamic and unpredictable, panning from quaint romance to exhilarating action. Howard succeeds in delivering a product which contains more than just pure beauty, but despair as well as joy. Wrapped up in this feature are messages that all people can draw from, whether you're ambitions and inspired or not. It reminds us all that life has its challenges, but also that those challenges can be overcome if we learn to ignore the hurdles whilst embracing the rewards. Prepare to be amazed, saddened, elated and touched by a movie which exhibits more than just the beauty of overcoming.86/100",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

That is despite good performances by Crowe and Connelly and some others and three false scenes clever enough to justify themselves.I am not a mathematician or a scientist, but despite my lack of understanding, the first page of Sylvia Nasar's book was more interesting to me than the entire movie.Screenplays frequently change facts and oversimplify to convey important information or feelings efficiently and powerfully.  I'm not offended by such fictionalization per se.  But this movie takes a fascinating real story and completely ignores almost everything fascinating about it and tells a different, ridiculous story that would be journalistically justifiable but mediocre at best as art IF IT WERE TRUE ... which it is not.Until now I thought Moulin Rouge was the worst movie of the year ...

"Reveals common misconceptions about mental illness, in particular schizophrenia, using a brilliant mathematician as a vehicle.","This film is not meant to be a biography; if you want an accuratebiography go read a book...you cannot make a film into abiography. The film does not set out to explain modern theories ofeconomics and quantum physics ( again, find an Idiot's Guide! ). Ihave personal experience of mental illness, and the great worth ofthe film is its focus on the nightmarish experience ofschizophrenia, and the general lack of understanding about it,even in the 21st century; it has more impact as well by showinghow such an illness can possibly destroy the mind of a genius.  Ofcourse in addition how it could wreck one's family, relationshipsand career. The film is generally empathetic about how his wifeand close friends stick by him, which is so important, no matterhow scary things can get, and also shows the importance of usingavailable drug therapy. It also demonstrates the ability of thesufferer of this illness to overcome it to the degree of being able tolive a successful life, by acknowledging the illness ( a physicalillness which attacks the brain...I do not like the term mentalillness ), and striving to fight those thoughts and images that youknow are irrational, even though they can be so real. In the film theimaginary characters are more real to the viewers of the film thanthey are to those not close to Nash; thus trying to demonstrate tous the absolute reality of these figures in the mind of the afflictedperson. Throughout his life these ""imaginary"" characters werealways real, he just chose not to acknowledge them or speak tothem; he had the advantage of being supremely intelligent andunderstanding his disease; and in his final speech he acknowledges mathematics, quantum theory, and his own imagination as part of his make up; he embraces them; they arepart of who is John Nash, thus raising the ever stimulatingquestion of what reality actually is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A beautiful movie,"""A beautiful mind"" is a very good movie because it mixes all kind of situations, making you feel different sensations during the story.What I think that is the best quality of the movie is the way how it shows the contrast between what happens in Jhon Nash's real life, and what happens in his imaginary life.I think that this is one of Russell Crowe's best role plays ever done in his entire career, because in this movie he has to act as a person with psychological problems and at the same time as a brilliant mathematician; but the most interesting point of the movie is that you'll be able to watch all kind of scenes as suspense, drama and even humor.In my point of view this is one of the greatest movies of all times, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes to watch original and impacting movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Whose life is it, anyway?","""A Beautiful Mind"" is a beautiful movie. It is the story of the brilliant and tortured John Nash, mathematician and Nobel laureate, a man who wrestled with the demons of mental illness and came out on top.Or is it?If you read the book on which the movie was based - and be forewarned, it is NOT an easy read - you will find that the movie really had only the most tenuous connection with John Nash's life. He was brilliant. He was arrogant. He was mad. He married Alicia. And he won a Nobel prize.Yet even after I read the book, and saw Nash himself interviewed (and heard him make discouraging comments that his schizophrenic son should employ more ""rational thinking""), I found that I still like the movie.Maybe because I have wrestled with my own demons of mental illness (though mine are tame compared to Nash's), I found myself in sympathy with Nash's film self. I also felt for Alicia, as my spouse has had to go through some harrowing moments with me. Scenes in the hospital were a bit unnerving. Yet there a poignant hope surrounding the film, that those of us in the depths may find the light in the tunnel, and passage out of the darkness.Akiva Goldsman's script was both luminous and shadowy, probing the mind of genius and insanity with equal aplomb. Someone so complex as Nash could not have been brought to life by a poor writer. Sylvia Nasar's book is excellent; Goldsman's screenplay, though bearing only slight resemblance to the book, is excellent as well. The movie owes much to the screenplay's brilliance.Russell Crowe did a wonderful job as Nash, portraying the man on many levels. The one problem for me was his accent, or lack thereof. Only twice did he lapse into something faintly resembling a Southern accent. The rest of the time I kept hearing Richard Burton, particularly as George in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" Crowe will be the perfect choice to play Burton's role in the remake.Jennifer Connelly was both strong and delicate as Alicia Nash. (It would have been nice if the film had at least hinted that Alicia is Hispanic.) Ed Harris rarely stumbles, and he was certainly in fine form as the hard-as-nails - and ultimately terrifying - William Parcher.  Judd Hirsch was unfortunately wasted in a throw-away part.Ulimately, however, it was the performance of Paul Bettany that made me go back to the theater a second time, and what will make me buy the video as soon as it is released. As the ""prodigal roommate"" Charles Herman, Bettany was a perfect foil and comic relief for Crowe's anguished Nash. The role of Charles may well have been the most difficult in the film, and Bettany did it proud. I was disappointed that the Academy Awards overlooked him.Perhaps the film owes its heart and soul to its director, Ron Howard. I've never been a huge fan of Howard's pictures - though I did like ""Apollo 13"" (and ""Gung Ho"" had its moments: ""No more MTV! No more Twisted Sister!""). With ""A Beautiful Mind,"" Ron grows up. It's nice to see one of my contemporaries make good after many years of hard work. (You can always count on Ron to include his family in his pictures - Daddy Rance showed up in ""A Beautiful Mind"" as a mental patient, and Ron himself was a party guest.)While much of the pre-Oscar buzz going around was true - ""A Beautiful Mind"" does sugarcoat Nash's rather abrasive personality - the best thing to do is judge the film as a separate entity. Read the book for the life of John Nash. Watch ""A Beautiful Mind"" to see a beautiful movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"Breathtaking, amazing, spectacular","I'm known to give my personal opinions of movies to my friends and coworkers on a daily basis, with ""A Beautiful Mind"" being no exception. But with a film this affecting, I'm also drawn to share my thoughts with the members of the IMDb. Simply put, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a film which extends far beyond the 2 hours and 8 minutes that you will spend viewing it in the theater. The characters continued to haunt me after the movie, thanks to the Oscar-inducing performances by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and all of the supporting players.  They are not merely acting, yet are transformed into the characters, leaving no trace of a line between their part and reality. Of course a film is only as good as a screenplay would allow, and the story contained within is written in a way that compliments everything that is truly great about ""A Beautiful Mind.""  Ron Howard can nearly be forgiven for his work on ""The Grinch"" for the inspiring work he has contributed to this film, and I hope that the critics remember him when awards are being given out.I know that most reviews give you a synopsis of the film, revealing many of its major details to give you a picture of whether or not you would enjoy a film, but I've never been one to spoil movies with plot details.  I can only tell you that if you're looking for an emotionally-charged movie with near perfect acting, cinematography, directing, editing and a screenplay which will cause the story of John Nash to inspire you, then consider ""A Beautiful Mind.""In closing, if Crowe isn't awarded the Best Actor Oscar this year, then my faith in movies and its rewards system will be seriously tarnished.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"good, but not great","Overall I did enjoy this movie.  Crowe was excellent portraying a troubled mathematician.  However, the story of John Nash itself simply isn't all that interesting and one gets the impression that Hollywood is trying too hard to make a story out of nothing.  I mean Nash's mental conditions was heavily emphasized throughout the film that it came across more on a movie about mental disorders.  I wished the film devoted more time emphasizing Nash's contributions to mathematics and why his contributions were important.  At the very end you do hear a bit about that but that was much too late after 2 hrs worth of riding through Nash's mental problems.  This movie had chances to become really good, but instead of going deeper into explaining in layman's terms the contributions of Nash, so we can appreciate his ""beautiful mind"", we get carried away into Nash's nightmares and drowned for 2 hrs in Nash's mental state that could've been explained in 15 minutes. The movie echoed the sixth sense the way Nash's sees ""people"" around him all the time and it just got ridiculous in that aspect.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
has the whole world gone insane?,"seeing this movie (just recently) for the first time has shaken my faith in the academy, the critics and filmgoers everywhere.is this the film that won THE OSCAR for BEST FILM of 2001? come on, people! were you on something?i found ""a beautiful mind"" to be so inept and irredeemably stupid, that had i attended a test screening, i'd have recommended the studio shelf the movie, let alone submit it for consideration.""akiva goldsman writes a serious script"". the very thought seemed like a joke. but after the oscars and the critical and popular success, i assumed i was just wrong about him; maybe he really was a real writer. maybe the man who brought us the god-awful ""lost in space"" and ""batman returns"" (which featured the legendarily witty salvo, ""hi freeze, i'm batman"") was just making a living, waiting for his masterpiece to be produced? but all hopes were dashed in the first two minutes. this material is aimed at 6 year olds!how can people have serious debates over a movie where characters talk in nothing but expositions, literary quotes, lame jokes and regurgitated cliches? where mathematics, presumably a central theme, is shown as something incomprehensible that eggheads doodle? with a saturday morning cartoon villain/antagonist who taunts our hero about his failures, only to be mocked when he finally succeeds? where a govt. agent's briefing on soviet espionage consists of showing nash (and the audience) stock footage of a-bomb explosions, and nash's explanation of the meaning of a secret russian code meets the reply, ""thanks for all your help mr. nash, so-and-so will show you out""?in many ways, this movie is just as bad, if not worse, than any fictionalized biopic ever made in hollywood. would you believe you could still see, in the 21st century, a new movie where an actor in exaggerated old-age makeup accepts the nobel prize for economics with a speech about how the real meaning of life can be found ""in the equations of love""?! give me a break!one moment contained as good an unintentional laugh as any in goldsman's old turkeys. in the early stages, a man in the m.i.t. library gets a tribute from colleagues; each places his pen on the man's table. nash ""asks"" what this means and receives the explanation, along with us. when the obvious payoff to this scene arrives at a later stage, and nash receives the same tribute himself, the mushy string-music moment stretches on for a minute or two, and then nash actually says, almost directly into the camera: ""how totally unexpected"". how totally ridiculous!dreamworks continues to be a studio that makes only 3 kinds of films: calculated, soulless, test-marketed attempts to make a big box office; calculated, soulless, test-marketed attempts to win oscars, and, thereafter, a big box office; and spielberg films. it's the only time i can think of that a movie studio only contributed to cultural decline, without a single contribution (and yes, i do include ""american beauty"" and ""saving private ryan"" in that statement. haven't seen ""perdition"" yet, but i'm sure it's still accurate.)i hope nash's story will actually, one day, be made into a good movie, not a laughable ham-fest with rehashed sixth sense silliness.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Makes you think...,"A beautiful mind is quite unique in its sort. The movie is about the famous mathematician John Nash, who we all know him from his famous ""prisinor's dilemma"" and other economical theories. After being a nerd with a cause in uni (Princeton, US), he comes up with a controversial theory about ""governing dynamics"". In the movie you see a great example of the prisinor's dilemma mentioned earlier: Four guys are sitting in a bar, they all see a bunch of girls but one chick stands out and all four like her. In stead of all going after one girl and end up alone, it would be better to do what's best for yourself and the group. So you choose one of her girlfriends and you all have sex. Makes you think...Anyway, doctor Nash marries a student, gets a kid and becomes schizo. Shiver.. shiver.. Nicely filmed but in the end, alas, the film becomes a hollywood flick (e.g. the really lame part where he gets all the pens.. dude!).All by all it's still a great movie and it definitely prooves for me that economics students as well as mathematicians are by nature a little 'twisted in the mind' ;)Thank you mr.

Yet, there is real feeling for the character who, despite mental illness, went on to win international recognization. It was very hopeful in the end.

Movie is too distant to get feel attached to any of the characters,"""A Beautiful Mind"" seems to buy into itself too much and leaves the viewer wondering what's going on.  Unrealistic and unexplained sequences that are supposedly only in John Nash's head seem to get in the way of a story that could be interesting.  We are never really told why Nash is famous or if he actually did work for the CIA.  The love story between his wife (Jennifer Connely) is, again, not realistic in it's approach. Why does she fall in love with him and, more importantly, why do they get married and stay together.  Russell Crowe is good as John Nash, but the distance created between the actor and the audience is too much.  Jennifer Connely is good as well, but it is hard to figure her character out.  I never felt attached to either character, and didn't want to root for them to overcome.  Some of the scenes between the two are so over-the-top; the star-gazing scene is especially silly.  The last half hour of the movie is better, as we know what is going on and his life is explained.  The first portion of the movie is distant and cold, leaving a lot desired by the audience who wants to know who this guy is and what is really going on.  It is unlike ""The Sixth Sense"" when it is such a cool surprise when you find out he is actually dead.

It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but I've seen it before, and in a better version.Avid watchers of film will equate ""A Beautiful Mind"" with a little indie flick that came out in 1998 called ""Pi.""  (The actual title is the mathematical symbol.)  That film also depicts a mathematical genius, number theory stretching beyond his control, and the game Go.  But ""Pi"" itself was possessed of a spiraling madness.  A reclusive mathematician whose computer spits out a 237 digit number which could be translated through Hebrew into the name of God, and thus finding patterns in all the chaotic events of daily life.  It was directed by Darren Aronofsky, (who also directed ""Requiem For A Dream"" and is in talks to helm the ""Batman: Year One"" film) and was shot on grainy, 16mm black and white.  ""Pi"" had edge and daring and a lot of other stuff ""A Beautiful Mind"" doesn't have.That being said, ""A Beautiful Mind."" is a lovely little film. A man's battle with himself, and a love story to boost ticket sales. It's one of those slivers of a true story that is mostly fiction but we all wish happened anyway.  Russell Crowe, in a brilliant performance, plays John Nash, a West Virginia math prodigy who can afford to be arrogant because he's always right.  The rest of the movie for the most part is nothing new, but the character of John Nash is something I don't remember seeing.  Mumbling in his near indecipherable accent, hobbling along as he ages, looking positively ill at ease in a tuxedo.  This is a new level of fearlessness for Crowe.  After a guy plays a disgraced-yet-studly Roman soldier in one of the most overrated films ever made, there is a level of coolness that one might feel the need to live up to.  Not Crowe.  He takes off his leather skirt and jumps right back into the deep characters where he left off with ""The Insider.""As a director, Ron Howard is shamelessly commercial.  That's not always a bad thing, but it ain't always good either.  From his worst movies (""Dr. Suess' How The Grinch Stole Christmas"") to his best, (""Apollo 13"") Howard shows no artist's touch whatsoever.  My feeling is that he just falls ass-backwards into the scripts that'll probably be the highest grossers. Well, more power to him.  If he makes more movies like ""A Beautiful Mind,"" he may find himself with one more fan.  But pay Aronofsky some royalties, will ya?*** out of 4",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
beautiful movie,"My pursuit took me through physics, metaphysics, hallucinations, and back again. The world of top scientists is amazing enough, and he has great love.

"Too imperfect to deserve so many Oscars, but a well-made and challenging work all the same","As with fellow Oscar-winner Monster, this biopic has received criticism for a few inaccuracies regarding the real life of the subject. Those in A Beautiful Mind are more worthy of criticism, or of clarification at the very least.From what I gather, the portrayal of schizophrenia is not accurate. John Nash did not visualise people, he merely heard their voices and interpreted them his own way. This limits the film's worth on an educational side, but does allow the film to take on more drama for those unfamiliar with Nash's life.Which leads me to the other big issue, the inaccuracies as to his romantic life. Not only is Nash's older son ignored, Alicia being from El Salvador originally is also overlooked, and their divorce and remarriage is not mentioned either.Worse to some, Nash's past rumoured bisexual relationships are airbrushed away. I don't feel the writers should however be blamed for this, for two reasons. Firstly, Nash claims that he had a level of identity crisis during his schizophrenic times, and attributes any dalliances with men to these. Hardly a view likely to be well-received by gay viewers, much less Hollywood's large gay presence. Secondly, homosexuality is almost entirely ignored in mainstream cinema, unless it is integral to a true story (such as Monster), and this might not be the best film to break it thought.When I first watched the film, I loved the ending - the whole 'triumph over adversity' feel combined with the touching 'I did so much wrong, but now I've found truth' speech seemed to justify everything. With the reality being somewhat different, it may instead have been phony Hollywood schmaltz. I don't know whether Nash's acceptance speech was similar to what was used in the film - if not, this is a major flaw if the film is to be viewed as a biopic.For all these flaws, we are still looking at an entertaining piece of work. Nash's mathematical achievements are largely simplified or overlooked, but this is fair enough - to most people it's an over-complex or boring field. Many will have left the cinema keen to research Nash's real work, and there are many places where that can be done easily enough. The same goes for the anti-Communism hysteria and status of the Nobel Prize for Economics which are mentioned by other reviewers.Above all, this is a human interest piece. A complex, flawed but gifted man struggles with complex demons and somehow comes out on top. He loses what could have been his best years, but enjoys a later-life renaissance and is accepted by the very people he once had (mutual) distrust of. Russell Crowe is superb throughout, Ed Harris is truly awesome, while Paul Bettany is perhaps best of all as Charles, who in many ways is what Nash deep down wishes he was but is convinced he is not - sociable, suave and popular with the ladies. He takes centre stage in the comic chat-up attempt in particular. If you're open-minded, but aware of what you will be viewing, give it a go.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Summarized at parts and extended on others.,"1) The movie is extremely summarised at parts, especially in the beginning and at the end. In the beginning, it failed to show how brilliant the man is. At the end, it also failed to show how the man got the noble prize. What did he do to get it? It needed more than these number of scenes. It utterly concentrated on his schizophrenia and this is what point 2 is about.2) Schizophrenia literally filled all the movie which got really really boring in the middle. Okay, we know he sees things. Let's move on! Show us how we worked to get over it and get the Noble prize.3) The movie showed that Jack Nash was only running after recognition which I find a bit degrading for such a man.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Warm and Fuzzy, But Just the Facts Ma'am?","I have read many of the other reviews, both positive and negative. Despite being '000s of kilometres away in Australia, we receive many first-hand news reports on the Hollywood entertainment industry and, alarmingly, reports on alleged 'dirty tactics,' supposedly designed to ruin particular movies' chances of winning Oscars.I guess the studios will do what they do, simply because their revenues and budgets are dependent upon a movie's success and recognition from the Academy, in particular, and industry in general. It just seems disappointing that people will stoop to slurring a movie in the hopes that its success in any capacity will be diminished.We have heard that Russell Crowe's character, Nash, was homosexual, anti-semitic and unfaithful to his wife. I do not know whether these things are true, but I remember that after the release of Schindler's List, there was criticism that Schindler's infidelities and poor treatment of his wife were overlooked by director Spielberg.No doubt, the same people that are complaining about the leaving-out of facts would also complain about the movie being over-long, if extra time was taken to include the facts.The director uses the film to tell the story that they want to tell. They are given that perogative by the studios, ovbiously with the consideration of commercial viability being an important factor. To label a film as bad, simply because some facts are left out, is supremely ignorant.If factual deficiencies make a movie bad, then why are films such as the Godfather so highly-regarded? There is no factual basis behind the Godfather whatsoever. Additionally, its subject matter is repugnant, but the story is told in such a way as to make it palatable to a large audience. How is this different from A Beautiful Mind?I can not speak for Ron Howard's intentions, but I found ABM included sufficient positives and negatives from Nash's life to provide a balanced view. The man was no saint, but he was battling a disease that I personally had no conception of, until I saw this movie.There was a guy at school with me who had schitzophrenia. He suffered greatly, in addition to his disease, due to our ignorance of what he was going through. He was teased and ridiculed, much like Nash was, yet he has gone on to become a successful lawyer, after 6 years of study. This film has added to my understanding of others, much more than a mindless alien invasion movie or love story. Only the most cynical would overlook the value that this film has to understanding mental illness.The point is that directors have limited time in which to convey their messages. Let's face it, if biographical films were completely true-to-life, they would all be 5 + hours long and very boring. The director must use his/her discretion to balance a feasible story with a consideration of the audience's need to be 'entertained'. The director could include many more facts from the character's life, but if they are not pertinent to the story that the director wishes to tell, then what is the point?Ron ""with cheese"" Howard, judging by the comments on this board, is renowned for making 'schmaltzy' movies. Well guess what people? If you don't like his movies, stop going to see them. Why see something from a particular director if you know that you don't like his work? It doesn't make sense.Personally, on the odd occasion, I enjoy leaving a movie theatre feeling like I have learned something and, dare I say, feeling uplifted and happy. You can try it too!

On Suffering,"A poignant look at schizophrenia and one man's lifelong endeavor to overcome it.Overcoming something as abstract as schizophrenia does not mean eliminating it. Rather to accept that it is there, always will be there, yet exercising dominion over it regardless. Being it's master instead of the far more common opposite approach that the psychiatric profession tends towards.John Nash in this regard is beyond admirable for this achievement more so than his achievements in mathematics, including that for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.In this life, the very best testimony we have as individuals is rooted wholly in how we answer the following question honestly:How did I handle my trouble in my life ?This is who we truly are. This is our integrity. The essence of who we are.Anyone living a trouble free life, or better stated, a life devoid of challenges, can point to this, that or the other. These really aren't achievements though. It's the overcoming that paints the picture of who we are.And it's the overcoming that enriches us.This movie presents an outstanding historical account of this beautifully.Our problems are our belongings. They are ours, each of us with their own set of problems. Our property. Ownership of these troubles is the beginning of the road to overcoming and gaining mastery over trouble. Even when the trouble will stay with you for your entire life.I highly recommend this movie. Beautifully acted, well put together, extraordinary movie on a topic that is rarely the chosen theme, and even rarer yet, portrayed properly and vividly.May Jesus Christ, whom personifies all suffering and tears, bless each of you with the strength and the courage to be overcomer's in this life, to know His grace, and to understand why it is a necessary good to declare all out war against your own personal pride.

Crowe gives the performance of his career,"This film, from director Ron Howard, is about real life math genius John Nash (expertly played by Russell Crowe) and his decent into paranoid-schizophrenia. The film works primarily because it comes at us from Nash's point of view so we as the audience are equally shocked to discover that characters that we had seen him interacting with are nothing more than figments of his imagination. Crowe is brilliant in this part, really making what could be an overdone role in the hands of a lesser actor, in to something quite compelling.

John Nash is a genius and he surely has all the ""characteristics""...everything.An obvious genius!

Does it? John Nash is an example that if you want,you can.Despite all the barriers you have to break,you can. Geniuses come rare.And they rarely come alone.Because alone...alone is certain death.The lack of interactivity with other humans is fatal.And we can surely see this here. The power of the heart is stronger than the power of the mind.But they are in a continuos fight.We have to decide who wins. It is a superb movie, and I must say I havent's seen many as good as this. And to the Oscar business...I am really wondering if someone will have the brains to see how good this was. I haven't seen The Lord of the Rings yet.I will next week.And I will decide by myself how many intelligent people are on this world. This movie shows a life that few of us have,and that very few can understand. With the help of his wife,Alicia( Jennifer Connelly) John will be able to defeat his imagination, his imaginary friend Charles(Paul Bettany), Parcer(Ed Harris) and his fear.In life you have to do great sacrifices...being a genius involves more than usual.It is hard.Very hard to fight agianst yourself.But if you are strong,you win!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"good movie, bad accent","A Beautiful Mind would have been flawless if not for oneinconsistenency: Russell Crowe's  accent -- which is straight outof the Mel Gibson School for Hunky Aussie Males Who Want toPlay Complex American Leads. To his credit, Crowe does pull off avery complicated character -- but just barely. John Nash is U.S.born and bred and never really strayed far from his W. Virginiaroots. So why did the filmmakers find it necessary to cast anAustralian lead? Yer guess is as g'das mine, mate. Granted,Russell Crowe was awesome as the soft-spoken detective in L.A.Confidential (keyword 'soft-spoken') and as the outspoken Romanwarrior in Gladiator, but as a complex leading man from a veryprovincial area of the U.S., Crowe misses the mark at times. Atone point, I thought I was hearing Crocodile Dundee speaking at aPrinceton checker match. Where was Kevin Spacey when theproducers were casting Beautiful Mind? Kevin Kline? Or even GuyPearce -- who also is Australian but can affect a flawless U.S.accent (ala Memento)?

A Beautiful Film,"I knew roughly what to expect from this film just from hearing other's reviews about it. What I didn't expect was the dipping and diving as the plot took me from one emotion to another. This is really a film that deserves the credit it gets. It is pretty much as good a film could be before it becomes one of those artistic cult classics due to it's historical significance/novel storyline/first-of-it's-kind creative venture. It's not quite Shawshank or Apocalypse Now or The Matrix, nor is it trying to be, but it's the very cream of the next tier down. If you've seen The Imitation Game, or The Da Vinci Code, or The Theory of Everything, it's that sort of a movie, it reminds me of those beautiful stories done beautifully.In short it's a story of genius. As for the ride, yes I didn't expect so many tears, or smiles, or frustrations, or even LOLs. I also did a bit of research on John Nash afterwards, which I'd recommend doing to put things into perspective, especially if you're interested in Mental Health. How we used to treat these conditions in the past is truly the stuff of nightmares, and similar to The Imitation Game, it will leave you reeling and ashamed.....but is there a beautiful, happy ending....?....you'll have to find out won't you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Some interesting issues raised,"I enjoyed the film but thought that the makeup jobs could have done with a bit more work (especially Nash's wife at the end - how fake did that look?).Something which I feel people have missed out on commenting on is the way that the secret agents are depicted. After reading Patrick Radden Keefe's book, ""Chatter"" the author gives an insight into the workings of the 'secret agencies' such as the NSA, CIA etc. The author goes on to tell us the difficulties of finding out information and that many people he interviews try to hide the fact that the workings of these agencies exist at all. It seems to gives 'us' an uncertainty as to whether we are being monitored, being surveyed on? by the outside world or is it just paranoia?I like the way Beautiful mind shows Nash continually looking for threats, not being safe in the knowledge that he holds a secret.But, although we find out that Nash is someone with a mental condition, i'm sure these worries do affect the 'real' people who work in the Cyrpto departments. It must be a challenge to keep things secret and not be able to comment on the line of their work with their family.Beautiful mind raises these issues nicely which i'm sure, in reality, do exist for some.The numbers are an interesting part of the film and for me as an art student it is interesting to see Nash go into cracking mode by filtering out the unwanted numbers and focusing on the connections between them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Superior and not at all what you think.,"Insanity and utter genius are so closely related that it is sometimes difficult to see where one ends and the other begins. John Nash was clearly both.Nash thought he would be able to ""solve the problem,"" and find a form of cure for his disorder. But clearly if he was to medicate, he'd lose his gift. I agree with Nash: the gift is better to accept with the insanity then to accept the cure and lose the gift.I truly expected this movie to be a ""spy"" movie. And as one other reviewer has pointed out, this isn't, and yet in a way is a spy movie. Albeit the spooks are only in Nash's mind.I recommend this film to anyone, including those who don't like Russell Crowe.

Now, I can say that I don't dislike Crowe, but rather had a distaste for Gladiator.If you liked this film, do yourself a favor and go rent ""Pi,"" these movies compliment each other and are worthy of being seen.Out of 10, I give ""A Beautiful Mind"" a 6, marking it as a superior product.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The direction was totally manipulative.  Only the acting, (which was still a bit of the showy ""give me an Oscar"" variety by Crow) kept me with this film.  The Sixth Sense plot line was predictable, and the staging was awkward.

"It's good, but not worthy of Best Picture.","'A Beautiful Mind' IS a good movie.  The acting is quite good, the story itself is ho-hum, but it just doesn't have what it takes to be a Best Picture.I have to admit that I was pretty impressed with Russell Crowe's performance.  I might just have to go all the way and say that I wouldn't have been upset if he would have won that Oscar.  He did a terrific job; he let his emotions flow, didn't seem to annoy me...no complaints here.  Okay, I have a complaint.  I did not agree with the casting of Jennifer Connelly. Am I truly the only one that thought that her role was extremely small?  I mean she just didn't have that big of a part.  She won her Oscar for some reason, not really sure why.  Ed Harris was alright.  He wasn't anything spectacular, but he certainly was better than Connelly.  I can't really remember any of the other actors just because they were all males, plus they looked somewhat similar to each other.I'm not too thrilled with the story itself.  I had never even heard of John Nash before.  It seemed interesting, but then boring after a while, then it picked up, but became tiresome again.  It was a bit long, so I was somewhat relieved when it finally did come to an end.Okay, 'A Beautiful Mind' is good, but it did not deserve to be named Best Picture of the year.  I'm not sure that I would have even thought to put it in the nomination category.  The thing is is that Ron Howard did a wonderful job.  I'm a big fan of Howard; loved him for years.  He's an amazing director and his direction of the film is handled so well, but for some reason the movie just did not deserve that award.  He, however, did deserve his long awaited Oscar as it was rightfully awarded.

Very confusing movie ..,"Confused between having to give it a very low rating or a very high one and with hundreds of reviews written before mine, I still want to make a few points. Maybe it would help out someone:1- Biographically: I've read that the real John Nash had an entirely different story. Please tell me would you take the history and life of a man and change it entirely, deceiving a lot of people and mutilating history to make a movie ?! Couldn't you change the names and say that it was ""inspired"" bu a true story ?! Was it that hard or was it not at appealing and interesting ?! So I agree with everyone out here bashing out this movie for being that inaccurate and deceiving.2- Regarding the fictional love story: it was a little real. When you love someone with all your heart and senses, Hollywood -in a lot of other movies- would be selling you lies. The reality is that even the most romantic couples with the most beautiful love stories ever suffer a lot, fight but stick around. So, it was to some degree realistic.3- Regarding the mental illness:Some people here say it was very unrealistic and a fairy tale. Those people didn't pay enough attention to a lot of details in the movie like the baby who would drown or the people making fun of the professor. So I disagree, it showed much truth, although not in every aspect.There's a very important aspect that was very disrespected in the movie: the Psychiatrist's image and the medications, which I overlooked because that might be the case with some of the patients who weren't taught how medications would help or have had experiences with bad psychiatrists.A point I found ridiculous and offensive to a great extent, however, was how mental illnesses were portrayed as if a patient with some strong will would overcome them without hospitalization, psychiatric help or medication, just his ""heart"" as pointed by the wife in the movie. This was utterly stupid, this is a disease who sick people should be taught how to cope with, or in other words, a state of mind that you have to learn to live with.However, there's a very important aspect clarified here: disorders are not things you have to get rid of or cure, rather than states of mind or in other words, chronic cases, medication should help in some cases, therapy would help greatly too in a lot of cases, and you have to cope with it. Pain makes the most beautiful and the wisest people as I have seen in my life, especially mental and psychological pain, and if the patient/individual knew how to learn from it.4- Technical Details: The acting was marvelous and the soundtrack stood out. The direction overall could have been a little better and of course, the writing is really criticized for all the deception.Overall, a movie recommended and shows a lot of reality for some people, but is a sorrow to see it transform true people's stories into fabrications.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

A Beautiful and Intelligent Film,"A BEAUTIFUL MINDSTARRING: RUSSELL CROWE, ED HARRIS, JENNIFER CONNELLY, CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER AND PAUL BETTANY""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of the best films from 2001. It already has 8 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe and Best Supporting Actress for Jennifer Connelly.   Russell Crowe is an intelligent actor and knows how to act in great films. This is his 4th Oscar Nomination; others include nominations from ""L.A. Confidental"",""The Insider"" and ""Gladiator"" which is the only Oscar he won for. I apparently thought his performance was extradionary and that he will possibly get the Oscar. He played John Nash in the film, a Math Genius who is diagnosed as paranoid-schizophrenic. He goes on to win a Nobel Prize for his game theory.Jennifer Connelly plays Alicia Nash, Nash's wife (isn't it obvious). She tries so much to get through to Nash in the film so many times. She really had to go through a lot in her life as his wife, but she pulled through and that i really find great. Connelly did a good job and all but she sometimes bothers me because she is very gaunt;however, she is extremely pretty and you can't push that away.Ed Harris plays Parcher in the film. He has an excellent role in the film and he plays it very well. The film itself stands as one of the best for 2001 and a very unforgettable film. It really deserves some of the Oscars it was nominated for.My Rating: ****1/2 stars out of *****.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

I love it!,"Russell Crowe's performance was impressive in the movie. What stood out to me was the subtleties, like twitches and lack of eye contact. Crowe has a commanding presence on screen that reminds me of Denzel Washington's performances. The movie had a good pace and covered an entire man's life in 135 minutes without losing my attention. The supporting cast was great, with Jennifer Connelly as Nash's wife being incredible. Ed Harris, Josh Lucas, and Christopher Plummer all did well too. While this movie wasn't one of Deakins' iconic works, some of the images were still memorable, like the first time John Nash was in the secret lab. Overall, it was a solid biopic with great pacing and a strong cast complementing Crowe's performance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Some wonderful Crowe and Howard,"A wonderful movie that counts us the great history of the prize Nobel John Nash and their fight against the schizophrenia and one of the best movies of Ron Howard!!!. A history that Howard directs and he counts us the history in a simple but at the same time sublime way, a brilliant one"" biography "" that makes us understand the character (with the help of the touching intervention of Russell Crowe) and like he goes being able to make in front of their fight against their mental illness.I am surprised as Howard plays with the inability of distinguishing the real of the unreal of Nash and it is able to make us believe that the main character hallucinations are real and then he gives us the surprise that it is totally the opposite. A movie that is so majestic that I don't have words to define it. I love the way in that the whole plot is developed; as Nash, thanks to their willpower and the support and their wife's love, it is able to overcome the great problem that it comes him torturing in the whole history. A splendid sound band that accompanies and it supplements perfectly with a real history and with a good atmosphere and screenplay.The part of the interpretations neither should spend for high in this history they are already of the best that I have seen, as that of Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer.... and mainly the special interpretation of Russell Crowe (For my it is the best interpretation in his career like actor) that it gives a tremendous air of realism to the character as if the one was the own John Nash.

Wow - really Russell should have won!,"I have seen a lot of movies in my time, but this movie just took me by storm. Its uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation was a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood blockbuster. This movie provided a brilliant (pardon the pun) insight into many aspects of a genius at work.This movie touched me on many levels. The psychology of the movie was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually realistic from my own experience, and the icing on the cake making the movie stand out was surprisingly the humanistic side of Love. While love is a common basis in most movies, the interaction of this theme with other aspects of the plot was planned phenomenlly.As for the cast, I have never noticed the actual difference in skill between many actors/actresses before. I like Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise etc, but I wouldn't be able to pinpoint a classic actor's performance. But Russell Crowe in this film showed me what it was like to act in a way where I was in awe of his skill in playing this character, especially when considering the extreme difference from characters in his other movies such as the Gladiator and The Insider. Russell Crowe was one of the big reasons this movie was so brilliant. Added to that the stellar performances of Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Adam Goldberg, and this made for the 'perfect' movie.A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original, intelligent and entertaining movie I have ever seen. And this from a movie I didn't expect big things from. Kudos to Ron Howard, the cast and the crew of this movie.

beautiful but 2001's best?,"Although I was not very familiar with the history of John Nash, the man whose life this picture is based on, I did find the story compelling and the acting very good indeed. However if this was the best film of 2001 then it certainly was a mediocre year for movies. Yes the ending was moving but in a melodramatic movie-of-week sort of way. Jennifer Connelly gives a superb performance and she adds depth to her role as the stoic supportive wife. We can see her fear grow as the evidence mounts against her husband. Through her frustration the audience gets a sense of how hard it would be to stand by someone with that kind of illness. This makes the payoff at the end all the more sweet. But the fact that Nash's life story was cleaned up for the big screen does unfortunately detract from the movie. One can almost feel the focus groups and marketing surveys determining how the film will finally play out. This is a shame because of the remarkable and convincing way the audience is set-up to discover that Nash suffers from schizophrenia. If the film had gone on past the point where it ended I think it would have scored a bullseye. Because even without knowing that certain parts of Nash's life were left out, I still wondered if he really said the things he said when he gave his speech. The fact that the film ends where it does already seemed to make it just a little too much Hollywood. That parts of his life were left out to make the picture more ""commercial"" makes me wonder if other parts were over emphasized for dramatic effect. This takes a good film down a notch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"A beautiful, inspiring film","A beautiful,insightful and very moving film which is a joy to watch. The script and direction are superb and the film zips along at a 'page-turning' rate which will continually have you asking 'what happens next' as it is a rolled up thriller, love story and biography in one. For me, it was also a revelation in terms of Russell Crowe as an actor. I had admired his playing in 'Gladiator' and thought he was good fun to watch in 'Master and Commander' (while, on the other hand, I had thought his 'Robein Hood' was a disaster and a waste of talent all round - not least for including the usually marvellous Cate Blanchett in its proceedings as well!) In this film, though, Crowe is a revelation and shows some of the best movie screen acting I have ever witnessed. His portrayal of the lead character is achingly beautiful, with many high points (culminating in his 'Nobel Acceptance Speech' which had me on the verge of tears!)

You get Russel Crowe in A Beautiful Mind a.k.a. John Nash, a brilliant mathmetician that keeps seeing (dead anyone?:-) people around him. Although I didn't agree with last year's oscarwinning role in Gladiator, I do believe that A Beautiful Mind gives Crowe the stage where he shows his acting ability to the highest level seen in recent years. The movie is a delightful adaptation from the original biography, althought it must be said that most facts have been interpreted ""politically correct"", unfortunately leaving out lesser flattering, but imperative facts about the life of John Nash.Jennifer Connelly, playing the role of supporting partner to a lesser fortunate soul, gives another great performance after gems like Requiem for a Dream & Pollock. Although she didn't convince me of the fact that she was a brilliant mathmetician, she did play the role of supporting half to the utmost possible level. Her beauty is unparallelled in recent years by any other actress, and even at the end of the movie when she's transformed into an older lady, all the make-up in the world couldn't make her lesser attractive!Ron Howard delivers a moving, mindbuggling bioepic that will have a profound effect on anyone that will come across it.

A good story about schizophrenia,"A Beautiful Mind, is not a movie about the life of John Nash or about a mathematical genius. It is about a person whose schizophrenia gets worse and worse and how he overcomes it.To label it as a story of John Nash, portrayed here by Russell Crowe, is inaccurate.  Much of the unsavory parts of his life has been edited out and other parts has been changed.  This is all to make him a character whose only flaw is his sickness, which is also something the filmmaker wants the people to sympathize with.  Plus, many characters seem to be invented so that it will easily fill the story.  Watching the film at first, and then finding out his true life, you feel as if have been conned by the filmmakers.  I think if they dealt with all aspects of his life, likeable or not, his character would have been more real, and it would have made a fuller and more complex film.The mathematics aspects of the film seems to be glossed over much like window dressing, all to display his abstract genius mind without delving into anything deep and truly explaining the complexities of it.  When I was watching the film and saw the numbers being highlighted, I thought this was a pathetic joke, something like math for dummies, a picturisque coffee table version.  Eventually you realize the movie has nothing to do with mathematics.  In some aspect, I was disappointed by it.The film's true focus is on his sickness, including all the delusions he has, his treatments and all the effects it had on him, his temptation to go back to his old exciting self and eventually his will to fight the battle on his own.  It all makes for a emotional drama, although it is one that is heavily sugar coated by Hollywood.Russell Crowe performed remarkably in this film.  He was always a versatile actor, with a great performance in The Insider.  If it was not for the mysterious Oscar that he got for The Gladiator, he surely would have won one for this.  As for the Oscar that Ron Howard and the film got, it is questionable since the film was not groundbreaking.  I guess that is why films like this gets Ron the Oscars and Mulholland Drive gets David Lynch the award at Cannes.In all, recommended, given that one take it as a film about a man's fight with his sickness and nothing more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Genius,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of those projects that would look like a hard sell to a producer upon close examination. Think about its premise: the story of the co-recipient of the Nobel prize for economics in 1994, a mathematical genius who was nearly overlooked because he was a paranoid schizophrenic. There is no doubt that Ron Howard and Russell Crowe's involvement was crucial to the film's coming to pass, but before one frame was shot, someone had to say ""yes."" Sylvia Nasar, upon whose novel the screenplay is based, must have been as surprised as anyone when producers Brian Grazer and Ron Howard came calling.This is the kind of story that wouldn't seem to lend itself to film narrative-it may not have had it not been for Akiva Goldsman and Howard's approach to the material. They leave out details of John Nash's life, glamorize people and events, all in the name of creating the best film possible. The difficulty in adapting Nasar's novel was that so much of the story goes on in Nash's head. Goldsman's script is one of the best I've ever seen put to film. It's part human drama, part perception-tampering psychological thriller. Another challenge is Nash himself. By now it's well known that the man had an awful personality. Goldsman doesn't shy away from this, but turns it to the movie's advantage. Crowe's remarkable performance as Nash is heartbreaking. The man is obviously a very dedicated mathematician, with all these ideas, but doesn't have the disposition to get them across. He's his own worst enemy.The actual love story between Nash and his wife is altered, again, for the purposes of making the Nash character at all likeable. Nash had a son with Eleanor Stier before he ever met Alicia Larde. He never married Eleanor, who reportedly wished he would, but married Alicia. She divorced him in 1963 but did keep him from returning to a mental institution and stood by him while he fought his mental illness. The two were re-married recently.Any inaccuracies or liberties taken have been excused by phrases attached to ""Beautiful Mind"" such as inspired by' or based on.' This film has critics scoffing over the way it oversimplifies Nash's ordeal, and yet those same critics turn around and unanimously bestow it with Best Picture nominations and awards, Top Ten list entries, praise for Goldsman, Howard, Crowe, and Jennifer Connelly. They need to remember that if Howard and company were for some reason forced to depict the events of Nash's life more truthfully, ""Mind"" never would have been made or worse, it would have been an inferior film. The industry needs more pictures like this one. Not that anyone in Hollywood cares what critics think anyhow.Look for ""A Beautiful Mind"" to earn Crowe his second straight Oscar. Wins for Connelly and Goldsman are also likely. A shame, though, that Roger Deakins has been getting such well-deserved attention for his cinematography on ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" his work on this film may be overlooked.Grade: A",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

This is a dignified, tender, sympathetic portrait of a genius, a true genius. I've always known that genius is a person who can see the answer before the question, and this is perfectly exemplified and shown by Ron Howard. When Nash sees mathematical equations in the prisms of light from drinking glasses that match with a bad tie, to the long shadows cast by glasses forming columns of groups, to the movement and replacement of certain women in the bar, John Nash sees his answer. It's all there in front of him.Ron Howard created a classic in this film.This is a tender and accurate portrait of a genius, and a moving portrait of a schizophrenic. Beautiful film.

Follows the tradition of the mental illness genre but Russell Crowe elevates the film to a new level,"An ordinary mental illness genre film would have dissolved into the typical paint by numbers rule in which the lead actor adequately performs his role and his problems are understood only by the audience.  A Beautiful Mind follows the rule that only the audience and his wife can sympathize with the mental patient but it develops into something more because of the difficulty and depth of Russell Crowe's performance.  Do you remember the small but poignant scene where John Nash attempted to hold his newborn son in the rocking chair?  It was a simple scene that wouldn't be difficult for an actor but the facial expressions and look of pain in Crowe's eyes elevated it to a new level.  Say what you want about Crowe and his real-life shenanigans but be open to the idea that liking him as an actor should be more about how he performs in his roles and less about condemnation of his bad-boy persona.It is a shame that Crowe performed better this year than the always dependable and Oscar-deserving Denzel Washington (He should have won for Malcolm X in 1992) and became virtually the only nominee from A Beautiful Mind who lost the chance to grace the podium.  After all, Jennifer Connelly simply played the conventional role of the young wife who understands but has difficulty dealing with her husband's condition.  Connelly fared better in the little-seen but unforgettable film Requiem for a Dream.  Ron Howard's directorial award was somewhat overblown when you realize that Robert Altman had to skillfully handle 20+ speaking parts in Gosford Park and he did it wonderfully without breaking a sweat.  And perhaps it's just me but can anyone else not forget that Ron Howard once direct Elijah Wood in that pathetic movie North?A Beautiful Mind is the kind of film that you'll remember 20 years down the road but less for the conventional plot and more for what Russell Crowe brought to the role.  The comparison to Rain Man is justified here because that was a movie where your likely to forget the road trip shared by Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) and his brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) and more likely to remember how Dustin Hoffman had to have maple syrup with his pancakes and only wore K-Mart underwear.  Rain Man also lacked a viable plot but movies within the mental patient genre are not meant to focus on plots but on patients.  In that sense the so-called boring storyline of A Beautiful Mind is forgivable because much more beautiful than the Nash speech at the end is the way that Russell Crowe's eyes express the feelings that his mouth cannot speak.9/10 (The best performance by an actor since Denzel Washington in Malcolm X)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

But in third act, when the Nash gets old, the film goes like a conventional tear-jerker Hollywood schmaltz. Based on the book, the screenplay is very well written by Akiva Goldsman. The film does not entirely follows Dr. Nash's life and times, and did took some creative liberties showcasing his life. Also, I wanted to see a bit more of Nash's work – the film barely touches that.Cinematographer Roger Deakins and composer James Horner contributed amazingly to the film. Editing in between the middle is slightly slow in pace, but I am nit-picking here. The man of the show is Russell Crowe. He brings great sense of humanity and emotions to his portrayal of John Nash. His body language, his dialog delivery is so effortless that you really think that he is John Nash. Jennifer Connelly also did a great job portraying Nash's loving wife. She was pitch perfect in many scenes, and perhaps her role itself defines the word 'Supporting'.A Beautiful Mind is a well made film with wonderful performances. Although flawed, it is a film that will be remembered for Russell Crowe's beautiful performance. The film is a must watch, but it is certainly not a masterpiece.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Mesmerizing!,"Another great film for Russell Crowe and Ron Howard. Crowe is such a powerful presence on the screen. He just commands your attention. As John Nash mumbles through complex math theories, the entire audience is just spellbound. I am quite sure most of us don't have a clue as to what he was saying, it didn't matter. Being said by Russell Crowe is enough for us to know it matters. Very few actors have ever been able to do that, Brando comes to mind. The pleasant surprise from the movie was the script itself. I have heard the buzz for Crowe, and for Connelly...both deservedly so. But, I have not heard much about the power and humor of the script. Akiva Goldsman did a great job, as adapting books is hopefully becoming a specialty (Sum of All Fears is next). The Oscar buzz is not just hype, this is a serious contender for Crowe, Connelly, picture, adapted screenplay, and possibly director, although our buddy Ron is up against some tough customers this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

A Beautiful Mind: 8/10,"At the 2001 Academy Awards, A Beautiful Mind got four Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Screenplay from Another Medium. It well deserved all of them.Russell Crowe is John Forbes Nash. He's an acclaimed mathematician. He reluctantly teaches a class at Princeton, where he meets Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). It doesn't take a genius to know that they get married. However, what Alicia, and John, don't know is that John is a schizophrenic. His life soon turns to shambles as he tries to piece together what's real in his life and what's not.It could only be Ron Howard who could make this believable. Of course, the story of John Nash is unbelievable, but it could be played with such unnatural pathos, making the story too silly to be likeable. Howard, however, could turn this into a compelling drama that you'll enjoy sitting through. The over-two-hour runtime seems to fly by. A Beautiful Mind has about everything a drama needs: palpable drama, romance, a few tense scenes, and even a little humor. Not much, but a little.The slow camera movements added to the general creepiness. Such as the clichéd use of little girls with big eyes to add tension, the creeping camera brought out the feel of the picture that is very tangible. If you just take an ordinary `drama', you can't connect to any of the characters. Howard, along with screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, made Nash a likeable character, even from his asocial and agoraphobic tendencies from the beginning of the film.James Horner created great music for this film. It's actually a soundtrack that I'm thinking of purchasing; he got robbed at the Oscars.Goldsman's script was so masterfully written. It seems like he could become an object to behold soon in the future. It seemed, however, like he wanted each line to be a memorable one that everyone in the future would remember. Although some of them may be, it was a turn off (but one of the few from the film). I think that Howard and Goldsman can become a worthy team soon on.Crowe did a better job here than in other movies, such as Gladiator. His genuine fear was very well displayed, though I don't think he got cheated at the Oscars. Connelly (who looked a lot like Andie McDowell to me) was also quite good, but, personally, didn't deserve her Oscar. Ed Harris, I think, did the best performance in the film as an FBI man, William Parcher. I could really feel for these characters, they did an excellent job as a whole.There's not much more to say, it was a great movie that everyone should see.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for intense thematic material, sexual content and a scene of violence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Incomplete but effective biography,"Ron Howard directs this admittedly incomplete biography of mathematician John Forbes Nash (Russell Crowe), from his years at Princeton, to his descent into madness and his recovery. Crowe does great work, though his fidgeting is difficult to watch at times, and Connelly, Bettany and Harris support him perfectly. Unlike most biographies, the movie doesn't come off as a series of vignettes from the subject's life, it's all tied together very nicely and cleanly. It's a fascinating story, no matter how much of it was left out, though it may not be Best Picture material, but then few movies are.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
wish I had seen the movie before I read the book,"I loved the biography written by Sylvia Nasar and I must say that the screenplay could have trusted the audience with more of the complex story written in this work. I liked the visual approach of the movie giving us an insight that was not available in the book, a novel perspective and an interesting solution, but I think that, as it was stated in the New York Times, the audience could have been trusted with the complexity of the situation. The portrayal of Nasar is so much more intense, and some much more realistic. I liked the movie, but would recommend that anybody who sees it read the real thing afterwards in a wonderfully written biography that shows you that life with a genious, with madness, with a mad academic world and in a paranoid era was very very far from the hollywood treatment of it. The acting by Crowe and the visual idea of getting us into that world was wonderful, but I hope that there is in the future more trust that an audience can deal with much more complexity. Read the New York time review, it really hits the mark.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Engrossing film,"This is an outstanding motion picture telling the powerful story of the rise & fall, then subsequent triumphant rise again of Dr. John Nash. Russell Crowe is outstanding as the compelling lead. Film is visually stunning throughout as it covers over 40 years of Nash's amazing brilliant and often tragic life; a sincere tribute to a genuinely unique and interesting life struggle. Jennifer Connelly delivers a memorable performance as well giving brave portrayal of Nash's wife, which earned her a well-deserved Oscar in the female lead category. Yet the major credit for this well-crafted motion picture is the inventive collaboration of director Ron Howard's vision with the skilled production talents of Brian Grazer who took home Oscar that same year for Best Director and Best Picture respectively. Through their collective efforts they utilized Akiva Goldsman's Oscar winning screenplay in a clever and imaginative way to transform this sympathetic yet complex story into a delightful, pleasing to the eye treat that will engage all that screen this powerful biography of a brilliant yet flawed professor.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Amazing!,"I thought this film was absolutely brilliant, with all the actors fitting their roles perfectly. Crowe is phenomenal, you really see how hard it hurts him to find out although his mind is his best asset it is also his worst enemy. Seeing the struggle as he tries to fight it even though it's so hard is heartbreaking, and you see it's killing him to not be able to work as he wants to be recognised and have his own accomplishments. Supporting actors help pull the whole story together, Jennifer Connelly in particular I thought this was one of the best roles I've seen her in, she seems to embody the way the characters wife would feel if it was to happen to her, going through all these different emotions yet still wanting to stick by her husband through it all as it isn't his fault. Ed Harris is also a great supporting actor in this film, fitting the profile so well that you actually find it hard to believe it's all in Crowe's characters head. Many of the cast could have a mention.I have only seen this film a few times yet every time it still amazes me and gives me goosebumps, an amazing movie, heavily recommended by me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A towering achievement cinematic ally, biographically, and historically.","With this film Russell Crowe dispels any doubt that his Oscar for Gladiator was deserved. Had Crowe not alienated the entire Hollywood community with his sullen and belligerent manner in the months leading up to voting, he would have won the Best Actor statue for a second time. And while this is a tragedy of Crowe's own doing, it does not eclipse the satisfaction of Ron Howard finally getting his statue for Best Director.This is a true story that is sometimes a little taxing to watch, and the dizzying contrast between high and low is something that is only poorly attempted by the likes of contemporaries such as Vanilla Sky.Speaking of contrast, naysayers who panned Russell as wooden and two-dimensional in Gladiator will have to eat those words as he renders this complex turn that is filled with both vulnerability and hubris, elation and pathos, genius and madness. After all, that's why they call it acting, which Crowe has more than proved he can do.There isn't a weak performance in the cast, and the only danger is that Crowe has peaked too high too soon, a'la, say Richard Dreyfuss, or, *gasp* Anna Paquin (Hollywood's most underrated young beauty) and even *double gasp*, Tatum O'Neal, and although nobody can accuse Crowe of being an overnight success, performances like this one make us hope he isn't spent any time soon.The first half of the movie is lyrically beautiful, in which Crowe ascends the throne of the mathematics intelligentsia, meeting his exquisite wife, played beautifully and as a full peer to Crowe by Jennifer Connelly who won a well-deserved Oscar. The second half is, without spoiling it for you, the best suspense you will see since The Sixth Sense. In the end, it wraps up nicely with a bow, and to those whose reviews pretentiously claimed to find the story unbelievable, I can only add, this being a true story, that fact is always stranger than fiction.Much is left out of Nash's back story, like, among many other things, that he had pronounced homosexual tendencies, and we are never quite given any satisfactory explanation for his descent into madness. Nevertheless, A Beautiful Mind is a towering achievement cinematically, biographically, and historically.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

A Beautiful Mind - A Beautiful Movie,"""A Beautiful Mind"" took home four major Academy Awards for 2001. It deservedly won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress and Best Screenplay (Adaptation).It is the story of John Nash who is a brilliant mathematician whose life becomes a nightmare when he descends into the scary and uncertain world of a paranoid schizophrenic. Producer Brian Grazer, Director Ron Howard and Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman show us the world of a schizophrenic from the patient's point of view as Nash's world alternates between reality and and imagined reality. The audience shares his suffering and also does not know what situations and /or characters are real or imagined.Russell Crowe, in an outstanding performance, plays Nash with conviction and believability. Jennifer Connelly is his long-suffering wife Alicia who sticks with him and provides the support he so desperately needs. Christopher Plummer plays Dr. Rosen the psychiatrist who tries to help Nash. Ed Harris is excellent as Nash's contact in the Defence Department where Nash works de-coding hidden messages..or does he? Paul Bettany is Martin Hansen Nash's college roommate and Vivien Cardone his niece who Nash turns to for comfort. Adam Goldberg and Anthony Rapp are two of Nash's college classmates who he also meets from time to time over the years and who help Alicia in coping with Nash's behavior.

A Heart-Wrenching Masterpiece,"Schindler's List, directed by Steven Spielberg and released in 1993, is a cinematic masterpiece that stands as a hauntingly powerful testament to the Holocaust. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand Polish-Jewish refugees during World War II, the film is a heartbreaking and unforgettable portrayal of the Holocaust's horrors, human resilience, and one man's extraordinary act of compassion. Spanning over three hours, this black-and-white epic leaves an indelible mark on its viewers.The film's visual style, presented in stark black and white, evokes a sense of historical authenticity and a tone of somber reflection. The absence of color intensifies the raw emotions and stark realities the characters face. Spielberg's decision to shoot the film in this manner creates a harrowing and visceral experience that immerses the audience in the bleakness of the Holocaust era.The casting of Schindler's List is exceptional, with Liam Neeson delivering a remarkable performance as Oskar Schindler. Neeson portrays Schindler as a complex character, a charming and opportunistic businessman who undergoes a profound transformation. His journey from a self-serving capitalist to a selfless savior is palpable, and Neeson's portrayal captures the essence of Schindler's moral awakening. Ralph Fiennes, playing the ruthless Amon Göth, also delivers an unforgettable performance. His portrayal of the sadistic Nazi officer is chilling and disturbing, making Göth one of the most terrifying villains in cinematic history.The supporting cast is equally compelling, with standout performances by Ben Kingsley as Schindler's right-hand man, Itzhak Stern, and Embeth Davidtz as Helen Hirsch, a Jewish maid in Göth's household. These characters and their interactions provide depth and nuance to the narrative, highlighting the multifaceted relationships that develop amidst the horrors of the Holocaust.One of the most striking aspects of Schindler's List is its unflinching portrayal of the Holocaust's brutality. The film does not shy away from depicting the dehumanizing conditions in concentration camps, the mass murders, and the atrocities committed by the Nazis. It forces the viewer to confront the unspeakable horrors that occurred during this dark chapter of history. Spielberg's commitment to historical accuracy and his refusal to sugarcoat the events make the film an essential educational tool, ensuring that the memory of the Holocaust is not forgotten.The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is breathtaking, with carefully composed shots and an expert use of light and shadow. Kaminski's camera work accentuates the emotional weight of each scene, whether it's the juxtaposition of Schindler's wealth and the misery of the Jewish prisoners or the stark images of the concentration camps. The haunting, minimalist score by John Williams complements the visuals, adding a layer of melancholy that lingers long after the film's conclusion.The screenplay, written by Steven Zaillian, is a poignant adaptation of Thomas Keneally's book, ""Schindler's Ark."" It successfully weaves a complex narrative, chronicling Schindler's transformation, the evolving dynamics between characters, and the larger historical context. The script captures the essence of the Holocaust and the individual stories within it, emphasizing the significance of each life saved by Schindler.The film's pacing, despite its over three-hour runtime, is remarkably engaging. Spielberg manages to maintain the audience's attention throughout, using a combination of tension, emotion, and storytelling to propel the narrative forward. The film's episodic structure, with moments of despair and hope interwoven, adds depth to the storytelling and reinforces the film's message.Schindler's List is not just a Holocaust drama; it's a testament to the power of one person to make a difference. Oskar Schindler's heroism, juxtaposed against the backdrop of unimaginable suffering, serves as a beacon of hope. It reminds us that even in the darkest times, compassion and the refusal to remain indifferent can change lives.The film's final scenes are particularly poignant, featuring the real-life Schindlerjuden (Schindler's Jews) and their descendants paying homage at Oskar Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. This powerful conclusion reinforces the film's message of remembrance and gratitude, urging viewers to acknowledge the past and honor those who risked everything to save lives.Schindler's List has received widespread critical acclaim and numerous awards, including seven Academy Awards. Its impact on popular culture and education is immeasurable. The film serves as a historical document, an emotional journey, and a stark reminder of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust. It compels viewers to reflect on humanity's capacity for both evil and goodness, leaving an enduring imprint on their hearts and minds.In conclusion, Schindler's List is a cinematic triumph that remains an essential work of art and a vital historical record. It combines powerful performances, masterful direction, and a haunting visual style to create a profoundly moving and unforgettable portrayal of the Holocaust. The film's commitment to authenticity, emotional depth, and historical accuracy make it a must-watch for those seeking to better understand the depths of human suffering and the potential for redemption in the face of evil. Schindler's List is not merely a film; it is a haunting, emotional, and transformative experience that transcends the boundaries of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A simplistic mind...,"As a movie, A Beautiful Mind works well enough - in fact, it comes off as a standard Hollywood ""man meets adversity and conquers it with the support of a loyal woman"" film.Watching it though, I couldn't help feeling that a complex life had been simplified and ironed out to fit that standard mold.  What do we know of the real man behind the film, at the end?  Do we get any sense of the complexity of his achievements, or of his problems?  If I were to believe this movie, I would believe that Nash had only one single idea in his life, and a simple (if pervasive) problem to face.Unfortunately, at the end, I'm left with the images of Crowe acting out nervous tics, and Jennifer Connelly playing the impossibly loyal wife.The IMDB info for this film says that ""A number of facts in John Nash's life were intentionally altered for dramatic and commercial reasons"" - unfortunately, so many of them that in the end A Beautiful Mind felt like a lie to me.  Ron Howard got his dramatic and commercial success, but something significant was lost in the translation...",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The Vidiot Reviews...,"A Beautiful MindThe downside to being an extremely intelligent person is not being able to enjoy anything in pop culture.Thankfully, the math prodigy in this drama keeps himself occupied cracking hidden code.After proving his acumen at Princeton, and later at MIT, John Forbes Nash, Jr. (Russell Crowe) is approached by the US Defense Department (Ed Harris) to decipher Russian communiqué concealed in daily newspapers and magazines.Much to the chagrin of his concerned wife (Jennifer Connelly), John becomes obsessed with his top-secret task and the shadowy government agents he insists are out to silence him.Ron Howard's astute but skewed interpretation of the Noble Prize winning economist 's descent into schizophrenia, this adaptation of the renowned novel is masterfully crafted and superbly acted.However, its insistence on formulating a touching love story is strenuous.Incidentally, marriages built on an attraction to each other's mind only works if you're both ugly.Yellow lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A provocative masterpiece of the 00's.,"Well, this is a film which definitely belongs in top 250 IMDb, even in the first 100 if i think right.Why isn't it there, is beyond me.First, the plot is very clever, mind-blowing actually.Then, the actors did a great job, Russell Crowe at his best performance so far if you ask me, I always liked Jennifer Connelly because of her amazing talent in acting, combined with a quite simple, but so rare beauty, as for Ed Harris, well, he's one of my all time favourites.It's true, the film may be a little confusing for some of you, if not most of you, but that's life, not all films go for the money.Seems like nowadays, it's all that matters: money, money, money.It's not about fame and cinematography success anymore, like once was, it's all about the money, and I personally hate this materialism. Well it's not the case here, because A beautiful mind is a very provocative, intelligent drama which may not be receptive to mass public, a possible reason for it's poor rating.I loved the thin line between reality and fantasy, between health and mental illness, line which becomes clearer and clearer as we approach the end, i might say a tragic, but not so tragic one - depending on every ones judgment.Last but not least, what i find of particular importance is the message this drama delivers: when you can't defeat schizophrenia or any other illness, acceptance can be just as comforting as the hope for a miraculous cure.All being said I hope I made my point, A beautiful mind is without a doubt in my mind, the most intense and provocative film of the 00's so far, and i rate it 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A moving experience with beautiful performances,"Russell Crowe gives an incredible performance in an amazingly moving story of a brilliant man beset by mental illness of huge proportions.  I found this to be one of the ten best movies I have ever seen.  Crowe's performance, much of which he credited to Ron Howard's direction in his Best Actor acceptance speech at the Golden Globes, is astonishing in its power and range.  I'm sure that Howard's direction was a factor, but Crowe's talents seem to grow with each role.  The range of emotions, actions and ages he displays in this film are broad and diverse, and Howard's direction appears to be both flawless and visionary.

A Beautiful Film,"After critics' came down hard on his last film (""How the Grinch Stole Christmas""), director Ron Howard comes back with a bang with ""A Beautiful Mind"". Academy voters out there reading this review, listen up! You unfairly snubbed Howard of a Best Director Oscar nomination 6 years ago for his brilliant ""Apollo 13"", and if you decide to snub him of a Best Director nomination this year for ""A Beautiful Mind"", you will be sorry. Howard should be nominated for his directing job on this film because he did a great job. Let me say that again. A GREAT JOB! The film should also get a nod for Best Picture too. It's one of the very best movies of 2001. ""A Beautiful Mind"" tells the true story of John Forbes Nash Jr., a man who is one of the world's greatest mathematicians, and a victim of schizophrenia. From undergraduate days at Princeton to his winning of the Nobel Prize, we follow Nash on a journey that takes him into the far reaches of mathematical discovery, and into a bewildering labyrinth of hallucinations and madness. Russell Crowe brilliantly portrays Nash in what I think is the best performance of his career. He's sure to win another Oscar nomination this year (we'll see if he can duplicate what Tom Hanks did several years ago and that is win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars; Crowe has a very good chance of doing that). A great supporting performance is turned in by Jennifer Connelly as Nash's wife Alicia; she'll get a Best Supporting Actress nomination. These two key performances by Crowe and Connelly make ""A Beautiful Mind"" the great film it is thanks primarily to Howard's direction and Akiva Goldsmith's wonderful screenplay (based on Sylvia Nasar's book). ""A Beautiful Mind"" might give ""Lord of the Rings"" a run for the Oscars come this March. It's a great movie.**** (out of four)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Beautiful,"So soft and touching is A Beautiful mind. It has it sad and scary moments but also has its funny laughing moments. Seeing a world were all you thought was real, was only a dream. Or in John Nash's case, a illusion. Seeing what is really not there and cannot tell between the real and fake, can be a frightening experience. Living in a world were all your work is a lie, can scare you. Living in a world were no one beleives you, can scare you. A Beautiful Mind was indeed Beautiful, it showed a man's love and desire to lead a life with his wife and to do what he is great at. Seeing numbers in everything, is amazing. But ignorning things that taunt you, is miraculos. It is hard and makes me understand, what the disease really is. A genius, cursed with a heavy load. Seeing a FBI agent and solving hard riddles that do not exist is indeed the brink of life. Showing a woman's compassion to help her husband thru this time, is Beautiful. And coming out a victor, is what A Beautiful Mind really is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Like John Nash's, this beautiful mind is flawed...","First, let me be unequivocal...see this film.  Here's the problem I had: Why did Alicia love John Nash so devotedly.  I'm not saying it's incomprehensible, just not explained in this film.  She appears to be a beautiful (does anyone else have a problem getting around Jennifer Connelly's breathtaking beauty in order to fully appreciate her acting?), articulate and, in a word, normal woman.  Why does she so love this twitchy, antisocial ""Rainmathman?""Don't get me wrong.  The character of John Nash, as portrayed by Russell Crowe, is poignant in his brilliance and imperfect humanity.  I don't doubt that Alicia Nash was, in fact, devoted to him...but why?  If the film had answered that question, it would have been more than a bewildering and inspiring insight into the life of an amazing man.  It would have been a wonderful and inspiring story of true love.Having complained about the movie that wasn't, let me say again that the movie that is - is wonderful in its own right.

The story set in many points in time. We see main character growing up and see what he has been through over the years which is remind me of 'Forrest Gump'. It's all about acceptance and loyalty. I don't know anything about this movie before watching it so by the end when they revealed that this is based on a true story of John Nash, a matematician who won a Nobel Prize in 1994 makes love this movie even more.

Both men played well.It is very sharp and terrific to watch a man who fights against his mind with the aid of his mind. Results are very impressive and dramatic. The film also gives messages to ordinary people like us by showing a genius' life story ""We live with our souls and minds, none of them by itself is not enough to live...""

The chance to see the mind of a schizophrenic! WOW!,"I could never have imagined how a person with schizophrenia views the world. I thought that they just heard voices, but I knew nothing about them seeing people.  I was actually very surprised when I realized that `John Nash' brilliantly played by Russell Crowe (Proof of Life, The Insider) has all those imaginary people inside his head.  I believed that the way he was cutting and pasting newspapers and magazines showed how confused his mind was.Last time Brian Grasier produced a movie about someone with a psychiatric disorder was ` As Good as it Gets', a movie that won two Oscars:  one for Jack Nicholson   `Melvin Udal',the obsessive compulsive writer.  The  second Oscar went to Helen Hunt 'Carol Conelly.' the woman that Melvin falls in love with.The movie got much praise from psychiatrists and it is  loved by many people. I love the movie. I have been watching it. It is a well done movie. As a parallel I am hoping that the movie at hand wins many Oscars. I am cheering for all who got nominated, specially Russell Crowe, because he is a very good artist and because I don't believe that the Academy has ever given two Oscars in a roll to a foreign born actor.I love the fact that `Alicia Nash's' played by Jennifer Connelly (Inventing the Abbotts) stayed by her husband's side until he was finally able to live with himself and society. My neighbors are getting the divorce!  This is a true story in every sense of the word.  `A Beautiful Mind' gave me more compassion than I already had for my neighbor who has the disorder. My neighbor used to send  letters to the entire homeowners association talking about how much Big Brother was giving him a hard time. It is amazing! He complained about the side effects of his medication. He has been hospitalized! It is very interesting that Ron Howard gave us the chance to see the mind of a schizophrenic.

"Well acted drama, though more entertaining than informative","The movie about highly skilled mathematician John Forbes Nash first seemed to me, as if it's going to be a mediocre try to show the life of a special, but uninteresting person. Until the great twist, that comes so unexpected it is entertaining, but not very outstanding. Though it really develops to a well-acted movie about the dramatic life of this poor man, and seeing this man being destroyed by himself is so stirring, that boredom soon is replaced by sympathy for Nash and his wife, who suffer badly under the circumstances that nearly destroy his life. Unfortunately the more this movie tries to be dramatic, the more Hollywood kitsch annoys the audience, so people who like happy ends will be satisfied. Beside that, it's a pity that only this special part of his life is shown to the audience, so we get more information about his tragic fate than about himself and his work.Still it is a really good movie about an interesting person, well acted by Russell Crowe, which is worth its money and I can definitely recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
No bad,"At first, I thought that ""Beautiful Mind"" had a plot full of ups and downs, laughter, and tears like ""Beautiful Life"", but after watching it, I realized it wasn't.

I never remember people's names when I watch movies, and today is no exception. It's not that I can't remember, it's that I don't want to remember. In fact, it's a seemingly unattractive soul, a highly intelligent man who has been struggling with himself for a lifetime. He began to have hallucinations when he was young, and the fatal thing was that the objects in the hallucinations were not one person, but three. He is smarter and more introverted than anyone else, but in fact, he is more eager for communication and a way out than anyone else. So he suffocated. These three objects of visual and auditory hallucinations express the three desires in his heart, which should also reflect the three desires in any man's heart.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Try this !!!,"Ron Howard's A Beautiful Mind (2001) is a cinematic triumph that captures the deeply emotional and intellectually complex life of mathematician John Nash. Based on the biography by Sylvia Nasar, the film tells the story of Nash's rise to fame, his struggle with schizophrenia, and his eventual triumph over adversity. It is a compelling exploration of the human mind, mental illness, genius, and love, all wrapped in a narrative that is both gripping and moving.Russell Crowe's portrayal of John Nash is nothing short of brilliant. Crowe dives deeply into the complexity of Nash's character, portraying his eccentricity, brilliance, and vulnerability with remarkable precision. From the young, impetuous Princeton student who struggles to fit in, to the older man grappling with the onset of schizophrenia, Crowe offers a nuanced and layered performance that keeps the audience captivated. His ability to show Nash's intelligence while simultaneously depicting his inner turmoil is one of the film's greatest strengths. Crowe earned a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, and his performance is a cornerstone of the film's success.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"Crowe shines in this otherwise solid, workmanlike biography","Russell Crowe stars in the story (based on real events) of John Forbes Nash Jr, a mathematics genius. In the first third of the film, we learn that Nash is brilliant, intolerant of lazy thinking, and introverted to a fault. ""I don't like other people, and they don't like me"" he remarks. His whole mind is tied to creating a 'truly original idea'. Director Ron Howard (Apollo 13, Ransom) goes to great lengths to show us how revolutionary and cool Nash's ideas are. Thankfully, Nash only explains himself once, and then at a suitably earthy level that everyone can understand.The first half of the film feels like Good Will Hunting crossed with North By Northwest. A math genius plunged into cloak-and-dagger intrigue. Only at the midway point do we learn that there's more in Nash's (and Howard's) Mind than we thought.Howard is the king of the safe, dependable movie you can safely take your parents to see. Nothing challenging, nothing revolutionary, just quality, mainstream entertainment. There's nothing remarkable here, except for another (sigh) revelatory performance from Russell Crowe. There are no great lines, no great scenes, but to watch Crowe react to the outside stimulus to his interior world. Howard draws out Nash's overactive mind through a labyrinth of mathematical notation, but we can see Nash's wheels turning in the eyes of Crowe.Jennifer Connelly (Pollock, Requiem for a Dream), in her highest profile role of her career, is splendid as Nash's wife and only connection to the real world. She is an intelligent, educated woman who loves Nash's heart over his mind. Her character is well-formed on the page, and she plays the conflicts between the heart and mind, the real world and the metaphysical, with grace.Ed Harris is Ed Harris. Always superb (Pollock, Apollo 13), he does a fine job as a G-man doggedly pursuing Nash's genius for the good of the country. In his 1940's spook suit, he looks tough and mean enough to beat up Humphrey Bogart.The movie has the potential to be excellent, but steps back into very good territory in the last third. When making a biopic of a real person (Nash is alive and well) you must choose whether to tell THE story OF a man's life, or A story IN a man's life. Howard tries for both and the movie suffers for it. Once Nash conquers his struggles, the film continues for (what feels like) twenty minutes, covering the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties and Nineties. This incredibly boring section is necessary to get us to a 1994 Nobel Prize nomination, and a completely fictional acceptance speech. The story IN his life was over decades earlier. If Nash were a fictional character, these 20 minutes would never have made the final cut. Howard felt the need (out of respect) to conclude the movie on the best, happiest, and least ambiguous note possible. No doubt can be left in the viewer's mind that everything turned out okay.Crowe shines in this otherwise solid, workmanlike biography. You can always count on Howard for quality product, but it wouldn't hurt the film to trim a little.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Great movie, bad portrayal.","I thoroughly enjoyed A Beautiful Mind. In fact, I would recommend it to anyone, and I often do. But to say this is based on John Nash's life in any way other than the most remote doesn't stack up. The seemingly endless onslaught of love and support put forth by Alicia to present an eloquent story is just that, a story, with no truth to it. They made no mention to the fact that she divorced him almost 30 years prior to his winning of the Nobel Prize. Granted, she did eventually go back to him (they were remarried in 2001, 7 years after the Nobel Prize), but to portray her the way they did is just plain bad form.

With Sensitivity and Passion,"John Forbes Nash, the main character, has a mind of a genius and suffer from paranoid schizophrenia. While a graduate in Princeton in the late 40's, he came up with his own ""governing dynamic"", a game theory - mathematics of competition, and after years of fighting his demons won the Nobel Prize in 1994. And this is a true story! Russell Crowe shows why he's a versatile actor by portraying Nash with sensitivity and passion. Jennifer Connelly did an excellent job as the woman who thought she was married to an eccentric man and did not leave his side after finding out about his illness. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany and Christopher Plummer did a fine job in their supporting role of ""explaining and showing"" the mindset of a schizophrenic. Trying to tell this story is not an easy task yet director Ron Howard did it without resorting to sensationalism. This movie gave me an insight of what a schizophrenic goes through on a daily life; not being able to distinguish between what's real and what's reality is frightening or using one's energy to push away the illusion is exhausting.

Don't live perfunctorily.,"Perhaps genius and neuropathy are only separated by a line. In many cases, the boundaries between them are not very clear, and schizophrenia like ""a beautiful eve"" is in most cases the patent of a person with a high IQ. Movies need dramatic contradictions and conflicts, and a contradictory personality is undoubtedly a good material. For a long time, both movies and TV shows have created a series of similar images to satisfy the audience's voyeuristic desire for the group of highly intelligent businessmen.
But there is no doubt that geniuses are also people, and their human emotions also need to be satisfied. Therefore, most of this type of film will return to human nature after touting genius, and eventually realize the universal significance of the film on its redemption road.""A beautiful eve"" can also be regarded as a discussion of fame and fortune to a certain extent. The opening remark is a heated text in the style of ""Youth China"", so that the future of each motherland present feels that if it has not been opened before death It's shameful to pass. This kind of strong utilitarian suggestion has to say that it has deeply influenced Nash's life trajectory to a great extent, making him eager to become famous, and he is willing to do everything he can, as long as this society affirms him. William Parcher is such an existence. He appeared at a time when Nash was not willing to be kicked by the Pentagon. He made Nash feel valued and met Bole. From then on, he could go straight. This VIP-style treatment undoubtedly excites him and allows his vanity to be unprecedentedly satisfied, although this can also be attributed to the failure of his relationship. So whether he was in school or taking medicine, what he was most afraid of was his wise eyes ""blindness"". This taste is like interrupting the legs of a sportsman. The basics.When you are alive, walking on the road, you are an ordinary person, not an academic elite, not a genius. You live a life as ordinary as others, and you must learn to respect life.The true enemy of genius is genius, the opponent of idiot is idiot, and the person you never want to defeat is actually yourself.

Nash was in fact a Rambler and a Gremlin,"This is an unfaithful edit of my review of this pretty fine movie. by the staff at IMDb:Jennifer Connelly is a shocking and beautiful actress. When my atheist friends tell me "" There is no God"", I say: How do you explain the existence of Jennifer Connelly then? That usually shuts them right up. Jennifer plays "" the wife of"" gifted mathematician John Nash. That's it. That's her role here. Second Banana to Nash, so to speak. John Nash and his wife were both students at Princeton(MIT?) although his future wife wasn't as splashy as he. She wasn't a potted plant-is all I'm saying....Nash was a mathematician of excellence. He pushed the limit of his mind and lost. This movie is a tender-hearted and artful representation of his complex and doofy and gut-wrenching and important life. This game-theorist Nash didn't realize he played a game on himself. How ironic. The game of Insanity is just another game for people who don't know when to quit. Sanity is where you quit your (failed/lost)game of life and move on. End of Story.Insanity is -sometimes-where you ask yourself to be an Intellectual Giant- without mercy or reprieve- when you might be a pretty fine Intellectual Mighty Whale instead. Nash was a fine, flawed person who wished to be Einstein. He must have hated himself unmercifully for having not achieved that. Genetics may have pointed him towards shizophrenia- I'm not an expert on this. Losing a game of Chess can be very hard to take. Nash played ""Go"" instead.I never learned how to lose at Chess. It makes you angry at the universe- if you take it too seriously. It feels like you are being humiliated by The Whole World. In reality, it's okay to fail at a game. John Nash forgot to throw the Monoply board over and start a new game. He killed his own life, by not allowing himself to quit the game:The life-game called Insanity. What a waste. In sum, this movie is good enough for Hollywood. It has a heart. I am glad I saw it. Please read the fine Sylvia Nasar book of the same title. It will thrill you and give you the background for this fairly good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Good, albeit overrated film","Ron Howard admirably put together 2001's Bet Picture `A Beautiful Mind,' the story of Professor John Nash's battle against his schizophrenia. As anyone who has read my reviews knows I tend not too watch too many of these modern, major Hollywood productions and I usually find them to be too slick and with no edge. This fact, along with my general dislike of Russell Crowe had me avoiding this Oscar winner for a while.With all of my personal baggage now set aside, I must admit I enjoyed this film more than I thought I would, and even more surprisingly, I found the best part of the film to be Crowe's convincing portrayal of Nash. The depth and talent that must be utilized in order to convincingly portray mental illness must be staggering. Jennifer Connelly (`Pollock') deservedly earned her Oscar for her heart-felt depiction of Nash's wife, Alicia. The other actor that warrants mentioning is the always brilliant Ed Harris (`Pollock,' `Apollo 13,' `Nixon.') Is it just me or do others feel that if Ed Harris starred in a remake of `Plan 9 from Outer Space' it would warrant Oscar consideration? The man is an amazing talent.The area of this project that seems the most beautiful to me is the combination of Howard's direction, Roger Deakin's (`O' Brother Where Art Thou' `Fargo' `Kundun')cinematography and the editing of Dan Hanley and Michael Hill (editing team on `Apollo 13' and `Backdraft'). The way that this film depicts the inner workings of Nash's mathematical and schizophrenia is wonderfully done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Russell Crowe is simply awesome,I just saw A Beautiful Mind and I must say that Russell Crowe has delivered the finest acting performance that I have seen in a long long time.  How can this be the same man who was the strong leader of Oscar winner Gladiator.Watching him disappear in his characters is simply magic.Undoubtedly the finest actor of our generation.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
