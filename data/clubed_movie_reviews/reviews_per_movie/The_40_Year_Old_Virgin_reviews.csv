Hilarious,"Down to earth, relatable and just plain funny. The 40 Year Old Virgin is a great comedy that is genuinely funny. The movie touches on not just the struggle of the virgin but other relationship issues as well that make the film relatable. Its fun to watch Andy slowly grow into a confident man who is able to find true love. The entire cast is great, especially the supporting friends of Andy, as always Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen do not disappoint!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Breakout film for Carell,"Steve Carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy, first on 'The Daily Show', and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin, Carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle aged man living a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a little odd, but in an awkward nice guy sort of way. One night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially tease Andy about his situation. But it's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that Andy is, and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity. And so begins Andy's quest into adulthood. Andy is the quintessential innocent, and the bulk of the humor derives from his naivet√© to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film. Some of the humor is crude gross out stuff, but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy. In addition, I found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as Andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama; it's a rolling in your seats comedy. Still, every good comedy I have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters. A good comparison would be 'The Wedding Crashers' from earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar humor, but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes. I particularly loved the ending of the film, which I thought was a perfect way to end the flick. Without giving anything away, it reminded me of 'Something About Mary'. Very light and fun; it leaves you laughing and smiling, which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy. I would highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Painfully funny,"Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) is hopelessly single at 40 working as a tech guy at an electronic store. He has no game with the ladies and no experience with sex. His co-workers David (Paul Rudd), Cal (Seth Rogen), and Jay (Romany Malco) reluctantly asks him to join their poker game. During the game, Andy let slip that he has never had sex. The guys make fun of him but then vows to get him laid. They give contradictory and generally bad advise. At a club, he goes home with Nicky (Leslie Mann) who is crazy drunk. Trish (Catherine Keener) comes into the store to buy a VCR. She has a storefront across the street selling other people's stuff on Ebay. Marla (Kat Dennings) is one of her kids. Cal tells him to keep asking questions to be mysterious and that works on bookstore clerk Beth (Elizabeth Banks).There are a lot of awkward hilarity coming from this Judd Apatow comedy. Steve Carell especially with that haircut is perfect for the role. There is nothing more painfully funny than Kelly Clarkson. At its heart, Carell is an adorable dork. The other guys are almost as ridiculous. That is why this works so well. There are so many great comedians working with such a funny idea.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Prepare to blush as much as you laugh,"All right, here's the deal: if you're easily offended then you might want to stay far, far away from this one. There are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but I probably blushed about as much as I laughed. Actually, I probably blushed MORE than I laughed. And if I wasn't literally blushing on the outside, then I was blushing on the inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame. Whether that's a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder I suppose.I will not deny that I laughed quite a bit, but this is a movie that I simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter. If I were to say, ""This movie is hilarious, go check it out!"" and some sweet, little old church-going lady heads to the theater and has a heart-attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations, well, that's just something I don't need on my conscience.So how raunchy is it? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honestly. My mom would've walked out during the first scene. I feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect.There is some cleverly intelligent comedy here, but that's what I come to expect from the man (Judd Apatow) who had a hand in both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. Paul Rudd proclaiming, ""If I hear Ya Mo Be There one more time I'll Ya Mo burn this place down,"" is hilarious, but it's one of those things that the majority of the audience won't appreciate.And when we see a quick 3-second flashback of Steve Carrell singing along to Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over, whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it.Strangely enough, despite the raunch, there's an admirable moral to the story. The movie doesn't portray Carrell as some freaky loser just because he's a virgin. He's really portrayed as a likable, admirable character. Sure, he's a little weird. After all, he has a framed Asia poster, ""more videogames than an Asian kid,"" and a toy collection that features the Million Dollar Man's BOSS, but we're never led to believe that there's actually anything wrong with the fact that he's a virgin. As odd as it may seem, there's a bit of an ""it's OK to wait"" message.But man, oh man, please be warned that this pushes its R rating about as far as it can go. That was certainly Apatow's intention. According to him, he just let some of the guys (particularly Rogen and Malco) improv and talk the way they normally talk, all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty. If you can handle that or talk that way yourself, then you'll love the movie.I'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes. I find that subtle, clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f-word or fratboy sex discussions. But that's me. Like I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if they're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to ever see at the theater. I just don't know how interested most women will be in what's discussed by men while playing poker. Honestly ladies, you might not want to know. If you've ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross, well, this gives you a good idea.There you go - my humble, honest take on what to expect. Be that your guide. It definitely should not be seen with your Sunday School class, mama, grandmama, any family members of the opposite sex, children of any age, or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion. If you'd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A very funny film that really showcases Carell's talent,"Just came out of a sneak preview for this film. It had me laughing every 30 secs. The ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing I hadn't bought that large coke. There are definitely some lulls, but, overall, highly entertaining. The movie lets Steve Carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey in ""Bruce Almighty"" and Will Ferrell ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy"" in their movies. Paul Rudd is hilarious as always. I love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas (like P.S.). I think that Seth Rogen should be getting more work, because he so freaking talented and engaging. Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments. I highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you're easily offended, don't see this movie. If you're a rabid feminist, don't see this movie. And, please, not matter what, even if you think you're one of those ""hip"" parents, don't take your kids to this movie. Sure, you should let your teens go see this movie, just don't watch it with them. It would make for some incredibly awkward moments.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Raunchy and heartfelt in equal measure!,"It may feel overlong, sketchy, and familiar; but all this actually because of one single flaw, which is that the movie completely delivered itself to its message. Don't get me wrong, the message of the movie is one of its best merits (it's well-conveyed, and it makes the movie stand out from the rest of raunchy comedies). But when the plot ends up being completely driven by the moral of the story, you know that there is something wrong here. A lot of monotonous, stretched story-lines, and repetitive jokes made the movie feels as if it has overstayed its welcome. And I kept always wondering why a movie that felt so fresh and genuine, and also has a lot to say (considering its remaining running time and the almost flawless, extremely hilarious and intriguing first act and half of the second). I think I found the answer as the third act kicked off, which is to keep stretching the movie as much as it could until it reach the denouement, and hence delivers its message at the end. It ends up being pretty much a run-of-the-mill rom-com.However, The 40-Year-Old Virgin completely deserves the cult status it has achieved. First and foremost, Judd Apatow pulled off a something seemingly impossible: a combination of a crude, gross-out comedy and a heartfelt, tender romantic comedy. While these two sub-genres didn't mix very well with each other, glimpses of each of both have managed to be consistent throughout the entire movie. That's largely due to the likable and unbelievably relatable protagonist, Andy, brought to life by an outstanding, star-making performance by Steve Carell, who revealed his massive talent, showing an impressive range he would latter become famous for.All the secondary characters here have a reasonable depth that prove how this movie is really different from your typical gross-out comedy. They may be stereotypical after all, but the witty rude humor that came from them added an extra, and maybe interestingly contradictory, layer to all of them. I think all the performances are great, but Paul Rudd really stole the show.Also the movie features a young Jonah Hill in a very funny cameo. I mean, what more could you ask for?(7.5/10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
They don't do movies like this anymore,"""The 40 year Old Virgin"" is a 2005 film that perfectly describe when and where Hollywood reached its peak, when films didn't have to worry about being politically correct, but at the same time they understand some key aspect of society, American society specially, there was inclusivity, there was some boundaries but ultimately, there was fun, it was in a few words pure entertainment.Talking specifically about the movie there are a lot of jokes that may hurt some sensibility in today society, yet they are not ill intended, and for most of people they are funny, it also has a few touchy and warm-felt moments, it talks about friendship, loneliness, love, parenthood, fear of rejection and many other sensible topics yet it doesn't never stray away from its purpose of being an irreverent comedy movie.I think this is one of the best comedy film of the last years, who can be enjoy by teenagers, young adults and adults alike.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A winning comedy; everything comes together so nicely,"""The 40 Year Old Virgin"":Judd Apatow's first time at-bat, Steve Carell's career launching pad . . . It even saved ""The Office"" from cancelation. That's some serious cachet, and maybe the real surprise is that (despite being so wildly 2005) it holds up so well today.Carell can't be underestimated here. He's super relatable as the guy who's never bothered with dating, and I really felt for his character when life started moving too fast. The cast has amazing chemistry and they all work together to make something that's genuinely funny (the deliveries of these jokes are incredible!). It's a legit knee-slapper.Apatow has made a career out of his raunch-with-a-heart shtick but he struck just the right balance here. The whole thing just seems to work in harmony.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
a healthy reminder that sex jokes can be well crafted; Carrell is genius,"Something about the 40 Year Old Virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer, Wedding Crashers, is similar, but they are two different films in some respects. Both are romantic comedies that have that kind of over-the-top, crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20's along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films. Both have some sort of formula to the stories as well. But by the end of the 40 Year Old Virgin, I think I found overall it was more satisfying than 'Crashers'. Although one can guess where the relationship story with Steve Carrell's character Andy and Catherine Keener's character Trish will go to, it isn't too basic for one to figure out like with Crashers, and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic, more rounded than most of the one-dimensional or unexplained people in the other. And, perhaps, it may also depend on how much you identify (or just find the lunacy) in both.The thing is some people may go into The 40 Year Old Virgin not knowing Steve Carrell as well as Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn, as Carrell has built up his cult status on The Daily Show (one of my favorite shows on now) and in small but unforgettably riotous roles in Anchorman and Bruce Almighty. This is his first starring role, but it's not treated like some third rate vehicle. He and co-writer/director Judd Apatow treat the character of Andy with a certain level of sincerity that keeps the audience on his side all the way, even early on as he talks to his action figures while re-painting them. It's also a tricky line to walk on- in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the Lackluster 40 Days and 40 Nights with Josh Hartnett (also about sexual dysfunction). As the title suggests, Andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little Pee-Wee Herman in him (the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious, a good sign).So, his friends (among them Paul Rudd, Romany Mancoy, Seth Rogen, all very good comic foils) try and devise different strategies and tips to finally break the sort of curse over Andy's head to pop his cherry, so to speak. He almost gets with a overly drunk woman, he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl, and almost with his own boss (Jane Lynch, also very funny in the mockumentaries) as a (explitive) buddy. But this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with Trish, who works across the street from him. As they build on a relationship not based at all on sex, one might worry that the plot gear of ""how is he going to tell her such and such"" might get in the way of the comedy. It doesn't. In fact, if anything, Carrell and the cast build on it to a very high degree. For practically an hour and a half of the film's two hour length, there was barely a moment I wasn't laughing, whether big or small.The big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot, or one or two little stray stories (the fellow co-workers have their own relationship problems as well, Rudd's being the funniest). The big laughs come through because of Carrell's reactions, and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humor/charm, or that its with some truth. Keener gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship (and, un-like 'Crashers', there isn't as much that doesn't make sense character wise). For someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face, Carrell gets very high points here. And like with a Farrelly brothers movie, the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity; the 'waxing' scene (which was done for real, by the way) and the sort of Aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film (the way it comes out at first is a total, uproarious surprise). But if you're willing not to get offended by it, there's more where that came from. This is one of the funniest films of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A sweet romance buried underneath ""Man Show"" style humor","If you liked ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" you will love this movie. In fact, it rejoins a couple of the supporting cast of that film, starring Steve Carrell, who played ""Brick"" who, in my opinion, stole that show with his clueless stares and inane ramblings. In this film, Andy, the 40-year-old virgin, gets a lot of unwanted help from his male coworkers, who are all so completely dysfunctional that they really don't have any business trying to repair anyone else's private life. The fact that Andy also still rides a bicycle and is chided by his coworkers for that, too, just seems to emphasize that modern society has turned virginity into a stigma similar to not being able to pass a driving test.Instead of wanting to lose his virginity, though, what Andy really wants is a relationship with the nice woman running a store across the street from where he works. His virginity is just a byproduct of him not finding a good relationship with a woman yet. The resulting story is actually a rather sweet romance buried underneath all of the Man Show style humor. It carries a rare message in modern film - that chastity before marriage is not a bad thing, and that everybody is running on their own schedule.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funny for about 15 minutes of the entire movie.,"I know this will be very unpopular, but I found this movie to be mostly unfunny, way too long, incredibly predictable, and very base. For anyone seeking humor that does not insult one's basic level of intelligence, this is not the movie for you. There ARE some hilarious scenes, but they are very brief and sandwiched in between big fat loaves of the most low-level frat/high school humor I've seen in a while. It doesn't involve you enough to really want to see what happens, also because it rambles on for about a half hour too long.I'm a big fan of humor like old Woody Allen, The Office, Spinal Tap, and Airplane!, and this just wasn't inventive enough to hold my interest. Toilet humor does not require good writing, it just requires an audience who likes toilet humor. I'm cool with people liking it, but it does nothing for me, personally. Occasionally a bit of random, absurd humor would pop in, which was good, but it was mostly relying on cheap humor tricks that got old after the first 15 minutes, for me.Also, I don't mind people swearing at all, but after a while, I actually got bored of hearing it so freaking much.Sorry, two thumbs down here.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"SO,,,, GUESS THERE IS A FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING!!!","...But FIRST: Let us FOCUS on the Title's Content and Context....
As SO often occurs in Hollywood, Movies are made where the main idea seems to be so good, so foolproof, that you react by saying, ""Damn, what a hell of a great premise for a movie...No WAY they can screw THAT up!""Unfortunately, with Movies...As is the case with almost EVERYTHING in LIFE...where there's a will, there's a Way,! And, consequently, sometimes even the best of concepts results in a five-alarm disaster of a film... Thank God that, The 40 Year Old Virgin, is a case of ""The Exception Proves the Rule!"" And this, despite the fact that Universal seemed to do just about everything possible to spoil VIRGIN, it is STILL definitely worth watching, at least once!In the title role we have the comedy sensation of recent years, Steve Carell, who entered the Comedy Stratosphere with Bruce Almighty. (Where Mr. Carell was Jim Carey's TV weatherman competition...Remember that now famous scene where Carell's character is trying to break some important news, but all he can manage to get out is a series of weird grunts, groans and assorted sounds!) It seems that, Carrell, who really WAS around 40 at the time ALMIGHTY was made, attained great comic success relatively late in life...But, of course, much better late.....!One of Virgin's excesses is that every time the film reaches a rather difficult stretch, it appears that Director, Tom Shadyac (Liar, Liar) places too much responsibility on the shoulders of his leading man, who, despite his great and varied talents, sometimes can't help showing just how much of a struggle it is to carry the film forward.Another example where VIRGIN is a bit over-the-top, regards the unrelenting profanity in the dialog! If any of you non-native speakers out there were not familiar with some of these words in English, during each viewing, you'll get to practice them at least a hundred times! At some point, it just stops being funny for everyone in the audience.Also, there is simply too much information about too many sexual acts and other kinky incidentals that might have provoked laughter the first, second, or even a bit the third time, but with the umpteenth reference ends up being downright nauseating.With a runtime of nearly two hours, I think that Virgin would have been even more enjoyable with at least 5 to 10 minutes of strategic editing. But, despite the flaws mentioned here, there are a number of scenes that produce industrial-size laughter, which readily justify the time you invest watching! Also, Virgin demonstrates more than enough originality, both in general concept and in how it has been brought to the screen..It is well worth mentioning co-star, Catherine Keener (The Interpreter, Being John Malkovich), certainly, a very underrated actress in Hollywood. She plays the competition for love interest to perfection, giving the film a much needed touch of realism and credibility.So here is an interesting and fun film that will probably feel good to both men and women alike! There is almost nothing visually graphic in Virgin, but because of its non-stop hardcore locker room language, I would recommend it for those at least14 or15, in your family.No matter if you lost yours at 12 or at 40... or even if you still are...VIRGIN makes us ALL laugh about an integral component of the human condition, one with which practically each and every one of us can relate to!ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Espa√±ol, are welcome!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The audience all shared my laughter, and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie.Kudos to Steve Carrell(who I had already been a fan of). He proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy. He has a style that I haven't seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God there wasn't a cameo from Will Ferrell(love him, but saw him too much this summer).There were parts of comedic genius in this movie. Partly thanks to Carrell, and partly thanks to the writing(also Carrell).

Catherine Keener was terrific as Trish, and all of Steve Carell's friends were flawed but amiable, and so much fun. the idea that they suspected that Carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming, and very funny. highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Cute, crude, charming, nasty, hilarious, and more......","I got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know  what to expect. The premise seemed silly and I assumed it would be a  lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-virgin humor. What a great surprise. I  laughed so hard I cried at some of the jokes. This film is a must see  for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor.  OK.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother (Jack  Palance?) or small children. The language is filthy, the jokes are  (very) crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find  anywhere. What's amazing, however, is that the movie is still a sweet  love story. My girlfriend and I both loved it.  Steve Carell is terrific, but (like The Office) the supporting cast  really makes the film work.

Classic Steve Carrel,"Steve Carrel has a special ability for making typically unhumorous situations humorous simply by virture of him being there. This is what I call the Steve effect, and it happens many times during this movie. The script may not be particularly brilliant, but there's something about his goofy mannerisms that turns any situation into a comedic one.The cast of characters here is strong. There are his well meaning but dumb co-workers who egg him on into embarrassing himself. Ironically, Andy seems to have more luck with women than any of his friends. Surely this says something about the way men approach women. They see women as a prize to be bagged, but Andy sees them as human beings with hearts and souls. I think that is why he's so successful.There are a lot of funny moments, and probably an equal amount of really stupid ones, like the waxing scene. These are the types of moments that make comedies like this worthwhile. It's payoff.Everyone from the charming Trish, to gruff boss Paula, to sarcastic daughter Marla, bring a something unique through their character. We come to appreciate the unique qualities of these people and how everyone has such a different way of communicating with the world.The ending is really random, but also really joyful and uplifting.

You can tell that Will Ferrell influenced his ""comedic air"" but Carell takes it to another level, everything he does is innocent, lovable, and hilarious.

The film is probably going to be about sex, dear readers, so if you're not ready for some jokes about genitals and putting on a condom the right way the movie may not be for you.""The inept acting, scripting, pacing, continuity, and direction are as bad as anything I've ever seen. ""I found Steve Carrol's acting along with his friends very believable... and what exactly does 'bad directing' mean? The only directing involved in this movie is in regular dialog and in some beds, so you have face A, then face B, then back to face A again: can you really screw that up? Also, the scripting was great because you have characters delivering rapid-fire dialog, then can change gears to slow seduction scenes, both appropriate for a comedy. I beg you readers to also ignore this horribly common stock criticism.""The story is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent.""I found the opposite to be true. You start with a guy whose friends find out he is a virgin, so they try to give him advice then set him up with several women. He falls for a compatible lady incidentally, whom he starts a relationship with. Eventually he falls head over heels for said lady, things heat up between them... and so on, the events unfold in that order. Do these events really sound disjointed, or fragmented? Do they make sense, or are they incoherent? C'mon...""This is a dull, painful and hopelessly dreadful film from nearly every point of view that caters either to adolescents or to the basest elements. How vulgar language, rubber penises, vomit and racist jokes pass for comedy is beyond me.""The content of this movie is immature at times, but it contains genuine feelings over a problem some face. What's wrong with exploiting it in humorous situations ? I've met friends in their 30s and 40s who still found this movie hilarious, so this brand of humor isn't necessarily bound to one age group; why when someone doesn't get a joke make up the idea that teenagers or college-aged students are more gullible and should find it appealing is beyond *me*.Also, I'm sick of foreigners bashing it because it's ""American Comedy"".

"The Modern Definition of ""Serious Comedy""","I'm not quite sure if the term ""serious comedy"" applies to this movie, Im not even sure if this can be applied. On the last few years movie theaters have become filled with comedy movies which are way too stupid to even make us grin. Therefore, I considered the movies which do not fill these requirements as ""serious comedies"".Does The 40 Year Old Virgin fit into this guild? That is finally up to you, but in my opinion, this is a very funny movie. You get to laugh a lot, plus it delivers a social commentary through some really great characters and situations.I'm pretty there is more than one 40 year old virgin out there, and even the people whom do not exactly fit this specifications, may feel identified by one of the characters in the movie, especially men.The story, as the title says it, is about Andy, a shy, silent guy, whom collects action figures, watches Survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is Asia.Kal is Andy's co-worker at SmartTech. He believes Andy to be a psychopath until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is clearly a sexual pervert but yet he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre.David is the passionate guy who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, whom ran away with another guy. And Jay, a man in a relationship which seems to be affected by his continuous cheating and getting caught acts.I'm pretty sure most youngsters from 13 to 21 have already watched this film, but it really does not have an age limit to be able to enjoy it.

"Entertaining, but too long.","One thing I love about Steve Carell is that he leaves a good impression in every movie he's enrolled in. His performance and expressions in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" makes the audience believe in the situation that he is dealing with. Judd Apatow's movies are known to include comedian actors such as Paul Rudd and Soth Rogen who played two amazing roles in this movie. Seeing that the movie turned out to be entertaining and well developed, I found it longer than it should have been. I think movies like ""The 40 year old virgin"", or ""This is 40"" (also directed by Judd Apatow) should be plain and simple (about 1 hr 20 min - 1 hr 30 min max). Despite the fact that the plot is amusing, it should have been compressed. Overall, it was a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Hysterically funny high-concept comedy about the titular Andy Stitzer (wonderfully played by perennial second banana Carell in a truly extraordinarily comic breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the A-list), a tech services rep for an electronics store in Southern California who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well-meaning yet entirely clueless womanizing co-worker buddies (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one degree funnier than the next) determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost. What follows is an unlikely yet very warm-hearted romance with a vivacious mother (the marvelous Keener having lots of fun here) leading to add more fuel to the fires within Andy. A surprisingly good-spirited and unapologetically raunchy romantic comedy; the funniest since ""There's Something About Mary"" with a shrewdly observant script by director Judd Apatow and Carell that features some astoundingly gut-busting sequences including a scathingly accurate David Caruso joke, homophobic debunking ribbing, send-ups of 'date-a-paloozas' and demystifying the war of the sexes with cheeky aplomb.

I would have preferred more Carrell...less of his loutish friends,"""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is an odd mix. On one hand the film is very crude and nasty...filled with tons of sexual innuendos. And, on the other, it's a sweet romance. And for me, the mix didn't quite work. I would have preferred less of the crude humor and more of Steve Carrell's character and the romance.Andy (Carrell) works at an Electronics store that is much like Best Buy. His co-workers are all jerks who talk about sex all the time. Andy, on the other hand, is pretty shy and has no experience with women...and at first these co-workers make fun of him being a virgin. However, later they make it their mission to get Andy laid. And, not surprisingly, these efforts don't work and their advice is pretty bad. Can Andy manage to find love as well as sex?Apparently there's a director's cut which has more crudeness than this version.

more romantic than comedy,i got the DVD of this movie very recently hoping for a outrageous farce like 'death at a funeral' or ' the heartbreak kid' . sorry but do not think it should be talked about in same breath. the genre is a bit more of the rom com (romantic comedy )variety .it is more a heartwarming movie in which the protagonist is looking for - and is in the process of getting- his true love. the fact that he is also a 40 year old virgin seems incidental. of course the team of horny/love lorn co workers get into the act of helping our man get some action.this results in some smarmy dialogue with verbal banter bonding the boys. its got a mild smattering of outrageous humour thrown in for measure. don't get me wrong it is not a bad movie but watch it if you are in the mood for a sentimental romantic comedy with a happy ending and bits of funny stuff .as an aside - the interactions between the Asian and the African American character seemed a bit forced to me.i guess it depends on what you are in the mood for. i repeat good if you like this kind of sugar and spice .6 on 10 from me.,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Of course his partners in crime are very well casted, too.Some jokes are a bit childish, but they're played with so much gusto, from the cast, that you don't really mind.

Steve Carell Rocks My World,"An electronics store employee is forty years old and has never made love to a woman. After his co-workers find out, they vow to find him a woman. This film follows the adventures of Andy, his exploits with loose women, and his quest to end his virginity. But will he make it? Like ""Beerfest"", this film suffers from a plot that is very one-sided. The jokes are fairly repetitive since they all revolve around whether or not Andy has been with a woman yet (which is consistently not so). Some of the jokes stand out (Andy making up a time he was with a woman, the running ""I know you're gay because..."" joke) but many aren't so hot. I think some of the humor relies on being at least vaguely familiar with geeky stuff.What the film has going for it is its heart. I didn't expect heart, but like ""Click"" there is a positive message under the superficial exterior. My friend says to me, the film has not enough smut. She really likes smut. Well, it's true, the smut was lacking for a film about getting it on. But this might be considered a strong point since the film stressed quality of relationships, something probably important (especially for a man who is 40).Steve Carell is a funny guy, and I admire his dedication to realism. Allegedly, the chest-waxing scene is all real because Carell didn't want to cheat his audience. Thank you! This scene was one of the better ones. Paul Rudd was also funny, and the other co-stars did a fine job.A shout-out to the daughter in the film, whom I have also seen in ""London"". I feel she has a bright career ahead of her and will be a household name in five years. (Sadly, her name escapes me now... Kit something.) A decent comedy, and with no Adam Sandler, Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell, which I think is nice. No disrespect to these gentlemen, but it's time to share the stage with another man...

Legend has it the Michael McDonald DVD is still playing,"Here we have yet another first-world comedy from the king of first-world comedies, Judd Apatow, himself. The director/writer/producer crafted, this time, an interesting story with a lead character just begging to be liked. Andy (Steve Carell) is an apparent worry-free, happy, well-groomed respectable man, working at a tech store, but there is something off about him... oh, right, he's a 40-year old virgin (in case you hadn't figured it from the title) and a nerd.If riding his bike to work and signaling his turns does not make you think that something is off with him, then his enormous collection of toys and action figures definitely will. The plot revolves pretty much around his co-workers and friends helping him to get laid--hallelujah! Despite its comedic tone and its raunchiness, this is a surprisingly insightful film as far as buddy comedies go, even if the information revolves around various echelons of women and naughty theories about sex. The film's misogynistic moments are often necessary, and not everything boils down to sex, but the experience of love.Andy's buddies, despite being a bunch of hedonists and testosterone driven macho-men, are not worried simply because he never had sex. They want him to experience love, they genuinely think about his emotional future, and the comedy comes from the fact that the only way they know how to teach him is by bringing him to obscene nightclubs, offering him a box filled with pornographic material or simply giving him instructions on how to approach a woman.There are tons of moments of pure modernity-inspired fun even outside this main plot. One of the most random and best recurring gags is the one in which the only material playing on the TVs on display is a two-year old Michael McDonald DVD of which David (Paul Rudd), makes a bold, funny and perfectly-delivered threat to his boss to be changed. All-in-all, Andy does interact with many women and we see flashbacks of his failed teenager years attempts at popping his cherry, all failing in hilarious ways--this is another thing that I liked: there was no dramatic moment or anything in his life, he simply had bad luck!Apatow crafted yet another first-world, modern comedy. It is what it is, but by the end of it, despite knowing that ideally Andy should be with a single woman, Trish, who is presented as the one, the film does a great job at confusing you as well as him. Luckily there are many gags to keep you entertained and with such a sweet, human character, I can barely get past the cringe-inducing song at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
could have been a whole lot funnier,"""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" wins the award for being the dirtiest, most foulmouthed version of ""Pygmalion"" this side of ""My Bare Lady."" As the title explicitly states, this is the story of a man who has somehow managed to avoid having sex for the first four decades of his life, and the attempts on the part of his co-workers to see that he doesn't make it five. Thus, once they get over the shock of Andy Stitzer's little secret, these helpful buddies spend the remainder of the movie coaching and grooming him in the fine art of sexual conquest and romantic seduction.The problem with ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" is that it can't decide whether it wants to be a crude, gross-out raunch-fest or a sweet, warmhearted romantic comedy. By trying to succeed at both, it manages to succeed at neither. For all the filmmakers' attempts to meld them, the two very different halves just keep canceling one another out.Yet, as with any film that aspires to make us laugh, ""Virgin"" must finally be adjudged a success or failure based not on how wild or tame it is, but on how funny. And, unfortunately, there just isn't very much humor to be found in this film, with the setups and jokes feeling mighty thin and painfully obvious for the most part, and the movie never seeming to know when to leave well enough alone. The ""well enough"" are the two lead performers - Steve Carell and Katherine Keener - who are both tremendously natural and likable performers and who could really make us care about their characters if the film weren't so cluttered with extraneous elements and subsidiary characters, and so tedious and drawn out in its execution. For, indeed, ""Virgin"" flies right in the face of that unwritten law of movie-making that decrees that no comedy should ever even approach a two-hour running time, let alone exceed it. Yet, clocking in at a whopping 128 minutes, the film begins to feel aimless and endless, with long stretches of time between all-too-infrequent laughs.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Forty Year Old Turkey,"Insufferably and embarrassingly poor on practically every conceivable level. The inept acting, scripting, pacing, continuity, and direction are as bad as anything I've ever seen. The plot meanders almost from the outset suffering from non-sequitur dialogue and situations, with any attempts at humor being as sophomoric as anything in the history of cinema . There are endless topics of discussion and mis-fire situations that seem to pop in from nowhere and leave to nowhere.Foul-mouthed East Indians maybe amusing initially-only because that type of behaviour doesn't fit the stereotype, but they become tiresome quickly--especially when seen throughout the entire picture.However, after seeing a startingly high number of very positive reviews it has received--even from reputable film critics--I am somewhat disturbed by how the evaluation standards of filmaking apparently now isn't anything at all like how I think it has been, or close to what it should be.

Steve Carell makes you root for him like you've never rooted for a desperate virgin before,"Much like Knocked-Up, the film Judd Apatow and company made after this one, The 40-Year-Old Virgin is a comedy about genre-typical subjects, centered around sex and love, written and presented a little more intelligently than what we've been accustomed to in this genre. Apatow's characters are simple-minded and goofy, but they have an everyman naturalness and warmth which makes them feel close and authentic, as if they were your next-door neighbours or your unassuming pals - despite their obvious weirdness which of course is the basic for the comedic effect. Add to that Apatow's often ingenious perspective on universal matters, and you have a formula which works - and will work again. Steve Carell is one of the key factors; his irresistibly likeable persona is perfect for the part.

"Funny, but not strictly Politically Correct.","The 40 Year-Old Virgin (2005) -Yes, the scene in which Andy's new found friends take him to get waxed to improve his chances with women was funny, but honestly, who could believe that leading man Steve Carell's chest hair really stopped so perfectly at his shoulder line and hadn't previously been shaped somehow? And does anyone else think that Steve is actually really sexy, because I definitely do.I could easily associate with his character, technically I am still a 43 year old virgin, but that's only because I haven't slept with any women (I like men), but that wasn't why I felt I could understand him. I've always been a bit of a nerd myself, my 'Star Wars' (1977) figure collection had to be sold so I could move for a job I got and my current obsession is with Lego. It's nice to get lost in a hobby and partners can potentially get in the way of that. I could see how his focus just hadn't gone down that route yet.I recognised his life as it was before and as it developed throughout the film from my own dating/sexual experiences and, not wanting to have too serious a moment, wondered whether we put too much pressure not only on sex, but on being in a relationship as well.Andy was sweet and harming no one until his work colleagues took it upon themselves to get him laid, giving him all sorts of bad advice and ""Support"". If these films have taught us anything it would be not to listen to a word of it, but then the shenanigans and jokes wouldn't happen and the film would be 25 minutes long.Sadly I couldn't tell what sort of character David, played by Paul Rudd, was meant to be. There was no real depth or shape to the role, which may sound like ""Critic"" syndrome or something, but it really does help to add more enjoyment to a film when the characters are well rounded, even if it is just meant to be frivolous fun. It was definitely not Paul's best character.I also struggled to understand most of what Romany Malco as Jay was saying at all. It was like he was talking a different language entirely at some points.So Seth Rogen in the role of Cal was the easiest one to connect with and the nicest of the bunch really. I've never been his biggest fan actually, but he delivered his part quite well.The film also featured a lot of celebrities that weren't necessarily big at the time, but have since turned up everywhere. It was quite fun to play spot the cameo. I thought that Jonah Hill's was the best.The story unfolded as I had expected with various dating mishaps and a genuine love interest that would potentially go wrong, because of all the bad advice.Essentially the humour was quite vulgar and derogatory, showing up the idiocy of the stereotypical heterosexual man, but there were some other cute, funny and silly moments that shouldn't really be offensive to anyone. It seems strange to say it was ""Of its time"" only 20 years later, but I would hope that we really have come a long way since then. Even with that in mind I didn't feel that they were trying to be sexist and cause offence, but actually trying to show up those behaviours, so if you can just go with it, without taking it too seriously or melting like a snowflake, it wasn't so bad. One of those that will just take you away from reality for a while and it ended superbly with a great musical moment that should be the blueprint for the end of all films forever in my honest opinion.It wasn't the sort of film that I could compare to other great cinematic experiences or comment on the outstanding lighting or scenery, because it wasn't trying to do that, but it made me laugh out loud more than once, which was nice.703.01/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It talks about how they wanted precisely to work that line between those newer more slapstick, ribald films but underpin it with a human story influenced by Hal Ashby and the like... deadpan and concerned ultimately with empathy for characters rather than mockery of them. Well, they more or less pull it off. The script slackens at times and is weakened by the fact that he's not that unlikely to 'get laid' from the off, but then, that's partly their decision not to make him unbelievably weird and geeky.As a friend said, though, ""you can;t imagine a film about a female 40 year old virgin taking the same tone."" perhaps she's right.

The dialogue is some of the most dynamic, quick, interactive and downright hysterical I have ever heard in a comedy, and this elevates the whole film above generic formula. Carell brings refreshing charisma and comedic timing to his performance, and I have never heard a funnier, better screamer since Macalauy Culkin in Home Alone (""I'm SHY!!!""). It is also nice to see Paul Rudd back in comedy action, as I greatly missed this guy when he seemed to depart from fame post-Clueless. Someone else whose comedic skills are worthy of a great deal of praise is Romany Malco, playing Andy's friend and pimp, always there to facilitate his mission, but always ending up making things worse. It is these three men that, when combined, are so funny that they just take my breath away.The only negative aspect to The 40 Year Old Virgin (aside from its philosophy that you can't be happy unless you're in a relationship) is that it is much too long. It has been said before yes, but there is a reason it has been brought up so much and that is because a raunchy sex comedy just does not hold up for 120 minutes. As the novelty of the fun dialogue and sexy situations wore off, I became less and less engrossed in the film. And let's not talk about the final sing-and-dance number. Just... please. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Cult classic comedy, but not over the top hilarious","The 40-Year Old Virgin was cutting edge back in the day. At the time of its first release, I don't remember seeing any other movies exploring sex jokes and awkward virgins the way this movie does. The great thing is that this movie could've gone in a really bad direction, and not have had any depth to it, but while being funny and goofy, Andy and Trish's love story and the lessons he learns from his first real relationship are life lessons that can apply to anybody going through a relationship, whether they are virgins or not.The first half of the film might be uncomfortable for feminists. At first, there are a lot of misogynistic jokes and Andy's ""friends"" seem really shallow. But over time, the course of their friendship develops and you see that even these guys have some depth to them.I really enjoyed this. It didn't have me reeling from laughter, but it made for a nice, light romantic comedy in its own sense.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Mediocre at best,"In a summer of terrible films (Stealth, Dukes of Hazzard, etc) along comes the 40 year old virgin. About 10 minutes into the film I had the feeling that the script was written by a couple of 16 year olds.When did a huge amount of cursing become the basis for a movie to be funny? Don't get me wrong - I myself use the F word a lot, but this film tries to pull of jokes, which when they fall flat, are accentuated by a slew of cursing.The movie plays like a 5 minute story synopsis dragged out over two hours. In the case of the Wedding Crashers, two hours seemed to be almost too long for the film to run. In the case of the 40 year old virgin, 2 hours feels like an eternity....Predictable, overlong, and lacking the courage to really take things to the next level, this film was obviously rated R for the amount of foul language, since there's barely any nudity in the film....It's painfully obvious that the film will have the ever so popular unrated tag when it comes to DVD and hopefully that will enable them to actually take some chances the theatrical version didn't.All in all - I felt cheated by this film, which had promise, but just seemed content to go only so far, falling short of what could have made for some truly funny situations. Padding the film out with the silly side stories simply made the picture drag on too long....Definitely one that you can wait for DVD.Addendum: After seeing it on DVD in it's unrated version I have a new appreciation for the film and therefore rank it higher now.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An adult comedy to watch alone or with friends.,"In this comedy, quite adult, even if not for the theme, we follow the attempts of a group of co-workers to get one of their colleagues, more shy but already forty years old, to lose his virginity. It is a very simple plot, totally focused on easy comedy, sometimes quite breeder. It's not the kind of movie I recommend to watch with your mom or grandma, but it's great for a group of friends.The plot is, in fact, so basic that I fear spoiling it if I reveal more than what I said above. It is a very direct, straightforward film, where the theme of sex, and the way we look at sex, is approached without taboos or complications to, after all, prove the importance and relevance of love and how empty it can be the sex just for sex. I think that's the big message of the film.The film rests entirely on the shoulders of Steve Carell, a particularly skilled and pleasant comic actor, who seems to have real fun while playing the character. I was sorry that the film did not have, in the final credits, scenes cut or unedited with the best fails of the filming, as some comedies do. It would certainly have been a much more appealing and interesting way to end this film than that endless ""Age of Aquarius"" song. The film also has a good participation by Catherine Keener, but the rest of the cast is limited to supporting these two actors.Technically, it is a discreet film, which allows comedy to dominate and get our attention. Therefore, cinematography is quite routine, the sets and costumes are what you would expect, and the soundtrack is not always pleasant (I already mentioned that I didn't like the final song), but that's not bad, on the contrary, it gives space so that we can focus on what is essential: laughter and entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
10/10,"This movie is one of my favourite ever comedy films. I never saw it at the movies, because it didn't seem like the type of movie I'd be interested in as the title is silly, but then my flat mate strongly encouraged me to watch it and I instantly fell in love. This film combines vulgarity, slapstick, sex, a solid plot, good acting and most importantly heart - it could of very easily just been a silly satire but you really feel for the characters, Andy at least anyway. There are so many one liners they can be easy to overlook, I'm always finding something else to laugh at each time I watch it. Steve Carrell definitely became one of my favourite comedic actors after seeing this film. My only criticism is that I hate musicals and the film ends on a song and dance number ... which is a bit odd and out of left field.Final Verdict: Some may see it as nothing but vulgar given the title and general plot but if you give it a chance you'll see it's much more than that. It's a well thought out comedy more about love and friendship than the sex and nudity... Sort of. Steve Carrell's best acting performance hands down! Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Decent comedy,"Overall, I thought that this comedy contained a good number of laughs and was an enjoyable viewing experience. Steve Carrell was convincing and likable as the title character, and for the most part I liked the supporting cast portraying his coworkers who tried to help him to remedy his ""predicament."" Catherine Keener was also good as Carrell's romantic interest. The couple inexplicably had a decent on-screen chemistry, which made you root for both characters. The sarcastic banter between Carrell and Keener's teenage daughter is pretty funny, although the daughter kind of drops out of the last half hour of the film. While a lot of people have mentioned the film's raunchiness and gross out humor, I actually didn't really notice it while watching the movie. It certainly didn't strike me as being worse than anything out of a Farrely Brother's movie.I had a few problems with the movie that forced me to detract several points. First, as many have commented, the film is really much longer than it needs to be. There are too many long scenes that don't arouse laughs and that don't contribute to either the plot or the characters' development. I actually would have been fine if the movie had ended right after the chase scene when Carrell finally confesses his secret to Keener. I didn't really need the typical happy Hollywood ending (not to mention the bizarre and spontaneous musical number at the conclusion). Some of the scenes that others have raved about didn't really do it for me, such as the excruciatingly long chest waxing scene. Similarly, the racial banter between the two South Asian characters and Romany Malco seemed out of place. They were funny at first, but they recur far too often and the South Asian guys never develop identities apart from trading racial insults with Malco. Finally, there is a scene in which Carroll criticizes Keener for trying to change him by making him sell all of his toys so that he can open up his own business. It looks for a moment that this is leading somewhere, and that maybe both characters will learn something about being too demanding of others, but then the premise is completely dropped, and we learn at the end that Carrell has indeed sold all of his toys to hold an extravagant wedding, which seems very inconsistent with his and Keener's characters.Overall, this comedy had its share of laughs, but I was glad I waited until it came out on DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Insipid toilet humor,"Like a great many people I viewed this film based upon a promising storyline and Steve Carell's fine performance in Anchorman which, albeit its slightly crude nature, was very entertaining.The film begins with promise but quickly loses steam and falls into an abyss of vulgarity and stupidity from which it never recovers.This is a dull, painful and hopelessly dreadful film from nearly every point of view that caters either to adolescents or to the basest elements. How vulgar language, rubber penises, vomit and racist jokes pass for comedy is beyond me. I'm very surprised at the relatively high rating given this dreck at IMDb.com, but I suppose that people's judgement has been reduced somewhat due to the relentless parade of similarly wretched offerings spluttering forth from Hollywood.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The 40 Year Old Virgin,"A hilarious cast of characters and wonderfully talented comedians makes The 40 Year Old Virgin a comedic classic, but watching it in 2020 again the film and the jokes does seem dated. The movie would have done so much better if it tried beyond that ""R"" rating and went for the extra notch in raunchiness. The story itself is very linear and standard to what we would expect from this time period and this cast, but it is the standard of the actors that made the film so memorable for so many film lovers.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""Animal House"" Grows Up","""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is ""Animal House"" 27 years later (if the frat boys were 13 then, which is how they acted). Like that film, regardless of the ""R"" rating, the matin√©e I was at attracted babies up to boomers, with each segment laughing at different jokes (well, the babies mostly cried.) The kids hooted at every frequent use of four letter words, which were used quite naturally in conversations, and didn't get any of the funny musical references to the '70's.Director/co-writer Judd Apatow and co-writer/star Steve Carell well capture single guys exaggerated braggadocio to each other, with each having a different immaturity issue (while they all share a love of video games) and still oblivious about and inept with women.However, the trash talking takes an unnecessary racial turn with Asian and African-American co-workers for repetitive jokes that went on too long of other guys talking black that was already classically done in ""Airplane,"" plus the constant gay joshing, that like in ""Four Brothers,"" defensively borders on homophobia.Carell's character is most believable when he's not parroting these other guys but is genuinely himself. While it recalls HBO's ""Mind of the Married Man,"" it is very funny when it braves original takes on dating and sex education, hair waxing and condom use. Some of the actors' cracking up looks like genuine reaction to the goings on. Paul Rudd's lovelorn depressive is particularly amusing.The film is bolstered by the strong performances by women, as these are real actresses and not just the usual bland beauties such comedies employ, with the women getting the last laugh on these guys. Catherine Keener's character has a real, amusingly complicated life (with a nice promotion for e-Bay) and past that informs the development of her relationship with the titular character. Elizabeth Banks, notably more bubbly than in ""Heights,"" is charming.The film does go on a bit long, and while evidently some jokes were cut due to unsympathetic responses of test audiences, more could have been. The credits close with a nice thank you to Michael McDonald - ""You rock""-- as his DVD is a source of a running gag. A lot of pop culture references go by --actors, movies, TV shows--and I wasn't sure if they were product placement or had particular resonances.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Coming Out of the Box,"This comedy was better than I expected, although considering the questionable quality of movie comedy coming out of the States these days, that isn't saying too much. The writers set themselves something of a tricky task in a way: making Andy nerdy enough to still be a believable virgin and yet still likable enough for his workmates to want to help him lose his virginity rather than simply make them the butt of their jokes (which, let's face it, is probably what would have happened in real life). The film's quite likable in that respect, always sympathising with its main character while making him the subject of its humour which, for the most part, manages to rise just above the gross juvenile level you might expect. Having said that, there's no belly laughs here, just a lot of wry smiles. And at nearly two-and-a-quarter-hours, this film, like Andy's virginity, lasts for way too long...",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great heartwarming comedy,"The 40 Year Old Virgin has some jokes that aren't funny but its still a great comedy that's heartwarming, sincere and funny.

Judd Apatow's direction is great and the soundtrack is really good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Blessedly semen-free,"It would seem self-evident that certain things should be avoided during sex, simulated or otherwise: braces, pastries, super glue, zippers. All these items scream Sex Comedy, though, and have featured prominently in big Hollywood scores (no pun intended) in recent years. These flicks have managed to be more or less consistently pretty funny, although getting audience guffaws at the sheer relief of watching mortifying things happen to other people during sex seems like pinning the tail on the donkey with no blindfold. Regardless, now comes ""The 40 Year Old Virgin,"" gamely continuing the palliative formula of sticking our collective carnal neuroses on some schmucky loser, and reaping the rewards of our horrified laughter.""Virgin"" succeeds largely on the dopey antics of star Steve Carrell, who makes an art form of creating comic centerpieces out of straight men. As Andrew, the titular touch-me-not, Carrell chortles and wheedles his way through innumerable conversations on which he has no expertise with an incompetent evasiveness worthy of Jeff Lebowski. A film that takes its central gag as its title is clearly not into wasting time, and ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" rapidly settles into a series of sketches of ill-advised attempts to enter poor Andrew into the world of the violated. There's a disastrous round of speed-dating, a pick up lesson (""just keep asking questions,"" advises Andrew's buddy), and a transvestite hooker, all of which mostly comes off as standard, i.e. not very funny, fare. Even less amusing is ""Virgin""'s insistence on detouring into unnecessary gay jokes, as well as the two caricatured Pakistani coworkers whose only function is to sound funny talking in heavily-accented street patois.Carrell himself, though, is funny, and ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is at its best when focusing on Andrew himself, rather than his pratfalls or cadre of Wacky Friends. The painfully transparent false confidence with which he equates a breast with a bag of sand, for example, or tells a bar floozy ""I hope you have a big trunk, because I'm putting my bike in it"" is far more restrained and subtly hilarious than any of the genre's more preferred ""semen in a¬Ö"" gags. The film is smart to go light on the scatology (at least in comparison to its predecessors), instead finding much of its humor in the pathologies of involuntary celibacy. Bike-riding, action figure-collecting Andrew has a lot in common with Steve Buscemi's obsessive schlump from ""Ghost World,"" though he does at times appear as much a victim of bad luck as of a defective personality.""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is nothing new, but does its thing well, and is a perfect stage for Carrell's deadpan histrionics. The ability to elevate basically mundane material is a too rare gift with which Carrell is evidently blessed. Let's hope Hollywood notices.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funniest movie yet!,"This is by far the funniest movie I've ever seen, and I have seen many comedies. The storyline of Steve Carell as a 40 year old man, who is still a virgin is a masterpiece. His comic book and action figure collection define the true meaning of fanatic,and to some extent, hilarious, kind hearted nerd. His performance is hysterical. I also enjoyed his co-workers at the Smart Tech electronics store. From his crew, to his boss, to the hilarious middle eastern guys (very, very funny), they shaped the whole movie. And it doesn't stop here! The whole storyline of his escapades to reach his goal are amazingly funny. First, he gets bikini waxed, and then he has trouble with condoms. Not to mention the speed dating and so called party invite. With help from the middle eastern guys, his peers, and his crew, Andy reaches his goal. This movie is laugh out loud funny.

More for men but I think an open mind is all it takes to laugh here.,"Just about every scene here is laugh worthy. The reason I think this is more for men is you don't see a lot of the woman's side of things. Could be almost in the same ballpark as a chick flick but reversed. That is not a slam on this movie mind you.Most people would be offended by the graphic sexual talk and the language but in this one it's not WHAT'S said, it's HOW it's said that made me have a steady stream of laughter.Steve Carell plays his character just perfectly especially if your familiar with his work. Paul Rudd had a funny part to. The love interest couldn't have been better.Only thing I had a problem with was some of the later scenes seemed forced like the argument but I guess they had to end the movie sometime. I thought Steve's character had the right idea on how to treat women right but the rest really showed what value sex has in today's society. Sad really.Griping aside I really loved this movie in to many ways to complain to much about it. Open mind at all see this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A film that will make you think after finishing laughing.,"A very good mix of comedy and romance. Really enjoyed it!!! May be a low budget and it might have caused real pain to the star, aka Steve Carell,while waxing his chest (ouch!) but the fact that the viewers could see this happening for real is hilarious!!!I admit that I did no justice to Steve Carell when watching Bruce Almighty. But I must state now that he is one good comedian and that even though some of the jokes contained in this movie grossed me out, I had a really good laugh and enjoyed myself.However being a comedy this film questions strong values like friendship, family and true love. It makes you wonder about the way you act in your everyday life, it shows you that when you believe in yourself you achieve almost everything.

"Has heart, but it's only moderately funny","Reminds me of the Farrelly Brothers' last few films. It's a comedy that wants to come off as really touching and thoughtful, one that doesn't want to use its pathetic characters for laughs, but then forgets to be especially funny otherwise. The 40 Year-Old Virgin is funny often enough to make it worth seeing, but the laughs are rarely belly laughs. I just never felt satisfied even after its best jokes. It seemed to be pulling some major punches. Scenes go on for a long time without payoff, and other scenes that seem to have golden setups get cut way too short. For example, in one sequence the title character's friends set him up with a prostitute. It becomes obvious from the outset that it's a man, but as soon as that's established, the movie cuts to the next scene. We don't see the virgin try to get out of the situation. We don't see the hooker try to do anything. There's a lot of potential for great comedy there; it doesn't have to be that dirty, either, to be funny. God knows we don't need a second Deuce Bigalow movie in the theaters this weekend. Steve Carell is very good, and all the characters are quite well fleshed out. I wish they would have done maybe a little more with Catherine Keener. She seems like she might be more interesting if we knew more about her.

A l-o-o-o-n-g goodbye to virginity,"Kudos to Hollywood for its skill in stretching one very unoriginal joke into almost two hours of repetitive gags. So how many times are you going to laugh at a morning woody? Or yet another drunken driving sequence? Or a discussion about women's breats? There's about as much original humor here as in the warnings on a package of Trojans, not to mention an utter lack of erotic tension. Romany Malco displays great timing, Catherine Keener shines (as usual) but headliner Steve Carell sinks a notch or two from his excellent corporate jerk role in The Office. He displays a frozen, deer-in-the-headlights stare that becomes tedious after the first half hour or so. Maybe he has come to the realization that there's very little to laugh about in this overblown and blatantly commercial road to penetration --other than the gross-triggered guffaws of gags built around diverse bodily orifices and organs. 40 Year Old Virgin feels like watching the 30 Years War Plus 10 in real time --minus the action and gore.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Surprisingly good,"I missed out on this film during its cinema release as I figured it to be yet another sex-comedy with gross-out gags. While the film does contain a little of this it is way more character based and the humor comes from more absurd situations than disgusting. Never judge book by its cover huh? Andy Stitzer (Steve Carrell) is a 40-year-old virgin. His life is made up of working in the returns department of an electronics store, collecting toys of movie characters and watching reality TV with his OAP neighbors. The touch of a woman is foreign to him and he is yet to be educated in their mysterious ways. Though he does have the bonus of not having to put up with their moaning, tantrums and bitching 'because they can'! When his secret is wrenched out of him his work buddies make it their mission to help him pop his cherry and think of a zillion, wacky, hair-brained schemes.But Andy is interested in Trish (Catherine Keener) the woman from the store across the road. Only he's really intimidated and arranges a weird no-sex policy with her that originally makes her relax at not having to live up to expectations but eventually makes her want to explode. Can he keep his secret from her too and perform the dirty deed with apparent expertise of your average porn stud? I'm just not a fan of all these ""Apatow Comedies"". Most of them long outstay their welcome and go on for well over two hours. The 40 Year Old Virgin is no exception.Despite some crude humor here and there this is more of a light-hearted 'drama-com' than a romantic comedy. Carrell also proves he a far more talented actor and comedian than Will Ferrel or Adam Sandler.Three stars are for the movie but it gets an extra bonus half-star for including a wonderfully, wonderfully top-heavy actress as Trish's daughter.

Normal men having a good time instead of being uptight and serious, they're still hormonal and make it look so easy to get the women.

Sex + love = real happiness,"Barbed, ribald, occasionally tasteless comedy does have a definite plus: it has an unashamed big heart (and a surprisingly old-fashioned undermining). Steve Carell plays a middle-aged kid, a tech-store stock manager into monster toys and video games, who confesses to his buddies at work that he is still, in fact, a sexual novice. Slick, commercial comedy directed by Judd Apatow, who co-wrote the screenplay with Carell, doesn't condescend to its main character (his celibacy isn't something he chose or planned on, it's merely a hurdle in his life--and although he's goaded into conquering the beast, he goes about that in his own way). The movie is alternately a sunny sex farce and a more sympathetic character-comedy about being true to yourself, with colorful weirdos filling the cast and lots of smart, insightful talk. Apatow is a giddy force behind the camera, and while his plot creaks and groans at times (particularly in the last third), it doesn't necessarily strike one as a highly-concocted audience pleaser until just after the end-credits roll. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

That man is a genius, right up there with the king of comedy, will Ferrell. This is one of those movies i saw last weekend,and am going to see again this Saturday!! Definitely worth the $16!! Can't wait to see it again!! GREAT JOB STEVE AND JUDD!!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Easy to forgive its shortcomings,"After decades of being dragged to the cinema by our better halves to watch the latest Meg Ryan or Hugh Grant pap, it was only a matter of time until men fought back in the rom-com genre. Director Judd Apatow, along with co-writer and lead star Steve Carell, went the extra mile and actually created a rom-com that is both genuinely romantic and laugh- out-loud hilarious, but one that members of both sex can actually enjoy. But amongst all the sweetness there are four guys talking like genuine guys. So, this includes lines like ""you need to put the pussy on a pedestal!"" and ""you know how I know you're gay? You listen to Coldplay."" The language is filthy, but the script is heartfelt.Andy Stitzer (Carell) lives a simple life alone with his collection of valuable (and still boxed) action figures and his gaming chair, working in the stockroom of an electronic store. He also rides a bike to work and never socialises, leading his co-workers to naturally assume he's a serial killer. When they find themselves a man down for a poker game, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) invite Andy. After swapping freaky sex stories, it becomes clear that Andy is in fact a 40 year-old virgin, and so they make a vow to get him laid. Amongst his options are the girl from the bookshop Beth (Elizabeth Banks), who takes a liking to Andy after he takes Cal's advice, his horny boss Paula (Jane Lynch), and the spunky Trish (Catherine Keener), a woman who's just opened a store across the street.The thing that The 40 Year-Old Virgin achieves most is how accurately it portrays its men. Sure, these are extreme versions of people we have come across before in our lives, but men generally talk crap and half- truths to each other about women, movies and computer games. The advice that David, Jay and Cal give is hardly helpful, and is based on their own half-remembered experiences that lead to the assumption that they are the ones that truly understands women. But they are all screwed up in their own way that their advice just leads to some amusing scenes, including the most famous scene of Andy having his chest waxed (which Carell really did, and he's the hairiest comedian since Robin Williams).The film also succeeds in its honesty and its attention to detail. Andy isn't the badly-dressed, bespectacled nerd that has been seen in the likes of She's All That (1999), that once he's given a makeover, he's a hunk. He signals when he's turning his bike on an empty street and his Monday-morning what-I-did-at-the-weekend stories involve making an egg salad sandwich. He's relatable because he's real, so his quest to get his leg over becomes something ultimately more important. The supporting cast are all excellent, especially Malco, who I'm surprised hasn't gone on to bigger things, and Keener, who is surprisingly adorable after years of playing the bitch. Like many movies churned out by the Apatow machine, it's goes on for far too long, but that's easy to forgive when the film is this funny.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"""I hope you have a big trunk... because I'm puttin' my bike in it. "" - Andy Stitzer's pick-up line","The new Steve Carrell (actually the first Steve Carrell) film, 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' was a movie I didn't have very high hopes for. Seeing the movie trailer for it both in the theater and on television, it didn't seem like it would be that funny. I liked the premise, but none of the scenes they showed during the commercials seemed to win me over. When I finally got around to seeing at, after hearing extremely positive buzz, all my reservations about it were put to rest. 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin' wasn't just a funny film, it was an absolutely hysterical one.The movie centers around a guy who has the be the largest geek in the world. He is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carrell), a forty-year old living in a small crummy apartment who works at an electronics store and whose hobbies include watching 'Survivor' with his elderly neighbor and collecting action figures. One day the guys Andy works with -- David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen), invite Andy to a poker game to get to know him and find out he is still a virgin! The three make a pact that they will do everything in their power to try to get Andy laid. The movie from there is all about these three guys trying to get Andy to sleep with different s including a drunk, a psychopath, a and a tom-boy named Gina (a bit-part played hilariously by MADTV's Mo Collins). While all of this madness is going on, Andy falls in love with a divorc√©e who owns a 'Sell it on Ebay' shop played by Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich, Full Frontal).When all is said and done, 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' will have you laughing hysterically through it's entire runtime. Steve Carrell proves himself to maybe be the next Will Ferrell with his performance as the weird loner Andy Stitzer, a performance that is pure comedic genius. Seth Rogen is constantly witty, Romany Malco never ceases to be hilarious, Paul Rudd is solid, and Catherine Keener is perfectly cast as Andy Stitzer's soul mate. The writing is very good for the most part (except for a kind of disappointing first five minutes, in which surprisingly I didn't laugh at all.) All in all, 'The 40 Year Old Virigin' is a good comedy, but nothing Oscar-worthy. It's raunchy, crazy and drop-dead hilarious, but not quite as much as 'Wedding Crashers'. If you are looking for a silly flick, that isn't great but will have you laughing until you either wet yourself or fall out of your chair, spend the time and money seeing 'The 40 Year Old Virgin'.

A Cut Above,"A winning mixture of middle-aged, sentimental rom-com and gross-out frat comedy, this may be one of the year's most pleasant surprises. It's as if the boys from ""Animal House"" never grew up. Women are minefields to be picked through or simply nose-dived and are more mature and sexually aware. The 40 year old virgin of the title is Steve Carell, (the David Brent character in the American version of ""The Office""), who still harbours notions of romantic love while his workmates deride him for 'putting the pussy on a pedestal'. He finds it in the form of the delectable Catherine Keener, (the sexiest grandmother in the movies), and is more than happy when she suggests they don't consummate their relationship, at least not straight away.Decidedly non-pc for most of it's length and often very funny in a scatological hit-and-miss sort of way, this marks the emergence of two new comic talents; Judd Apatow and Steve Carell, who co-wrote the film with Apatow directing and Carell taking the lead. Not quite in the same class as ""Sideways"", (same school of hard knocks), but a cut above most of what passes as American comedy these days.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Clever Raunchy Comedy About Love Life,"The 40 Year Old Virgin is a clever comedy that represents the life about being with your loved ones. Probably what represents the most is people that may or may not have experienced sex. I know there are people that are like Andy and may not be comfortable with sex because of the different types of women that have the certain behavior whether if they're party animals or just overly obsessed with sex, which what makes the writing pretty clever and provide the characters of the love stereotypes that may affect a relationship and hilarious jokes. There are issues that can keep this from being one of the best comedies because of how it can it times be complicated to follow for the first half, but it still was worth a good laugh. This movie isn't really for everyone since this movie is essentially the topic on sex. So I can say that if you're into raunchy comedies, you're most likely gonna have a good time. Or maybe even something useful if you ever want to get the idea of the concept of love life. Happy Valentines Day.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Wonderful depiction of the average, boring, middle-aged man¬Ö but also a virgin! Very innocent indeed.","Judd Apatow's and Steve Carell's characterisation of a 40 year old man replicates how young adults would brand their old man. Dull, immobile and petulant whilst posing in woolly jerseys. Personifying him as a virgin appends another mode of description. Most would find this amusing as generally most of nation lose their virginity from the day they are legal to drop their pants to fool around. Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a charming gentleman but a typical outcast, surrounded by sexual characteristics and hiding a very personal secret. After identifying the bags of sands as metaphor for the chest of a woman, there are those who become apprehensive of his lack of sexual activity. Co-worker David (Paul Rudd) sets out to assist Andy conquer the female anatomy, educating the casualness of intercourse and how to win the hearts of a woman's fine assets.Carell's stage presence has been a pitch of bits and pieces, cameos in Bewitched and the ever-popular journalism comedy Anchorman, starring Will Farrell and Carell's co-forty year old partner Rudd. This could be Carell's big break; this is a startling and valiant effort. He typifies the stereotypical mid-40's male, minus the squabbling teenagers with a vast style and potential to rise as a lead act in future outings that look almost guaranteed on the comedy front. His knowledge of this character is quite remarkable. Although he is of a similar age, to strip back to convey the formulaic maths teacher image is rather amusing in its own qualities. His tone and pitch are on point with no over-expressive weedy exaggerations. This is a character of wonderful intimacy, nurturing his action figure to a polished effect. In contrast, Steve Carell unravels some sheer talents in the comedy locker, unleashing uproarious waves of characteristic sound-effects and squeals to keep up with the tempo of the true nature of the 'giggle'. The delightfully funny nature of the waxing scene not only typifies Carell's wonderful immaturity, but also pictures the orthodox belief of how all men would react to such a meticulous circumstance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Remarkably unfunny and way too long,"Wow! This film is truly awful. I can't imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight. The cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast. The story is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent. The telling, leaden and predictable. No wit, no charm, no humour. Not sexy in the least. The characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake. There's also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on. When your lead (Carrell) is unfunny and unappealing it's uphill from there. Despite it's phony turn-around ending where love triumphs over lust I was left with a sick feeling in my stomach.

Immediately now his three friends (I guess you can call them that) are doing everything in their power to get Carell to have sex for the first time. There are loose women abound in wild clubs, the super-kinky Elizabeth Banks (arguably the best performer in a sexually-charged role) in a nearby bookstore and single mom Catherine Keener who works at an EBay specialty shop. Carell quickly likes Keener, while his pals give him loads of advice (mostly awful) as a thin line develops between having a sexual relationship and just having a meaningful relationship. Super raunchy, disgusting, verbally graphic antics all the way, but still strangely a film that has loads of emotion and heart. The characters all have a list of quirks, but ultimately they are likable and totally believable. Like ""Wedding Crashers"" there is really not much of a brain to be found within, but I liked the final product anyway. Carell and Keener have a subtle chemistry that works. The friends (led by Rudd) are comedic tidal waves and Banks continues to be one of Hollywood's best kept secrets.

Turns vulgarity into sincerity,"Humorously enlightened work from perceptive scribe Apatow, guided by the current master of comedic subtleties, Steve Carell. The lead displays such a knack for inner monologue, albeit it in an overtly comedic way, that he will literally take you to that freshman year place of discomfort that applies to the Andy in all of us. People who are simply too cool, or cold, to know Andy's plight have 3 or 4 excellently fleshed out supporting characters to relate to, ranging the gamut from pot head writer, to playa wannabe- letting everyone, at least every American male, feel engaged dealing with the movie's situations. This movie somehow manages to have the dirtiness of an adult American pie, yet somehow elevates this material to heartfelt sincerity, no small feet indeed. At times the improv heavy scenes could be trimmed a little, especially on the unrated extended version, but if anyone knows how to kill awkward space with even more awkwardness it is Mr Carell.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Before Superbad, there was The 40 Year Old Virgin","I absolutely love the film, Superbad. It is a nice teen sex comedy that is really quotable and really hilarious. But what are my thoughts on the film that came before it? The 40 Year Old Virgin was released in 2005 and stars Steve Carell. The film notably has a huge cast of famous faces like Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Jane Lynch with many other people making cameo appearances as well. Upon release, the film was a critical and financial success. While technically a sequel has not been made, a parody film titled : The 41 Year Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It. From what I hear, it sucks but perhaps I might watch it eventually.Andy is 40 years old and works at an electronics store. But he has a big secret. He is a virgin. When some of his fellow co-workers get wind of this, they decide to try and get Andy to do it. Andy meets a woman named Trish and could she possibly be the one?For the record, I watched the extended Unrated version of this film that makes this film run past the two hour mark. No problem though, I actually enjoyed this film. Sure, it is literally the same old stuff that is always put out by Judd Apatow. With that being said, it is rather unique. What other film out there (besides The 41 Year Old Virigin) has a plot like this? The story is handled well here. The characters react in the same fashion that anyone would react when you meet a 40 year old virgin which is kind of the joke. I love how Andy's friends (though there is some debate on whether or not they are actually his friends) who mean well, take Andy through all of these hilarious ventures. Sure, it gets a bit formulaic but it is still funny. A minor complaint would be when Andy meets Trish which kind of happens. I don't find relationships like that to be very plausible and it is annoying when things like that happen in movies. But, when they do start spending time together it is rather nice. The characters are portrayed rather nicely as well with Carrell giving a great performance as someone who is the opposite of a chick magnet. Everyone is really funny in this film. Even the cameos are really hilarious too. Kevin Hart anyone? Though some of my criticism for this film does go towards this film's comedy. Yes it is funny. But a lot of it is not PC. There are uses of the N-word which is fine when a black person says it but when someone who is not black says it, that is where I have a problem. This specific instance only occurs once thankfully. There is a difference when a white person says the N-word in say a civil rights movie or a civil war movie because it makes sense. But in this film, I think it is uneccessary. There are still other jokes that do cross that line for me but there are not that many. Aside from that, the comedy is the type of raunchy comedy that is in every Judd Apatow film. There are some memorable scenes like the wax scene. The funny thing is is that some of these scenes were improvised which I am a huge fan of that is when it is done with great effect and it is done with great effect in this film.The 40 Year Old Virgin, while nothing new from Apatow, is still a funny film that gives me a good laugh. I would recommend this film only to those who are really into the sex comedies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A pretty funny movie.,"Lately comedies have been going really down hill, but I have to say, this one is pretty funny.This movie is about Andy, a 40 year old nerd who collects action figures, spends his weekends shopping for materials to make a sandwich, works in an electronics store, oh, and he's never had sex. When his co-workers find this out, they go on a mission to get him a one night stand, but disaster awaits him at every try.All of the performances are pretty funny. Steve Carell is really making a name for himself with comedies now, and he's getting more and more offers...Rightfully so. This movie is non-stop funny, and it has some truth in it too.

I think my first time might be your best time too. Well I knew it, you know what? I knew that you'd react that way and I knew that you would want to lead me through my first sexual encounter will all the compassion and care that someone would give to their soul-mate."" There are so many films about romance. Too many. With titles floating around every year that just make the mark harder to reach for the next batch, where will we be in 15 years? Hopefully, some of the better writer's will always find the new humor, without resorting to current trendiness and eventually retread on the field of romantic film. Romeo and Juliet deserves a better remake? Bah, let the kids take it as they got it, I say. No need to follow the script to a 't', anymore. Too much is on the line with American media for it to admit it, but romantic comedies are so easy that it's actually harder to get attention at the box office.The 90's were a prime example of the ""way too much of a good thing"" theory. We all need that moment in the theater with a spouse or loved one around one arm, with one in a popcorn bucket. The balance is good. But the quantity of these movies released seems a bit brash. The point is, since ""There's Something About Mary"", we've all been waiting for the next troupe of filmmakers to fill the Fareley Brothers shoes.""You know what my problem is? I am not interesting. What am I supposed to say I went to magic camp? That I'm an accomplished ventriloquist? Oh, I am the 7th degree imperial yo-yo master."" No wonder, then, that it took a mockumentary specialist of the likes of Steve Carell to bring the life back to the perpetual stream of love-shmuckery in modern cinema. Carell, fresh of his stint on ""The Daily Show"", co-wrote ""40 Year Old Virgin"" with ""Anchorman"" director, Judd Apatow (which Steve also starred in.) Carell, himself has a charisma that allows first name approach to even the most unacquainted viewer. Shortly after ""40 Year Old"", Carell went on to command the reigns of popular TV show ""The Office"", playing in a similar business-type setting as the one in ""Virgin."" It is also probably of no surprise that the film ""Virgin"" contains some of it's most brilliant mockeries of culture in segments that totally exclude opposite gender reactionary stunts. For example, the poker scene near the beginning of the film should be listed, in my personal opinion, as one of the most funny scenes in film-making history. In it, we see five well-ab-led men in their middle ages (late 20's to late 30's) make total asses of themselves for each other around a table of gambles. As the Arabic fellow leaves the scene, we get a real taste of how down-right grungy the characters will be in the movie. How fitting, once again, that a film of such improportionate standards takes on cultural symbology and does a total script-flip on the idea of stereotypes, right? It doesn't do much good to really explore the depths of the film, without viewing it for yourself. ""40 Year Old Virgin"", is certainly one of those few movies that you need to be there to get the humor. Yet, nonetheless, the film remains attractive and utmost hilarious during just about every segment that it rustles out of it's pockets like a forlorn drunk scrambling to pay up his tab after an unsuccessful night at the bar.The lengths that the actors went to for the sake of comedy are, as such, mostly unscripted and spontaneously set up to explode on impact. Steve Carell even went in for a real chest hair removal job without special effects, for the film. Now where else are you going to get that realness? Objectively, the film demands attention. Subjectively? Forget it. I just hope guys who go and see this flick have already gotten their share of play with the female gender. Feelings will get hurt, quite easily, otherwise.""Do you ever notice how... like, in a relationship... one person's always like 'blah blah blah blah' and the other person's like 'What are you talking about?' and one person's like 'blah blah blalablah...'""",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Half the audience had walked out within 15 minutes.,I lasted 20 minutes. There wasn't one funny line or situation in the film up to the time I left. The dialog was made up of words describing sex organs or sexual situations. Unfortunately that's all there was. There was nothing clever or new. It sounded as though the writers copied some junior high school boys showing off the new words they have just learned. The few attempts at jokes were so predictable that nobody laughed. The interviews with the producer promised that the DVD would contain material that couldn't be used in the film. He could have added the first 15 minutes of this film to the unused material. Maybe more of the audience would have stayed longer. I'll never know because I have no intention of wasting more money on the DVD.,1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Mostly amusing and funny film that isn't overwhelmed by crudity even if it uses it,"When it was released I never got round to seeing this film and it started to drift away into the mist of my memory until recently when I made an effort to catch it. The reason for this was partly the good things I had heard about it and also the fact that it sort of was the film that started the seemingly endless parade of Judd Apatow films. At times I think this is a good thing but then too often I find his films to be pretty base and lacking the imagination and wit I would like. I thought that perhaps 40 Year Old Virgin would be different because of it being his first hit as director. Of course the title should have given me pause to think on that but I went ahead anyway.What I found was a film that has a bit of what I dislike about Apatow and also a bit of what I do. The plot is a simple one and does a typical soppy narrative that we have seen from him other places ¬ñ crude laughs but ultimately love comes through. This allows for essentially a series of sketches where Andy attempts to break out of his rut with his ""friends"" guiding him on the way. Some of these are pretty funny and some of these are quite weak but mostly they are amusing. The only parts that really fell flat for me were moments of comic racism between a black character and an Asian character ¬ñ these were not funny and they gave me an odd feeling given they were written by white men. Outside of this the film does have the ""sex comedy"" air of geek wish-fulfilment that again Apatow trades in ¬ñ it does nothing for me this side of his work but I can understand why it does for others.Part of the reason I did enjoy the film is Carell. Unlike Rogen's turns as leading man for Apatow, Carell has more ""likeablity"" to him and is also a much better comic. Where Rogen blunders Carell is subtle and clever. Of course we are still talking about a sex comedy so I'm not suggesting he is amazing but he is funny and his performance is bang on. Malco, Rudd and Rogen are good in supporting roles though and all three do this well. Keener works well with Carell to make this thread actually work reasonably well, while Banks is just left with looking hot and being sexy ¬ñ which she does well enough for this film.40 Year Old Virgin got rave reviews and continues to be looked back on fondly but I'm not seeing it myself. The comedy is crude at times but mostly it is amusing with only one or two failures along the way. It isn't hilarious and it is very much an Apatow film (which means good things and bad things) but is helped by the cast playing to their strengths (eg Carell in the lead, Rogen in support) producing a generally amusing and funny film that dabbles with but is never overwhelmed by crudity or geek wish-fulfilment.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Comedy, nothing more","This movie is nothing more than a comedy. A very good one that is. This is a nice down to earth comedy about sex, or lack thereof.This is a well written movie. The characters are great. They're charming and believable. You really feel for the poor guy. The dialog is good. There are punch-lines, but it's not the kind of movie where all the characters always say the right thing at the right time, bombarding each other with punch-lines. That's what makes this movie so down to earth and charming. It's also what makes you relate to the character. Never the less, they've still managed to make a good dialog and make it funny. The rest of the story is also funny. Maybe because it's rather simple. You don't need to think or pay very close attention to know what's going on. There's just the storyline with the main character and no other sub-plots. The other characters supports the lead in a good way and it's they who really makes the film move forward. All together this is a funny and well written story.The actors really got the hang of this. Steve Carell is great in the lead as Andy Stitzer. His performance is down to earth and believable. He really got that little boyish and geeky look and behavior. As for the rest of the cast they do a great job in supporting him. They portrays their characters good and gives a truly good performance.There is not much to say about the cinematography. It's good, but not fantastic. There's nothing special about it, it's just plain and good. It works well. The sets and decorations are nice. There are nothing special about them neither, but they look good. The costumes are also nice. They forms and gives an impression of the characters at once and work very good.Lyle Workman scored this movie nicely. It's a score it's there, but nothing more.

Sex Comedy That Keeps Its Trousers On,"I would cautiously venture that not many men who have made it into their fifth decade without doing the deed get the opportunity to break their duck with nymphomaniac, hard-bodied, blonde book-shop assistants, busty, wardrobe-malfunctioning speed-daters or, for that matter, Catherine Keener. But the fact that these are the potential partners put in front of our hero here, reminds us that 40-Year-Old Virgin is, first and foremost, a bawdy sex comedy, despite the critical acclaim and hints of depth.And our hero's name is Andy. He's polite, clean-cut and conscientious, rides around on a bike and collects action figures, but his workmates at the computer store think he could well be a serial killer. One night, during an illicit game of poker on the shop floor, the testosterone is flowing and Andy's swiftly concocted sex tales are less than convincing. His new buddies twig that he's a virgin and decide to help him rectify the situation.Quickly, the crux is established: For all their bravado posturing, Andy's colleagues are considerably less fulfilled than he is. Wise-cracking Jay (Romany Malco) may act the player, but he is hen-pecked and insecure; David (Paul Rudd) is still pining over a lost love from the distant past; and wild man Cal (Seth Rogen) lurches from day to day in booze-fuelled, over-sexed stupor (OK, so his life may be more fulfilling¬Ö)Despite some false starts with an array of unsuitable though aesthetically pleasing women (this IS a sex comedy, if you remember), Andy eventually finds the perfect partner in ""hot grandmother"" Trish (Keener). Now if only he can get his rocks offAnd here's the clever bit. Andy is a grown man. A little repressed, certainly, but he still has the world-weariness of someone who has experienced many of life's petty annoyances. It would have been easier comedically to make him some kind of desperate oaf ¬ñ a constantly horny dog who humps legs and chases schoolgirls down the street. But if you get to 40 and have never done it, it is likely that you simply aren't that fussed. Steve Carrell plays Andy perfectly with a child-like quality but no sinister perversions.This can be seen in the very first scene, where he goes about his morning business with a persistent erection. It's a nice parody of Porky's ¬ñ only here there is no furtive self-gratification, it is just part of the routine. For a puerile concept, this is a film that actually explores sexuality. A bit. Obviously, it loses its nerve on occasion as Carrell lapses into Saturday Night Live mode, but the intentions are good.Take the time-honoured masturbation scene. Instead of the standard montage of sensitive guy exposed to a barrel-load of smut, mistakes lube for super glue hilarity, Andy can't get into it and ends up chortling contentedly to an innocent episode of Everybody Loves Raymond.Indeed, these offbeat endings to such telegraphed set-ups are what give the film an edge over traditional preppy skin flicks. The beauty (if that is the right word) of the American Pie franchise, Wedding Crashers et al is that we can see the pay-off (apple pie defilement etc) coming a mile away. Here Carrell's Andy is ambiguous enough to surprise us with the way he handles certain lewdly choreographed scenarios.It's not all high praise. For starters it is absurdly long for a film of this nature. Some of the scenes in the middle don't go anywhere, and while this adds to the quirky, unpredictable feel, the actual ending (when it finally arrives) is oddly uninspiring. Perhaps this is supposed to represent the inevitable anticlimax of your first sexual experience, which would be an extremely bold cinematic statement, but probably not that bright. Anyway, there follows a bizarre musical post-script that has been cunningly cribbed from every Farrelly brothers movie ever made, and by that stage I was fuming as I had missed most of Match of the Day ¬ñ so anyone expecting a higher rating can blame it on that.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
More than just a sex comedy,"The cast is so great- Steve Carrel, Paul Rudd & Seth Rogen in the most Seth Rogen movie.Comedy is smart, the wax scene is iconic, its shocking to hear that it was actually done to get real life reactions from the cast. It is not a CGI but real hair were used ;)They find great situational comedy in the mix, the sex-ed class was great, the questions actualy feels like a kid or 40-year old virgin would ask.The morning wood scene was so pure that I don't know why I haven't seen many movies with that. The supporting characters feel like actual friends. The movie has some small messages with Steve Carrel being himself with his toys and others trying to change him for social norms.The ending is cliche but the movie had a smile on my face through out the run time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funniest thing to come out of Hollywood in quite some time...,"""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is an inspired comedy, one that blends blue sexual humor, the perceptions of males and females, and an uncommon tenderness to great cinematic success. But perhaps most impressive is how the title--which seems to promise a sex farce in the ""Porky""'s vein--subverts our expectations; against the image of a beaming, plain-clothed Steve Carell, we receive a farce with its own juvenile tendencies, made hilarious and relatable by a character who is seemingly past his sexual prime. Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a character that Hollywood often relegates to quirky supporting roles: introverted, modest guy working in retail, surrounded by friends who are as cocky as they are confident. While I'm not quite 40, ""Virgin"" presents Andy as a character most men would be able to relate to at some point in their sexual lives, and is therefore instantly likable. His reluctant efforts to score with women (persuaded by his co-workers), using different methods to pick them up, all while keeping his intended mate at arm's length, is more than a bit indicative of the oft-insecure methods of men. The script, by Carell and director Judd Apatow, is crude but layered, giving us characters who are shaded with quirks that act as amplifications of typical human behavior (one coworker has an obsessive love/hate relationship with his ex)...and when Andy finally meets his mate, the domestic humor stems from a strong sense of realism. Past the wonderful performances and the 'LOL' comedy present, it is this situational realism that gives ""Virgin"" such an endearing charm.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Middle-Aged 'American Pie',"""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" was a huge box-office hit and elected one of the best comedies of 2005. Thus, when I rented the unrated DVD last weekend, I was expecting a very funny movie. I was disappointed. There isn't even a truly funny moment in this silly gross-out piece. Just the usual dirty jokes, some nudity and the main character's stupid friends. Steve Carell's performance as a middle-aged Jason Biggs didn't quite convince me.I have seen worse movies, but that's not enough to recommend ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"".

"Funny, but WAY too long!!","The 40 Year Old Virgin is one of the funniest movies of 2005. It is not afraid to actually have some crude, sex humour. This movie also shows that Steve Carell is going to go far. The writing, acting and directing is very, very good for a comedy.Well, the plot isn't too hard to follow (see title). It is about Andy, a 40 year old virgin. He tells some of his work mates about this, and they make it their duty to get him laid as soon as possible. Along this journey, we encounter some very funny people and situations.From what I see, The 40 Year Old Virgin is targeted at younger audiences. I found this hilarious, my mum on the other hand, hated it. It has plenty of sex jokes/humour, tons of language and many scenes of brief nudity. There is an Indian who loves to swear, a joke about a horse and a woman and plenty of scenes that will make you squirm with embarrassment.The one major quarrel I have with this movie is that it is WAY too long. The uncut version, running over 2 hours, is just too long for a movie like this. There are plenty of scenes that could have been trimmed to keep this at around the 100 minute mark. Aside from that, I have no other problems with this superb comedy.3¬Ω/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hilariously Funny!!,"The 40-Year-Old Virgin is a romantic comedy film directed by Judd Apatow. The film stars Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen.40-year-old Andy Stitzer, who works at a big-box store, is a virgin and deals with female customers awkwardly. Things become interesting when a romance develops between him and Trish, an entrepreneur.This film is undoubtedly hilariously funny. The viewers may find this film as vulgar or foul but that is the theme of the film and nowhere you'll feel that the vulgarity is imposed or forced upon.The screenplay of the film is also funny and hilarious and the film will make you laugh on constant intervals.Acting is superb and apart from Carell it's the trio of Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen who makes the film hilariously funnier to watch.The end of the film gets little predictable but still

A sweet and raunchy comedy classic...,"I've been enjoying ""The Office"" in my 22-minute sitcom slot, which I'd never seen, and that led to ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" If you only know Steve Carell from his serious work on ""Morning Show"" (where he's not at all likeable), it's fun to see him in his breakout comedic role, with his impeccable timing, awkward charm, and genuine likeability as an actor. A mix of raunchy humor and genuine sweetness, it really is a standout comedy from the early aughts. It's aged well, retaining its humor and heart, though some of the dialogue wouldn't fly today (though it didn't bother me). The entire cast is great, and it's fun to see Jane Lynch, Seth Rogen, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, and many others early in their careers. If you haven't seen this in a long time, it's a good one to rewatch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Ahhhh Kelly Clarkson!,"The Good: The 2000s were a GOOD TIME for comedy and the 40 Year Old Virgin is probably amongst the most iconic films of the era. When this movie is firing on all cylinders, it's honestly one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The dynamic between Carrell, Rogen, Rudd and Malco is amazing. The dialog is filthy, but it still feels...mature. It's not about gross out humour, it's about sex. The good, the bad and the ugly.This movie is genius for how it compresses what for most of us would be a lifetime of POVs and depictions of sex into one man's journey. Andy starts off just wanting to get laid, he tries for casual stuff, he tries speed dating...but then realizes sex is about more than the physical act. A LOT more. It's something I think most of us go through and it's a surprisingly mature and nuanced view of the topic.The performances are generally fantastic. Everyone is having such a blast and is elite with the comic timing. I love when comedies create a world that's just a little more funny than ours is; the side characters get fantastic moments and more often than not, steal the show. The mix of improv and writing - a trend that would unfortunately crash and burn as the 2010s emerged - felt fresh and fun here. It's clear Apatow took what worked, but he didn't rely on funny guys to just ""do funny stuff"" on screen instead of writing a good script and story.Outside of that dynamic, and Andy's search for love and sex, the movie slows down towards the middle and focuses on his relationship with Trish. After the filthy dialog and set pieces, the more emotional tone of the middle works wonders. Although there are some issues, generally, I thought Carrell and Keener had fantastic chemistry. Carrell in particular is just awesome here; he conveys so much from just a glance and he really feels like his character and disappears into his role.The Bad: Unfortunately, The 40 Year Old Virgin was a harbinger for another negative Apatow trend: the length of the movie. This film doesn't need to be nearly 2 hours long. While the main 4 guys are great together, you get the sense watching it that the filmmakers didn't want to edit anything at points and...it shows.The Ugly: This movie was the beginning of a comedic renaissance that would burn brightly, but not for long. I absolutely love this movie and have seen it countless times at this point; it's funnier to me every time I watch it.When I first saw it, I was 14 years old and honestly...didn't understand much. Because, I didn't understand sex. I'd...never had it before. As time went on, the more and more I appreciated about this movie and to be honest, that's as good a sign of any that this movie, for all of its vulgarity and offensive humour, was really on to something.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Scores a 7 ... just,"I actually did laugh out loud a couple of times when I went to see this in the cinema, which can be pretty rare for me. The title's pretty self explanatory so no need for any plot summaries but suffice to say, you'll get almost what you expect. For me this movie was a bit over hyped. I can see that the score for this movie is coming down a bit recently from where it was and due to the timing, can only suspect that this has a little to do with US humour vs. rest of the world humour. Also, it must be noted that leading man Carrell is the main character in the US version of ""The Office"" which may (or may not) be lending extra weight to his role here and indeed be contributing to jokes which non-US viewers may not get. The movie, as I say, has its funny moments but these tend to be toward the start rather than nearer the end. Like most comedies, it loses its bite half way through and ends up concentrating more on the emotions and relationships rather than purely on the laughs. I found the ending to this to be especially weak and failed to see the relevance of the ""musical element"", unless the makers were trying to be kooky, which never really works when one tries too hard. Not bad but, due to being about 10-15 minutes overlong because of the repetition of some jokes, not as great as I'd hoped.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005) **1/2,"Not a great film, but a sincere and pretty funny one as we follow the trials of a good natured middle-aged geek named Andy (played by Steve Carell) who has yet to have sex with a woman. He's an introverted loner living by himself whose idea of an exciting weekend is making egg salad and painting his toy models. His buddies at the local electronics shop where they all work are a fun group of typical horny male characters, each around ten years younger than Andy, who try everything possible to break their inexperienced friend in, setting him up with women and passing on some of their own personal strategies for dealing with the opposite sex.Much to this film's credit, it isn't afraid to go over the line with occasional non-PC jokes and ideas in a day and age where everyone is so ultra-sensitive to everything. The cheap toilet humor and sex gags actually work very well amidst all this, aided greatly by a charming performance by Carell in the lead part, who actually makes his character of Andy very likable and almost even manages to make virginity seem cool. It was also refreshing to see an older and more down-to-earth love interest as portrayed by Catherine Keener for a change, instead of the usual ""Beverly Hills 90210"" bimbos we're bombarded with all the time.The audience I saw this with in the theater loved every minute and were in hysterics, adding to the fun. I've never seen my wife laugh so hard either; she howled so much, she was coughing and lost her breath! It's become a favorite film of hers and she's bought the ""Unrated"" DVD. We watched the extended version with 17 added minutes at home again recently and I recall it being a little better in its shorter theatrical version. But maybe that's just me. Oh, and one minor reminder -- not all of us guys who enjoy monster films and collecting movie memorabilia are clueless nerds who've never made love to a woman. **1/2 out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I hated hated hated this movie!,"""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" exists in a world I don't understand. A world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to ""f*** off"" and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded. A world where it's really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other peoples' cars. A world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underlings. A world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without any funny jokes! I am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie. I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch - not very funny to begin with, and stretched out beyond all rational thought. The chest-waxing scene went on FOREVER.The characters, aside from Carell, were totally one-note. And the romantic elements were completely contrived, particularly the scene where Keener finds porn in Carell's apartment. That was just lame.And I also found the ""Aquarius"" sequence totally annoying and excessive. I hated hated hated this movie!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Raunchy adult entertainment. Cruel but refined.,"No matter what, there's no denying this film is funny, even hysterically funny at times. Steve Carrell is perfect in the title role as the sweet-natured and reclusive Andy Stitzer, a 40-year old virgin, who works in an electronic store, lives alone in a nice apartment between his hand-painted model soldiers and vintage action figures (in the original packaging, never opened), never goes out on weekends, never meets any women, and never had sex. Everything seems fine and Andy is content with his lonely no-friends, no-women existence, until one day, during some trash talking about women with his randy colleagues at the electronic store (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco and Seth Rogen), he describes a woman's breasts like 'a bag of sand', and exposes himself as a virgin. Soon, they all engage on a series of well-meant and hilarious trials to get Andy laid, like speed-dating, waxing his chest (Carrel did it for real), and teaching him the fine art of the dating game and the pick-up line. But then he meets Trish (a glorious Catherine Keener), a 40-year old single mom with three children, who works across the street of the electronics store, selling people's stuff at Ebay (???), Andy not only goes for nooky, he also wants a lasting meaningful relationship with this woman.Steve Carrell touches just the right note here while he manages to get himself in a string of extremely embarrassing situations, and it's admirable how he can play this kind of straight guy loser with a golden heart in such a believable fashion. The supporting cast is excellent. Jane Lynch, Andy's boss at the electronics store, is simply marvelous in a seemingly effortless comic role. Watch that improvisation scene with Seth Roger (it's improv but it seems written, outstanding), or Elizabeth Banks, who works at the bookstore, my god, is she funny! And let's not forget Catherine Keener. Her part was well-written, but she transcends the writing and creates something fully her own, a wonderful character. I loved her in almost every film she was in, but here she not only shows she is one of the greatest actresses around, but also one with incredible comedic skills.The characters are well-written and well developed. This is in no way the kind of film that looks down on virgins and only vindicates them when they finally do it, more Porky's style, to draw a broad comparison. I could have done without the ""Hair""-like dancing scene in the end, but well, such a gross-out ending is perhaps a fitting way to end a film like this. Amidst the barrage of mediocre and painfully unfunny comedies in recent years, like ""The Wedding Crashers"" (I really hated that one), this one really sticks out. It's definitely not for the easily offended, but despite many of the crude jokes, it never sinks to just tits-and-ass levels or plain crudeness. The film has the courage to believe in its own convictions. Great raunchy fun with a real heart.Camera Obscura --- 9/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Wow! The funniest movie of the 2000's.,"This movie is funny. This movie is very funny. In fact, this movie is so funny, that it would break the most intelligent computer that tried to count exactly how many HUGE laughs were in it. Steve Carell stole a major scene in Bruce Almighty, played a hilariously random retard in Anchorman, and now, he finally gets a big break in The 40 Year Old Virgin, which recently beat Wedding Crashers as what I consider the funniest comedy of the 2000's.You can guess what the movie's about. Andy is 40, and he's a virgin. He has a major toy collection, a good job, and is just an all-out nice guy. He's just so hopelessly nerdy, that he has never succeeded with girls. When his friends find out about his celibate life, they set out to help him lose his virginity. They recommend that he hit on the most drunk woman he can find, but Andy doesn't think it's right. He sets his sights on a single mother, Trish, and when they start going out, Andy's friends are proud that he's going to finally do it. But Andy doesn't care about sex. He and Trish form a no-sex policy.This movie while fall-down, flat-out hysterical has it's share of drama. It's actually got a good message, that says you can wait to have sex for as long as you think is necessary. There are some fairly serious moments. The trailers make it look like a dumb, vulgar, and random sex- comedy. But it's not dumb. It's actually so intelligent, that some people may not find it funny. But I sure did. The waxing scene, and the poker game are my favorites. Also, this movie is FILTHY. Sex dominates every scene, and even when it's not actually happening, it's being discussed in the most graphic terms imaginable. The profanity is non-stop as well. It was however to see some good R rated comedies lately, and I hope for more to come. This movie was so funny, it's hard to believe a movie can actually be this funny. 10/10.It is rated R for Pervasive Sexual Content, Language, and some Drug Use.

The Best Comedy of the Year!!!,"Judd Apatow and Steve Carell, we'll be seeing their names for a long time, but right now, after highly praised but little seen cult TV Series (Freaks and Geeks, Undeclared for Apatow) and supporting roles in big comedies (Brick in Anchorman, The Daily Show for Carell), they team up to write, and one directs and the other stars in The 40 Year Old Virgin, the Best Comedy of the Year. And yes, I loved Wedding Crashers too.Like that Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson laugh fest, the movie is rated R and thank God they're making a comeback after way too many PG-13 stuff. Rob Schneider's Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo didn't make money but at least it made great use of its rating, and Apatow and Carell do too.Carell stars in the as Andy, a middle age electronics store clerk who's never had sex. Ever. He tried when he was younger, but after some disastrous attempts he just gave up. It was less humiliating to just forget about it than to keep his hopes up that it may actually happen one day. So he now runs from women and spends his nights watching Survivor with his old neighbor, playing online video games or playing with his many, many toys. He also never learned how to drive a car so he drives a bicycle to work everyday. Paul Rudd (Brian Fantana in Anchorman), Romany Malco and Seth Rogen (he's been in everything Apatow) costar as Andy's coworkers who find out about his situation. How they find out is great, during a night of poker they are telling each other's sex stories and when it's Andy's turn he gives one of the most pathetic tales ever told, and they quickly catch that he's a virgin. They love it though, and decide it's their new job to get him laid. Of course, they tell everybody they know about it.I won't give out the rest of the story away because there are lots of hilarious situations including a kinky library worker from next door played by Elizabeth Banks, Katherine Keener is also there as Andy's potential love interest Trish (don't worry, the love story doesn't get cheesy) and there's also David Koechner (Anchorman's Champ) who shows up for a scene in which Andy takes Trish's daughter to a sex clinic of some kind for kids who have answers about sex, and it ends up with Andy asking more questions than her.But one of the absolutely funniest scenes ever is the waxing scene shown briefly in the trailer. You could tell that it was all real pain because his screams were so authentic and you could see it in the other actors' faces that they were not in character, they were really laughing at the situation. And then the blood on his chest. It was really great.Apatow is a genius and he knows how to write comedy. The situations in the movie are real and the dialogue is hard core, and at times it sounds like it's too much, but is not, that's what those characters would say in those situations. And lots of stuff besides the waxing scene was improvised and so everything looks very natural and so the laughs are truly non-stop. Steve Carell almost stole the show in Anchorman, rules The Office and after this role, he's sure join the elite group of movie comics that Will Ferrell currently tops. Sadly, Ferrell doesn't make an appearance here so there's no Channel 4 News Team reunion but the movie doesn't need it, because again, The 40 Year Old Virgin is the Best Comedy of the Year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Best Comedy In 40 Years,"This comedy's principal achievement is in its laid back, shrugged shoulders attitude. When you can take life as not-so-seriously, even being a virgin past age 17 is solvable. For those less fortunate (in either sense), this comedy shows the way.This film combines a gross-out teenage comedy, slapstick oldie, a life-is-easier-without-sex message (i.e. 7th Heaven) and an overarching touching love story whose ever-present cheesiness is kept in check thanks to the actors' sincerity and casual delivery.The one-liners are so good, you'll share them with friends for the few hours after getting out of the movie. The best part is knowing you share a similar critical review and reaction to the film.This film pushes the R-rating with bestiality, porn clips, condom installation, legs wrapped around a male pelvis, bare breasts in public, vaginal models, husky seduction (use your imagination on that one), female masturbation, and the standard bed scene, but those watching the film aren't likely to cringe. Except maybe at ... oh, let's not spoil it.Too many formulaic comedies trained me to expect a twist at any second, but this comedy's not doing so actually bucks that standard and leaves a very pleasant, heart-warming aftertaste. This pleasant nod to reality and real lives raises the film's reality and believability in addition to the aforementioned actors' sincerity and talents. The ease with which the actor's chemistries happen is a wonderful testimony to both writing and casting.I saw it because Steve Carell was so wonderfully self-effacing in the American version of the BBC's ""The Office"". His talent again shines enormously. This movie is very much not my usual type of brooding, intellectual, and philsophical film which radically and permanently changes one's thinking, but I laughed clear through the entire film. Let's hope Carrell's not type cast into the self-reducing type of role, but even if he is, he brings smiles and laughs to all as he does so. Correspondingly, Keener's bright, shining, simply radiant presence in the film gives such wonderful goodness to the film's believability. She doesn't over- or under-play her part, but it seemingly entirely comfortable as the hot grandma whose temporary romantic woes are the woes of many.The film's ending credits are stunning in a way in which I hope more movies do so, but I won't spoil it.

Apatow films,"The ending of this film totally ruins the experience. These guys¬ÖThey like to have fun with film-making, singing stupid songs like ""Afternoon Delight"" in that scene from ""Anchorman""; but that strategy won't work all the time. It doesn't work at all in the ending of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", a honestly made comedic film.So about these guys¬ÖJudd Apatow has a company that produces films, films like ""Anchorman"". I think the man is proposing a new way of real comedy, with intelligent humor. The intelligence sometimes ironically proposes that stupidity can be the correct way of making people laugh. Apatow knows this, and he knows the people that can achieve it.""Anchorman"" was written by director Adam McKay and star Will Ferrell. The cast included Paul Rudd, David Koechner and Steve Carell. Apatow produced Will Ferrell's recent ""Kicking & Screaming""; gave Paul Rudd a role; lend David Koechner a cameo; and co-wrote with Steve Carell his first full-length feature, about a virgin with forty years.Carell stars; he's becoming quite ""the funny guy"" these days. He produced this film, and it seems he wants to make a fool out of himself by playing the fool, but that's exactly the reason; because he knows he has a gift for absurd comedy and he knows he'll make us laugh out loud with character like Andy in a movie like this. It is called self-confidence, and it is a great and basic quality in a comedian.I don't know any 40 year old man who's a virgin. I know adults that have their toys, adults that have their action figures, but no virgins. It is an issue, a serious one, and one that can be ridiculed in excess. Apatow and his partners deal with it truthfully, from the point of view of love relationships, making the ride very sincere.Carell's Andy works with pals David (the always natural Paul Rudd), Jay (a funny Romany Malco), Cal (the very promising Seth Rogen) and the foreigner Mooj (Gerry Bednop), who always encourages people to have sex with a goat (situations that repeat constantly so we understand the film's language). Besides being 40, Andy's social situation is difficult.When Cal talks to him about the weekend, he says he went to Tijuana and saw a woman having sex with a horse. ""What did you do?"", he asks Andy. ""Well, I felt I really needed an egg sandwich, so I bought the egg and spent three and a half hours making the sandwich, but then I didn't feel like eating it; and I didn't even have bread"". Cal pretends to shoot himself while Andy doesn't look.These situations the virgin experiences with all his co-workers, developing a friendship that originally comes from their objective: getting this man in bed. Eventually Trish comes into his life. She's played convincingly by Catherine Keener, and has kids and Andy starts dealing with them, the relationship grows but with absolutely no sex involved. This is all very well written and is the best of the film; Andy's talks with Trish's daughter Marla (Kat Dennings) and ultimately a scene of a misunderstanding that delivers an unforgettable line, by an unimportant character: ""Dude, teach me!"" It's awesome.The time will come for Andy to reveal the truth and you'll laugh constantly meanwhile, and in the end you'll realize that this is a good comedy of good intentions, that Judd Apatow is more a planner than a director (he directed correctly and simply an idea he wanted to develop), and that Steve Carell is a natural comedian; and he's got it going on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not as good as its IMDb rating,"I guess the high IMDb rating is more a reflection on the dearth of funny films than the actual comedy value of this movie.The movie starts well but the sex jokes go on - and on - and on - and eventually the film runs out of steam. But it's an OK movie - maybe 5 or 6 out of 10 - and definitely one of the funnier films of the last five years.Just don't expect a side-splitting 90 minutes. The humour is very adult so avoid this movie if you are easily offended. But if you're broad-minded and don't expect too much, you will enjoy this short, funny and entertaining film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Like a sick mind in the right place.,"As we all know the sub-genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded. Simply being excessively raunchy isn't enough anymore. I've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days.Coming into the 40 Year Old Virgin I knew basically what to expect; I did see the commercials after all; ""is it true that if you don't use it, you lose it?"" What I didn't expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development. There's still the weird ""off-the-wall"" characters that we see so much in Adam Sandler movies and there's still enough inappropriate language to sink Noah's Ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message.The main character Andy is (unfortunately for me) a person I can relate to. In the first shot I see that he even shares my love for Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the movie on his wall) and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities. Andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology. Andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. Most importantly of all; Andy is a nice person, he doesn't swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them. Combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he's a serial murderer. It's like my life story.The other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way Andy does. I felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie.I suppose since I mentioned one flaw I might as well bring the other noticeable one to light. The story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go; it's quite simple. It deals with Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what's going to happen in the end. Sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what's going to happen in the end, and I assure you it does. These are definitely small stains on the movie but there's so much good here that I can easily ignore it's few faults.When I say ""good"" I mean ""bad"" of course. This is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad. For the most part I think it succeeded. There are so many hilarious scenes such as Andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene where Andy goes with his Trish's daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else. Ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence ""Ooh! Como se llama!"" An interesting little note about that scene; the actor Steve Carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real. Of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part.Actually since we're talking about Steve Carell, I'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since I didn't even know who he was prior to seeing this film. I was just so impressed by his writing, acting and timing that I now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles. This man has talent it The 40 Year Old Virgin proves that.To be honest I had doubts about this film but early word was positive and I knew it was something I was eventually going to see. I'm glad that I did too since it's probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching. It's not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather it's a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance.

The 40 Year Old Virgin,"The 40 Year Old Virgin, is about Andy Stitzer, a forty year old man who works in an electronic store and doesn't have much of a social life and is very awkward around women. Some of his co-workers at the store invite him out one night and they discover that Andy, is still a virgin so they plan to help him lose his virginity. One day in the store Andy, meets a woman named Trish, who gives him her phone number and eventually Andy, works up enough courage to go on a date with her and they start to really like each other but Andy, is still very awkward when it comes to sex and he is going to have to tell this to Trish, much to his embarrassment if he can actually get up enough courage to tell her before things get awkward. The 40 Year Old Virgin, has good direction, a good script, good comedic performances by the whole cast, good cinematography and good film editing. The film stars and is co-written by Steve Carell, who does a very good comedic breakthrough performance and his writing for the film is very good too. I was very pleasantly surprised with this film. It is sweet, funny, entertaining, fun, enjoyable, clever, good natured and a good time. This film is just as good as this year's Wedding Crashers, and both films are two of the best comedies I have seen in awhile. The 40 Year Old Virgin, really showcases a lot of talent and it is put to good use and it works as a comedy and a romance and it is sweet and a lot of fun. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"It's alright, but save your money","First of all, I have to admit that the movie did make me laugh, but not that hard. I guess i expected a way funnier movie, but the jokes were kind of immature and sick. The back and forth of ""you know why your gay"" was really lame and not funny at all, and the thing is you could tell it was set up to be one of the funniest parts of the movie, but it just did not deliver at all. But the one part that was funny, and was over promoted in commercials was the waxing scene. That scene alone was probably the only thing that made this movie likable for me. There were so many points in the movie they could have capitalized on, especially with the Indian guy.I honestly expected a funnier movie, but i found the jokes to be just plain dumb and have no intelligence to them.

Funny But Overrated,"There are many humorous moments in this film, and kudos to the creators of it for making an adult movie for adults, but I think the praise heaped on it has made it out to be a much better movie than it is. Given the desultory crop of summer movies we've been subjected to in 2005, it's no wonder that a film that's even remotely original and fresh gets critics frothing at the mouth.This film suffers from what so many screen comedies do: some jokes and scenes just fall flat, and when they do, the whole pace of the movie is thrown off. It's not riotously funny, but there's enough to keep you chuckling through the dead parts. Probably not the stuff of a comedy classic, but there are worse ways to pass the time.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The worst movie I have ever seen.,"I found this movie very offensive both in language and content. There was an overly abundant amount of foul language which certainly added nothing to the storyline (such as it was). It was very unrealistic. The plot was stupid and the dialog thrown in between the foul language didn't make much sense either. I certainly didn't find anything to laugh at. Neither my companion nor I could stand more than 30 minutes and we left. I was surprised, because I did take the time to read the reviews (there were a large number of positive ratings) before going to see the movie. I, personally think it should be X rated rather than 14A. Very disappointing. In all my years of movie going, this is the first time I have actually had to get up and leave the theater because a movie was so dreadful. In future I will read ALL the reviews - not just the positive ones.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Beyond just middle-aged dating.,"Being a virgin was best for Christ's mother, but losing virginity is a right of passage for most American males. For Steve Carell's Andy Stitzer it's a nightmare he has avoided for 40 years. He's a reluctant virgin traumatized by more than one aggressive girl in his youth, but his buddies think his time has come. Thus begins a tortuous journey to love and maturity for an electronics store salesman whose idea of a good time is making a perfect omelet or rearranging his perfectly stored action figures.I thought ""Must Love Dogs"" with John Cusack and Diane Lane was the best romantic comedy of the summer, and more than I hoped for. But Virgin goes beyond just middle-aged dating; it explores the value of holding out for a higher level of meaning when engaging in sex;, and it satirizes the social norms that foster promiscuity. Ultimately it settles on the right mixture represented by Carell and his business neighbor, Catherine Keener's Trish.Along the way is some insightful writing, often delivered with understated irony, by Andy and his two buddies. For instance, those who haunt video stores for offbeat memories know immediately that when Andy is counseled to be tough like David Caruso in Jade, the writers are geeky and knowing. The setup in the waxing salon, with Carell actually having his chest hair torn off and bleeding, reminds me of the outtakes of Peter Sellers as Chauncey Gardner in ""Being There,"" where he keeps trying to swear but ends up blowing the scene because he finds himself amusingly out of place. Andy swears at each rip of the adhesive, each time funnier than the last.This is my first experience with Steve Carell; I hope it won't be the last. The same can be said of first time director Judd Apatow. Both are not virgins when it comes to delivering sophisticated comedy.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wow! It's about time!,"FINALLY somebody can recognize that sex is supposed to be saved for marriage! It's SUPPOSED to be that way!

It's supposed to be for a husband and wife and NOBODY else.Check this film out! (It's pathetically disgusting, which ruins a lot of the humor, but the end is SO great!!!!)Steve Carell should be highly commended for taking on this role.

Pretty Good movie,"This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen this year. I didn't see any cameos in the movie, but it is still pretty good.

Just a well put together movie!!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find this to be a really good movie. I definitely think that Ebert and Roeper's review of this movie is right on. I mean, I don't really like Ebert on most movies, but this is the movie that I will agree about. The movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there. There is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie. Yea, sure, you get laughed at when it is found out about, but it still suggests that you wait.

Let the Sun Shine In,"Greetings again from the darkness. Although Steve Carell has shown flashes of comedic genius in ""Anchorman"" and on TV in ""The Office"" and ""The Daily Show"", my expectations for this one were very low, given the subject matter.Pleasantly surprised at how Carell (as writer and lead actor) and Judd Apatow (as writer and director) delicately handle the topic and the situations that Carell's character finds himself, I found myself smiling, more than laughing. Much of the movie is downright sweet and charming.Don't get me wrong. There is much raunch and uncomfortable content when the boys are in full planning mood. It is interesting that two of Carell's three buddies on a mission both appeared in ""Anchorman"" with him (Paul Rudd and the very funny Seth Rogen). Scene stealers include an almost predatory Jane Lynch and an insatiable Elizabeth Banks (Spider-Man movies).The ""Aquarius"" segment at the end of brilliant and a vast improvement over a similar type ending to ""There's Something About Mary""With all of the nice supporting work, there is no mistake that this movie belongs to Carell and a truly terrific Catherine Keener. Keener displays none of the harshness that has made her famous, but instead is full of grace and charm and vulnerability. We like her and find ourselves pulling for them to make it (pun intended) Is the storyline built in? Yes. Is it executed well? Yes. This is usually a pretty good foundation for a comedy.

His more mediocre bits on the Jon Stewart Show are much funnier than his performance in this movie.I won't say I didn't enjoy the flick. It's a good date movie, and there are a few genuine laughs. But the life was edited out of it in order to keep in solidly in the ""cute"" category. A few of the secondary characters, for example, had the potential to provide more laughs than they were allowed. And there were a few sparks of subplots that didn't turn into anything. Finally, the gorgeous Elizabeth Banks was sorely underutilized.I'm glad to see Carrell pull off the acting thing, but I just wish he could stay away from this mainstream stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Solid film. Shows Carrell has talent and that the rest of the brat pack is just as good,"The 40 Year Old Virgin is one film I've been wanting to see for sometime now. I've been a huge fan of Carrel since seeing him in Bruce Almighty and The Office (US). Carrel has shown his talent through his various projects over the past two years and The 40 Year Old Virgin was the one that first brought him to the public. Let's face it, The Office wasn't well liked in the US until '06 and he had a small role in Bruce Almighty. I went in with high hopes for Carrel and The 40 Year Old Virgin and I must say I was not disappointed.The film follows that of Andy Stitzer, a well meaning electronics store worker. Also working at the store are his three good friends: David, Jay, and Cal. One night while playing poker, his three friends discover that Andy is still a virgin and take it upon themselves to help their good friend to lose his virginity. Andy is very reluctant and confused by the whole ordeal but goes along with his friends not exactly knowing what to do or even if he really wants to.4/5 Stars Carrel really does show his talent off in the role of Andy Stitzer. He brings out the character of Andy very well. He shows that Andy is a very innocent, very pleasant individual who is well meaning and really a new-bee to the whole situation on the more physical aspects of relationships. Andy is meant to be a sweet guy and Carrel makes him that relatively easy while bringing tons of laughs. An overall very strong performance from Steve Carrel.In support are three great actors: Paul Rudd (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy) Romany Malco (Blades of Glory) and Seth Rogen (Knocked Up). All three attempt to give Andy advice the whole movie and all three make hilarious remarks and have memorable scenes. Seth Rogen really helped his career by taking a supporting role in this, now he's in the biggest comedy of 2007. Paul Rudd has always been hilarious and he holds nothing back as the goofy and ex-girlfriend obsessed salesman. Romany Malco is rather new to me though he was hilarious throughout the film yet still the least funniest of the three friends. Overall a good combo to play the three friends.What makes me like The 40 Year Old Virgin is how much unsuspecting humor there is throughout the film. A good portion of the film was improvised by the actors and this makes for the best humor I think. Also the film is very wise. It doesn't have too many 'dirty' jokes and the ones that are present aren't exactly overly offensive. The jokes are well thought out and, while the language is strong, there is nothing else to really turn a person away. There is barely any potty humor and most of the jokes come from the character Andy's inexperience and failure to understand certain things about women.Carrel really breaks through with The 40 Year Old Virgin. He is quickly becoming a star in Hollywood with his role on The Office and Little Miss Sunshine. He really gives a lot of laughs in the movie and with the help of a strong supporting cast, makes the film work. The writing is very good, the directing is solid, and the actors are top notch. I had a great time watching this though the first 20 minutes I nearly fell asleep. The rest of the film is golden though and will keep people laughing until the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Funny and Sweet! This is the making of Carell.,"The ,marvellous year of movies continues and yet another superb comedy film is added to the pantheon of great films for 2005. Judd Apatow writes and directors this story of a 40 year old virgin who is taken under the wing of a group of male co-workers in order to get him laid.The simple premise works well and of course it has your usual romantic comedy patterns, with Andy falling in love with Trish, a 40 something grandmother, looking for love. Andy is a nice guy who has not had much luck with women, but as the film progresses he discovers that maybe sex just isn't as important as people make out.This is a nice sex comedy and Andy is very amiable played superbly by Steve Carell who will surely hit it big after this movie. Then there is great support by the sexy and likable Catherine Keener. Paul Rudd also adds humorous support as one of Andy's friends.As you'd expect there are plenty of low brow gags as well as some great one-liners and overall this is a charming and funny film, while Carell will certainly be one to watch for next year, and may star in his own sequel to Jim Carrey's Bruce Almighty which Carell was a co-star. ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A masterclass in raunchy humor with a touch of class and humanity,"Sure, Kevin Smith did Judd Apatow before Judd Apatow did it. Sentimental relationship drama surrounded by raunchy dude humor. However, as much as I like some of Smith's movies, Apatow is in a whole other league, and makes a much more successful argument for sex jokes and excessive swearing being a valid form of comic expression. We talk about sex all the time, it's in our nature, yet somehow comedy heavily focused on the subject is relegated very often by major, respectable critics and more highbrow audiences to the lowest of the low. In 2005, by making a sex comedy centered on a 40 year old (virgin) and with a female love interest played by a 46 year old, Judd Apatow made the sex comedy respected again. Thanks to critical raves from places you'd never expect them from and an appreciative audience and successful theatrical run, admitting to liking ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" doesn't make you an idiot, apparently.Of course Judd Apatow already had quite the cult audience thanks to the seminal teen drama ""Freaks and Geeks"", which puts to shame any other exploration of teenage angst, and remains one of the sweetest, classiest TV shows ever made, and his several other notable projects. ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" has a great screenplay. I see no reason to dispute that claim. It's a tight, well-crafted story, the central characters are well-developed for the most part (and the tertiary, deliberate caricatures are also brilliant thanks to perfect delivery of perhaps iffy dialogue), and there is a perfect harmony and balance between the comedy and the drama.But let's boil this thing down to a simple sex farce. On that level it is, honestly, quite brilliant. As stated before I find it an absolutely idiotic idea that sex is so frequently seen as a childish, juvenile subject for comedy, given how it is not only a driving force in the lives of many of us, but generally the one thing which connects us as a species, and, though debatable, probably really the main purpose of our existence: to procreate and reproduce. Simple biology. Now, of course, sex jokes can become exceptionally dull and tiresome, but Apatow is brilliant at creating an aesthetic where the vulgarity doesn't overwhelm the story. ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" contains vulgarity, but is not a vulgar movie. The conversations are real, they're funny because they're real, they're funny because they are occasionally very fresh, they're funny because they are grounded in an emotional story for these characters.They are also funny because the comic timing of the cast is flawless. Seth Rogen, not really just being Seth Rogen on autopilot here (it's a slightly different character than his others if you think about it), is terrific and he's the weak link the film. Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Elizabeth Banks, and oh my lord Steve Carrel are absolutely, absolutely PERFECT here. Credit to them, but credit to Apatow as well as a director for getting them to do such amazing work. There's not one line that's even a tiny bit off. Apatow's visual sensibility also really helps. There are actually several bits of extremely clever film-making here, and just when you think he could be losing you he pulls something off again which makes you rethink that.Where ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" fails is, as far as I'm concerned, in the clumsy climax of the film. It's not really funny, it suddenly becomes very typical and obvious, and what Apatow chooses for the final scene just didn't work for me at all, although it probably gets praise from a lot of people just for being different. I thought it lazy and unfunny. But it doesn't really matter because until the final five minutes ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is a comedy masterclass. Perfect writing, perfect direction, perfect comic timing. It contains no great insights into human nature, but is a phenomenal, phenomenal example of its craft. I'll have to see it again before deciding, but this might be one of my favorite movies. I have almost no interest in the sillier stuff Apatow does (""Walk Hard"", ""Zohan"", etc.), but I can't wait for ""Funny People"".",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
FUNNY but vulgar--,"""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" was directed by Judd Apatow and co-written by himself and Steve Carell, which originated as a skit that starred Carell. The virgin of the title is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), who is indeed 40, works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures, which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see. He has a lovely home theater system and watches ""Survivor"" with his two kind elderly neighbors. He's a pretty picturesque definition of the Lonely Guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle aged man living a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a little odd, but in an awkward nice guy sort of way. One night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially tease Andy about his situation. The language is filthy, the jokes are (very) crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find anywhere. What's amazing, however, is that the movie is still a sweet love story.The plot is simple. A man is forty years old and he is a virgin. Yet, behind this simple, five second joke, we are given a deep, complex story that is not only one of the funniest you'll ever witness, but has genuine lessons behind it.We have known Steve Carell, as, in my opinion, one of the best scene thieves of all time. Stealing hilarious scenes from Bruce Almighty and especially Anchorman, Steve Carell has come a long way, as finally, and proudly, is given his moment to shine as the star. No one will forget his name once they witness this pervasively funny, gut-busting, roll-in-the-aisle hilarious comedy.The 40 Year Old Virgin is two hours of non-stop laughs, a perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie. The script was perfect with so many great lines that you will want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all. The music fit the tone of the movie great, and you can tell the director knew what he was doing. All right, here's the deal: if you're easily offended then you might want to stay far, far away from this one. Filled with sex jokes, some nudity, and a lot of language, this movie isn't for everyone. I'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes. I find that subtle, clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f-word or frat boy sex discussions. But that's me. Like I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if they're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to ever see at the theater. Strangely enough, despite the vulgar words and conduct, there's an admirable moral to the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funny movie,This movie is soo funny with many funny adult seen and this movie cast do great work in this movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A totally funny entertaining movie. One of Carell's better movies.,I love the comedy packed horse power in this movie. It has got some really funny and really endearing moments. Even though it is a rom com it is more com than rom. Or at least I found it more entertaining then most romantic comedies.There are a lot of moments where you feel sorry for the main character and you root for him. All the supporting characters are developed in a way that make you connect with the group as they navigate their own relationship waters.On par with movies like Step Brothers or other stupid funny comedies. Would totally recommend.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Extremely Laughable,"This is a great movie for both men and women! I agree with it's ""R"" rating, due to foul language and sexual talk/innuendo, but none of it takes away from the movie itself. You will thoroughly enjoy this movie whether on a date or out with a few friends. This movie has sweet moments along with laugh out loud moments that will make you second guess your desire to take a drink of soda; you may end up spitting it on the person in front of you as you burst out laughing at the many hilarious moments this movie provides. During a time when the movie industry may put out only one good comedy a year, this year we've been blessed with two outrageous ones - The Wedding Crashers (an absolute MUST SEE) and The 40 Year Old Virgin. So, grab your significant other or a group of friends and treat yourself to an extremely laughable good time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
nice and product,"On a poker night with three bawdy colleagues, the geeky toy-collector Andy (Steve Carell, where have you been?) reluctantly reveals that he has never done the dirty. Thus, they begin a mission to get this 40- year-old virgin laid and efforts such as chest-waxing, dating services and loose women ensue. This is harder than it sounds, because Andy isn't exactly Casanova. He rides a bicycle to work. He collects action- figures. He talks to his action figures.I never quite prepared myself for just how funny The 40 Year Old Virgin was. The dialogue is some of the most dynamic, quick, interactive and downright hysterical I have ever heard in a comedy, and this elevates the whole film above generic formula. Carell brings refreshing charisma and comedic timing to his performance, and I have never heard a funnier, better screamer since Macalauy Culkin in Home Alone (""I'm SHY!!!""). It is also nice to see Paul Rudd back in comedy action, as I greatly missed this guy when he seemed to depart from fame post-Clueless. Someone else whose comedic skills are worthy of a great deal of praise is Romany Malco, playing Andy's friend and pimp, always there to facilitate his mission, but always ending up making things worse. It is these three men that, when combined, are so funny that they just take my breath away.The only negative aspect to The 40 Year Old Virgin (aside from its philosophy that you can't be happy unless you're in a relationship) is that it is much too long. It has been said before yes, but there is a reason it has been brought up so much and that is because a raunchy sex comedy just does not hold up for 120 minutes. As the novelty of the fun dialogue and sexy situations wore off, I became less and less engrossed in the film. And let's not talk about the final sing-and-dance number. Just... please. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"More vulgar than I expected, saved by Carell's performance.","I wanted to see this based on all the favorable reviews. I have to remember in the future that most reviewers are male. A man might find the excessive vulgarity and profanity funnier than I did. The 18-25 year old males will undoubtedly love this film. This movie is rated R and it is about a 40 year old virgin, but funny shouldn't mean four letter words in practically every scene. To be honest, some of the male talk left me in the dark. I guess you have to be a guy to know the 'guy speak'. I was expecting sharper dialogue, humor based more on observation. There are a few good one liners, but I wished for more. In the showing I saw, I imagine the 65-70 old woman in front of me was cringing a good deal of the time. Some scenes made 'me' uncomfortable. I'm guessing this movie will play better for men than most women.Steve Carell, so good in NBC's show ""the Office"", is equally excellent here. I was surprised at his range. He never makes Andy seem dorky, just a little out of the loop when it comes to women. His performance saves the film. The supporting characters are all excellent. I wish they had been given less raunchy material. I still give this movie a thumbs up, but with reservations, especially if you're easily offended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
There's Something About This Movie,"This was an enormously funny romp of a movie. It has been compared frequently ""The Wedding Crashers"". And mostly this movie seems to be liked better than ""The Wedding Crashers."" I see the comparison, but honestly think ""The Wedding Crashers"" was sharper, funnier, faster. As for ""40 Year Old Virgin,"" think this movie may be much more comparable to ""There's Something About Mary"".Having said all that, this was truly a hilarious movie about (of course) Sex. There were several parts that were especially funny to me. The chest-hair waxing scene. The ""I know you're gay because ¬Ö"" dialog. The conversation(s) in the bookstore. The scene with the condoms.The ending of the movie was really perfect, perfectly funny and perfectly high-spirited.Regarding acting and characterizations, frankly, I did not like Steve Carell as Andy. I guess in a way it might seem like an easy part to play, but who really could have pulled it off? Not Carell in my humble opinion. Catherine Keener as Trish was excellent, on the other hand. Then again, Catherine Keener is always excellent. Paul Rudd as the morose stoner was not to me very appealing. Romany Malco as Jay was very good. Elizabeth Banks was hot. HOWEVER ...Seth Rogan as Cal was by far the best in the movie!I really thought Rogan's Cal carried every scene he was in. Yet he never over-reached, never played too far or too fast or too anything. Who is this guy? Blue collar, tattooed, crude, funny, natural, relaxed, playing his part with a cool, confident style that simply never faltered. I see he co-produced the movie. Clearly he had a lot of confidence in the product as well. I really hope to see more of this talent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Delightful.  The best romantic comedy I've seen in a LONG time,"My husband and I (both over 50) had a GREAT time at this movie. Yes, it was funny, and yet it was remarkably uncrude. The writing was clever and the cast uniformly excellent. Carell is an amazing actor - likable, and BELIEVABLE in a role that could have gone so wrong so easily. In a way, he reminds me of a less good-looking version of the young James Garner. He makes it look easy - and that's the hardest kind of acting of all. Also like Gardner, he seems to LIKE women - and there is NOTHING more attractive (and sexy) than that!Catherine Keener is a blessing to every movie in which she appears, including this one.What really distinguishes ""40 Year Old Virgin"" is how SWEET it is. There are no villains and we're really rooting for these people. Normally, I think two hours is too long for a comedy. But I was glad this one went as long as it did, because I wanted to spend some more time with Andy, Trish, and the other characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Comic-ly timed and so right!,"I admit it. I was laughing, along with the rest of the movie hall, till I was close to tears. All the raunchy and maybe politically incorrect jokes not withstanding - this is a FUNNY movie.Andy (Steve Carell) is a man whose existence revolves around his collectible toys, video games and his trusty bike (as in bicycle - as he makes clear to a date!) - and oh yes, did I forget the morning erections? As the name of the movie suggests - 40 year old Andy has never ""done the deed"". So during a poker game, that any man would regret, his ""virginity"" comes to light. So from here the loyal friends of Andy aid him in finding a girl to do ""it"" with. Andy falls for a single mom (Catherine Keener) - and wants to get himself ready before he makes love to the woman he loves.From well meant advice about drunk girls at bar (which ends in a 'shellfish flavored' throw up!) to date-twenty-people in a hour events (where Andy gets propositioned by a ""reforming"" lesbian!) this movie is filled with the misadventures of sex and all things associated with it. The waxing bit, which has been shown in the trailers, is sure to have you in splits.The amazing thing that the director throws in lot of small funny bits about Andy's friends, co-workers and just about anyone around Andy. So you can see one joke coming from Andy's misadventure, but you're not braced for that unexpected action of his trusted friend. The loser clinging to his broken relationship, the ""dude"" who always the right thing to say, the confident but insecure party animal, the girl with the wild side - all make their appearances! Director Judd Apatow packs in a lot into the movie.But as with the other raunchy funnie of summer - Wedding Crashers (I know this comparison is so bound to happen!) - the movie falters in the bit when it takes itself a wee bit too serious for its own good. Also pruning twenty minutes of the movie might be a pretty good idea.The ending is funny too - remember to sit while the credits roll in! Thank god they ended the movie on a light fluffy note! In three words - Go see it! It's fun! It sure is!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Two hours wasted,"It's hard to believe Universal would have invested money in this movie. Regrettably, I wasted two precious hours of my life on it. Lesson learned: don't bother with movies from Universal. Try to look for something from a studio with some redeeming social value.Though there are some ""funny"" scenes here, if you are thinking only of your own c--k, there's really nothing here to keep your attention, assuming you have even a small brain. Otherwise, go for it. This is a great film for people who need to hear all the forbidden words shouted out in a large movie theater so they can laugh nervously about the things they would never say.In the end, it's sad to see that Universal has had to stoop to such low depths to find a script/film worth releasing. Perhaps it's time they stopped trying.PS--For those of you who thought this was a good/great/funny movie: you have a sad future in store for you.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Too much ...,"First, let me say, this film is very funny. It had the potential to be one of the great comedies in recent times. But it also had it's shortcomings that for me, and I'm sure for others, were too much to overlook.Now, I am not over sensitive and I can take a joke. But, did anyone else feel that the black stereotypes were overdone, and the amount of them was overkill, especially considering that there was only one significant black character? I mean, it was fine after the first hit ... even the second and third. The movie poked it's fun at everyone. But the black stereotypes just kept coming, and they weren't funny.Every other character in the film was new and hilarious. The writing for them was fresh and funny. But when it came to the black character it got very stereotypical. The actor who played the role did a very good job with the material he was given. But I'm sure, at times, he had to feel like the other guys got to be funny and have new material, and he was just there to be a platform for all of the same ""black jokes"" the writers wanted to get away with.Again, I wanted to let it go. The film was so funny in other parts, and even had more of a story than I expected. But they just laid it on too thick by the end. There was one scene, near the end, where the black guy was selling a stereo to a black customer. It wasn't funny. It added nothing to the story. It was just two black guys being stereotypical using the ""n"" word in an argument for no apparent reason. The scene was gratuitous and out of place, and it was the last straw for me.Hollywood either needs to bring in black writers for these characters, or the white writers need to dig a little deeper. Their work would be much funnier, deeper, more dramatic ... just much better if they took the time to look past the caricatures that they see in other films and on television. Talk to some black people for goodness sakes. If not, don't write for ""black people"". Just write for human beings. (Black actors can handle those roles too.) Or if you want to use racial humor, be creative and give these characters the same depth and thought that you give your other characters. You know? {END OF RANT}Despite these things, the movie was funny. I can't recommend it because I'm tired of seeing the previously stated issues in films. So, I'm not looking to send it support. So, yes, if you see it you will laugh. But you'll laugh just as much if you see it on cable.Also, if you're thinking about bringing your kids, don't. There is much more adult humor in it then I expected, even for the subject matter. That's just a heads up for parents.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The funniest film of the summer!,"""The 40yr Old Virgin"" emerges not only as 2005's best summer comedy, but probably the best comedy of the year! This is one crowd pleasing, feel good movie that starts off with a laugh, and ends with one too. Steve Carell does a magnificent job of bringing Andy Stitzer to life. Whether YOUR a virgin or not, there is a little bit of Andy in all of us. Andy is a great comedic triumph for Carrell, considering it's such a departure from his shovanistic ego-centric Michael on the NBS hit comedy ""The Office"".The plot is simple: 3 of Andy's coworkers find out over a game of poker and some sex swapping stories that Andy is a virgin and set out to make a man out of him once and for all! Nuff said.What ensues is Andy learning the masterful art of picking up woman, making friends (which he doesn't seem to have to many of), dealing with the fact that everyone at work knows about his non existent sex life, and learning to fall in love.This movie has so many laughs it would be a shame to list them here. The chest/waxing scene emerges as pretty darn funny- and there is a lot more to it than what you get on the commercial previews. This is also a great buddy movie that paints an honest/relatable portrait of friends, new romances, and workplace relationships. It's just a funny frieken movie all the way around!! This film is a masterpiece. It really is. You definitely will laugh your A*S off!! Worth the price of admission and more! Forget the rest of this summer's ""so called"" comedies because ""The 40yr Old Virgin"" trounces them all!!! VERY HIGHLY Recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Freakin hilarious,"I was invited at the last minute to a sneak preview of ""40 Year-Old Virgin"" and I'm so glad I decided to trudge through a thunderstorm to this. This is about the most hilarious thing I've seen! I was worried that it would be puerile or lame. Yes, there's some low comedy here but there is also so much more brilliant set-up and amazing pay-off. This is an ensemble effort that builds a joke giggle-by-giggle to horse-laughing finish. I've never been in a room full of so many laughing people. The characters draw you in mostly because you already know these people. I'm still laughing at this movie an hour later and can't wait to buy it! The finale is comedy at its best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Amusing but Overlong,"The title says it all. Unfortunately, the filmmakers choose to belabor the point, taking nearly two hours to milk the concept for all it's worth. As a general rule, comedies should be closer to 90 minutes than two hours. There isn't enough material here to support such a long running time, spreading the joke thin. The film is intermittently amusing, thanks mostly to Carrell. The actor brings not only humor but also some humanity to the title role, overcoming Apatow's penchant for focusing on raunchiness and sophomoric comedy. Keener, a terrific actress who has been criminally underused in films, plays the woman who has the opportunity to rid our hero of his distinctive affliction.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Tremendous Comedic Achievement,"This review is not meant to edify the reader's knowledge of what actually takes place in the movie. It is merely meant to advocate the legitimacy of this film as a rare comedic stand-out in an era when Hollywood studios care more about the financial bottom-line than actually engaging their audiences. At a time when the film industry is treating its patrons like HMOs do their patients, it is refreshing to have been able to view a movie that does not sacrifice quality nor demean my intelligence by pandering to conventionally uninspired adult humor. This film is well thought-out and will probably do a tremendous amount of business because it was well-crafted as opposed to the pre-packaged, formulaic soft sell approach of most comedic films today. As a 32 year-old, it was also refreshing to watch a film containing characters who are my age-mates, as opposed to another flaccid youth-obsessed teen movie. The fact that Steve Carell also co-wrote and executive-produced this movie not only makes ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" a tremendous personal achievement, but explains its artistic success, as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A lot more drama than comedy,"This movie was OK, certainly not bad, although it did drag a little bit towards the end. However, I must admit that I am a bit confused at the glowing reviews. It was nowhere near as funny as ""Anchorman"" or even ""Dodgeball."" I believe the film was a little confused. You had moments of real seriousness and then they would turn around and throw in some juvenile humor. A bit of a mess really. I like Carrill and Rudd, but they did not have the same surrounding talent as they had in Anchorman. I did enjoy the film OK, but it seemed like the film traded off from directly appealing to 40 year olds and then turning around and appealing all of their humor towards 14 year olds. Like I said, an OK film, but certainly not great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Wildly Overrated, Mildly Amusing Comedy","Are we really so deprived of decent entertainment that this movie is getting rave reviews which, quite frankly, it doesn't deserve.At best, it's mildly amusing, but I was expecting so much more, based on the reviews I've read and user comments on this board.Yes, it has an underlying sweetness, but it could have done with some judicious editing. What is funny the first or second time really isn't THAT funny the fourth and fifth time, such as the old Indian guy talking dirty. A good illustration is the end title sequence--it's funny to see the cast perform ""Aquarius/Let The Sun Shine In"" from ""Hair"" for 30 seconds but did we really need to see the whole thing as a music video? One thing that really bothers me about Steve Carell, both in this movie and in ""The Office,"" is that he is way too buff to be playing these kinds of characters. Guys like this don't have ""bods."" I'm really surprised that his agent hasn't told him that his physical condition is totally at odds with the personalities of the types of roles he's playing.If I really want to laugh, I'll tune into ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" reruns on HBO each weeknight.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Amazing,"Never considered Carell an essential component of the Daily Show with Jon Stewart's cast, but thought he contributed a fair deal to ""Anchorman""'s cult status. With this one, I think he proved himself to half of the galaxy, this is a smart, funny, feel-good movie, that never gets dull, even when it needs to develop its story line.The jokes will keep you on your feet, and for once, the trailer only shows you the tip of the iceberg.

This is the Dawning of the Age of Carell,"From the very beginning I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is possibly the funniest I've ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my dorm this September.Every element came together in this movie so beautifully. It's not often you see a movie with so many penis, gay, and racial jokes so praised by critics. Carell and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke sensationally. Carell remains sweet throughout the entire movie where by the end of the movie you're rooting for him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to get laid. The supporting cast is brutal, each of them having some problems with the ladies themselves.One of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we're given. This is what makes a movie easy to remember fondly. This movie will often be brought up when the words ""chest waxing"" and ""condoms"" are mentioned in conversation.Watching it in the theater I was surprised how many older people were there to watch it. I saw a group of four mid-60s women come in. Despite an older audience, this movie still filled the entire theater with laughter.I think the type of people who will like this are the fans of the Office and Steve Carell. A lot of the jokes remind me of the type of jokes you'd see on Family Guy, too. The movie is shallow enough for adolescent boys and still sweet and clever enough for middle aged women.I don't recommend going to this movie if you aren't a fan of profanity or if you are easily offended. However, when you are at the movie, just remember this movie is all in good humor. The jokes aren't ""gay jokes,"" they're just jokes. And they're funny.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A romantic comedy that's actually funny and romantic,"In general, romantic comedies tend to be successful because of their ability to generate laughter. This is because most movies are cast because of their star-power, not whether the actors have chemistry with each other. So when a movie comes along that actually makes us care about the characters' relationship (and I mean really care, not just for the sake of the story), people take notice. While Judd Apatow's 2005 film can boast a few funny scenes, it's the romance between the two central characters that really takes this movie to the next level.Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) is an all around nice-guy. He's a little geeky, but a good soul. However, he's 40 years old, and he's never gotten laid...ever. So his co-workers make it a mission to get him some action. Meanwhile, he's attracted to a GILF (grandmother I'd like to...you know) named Trish (Catherine Keener). But will she be turned off by a guy who's never had sex (and will obviously be pretty bad at it the first time)?Steve Carell become really popular because of the success of ""The Office,"" a show that I hate. ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" still has a lot of understated humor, but unlike ""The Office,"" this movie is funny. Carrell is the perfect choice for Andy because he's so geeky that you can't help but like the guy. He's a nerd, but also nice and genuine. His romantic interest, Catherine Keener, is delightful. Keener is so natural in the role that it's hard to believe that this is a performance. It doesn't take long for the audience to realize that these two belong together. His co-workers, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, and especially Romany Malco are pretty funny as the guys who are egging him on. However, the funniest moments have to go to Gerry Bedknob, who has some hysterical scenes.Judd Apatow redefined comedy for the 2000's. His trademarks are understated one-liners and raunchy jokes (although I am at a loss to understand why this nearly got an NC-17 rating...it's all talk, and none of it is especially graphic). In general, I'm not a fan of understated humor. Humor has to be energetic, almost manic. The Farrelly brothers got that, Chris Farley got that, but Judd Apatow doesn't. That's not to say that this is a waste; there's some funny stuff here (like the Date-a-palooza scene), but a lot of the stuff just isn't as funny as it should be. What Apatow should be congratulated for is making the romance work. Many romantic comedies spend so much time on the jokes and forget that we're supposed to want the characters to end up together. Apatow remembers this and that's the most effective part of the movie.Funny, romantic, and endearing, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is a good movie, plain and simple.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A sweet romcom about love (yes, I'm serious).","Better late than never, so they say...On a night playing Poker with three bawdy men, Andy Stitzer (the excellent newcomer to the Frat Pack scene, Steve Carell), a geeky toy-collector reveals that he has never done the dirty. Digs and mockery ensue, but the men also vow to get Andy to end his shameful virginity and find him a woman. Chest waxing and loose women follow, as well as a whole lot of male self-deprecation in Jud Apatow's silly, sweet and appropriately raunchy romantic comedy.As a protagonist, Andy is a deeply likable, if slightly kooky guy. He rides a bicycle to work. He carefully paints his toy figurines, whilst chatting to them. And he only has eyes for Trish, an eBay entrepreneur from across the road. Trish is played by Catherine Keener, and it is her chemistry with Steve Carell that elevates this film above the generic gross-out formula. Their romance is presented in a careful, convincing way, without holding back on the jokes, but cleverly using Andy's virginity as both a convenience (the couple spend their time doing other things, such as conversing, flirting, or kissing) as well an obstacle (Trish cannot wait to get into Andy's pants, but he's still scared), that, only solidifies the belief in the pair's love for each other.The supporting cast, whilst not quite to the standard of the leads, hold their roles well. Paul Rudd is funny is the guy who is still hung up on his heartless ex-girlfriend, whilst Romany Malco also amuses, though his character does nothing to dispel the African American infidel stereotype. However, despite that little hiccup, 40-Year-Old is extremely well written, for it blends comedy, drama and romance deftly, as well as creating two leads that we care about, amongst the bawdy humour, which, at some points, proves to be the movie's low point.There are other flaws too, of course. There are lines that begin ""I know you're gay because¬Ö"" which only manage a raised eyebrow, and the less said about that weird singsong at the end, the better. The running time of 2 hours is also to be questioned (romcoms are always like, 90 mins. Didn't you know that?) But for its faults, The 40-Year-Old Virgin is a hilarious film, sometimes painfully so, but one that never fails to entertain.B",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
It could be smarter.,"The movie is fun, and exciting. However, I think it could've been developed into a smarter comedy, or even a good drama.Basically, there are a lot of potential, interesting aspects to explore in the Andy-Trish relationship: the confusion of Andy to advice Trish when Trish is having a bad time with her daughter, the adaptation of Andy into ""fatherhood"" life (well, if he is gonna marry Trish, he'll be expected to play the role of father, rite?), the sacrifice Andy should make when Trish recommend him to part with his toys in order to have a more ""responsible-adult"" life.If these area is explored further, perhaps we'll end up with a witty comedy of human adaptation into a new life.

The Apex of Truthful Comedies,"One observing the title of this movie for the first time would be under very much the same impression I was upon seeing the trailer for it; that it would simply be the newest in a string of the increasingly popular slapstick sexual comedies that never fail to please the numb-minded audience. You would say that I was surprised upon viewing it, and the experience was quite different, but its duty as a comedy never reached trough.Being introduced to Andy brought forth an infinite potential of pleasing jokes but his evidently completely disoriented self, in terms of realizing the simple nature of a normal person, was only the target for the best of what the movie has to offer; Andy's small group of sadistic and apparently sexually experienced friends who after clearing up the theory that their action figure-collecting friend was homosexual, realize with much pride that their dear co-worker is a virgin and it immediately becomes their duty to ""help"" this person who was to become an even poorer soul upon their efforts.Unintentionally antagonized by the prolonged description of the purpose of life, with a substantial bit of graphic sexual references, from his Middle Eastern co-worker Mooj, hit on by his seemingly sexually well- endowed boss, Paula, given pearls of wisdom about growing pot from his simple minded buddy Cal, adrift in the notion of deep romance from slacker Dave and utterly sent in the wrong direction by the ""well laid"" plans of the ladies man Jay, Andy meets only further confusion to be directed in the right directions when he falls for a woman running a ""We sell your stuff on Ebay"" store.You might say that through these utterly painful learning experiences (and waxing sessions) that the viewer would be sympathetic for Andy, but in reality, the specter of the simple power of your friends to make feeble attempts at assistance (pioneered so brilliantly in The Big Lebowski) and engaging in malevolent pranks (such as locking you in a display room with a porno on) brings you to the notion that this comedy is one you are all to familiar with, and it is just Hollywood that allows this simplicity to unfold into a plethora of flawed personality demonstrations and sexual jokes whose roots you have already seen in past works, but come out in a more ingenious way than ever could have been thought to be conceived.The sustained use of profanity to convey the utter comedies that unfold through the dimwitted friends and their Middle Eastern coworkers who just further substantiate the situations drastic effects on Andy's ""adult growth"" becomes a second language, one to be quoted again and again, and one that brings you up to think of Andy as someone just as common as anybody's friend and seemingly cheered on on the sidelines by a group of misfits who seemingly seek benevolence and end up inadvertently flushing you down the toilet (or sending a transvestite prostitute to meet with you).The measure of how much you liked the recent comedies that have attempted to make sexual humor flawless has no effect on your attraction towards this movie. It is the simple nature of uncontrollable laughter brought on by the dumbest of the dumbest helping a man develop his manhood.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
such good expectations - disappointed in the end,"We all know that having big expectations for a movie from the buzz is bad. But I have laughed a few times, but that's all. It's a good movie but it's not that funny. Steve is a really good actor when he is with Jim Carrey or the SNL frat pack, and may be also here.But the worse thing in the movie is there is too much moral, like American Pie. Even if this seems to be completely funny and controversial there is still a direction, a moral and that is what it is so predictable. They say a few toilet humor jokes and they never get beyond this. If you want a break thru, you need to stay always out of the moral thing (without going too far, just because it is cool to stun people), Dumb and Dumbers, National Lampoon's, ZAZ movies, Not Another Teen Movie , Old School were all good because they don't try to give a message every one agrees on.I think that the reason people have really loved it that there are may be a much higher number of virgins than we think.The best scene is when he spend all the condoms and even have one on the foot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Steve Carell is a sheer perfection for comic timing.,"He manages not to get real silly like Will Ferrell probably would if he was playing role. He manages to be funny at just the right moment.

A funny and original movie,"When The 40 Year Old Virgin came out in 2005, it was a big deal. No one expected people for it to be as funny as it was, and it introduced the world to Judd Apatow and his gang. Apatow would go on to direct better movies, but this was a solid film directorial debut for him.The reason this movie works so well is because it is so raunchy and crude, but at the same time sweet and heartfelt, and it takes a strong talent to make those two aspects come together in a believable way. Apatow is the one to pull this off, and he does it quite well.The characters are strong and believable, and this is what makes the film work. Andy, played by Steve Carell, is a 40 year old man who lives by himself and has never had sex. He is quite nerdy and lives in his own world, spending his nights singing karaoke to Word Up. He meets Trish, played by Catherine Keener. She works at the store across from Andy's, and the two fall in love. At first all Andy wants to do is get in her pants, but once she puts on a no sex rule, the relationship aspect comes out, and he starts caring more about her than the sex. It plays out well, and becomes quite cute and heartfelt as the movie goes on.The supporting cast is good, consisting of the now famous Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd. They play Andy's immature buddies who gode him on to have sex. They add something nice to the story, but it is Andy (and Steve Carell) that outshines his supporting group.The writing is sharp and witty, the only downbeat part of it being that it could be quite long. At 133 minutes, the film drags in a few areas, and some of the scenes could be considered too long and painful to watch, such as the scene where Jay and Mooj battle over commission. It is long and unneeded, and some scenes in the film scream editing.The only part of the movie that needs working on is the length, but apart from that, the characters are full and rich and the story progresses into a more heartfelt vehicle than it started out as. It is fun and enjoyable to watch as the characters go on, but Apatow would outdo himself in his next project.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Plastic action figures having ""sex""","A subplot of this movie is that the 40 year old virgin hoards plastic action figures at his home, which he never unpacks. Just like his action figures, he needs someone to ""unpack"": have sex and grow up. But that never really happens, because the other characters are just as much stuck in their plastic packaging. The advice of the virgin's ""buddies"" -- who are not friends but work colleagues from an electronics store -- makes you wonder who really needs to grow up, the virgin or them. So the morale of this movie seems to be that, even if you remove the packaging, the figure is still as dead as plastic. All of this could have been funny if it wasn't so desperate and depressing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The great old mood,"The entertaining film with Steve Carell perfectly fulfills his role, from being a rough movie, ironic and funny, with a beautiful black humor, jokes that today would not be accepted. The absurd story with touches of cruelty, prejudice and sadism of the man who is a virgin in his 40 years makes not even the most ""boring"" of the viewers were closed-faced watching the two hours of Judd Apatow. That also hits the cast, with a number of young actors who would eventually make huge success in Hollywood, such as Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill, and of course the funny Steve Carell (which was already well known at the time). Technically, the film is not a good idea, it does not have a profound message, it is purely entertainment, but even so, it seeks a rougher humor haunt, which few have the courage to do.

Definitely attracts a older crowd due to its massive adult material and tons of Drug references, Its a good see none the less..

Yes, you heard me right, this movie is kind of aimed, in a slight way, to virgins to show them that it is not something to be ashamed of if you're a virgin.

Of course his character is much more likable and you just root for him. The rest of the cast does a great job too.

Just When You Think Hollywood's Completely Forgotten What A Funny Script Looks Like...,"THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN (4 outta 5 stars) A movie with this concept would be so easy to turn into a piece of utter crap a la ""Deuce Bigelow"". It's so rare to find a movie that can actually balance big laughs with honest character development. Steve Carell does a great job portraying Andy, a character quite unlike the loud, obnoxious types that he's best known for. Again, it would be very easy for actor to screw things up by overdoing the stereotype... but Carell does a nice balancing act... playing nerdy without making it too creepy. Catherine Keener has a great role, too... as the single mother of three who begins a relationship with Andy... not knowing the dreaded secret that has only recently come to the attention of his (messed up in their own way) co-workers. Written by Carell and director Judd Apatow (known for TV's ""Freaks and Geeks"")... maybe this will start a new trend of comedy movies with ACTUAL SCRIPTS?",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Director Judd Appatow helms a comic film about the importance of love and sex in relationships.,"In 'A forty year old virgin', the subject of sex was handled with pure ""American Style"" sensibilities. Most of the sex talks bordered on silliness as in an oversexed nation like USA, according to a rough estimate there is a 'one in a million chance' of finding somebody who is a virgin at the ripe age of 40. Director Judd Appatow and screen writer Steve Carrell have made a vain attempt to add drama to their film with the depiction of a futile battle of opinions and an idle clash of ideologies. For this purpose they chose to highlight the plight of a happy-go-lucky person who has absolutely no qualms being a virgin and those who are not happy at this strange person's outlandish ideas. As the film keeps the viewers dangling, it is felt that 2 hours is too long a time to deal with such an ordinary theme. Many viewers would not hesitate to express that it could have been easily handled in the standard Hollywood cinema duration of 90 minutes. As love does have an important place in all kinds of relationships even sex, this film ends on a positive note with the triumph of love over sex. This can be termed as this film's major achievement.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Major Disappointment,"I'm all about a good comedy so I was excited for the release of this movie. However, I was extremely disappointed when I realized that this was the least original comedy ever made. All this movie did was take jokes that everyone has told since the 6th grade and slapped them together and added one joke about Kelly Clarkson. Comedy films are supposed to be daring, or at least witty, not comparable to a comedy made by randomly selected high schoolers. To me, this film would have been American Pie 40 if Jim had never gotten laid. I've got nothing against American Pie, but the series quickly went down hill. I would not recommend this film unless you're the kid who laughs during sex ed. If you are that kid, then have a blast.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Don't Believe the Hype,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, it did not strike me as something I would rush out and see opening weekend. Since I enjoyed Steve Carell's previous work in Anchorman and Bruce Almighty, I knew eventually I would get around to it. Then it happened. The reviews started coming out saying this was the funniest movie of the year etc. etc and although this will probably drop, the 7.9 rating on this site is quite impressive. Needless to say, mildly interested turned into must see and as every experienced film buff knows, high expectations should be avoided at all costs. But then again, a good movie is impervious to being over-hyped. With that said, I soon found myself in the theater anxiously awaiting the best comedy of the year...or so I thought.As the title of the movie suggests, Andy Stitzer is a forty year old virgin who is quite comfortable in his situation until his secret is exposed during a card game with coworkers. This sets the all too familiar plot in motion as we have seen in films such as Swingers and Sideways. His buddies are determined to get him laid and are quick to impose their insightful advice like ""Tackle drunk bitches"" or ""Don't put the p*ssy on a pedestal"". And so it goes. During this quest to achieve the impossible, a customer named Trish enters the electronics store where Andy works and of course, becomes the main focus of interest...as in every other film of this nature. Carell and Keener do share a convincing chemistry to keep this aspect buoyant through act 2 but loses momentum during act 3 weighed down by unconvincing drama.Just as the premise is clich√©, so are most of the jokes. Andy's introduction would have been much funnier if we didn't already see the stiffie joke in Anchorman or the angry Pakistanian coworker done in Office Space. There were a few really funny scenes in this movie but not nearly enough to adequately supply the lengthy 2 hour running time with consistent humor. The second half of the movie was like watching a bad sitcom - without the laugh tracks. The enthusiastic audience that was obviously enjoying the movie more than I was even stopped except an occasional chuckle. The Age of Aquarius sequence had me eying the exits and was relieved that it was soon over after that disastrous attempt at comedy.Overall, I'm on the fence after watching this. This was not a terrible movie, it just wasn't that good or funny and certainly does not live up to the massive amount of praise accumulated from various sources. Had I approached this with no expectations without being exposing myself to the hype, I may have enjoyed it more. However, doing a little research on a film before seeing it has proved to be much more effective method than selecting something based solely on trailers...It's just not a perfect science.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Steve Carell,"Just reading the title you know that this movie will depend heavily on comedy based in embarrassment. The embarrassment of being 40 years old without having done the business, as well as the embarrassment of trying at that age. In the worst case scenario this could have been awful, it could have been degrading in a way that makes me at least turn off the TV. This is luckily not the worst case.I have to admit right away that i for some reason like Steve Carell. His whole appearance is just amazing. Seeing him finally outside the newscaster-role is great. You might say ""But he was already in The Office"". Then i say: i wouldn't watch that crap even if i was paid to. There is only one boss in ""The Office"" and that's Ricky Gervais. Anyway, i got sidetracked. Let's get on with it.Carell lends a certain warmth to his character here. He's not such a bad guy. He's just an insecure man who lives his life pretty much alone in the same way he has since he was fifteen years old. He collects action figures, plays video games and watches movies. He seldom goes out and never ever meets women. Basically he's the man most guys could have been if they hadn't met that first girlfriend. Which makes him human, and also it makes us pity him and feel for him when he goes through his embarrassing stages on the road to getting laid.The jokes and comedy in this movie is of a shifting quality. There are moments that are intensely funny and there are also many sly remarks that are great. The most fun are Carells work-buddies who make it the purpose of their lives to get him laid. And even though it becomes too much sometimes and they overstep the line, it never becomes truly disgusting or repulsive. Which is a feat considering the subject.Steve Carell makes this movie worth a five, his buddies makes it worth a six, and the fact that it's a movie about sex that doesn't end in a disgustingly cute way it's worth a seven. It's a laugh and sometimes that's all you need.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Funny at times... But an overall letdown,"Many argue that ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is hilarious or laugh out loud, but I argue otherwise. I will admit that this film had me laughing for the first half-hour to an hour. But after that point, it really just becomes a sappy love story with occasional humorous lines from Rogen and Rudd. Throughout the film, it felt as if it was trying to portray a message about love more than the actual humor. By average comedic standards, this may be worth seeing. But when compared against other Apatow films such as ""Pineapple Express"" or ""Superbad"", it honestly doesn't compare. One of the plus sides was the cast; putting Steve Carrell, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, etc. all in the same film makes it at least moderately humorous. Although this is not one of Carrell's better roles, he still does a decent job for the first half of the film (especially the waxing scene). Seth Rogen always does a good job doing his usual stoner roll and Paul Rudd plays an interesting and humorous character. Probably the biggest downside was the second half. I don't if it it's just me and I should see it again, but after a certain point it becomes closer to a chick flick than it does an Apatow film. I could have done without all of the sappy parts and pretty much Catherine Keener altogether. If you are into heartwarming romances with predictable outcomes at nearly every corner, then go for it. But otherwise, this film has a lifespan of that of your average sitcom. To sum this up, I will definitely say this is NOT one of Apatow's best films and is highly overrated. ""Superbad"" has a similar cast and characters as well humor and it does a much better job at getting the exact same point across without prolonging an dull and sappy ending by over an hour. Overall, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is basically a slightly funnier version of a Jane Austen book.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The film is just too long. After nearly two hours of listening to virgin jokes, and mindless squabbles between bit-part characters.

In that manner is was surprisingly insightful and was pretty good-natured.The profanity and the brief nudity was to be expected, so I would question why anyone would go into this type of movie and be surprised. If I had to make a criticism of the movie was it's length. I remember specifically asking my wife what the DVD counter stated at what stage we were at in the movie, and I was shocked that we were only at the 90 minutes mark! I chalk some of this up to the fact that it was the extended version. But still, by the end, we were both commenting about how the joke was starting to run out of steam. I compare it to one of the SNL skits that start off strong, but the writer doesn't know when or how to end it.

Potentially nasty concept is both funny and likable,"I was quite prepared to hate this based on the subject alone but the movie actually won me over by banking more on its heart and likable characters and mostly avoiding totally mean jokes. Don't get me wrong, there could be a few jokes considered mean (nothing wrong with that) but mostly the humor revolves around the awkwardness and naivet√© of the title character. There are some genuinely funny moments here, especially the physical comedy bits (the ""epilation"" scene is comic genius).The lead, Steve Carell, was a revelation. He's low-key and understated and the fact he doesn't chew the scenery or overact (like Jim Carrey could have) helps make his character not only believable but likable. Some of the situations will certainly remind us guys of our beginnings in the love/sex department so it's very relatable. There might be even be a few love insights for most of us as a bonus.

Am I going to understand any of the references? Despite falling into a couple of these traps, The 40 Year Old Virgin is pretty damn funny and holds up well for the most part. The underlying concept is ingenious and has so much comedy potential, which was utilised really well.First of all the cast. You really can't go wrong with Steve Carrell, Paul Rudd and Seth Rogan. All fantastic comedic actors with spot on performances. The chemistry between them was great, they embodied their characters excellently and were the main attraction of the film for me. Catherine Keener was a great opposite for Carrell, and the story between them was quite charming. The support cast were also all fantastic, with Jane Lynch providing some of my favourite dialogue.Moving on to the humour... this film is so noughties sometimes it hurts. If we're being honest some of the humour hasn't aged too well. A lot of it wouldn't wind up in a film in this day and age and with good reason, but there are so many parts that really do stand the test of time. ""KELLY CLARKSON"" will never not be funny and there is a great mix of physical, character, intelligent and crude humour. Even when this film wasn't laugh out loud funny I mostly had a grin on my face. It's just one of those comedies you can't help but fall in love with a little bit.There a some films that are good to have in your locker for a rainy day when you just want to kick back with a comedy, and I'll definitely be adding The 40 Year Old Virgin to that list.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Carell's First Time Is Our Best Time,"Steve Carell, the guy who stole the show in both ""Anchorman"" and ""Bruce Almighty"" is someone who was just recognised by face by most, but ""40 Year Old Virgin."" It's a rare occasion when I see a romantic comedy that I really liked, but this one is one of those. Carell is hilarious in his first leading role, and the extremely strong supporting cast is fantastic too. Part of the movie is a raunchy type of comedy, kind of like American Pie but with 30-somethings, but mostly, this is a sweet comedy that's really rude at the same time, which HAS to be a rare occurrence.It's the most quotable comedy movie since the likes of ""Dodgeball"" and ""Anchorman"" and it also has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard for a comedy, (the ""Aquarius"" cast recording is hilariously reminiscent of ""Afternoon Delight"" in Anchorman, and make for a great Bollywood spoof ending.) Absolutely unmissable and as enjoyable as the first time that Carell's character strives to achieve here. One of the funniest comedies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The 40 Year Old Virgin,"The best thing about ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is that it effortlessly makes you laugh from start to finish. There's no cheap jokes or overly crude scenes. The interaction between Carrell and Co is perfect. Everything , from the direction to the pacing is delivered exceptionally well making the film a naturally unforced barrels of laughter.Carrell character never fully agrees with his ""friends"" commitment to try and help him lose his virginity. The pressure that suddenly fulls upon Carrell shoulders enables you to feel some sort of unexpected sympathy. The films starts on a high and thankfully ends on one with the conclusion being satisfying.From the poker game to the Wax and dating scene, the film never stops bellowing out jokes, small or big. Nothing seems forced. A effortlessly good comedy",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A funny, sweet movie about a guy who is tired of being a virgin.  Be prepared to laugh out loud!","I was pretty sure this movie would be good, because I like Steve Carrel, but I had no idea how much I would like it. It was funny, no, hysterical at times, without getting silly (well, maybe a little). I loved watching his buddies come up with idea after idea to ""help"" him be cured of his virginity. I like that he tries to stay true to who he is rather than changing to suit everyone else. I also liked the way the characters are so individual and real in their own ways. Not a single one of them were boring either. I was also very impressed by the main character's collection of action figures. I just loved the whole movie and will suggest it to all my friends. I also told my husband we're going to buy it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A nice fit,"I consider comedies with trepidation, because they are so overwhelmingly likely to belong at one end or the other of the spectrum: Either not very funny at all, or so silly as to be embarrassing. Like ""Office Space"", this film fits neatly into the middle of the spectrum. No pratfalls, no pies in the face, but genuinely an amusing film. I was, however, disappointed with Catherine Keener. I've long considered her among my favorite actors, but maybe she is getting lazy or spoiled. She just doesn't have the sizzle that I had gotten used to. But then, who does, ten or twenty pictures into their career? I had trouble with character believability in this movie, too. The ending musical scenes were formulaic, and one of the worst examples I've ever seen of that formula.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Vomitorium,"If, mind you, if you can sit through the first 100 minutes or so of this gag-fest (and I stress the word ""gag""), there is a nice performance by Catherine Keener, the real and legitimate girl friend of The 40 Year Old Virgin. She is a lovely and mature actress who injects the only humanity in this mindless, sophomoric garbage. Keener's character Trish falls for Steve Carell (Andy), as timid a man as you're likely to ever see in a movie. There is a budding and emotionally almost-sorta-kinda believable romance that grows between them. It's worth watching, all five to ten minutes of it.But you have to wade through what seems like an eternity of filth and degradation to get to it.I must be getting old; I just sat there chuckling every once in awhile, but mostly cringing and blushing. The 40 Year Old Virgin isn't worth your time, even if you're a Keener fan.Flush this commode . . . and check something out in the grownups section of the video store.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Overrated,"Although it's quite a novelty to see the character of Andy, the virgin who's 40 years old, depicted as a nice and likable guy this movie is fairly one-dimensional all the way. In the instances that a male virgin is the subject they're usually weird and repulsive in some way, so Andy's character comes as refreshingly original. In some ways he's peculiar; his collection of toys and posters etc. but the film doesn't go overboard in that area. I can imagine that this rite of passage can seem like a mountain to climb if delayed too long, and in Andy's case it might just seem like an impossible task. Relatively late bloomers (say; just over 20) are nervous but how on earth would it be if you're 40.The film has some hilarious moments when focusing on Andy and his ever mounting fear of his impending task. The ""boner"" scenes sure do bring back memories. It's when his friends occupy a lot of screen time that the film isn't as interesting. Andy's friends are all complete stereotypes, straight out of American Pie it seems.Subtle messages, such as; ""it's really O.K. to wait for the perfect one"" are present but not really hammered on, this film more or less shows you that you truly can't be happy unless you ""do it"". In our sex driven modern atmosphere this movie simply reinforces our believe that sex is the most important thing you will ever encounter.I had high expectations for this film and on the whole was pretty disappointed. There's nothing that justifies over 2 hours running time, the film drags in the end; some pruning would have helped a lot. Still, it has it's moments and a wonderful comic performance by Steve Carrell.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Excellent comedy treat,"Andy Stizer (Steve Carrell) has a job, a nice apartment, a collection of action figures and his virginity. When his buddy's at work learn the truth, their quest becomes, helping Andy with the female of the species. A hilarious series of painful, sexual and eye-opening events ensues, and Andy's life will never be the same again.Steve Carrell plays the role superbly well, capturing the innocence and vulnerability of his character with ease, along with a strong script and a talented supporting cast '40 year old virgin' is one of the freshest comedies in recent years, and should be enjoyed by everyone.8/10 Hilarious and definitely recommended",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An Epic in the History of Comedy Cinema,"In my viewer opinion this movie is an epic in the history of comedy cinema. It introduced me to know and get in touch with Judd Apatow work, made me fan of Steve Carell and start following the career of Seth Rogen. This success should be considered a classic!Although an excessively long movie, we laugh throughout the scenes because, over all, the conception, the story, the characters, the places, the improvised dialogs and even the chest depilation of Andy were very well done. So, if you want to end a boring, bad, unfair day, or simply purge the depression daemons, I highly recommend you to watch The 40 Year Old Virgin.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This film should make you laugh from start to finish,"What I don't like about many comedies is the almost guaranteed fact that though they may start out amusing (Hitch, Wedding Crashers) by the end of the film they've always managed to make some sort of moralistic, 'slushy' (dare I say it - American) point. This film doesn't. Okay so it may have a 'happy' ending but at no point does it lose its comedy and at no point does the 'slushiness' overshadow the fact that this is essentially an amazingly funny, dirty and 'real' laugh fest. I honestly feel the only people who will not find this amazingly hilarious are self absorbed pretentious critics who wont allow themselves to be 'lowered' to the level that some of the comedy in this film descends to. Yes its rude, totally non pc and presents some fairly blatant racial and ethnic stereotypes. It is however an incredibly hilarious movie, it is consistently funny throughout the entire 2 hours, the acting is superbly done and actually believable and I would recommend everyone go and see it at least once!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funny and witty at times,"Steve Carell has done impeccable work in this and he is so cute and innocent.Similar to ""Wedding Crashers,"" ""Virgin"" sometimes appears to be forcing the humor, and there are instances where better editing could have resolved the slower sections. Despite the cleverness exhibited, the movie is not quite potent enough to maintain momentum for its nearly two-hour duration.Nevertheless, there are plenty of witty and disrespectful moments to entertain younger viewers, and the film concludes with a catchy sequence that even a slightly older audience will enjoy, humming an appropriate song from the 1980s, ""Just Got Lucky,"" as they exit the theater.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A 40 year old virgin!,"The cover on the DVD of this movie tells the whole story. It is about a love-lorn, nerdy 40-year old who has never done the deed. Inevidably his buddies learn the fact that he's a virgin and pressure him to score - which only leads to disaster after disaster. All of the leads, especially Steve Carrel, are hilarious in this movie. The amazing role, though, is Seth Rogen's. This should be a star-making role for him. The ending of this movie leaves a lot to be desired, but it is still funny in some ways and the beginning and middle more than make up for it. If you want to watch a movie with your grandparents, this movie isn't for you. However if you want to laugh your a$$ off with some buddies over good-natured sexual humour, this movie is a must see. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Andy, not a true Geek!","Is it not a bit odd that 95% of Andys action figures were released in the last 5 years??? I did not see one vintage Star Wars figure anywhere, you think a collector like that would have R2 D2 Power of the Force pop up sabre, mint carded somewhere, not even a sniff of a Blue Snaggletooth anywhere! It is obvious the set designers and prop guys went rount to Forbiden Planet, or such like shop and bought any stuff they could find, that coupled togetther with a few choice pieces makes the set, to me i was hoping to see a real collection.

The 40 Year-Old Virgin,"I'm totally unashamed of rating this so highly. I love this film! An incredible cast telling a simple, yet fun, story. Everyone plays their parts with such charm and enthusiasm, and there's plenty of memorable scenes and one-liners that still make me laugh after all these years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An Adult Version of the Teeny Flicks,"Raucous humor, outrageous interpersonal situations, potty mouth, and over the top jokes have long been the successful turf of countless summer movies aimed at the teen crowd, films such as the endless American Pie series, Dumb and Dumberer, There's Something About Mary, etc. Now there is a new trend aimed at the thirty to forty something audiences that mimics the earlier teen subjects. THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN falls into this category along with WEDDING CRASHERS et al, but there is a difference with this one: empathy.The story is slight: an uptight, loner, action heroes collecting, non-driving bicycle-riding punctual worker in a boring firm is now forty years old and is still a virgin - a fact that bothers him deeply but his virginity has developed into a phobia for close encounters of the female kind. His work partners discover his secret over poker and pledge to resolve the problem by getting him laid, in some of the most negative possible of suggestions. After endless trials to resolve his sexual vacuum he meets a forty something grandmother and in a mutually agreed pact they decide to date without sex for 20 dates before they allow physical activity to occur. In the process the friends at work (including the seductive female manager) learn a thing or two about their own life styles and the film ends in a bizarre musical number that pushes it over the top while tapping at the heart.Steve Carell co-wrote the script (with Director Judd Apatow) and it shows. His 'Andy' may be a nerd but his adaptation to his problematic existence is sweet and charismatic. Likewise, his office entourage (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, Romany Jay, Jane Lynch) gives us three-dimensional characters each of which shows some personal growth of their own during their experiments for Andy. The real glow of the film is due to the presence of Catherine Keener as the 'grandmother' for whom Andy falls. Whenever she is on the screen lights flash and reality sets in. The real problem for this viewer is that the slapstick portion of the film simply goes on too long. Apatow needs to rethink comedy in a way that reminds him that brevity is better: two hours is way too long for this very short story. Though it has redeeming graces, this is a film for a audience tolerant of the silly and the gross who is willing to wade through the first three-fourths of the film to catch the quietly tender social comment the film contains.

One of the dumbest comedies I've ever seen,"I admit that isn't a precursor for a bad film there have been plenty of no-brain comedies over the years that I thoroughly enjoyed. The main fault I'd have to find with this film is it's dreadful writing. It is terribly tired and formulaic i.e. shy guy seeks girl, friends give bad advice and embarrass shy guy, shy guy learns to be himself. None of the so called 'jokes' hit the mark notably any contributions from Andy's Indian/Pakistanii co-workers and his boss singing a Guatemalan serenade. WTF was that about? I suspect it was a cynical attempt by Steve Carrell and Judd Apatow to inject some Will Ferrell-style craziness into this terribly mundane comedy but it failed miserably and was just embarrassing. Anchorman was one of the best comedies in years. 40 Year Old Virgin highlights Ferrells considerable influence on that film.The fact that so many people have enjoyed this utterly classless film has shocked me. I hated it. I encourage anyone who regard themselves as having reasonably discernible taste to challenge me on this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A ""guy film"" girls can really like","So, there's some crude humor -- in fact, a *lot* of crude, sophomoric, juvenile-boy-type humor. But, women, if you are expecting nothing but fart jokes, I assure you that you will be pleasantly surprised. It's actually a pretty gentle (and often insightful) take on male-friend interaction, but there's enough sophomoric, ""P-word"" joking around to keep your boyfriend/husband happy, yet enough genuinely touching moments to keep *you* happy.It's a difficult movie to categorize -- part teen-style sex farce, and part true-romance, with enough laugh-out-loud, gut-busting moments for both male and female, straight and gay, hip and incurably-geek.In short, it's the best date movie I've seen in many years -- and there's nothing so offensive that you couldn't watch it with your mom (that is, if your mom is capable of cracking up over condom jokes).Big bonus for this viewer: MAD-TV's Mo Collins' brief but memorable cameo as as the ""ex-lesbian"", ""Gina"" (pronounced with a long ""I"").Extra-extra bonus: The soundtrack. Among the standouts: The Joboxers' irresistible ""Just Got Lucky""; the 1970s pop version of ""Jesu Joy"" (anyone else find this a welcome flashback via ""Boogie Nights""?); and the main theme from ""Hair"".Bottom line: Definitely watchable, rentable, and watchable-again. It's been a while since Hollywood has produced such an endearing sex farce.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The funniest film in recent years,"Quite definitely this is the funniest film I have seen in a long time. There were small parts of The Anchoman and Kicking and Screaming that made me laugh out loud but this movie has by far the most laugh out loud moments of any film I can remember since first seeing The Life of Brian.This is a well scripted film which is then developed further by a great cast who deliver the script perfectly. Add to that a few quirky bits, like the musical ending and you have a film you will remember when all the other 'comedy(s) of the year' have long been forgotten.You get the impression that the cast really enjoyed being in this movie and wanted it to be as good as it could be. It certainly proves Hollywood can make a good film still.I would say this is definitely not the film to put on when the village vicar is coming round for scones and tea and is rightly a 15 certificate in the UK. It's adult themed of course and there is some brief nudity but the film doesn't rely upon a little titillation to keep the attention of the viewer.At the time I made this report IMDb had this film scored at 7.7 out of 10, not many films get that sort of score. I think this speaks for itself and is as good a reason as any to rent this.Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Best Film About Relationships - Best Comedy To Date...,"Just watched this film and I have to say there were very few moments in the movie when I was not doubled over in full-out, belly-achingly laughter. This masterpiece has very little if any weak or down moments (in fact I can't name any).This is one of, if not the, best films I have seen dealing with relationships. Its observations are irreverent but also incisive. Other films along similar lines like the Tao of Steve, cannot really compare (though in truth it is hard to compare the two)though perhaps you might check out other good but much darker comedies like Roger Dodger.This is a must see for everyone that can take it (and a good instruction and test for those who can't).Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An odd comedy that's actually pretty good,"I must say, this film is not bad. It's your run of the mill raunchy ROM com plot. I really found some scenes to be quite relatable though thoughtfully exaggerated. It really gave me quite a good laugh.Other than that, there are also a couple of pretty good lessons to learn from the film. E.g. you got to know when you are ready for it and not be pressured by other people.All in all, this is an interesting comedy that follows your basic rom com plot. However, for those who love those, this is a film you might wanna check out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Surprisingly insightful,"Another gem from the Apatow stable with great laughs, a perfect cast and long running time. Carell and Keener are always great, and their easy chemistry anchors the movie while the Smart Tech Crew attempt to steal it with an endless supply of hilarious scenes and lines. TFYOV is a romcom, but more so a surprisingly insightful buddy movie that understands Gen X male relationships. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Everything I wanted,"To me, this movie was flawless. The humor was dead on, exactly the kind of dry but witty lines that only great actors can pull off. All four guys are amazing, and actually seemed just as down to earth as their respective characters. The sub-plots weren't far-fetched or unnecessary, the one-liners weren't trite, the women weren't supermodels. Everything was real, and I loved it.But the most important element of this movie had to be the awesome ending. I was in tears, it was just too good to be true.Steve Carrell is a great actor, with a unique style of acting. I hope that he goes far, because he really is hilarious.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
maybe the worst film i've ever seen!,"I went to see this film because enough reviewers seemed to have found it funny. Well, I certainly didn't. It was just plain dumb and the story was boring. I didn't find the main lead or the supporting cast interesting enough. The material and acting could have been better handled with a different cast or director maybe. Altogether a very disappointing film. Too much swearing and not enough laughs. And the bottom line is too much emphasis on sex anyway! No wonder some cultures look at the West with derision! I suggest you look at other comedies if you want a good laugh. Even the 1960s British 'Carry On' series is funnier than this and they touched on similar sexual themes. I'd give this film a zero if I was able to vote that low!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Sex is our part of lives,"It is so funny to watch the life like our life falling short sexual activity. As we live, it is not possible to notice our problematic behaviours and inflexible thinking of way. Like looking at the mirror, people will find out their taboos and boundaries.The people -especially males- even if they are married- always looking for more and more activity to prove their existence and power. The defect of their molecular structure restricts their lives.To say that the movie is out of life is not rightful decision. The comedy itself requires exaggerating, to caricature, to deform and to testify of human life. Additionally, it is reality that there is apartheid, scorns, unequal treatments, denigrate and complexes. Which one is bad? Doing them in real life or seeing them in movie? We have to feel ashamed of doing them, not to watch them. We cannot save our crystal world with criticizing filmmakers and ignoring these bad habits The movie certainly leans on life itself ¬ñ at least some of us life. Instead of saying good or bad, the movie point out the reality.Education, experience and unprejudiced mind will make people relaxed and happy in their sexual games. Can you imagine how many people live nightmares about sexuality? It is absolutely greater problem for married people. Let's try to think for a moment of sharing your life for a long time with someone who does not have sexual appeal? Sex is our part of lives and it deserves to make film about.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Funniest movie of the year, just one small problem","I went into this movie expecting it to be funny (considering the trailer), but I didn't realize it would be THAT funny.Steve Carell is a seriously amazing actor who makes you laugh just by looking at him as he played the role really well, making the correct facial expressions in any situation. Some scenes made me fall on the floor from laughter and I really felt my ribs were hurting.The story about a 40-year-old virgin whose younger friends are determined to get him laid ASAP. The story goes on to show you how they try to train him, telling him what to say, when to say it, how to act with girls.The way the story shows the different types of girls is really brilliant, how each time you see a new one, you would think: ""This one will be normal, unlike the one before!"" only to show you that she is just weirder, that is on the sexual level.I loved everything about this movie, except one small thing: The way the main character, the 40-year-old virgin talks to new girls/women make him look like a pro, and like he has been doing it for his entire life. There is a scene where is only suppose to ask a girl questions, and the way he asks them really makes you stop and ask yourself: ""So, if he is really that good with girls, how come he stayed a virgin?"" They only showed him nervous when he is trying to contact the woman he liked the most, played by Catherine Keener, but that happened two times, on the third, he just goes in and asks her to go out with him. Now lets face it, someone who hasn't tried to come near a woman for over 20 years will need a lot more work than this. It all seemed to flow nicely. I realize this is a comedy and whatnot, but still, a little credibility would have helped.I think this is the only reason why this movie doesn't get 9 stars (no movie can get more). Other than that, it has one of the funniest scenes you can ever see this year and the scene keeps on coming and coming without it being repetitive or boring. They took it to the limit, w/o boring the audience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Funny But Kinda Porno Movie,"An OK movie about how harder it gets to lose your virginity the older you get. Andy (Carell) is 40 and virgin and when his work mates find out they do they best to help him lose it, but none of their advice helps and he ends up meeting the perfect women for him, but will he have the guts to tell her or to even do the deed? This is a good movie, but can make u feel uncomfortable at times. It is a funny movie and is defiantly for teens or older, I also think this movie is more for men than women, but I think women will like it also. Some of the jokes in it are rather rude and grotesque. If you are a parent and you don't want your kids to know certain things about sex or to basically watch men with erections, naked women, or lesbian action then don't take your children to see this. Also if you don't want to see these things then don't watch it. This film is very good apart from these factors and does have some very smart jokes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Sharp Script and Carell's Skillful Underplaying Make for a Hilarious, Humane Comedy","The very concept of this movie sent a chill up my spine, as I was preparing myself for the return of Pee Wee Herman and the inevitable man-child clich√©s that would come with a character bearing the movie's title. Contrary to my expectations, this film is a frequently hilarious, surprisingly humane comedy that goes well beyond the inevitable deflowering process. First-time director Judd Apatow smartly averts the movie from being a one-joke premise and provides instead a perceptive overview of the romantic anxieties and social pressures faced by those looking unsuccessfully for intimacy. That's not to say it doesn't have its share of crude humor and graphic sex jokes, but more importantly, it has a heart thanks primarily to a thoughtful script by Apatow and Steve Carell.In a sharply comic performance, Carell plays the title character, Andy Stitzer, as a socially clueless, emotionally inert loner in a paralyzing state of arrested development. Surrounded by his exhaustive action figure collection and working in a Circuit City-type electronics store, he rides a bike, doesn't know how to drive and doesn't seem to want to despite living in LA (the one plot contrivance) and can talk endlessly about making egg salad as the highlight of his weekend. Andy works with a trio of co-workers who all think of themselves erroneously as wise in the ways of love, and upon discovering Andy's virginity, they are determined to help him get a woman.But the film doesn't focus so much on the pursuit as it does in peeling off the layers of Andy's personality - the fundamental terror that has kept him from women, a constant need for order and logic to fill the void, and finally an eagerness for life to stay simple and uncomplicated so that he can live without confronting his fear. In short, he has rationalized sex and intimacy out of his life, that is, until he meets Trish, a nice, eccentric single mom running an eBay transaction store. Their burgeoning relationship is the heart of the story, and it certainly helps to have the always wonderful Catherine Keener play Trish in such a warm, loopy fashion that it's easy to believe the mutual attraction.The supporting performances are terrific - Paul Rudd portrays Andy's closest colleague David, who cannot get over his failed relationship which he faces again in a chance meeting with his ex-girlfriend at a speed dating event; Romany Malco plays Jay, a married philanderer who eventually gets caught; Seth Rogen as Cal, who thinks he's a ladies' man despite all the evidence to the contrary; and Jane Lynch from ""Best in Show"" as their manager, a power-driven woman who in a very funny scene, discreetly offers herself to Andy and serenades him with a Guatemalan folk song.There are several great scenes, including the poker scene where Andy awkwardly talks about women knowingly, the already famous chest hair-waxing where Andy yells out a series of Tourette-like epithets, and the surreal musical production number at the end, which will get any baby boomer giggling with abandon. Truth be told, it runs a bit too long and sags toward the last third, but I doubt if I have laughed at a film so much in the past year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The Greatest Comedy Of The 2000's.,"MPAA Rating:Rated R for pervasive sexual content,language and some drug use. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:18A(should be 14A)I have seen the unrated version of the 40 Year Old Virgin on the Movie Network twice.In my opinion The 40 Year Old Virgin is the greatest comedy film of the 2000's.The summer of 2005 brought back raunchy R-rated comedies like Wedding Crashers and this film.I have seen both and The 40 Year Old Virgin is miles ahead of Wedding Crahers.Wedding Crashers was really funny and good but 40 Year Old Virgin was funnier and had a more interesting storyline.Not that we look for acting in a comedy but Steve Carrell is really convincing as a nerdy 40 year old virgin.This film is about a geeky man named Andy.One day he plays poker with his co-workers and they gloat him for being a virgin after he accidentally talks about it.Their co-workers help him lose his virginity.He meets a single mother and he falls in love with her.Filled with dozens of funny scenes The 40 Year Old Virgin is an excellent comedy that you wont want to miss.Runtime:133min10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Unbelievably embarrassing to anyone's intelligence,"I guess I got suckered in because of the trailers. My mother and I sat with a whole theatre full of senior citizens and I was totally embarrassed by the filthy language used throughout. Oh, its not that I'm a prude. Nor has my mother not heard language like that before. But holey smokes, what's the deal? When does dialogue so disgusting become the 'norm', and using every foul word in the book become OK?

Ding-a-ling-LESS is funnier!  And was made 3 years before!!!,"This movie is amusing, but it's nothing compared to a brilliant independent film called Ding- a-ling-LESS, which was made 4 years ago. It's about a 30-year-old birdhouse builder without a penis. He's a virgin too (obviously...he doesn't have a Penis) and hangs out with this guy named Alan, who is a womanizer. He eventually finds a doctor who specializes in penis reattachment, but has to find a penis donor before he can be normal. Things get really strange at this point. The performances are incredible in this film and the writing is incredibly witty...much wittier than The Forty-Year-Old-Virgin. And yes, it's raunchy, but it's also extremely sweet (very much like The Forty-Year-Old-Virgin) but the ending is much darker and ambiguous. I've never seen anything like it. Hopefully audiences will discover Ding-a-ling-LESS and appreciate how brave and original and ahead of it's time it actually is. It was called Re-Membering Jack at one point but the title was changed to Ding-a-ling-LESS when it was released on DVD. I'm not saying The Forty-Year-Old-Virgin is bad, because it's not, it's quite good, but Ding-a-ling-LESS is much better in my opinion.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"It truly is a very funny movie, and a smart, touching film as well.","Steve Carrell delivers a subtly fantastic performance in this hilarious comedy. But just because it's silly and funny, doesn't mean that's all that it is. Towards the end of the movie, I found myself watching a film about modern ideas of masculinity. There really is a strong narrative hidden behind uproarious comedy and obnoxious jokes. However, where ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" really demonstrates its strengths is simply in the comedy. It truly is a very funny movie, and a smart, touching film as well. Unlike similar comedies nowadays, it asks more of the film by taking the story a step further than creating laughs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Without a Doubt Carell's Funniest Film,"The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005, Dir. Judd Apatow)Andy Stitzer (Carell) enjoys life, but everything takes a turn for the worse, when his friends discover that he is still a virgin at 40. Andy doesn't seem to have a problem with this, but everyone else does and tries to constantly get Andy laid. The pressure adds on when Andy ends up meeting a single mother (Keener) who works across the road.Brilliantly written and an amazing comic performance from Steve Carell, creates a fun and heart filled comedy which would be loved by Apatow comedy fans.Yeah, well, virgin's not a dirty word.

"It's Okay but it's not ""Sideways""","Okay, the premise of this movie is somewhat shaky, but the movie is amusing, and at times provokes outright laughter. Yet this movie also has its serious side, which actually detracts from the movie's entertainment value because the main character is neither a social misfit or a buffoon. Instead, he is person who chooses to remain celibate and demands that his decision be respected, which is anything but amusing. For it's not that he can't ""get laid,"" or doesn't want to, it's just that he wants ""action"" on his own terms or not at all, which doesn't make for a funny character. If the main character were goofy, like, for instance, Austin Powers, or were some kind of pompous martinet, like, for instance, Captain Wally Binghamton in ""McHale's Navy,"" then this movie may have been much funnier. But here the 40-year-old virgin is actually quite normal, friendly, and likable. In short, he is boring. It would be like trying to laugh at Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy while taking them seriously. This is an okay movie, but if you want to watch a really funny movie, watch ""Sideways.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Gut-Bustingly funny. Vulgar but not gross.,"This is by-far the most hilarious comedy I have ever seen, and I have seen a ton. I judge comedies by how much they make me laugh, not some snotty pretentious standard. Although I definitely appreciate more subtle satire, like that found in Cohen brothers or Wes Anderson films, those don't qualify as ""pure comedies"" in my book. If you find vulgar humor about sex extremely off-putting, then you might want to stay away from this movie. If you don't have pole up your a**, then you will laugh harder than you've laughed, well ever.That being said, there is more to this movie than simple potty jokes. The vulgarity is used as tool of storytelling, and not central. Unlike Something About Mary, or Scary Movie, it's not purely done for the sake of grossing you out, and it never reaches that low-brow of a level. In fact the dirtiest parts are the dialog, which are very, very dirty. Some people may be tempted to draw comparisons to American Pie, due to the premise and the fact of it being a romantic comedy. While the story remains realistic albeit over the top, it also avoids suffering by sentimentality that so many other romantic comedies do, by keeping it in the realm of supremely silly yet totally relateable. The jokes are expertly timed and fit perfectly with the plot. But there are heartfelt moments where you really feel for the characters dilemmas.The acting and characters are really what stand out in this film, and make it special. When comparing it to other films, you will realize that these guys have achieved a new level of comic mastery. Steve Carell as the lead, is a likable nice-guy dork, who just happens to never have had sex at age 40. Paul Rudd, Romany Malco and Seth Rogen play his buddies at work who try to help him get the deed done, and are all superbly funny, each in his own way. Rudd is a bitter romantic, still obsessed with the girl who dumped him years ago. Malco is the suave ladies man who's in reality whipped by his girlfriend, and may have sexuality issues. Rogen is the sensitive but masculine alterna-rocker.What makes this film so much more enjoyable compared to every other romantic sex comedy out there, is that most guys will identify with several of these characters in the movie, or find themselves knowing people just like that. The characters are older and working ordinary low-level retail jobs. They're not teens, they're not in the entertainment biz, they're not too zany or weird, they're just ordinary guys. That's what makes them all so likable. Many of the scenes and situations, as wacky as they are, are taken right out of the real world, being a young single male in today's society. If you are a guy, definitely go out and buy this movie. Anyone who has an open mind and isn't afraid of vulgarity, will adore this film and laugh till they cry.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Nice but not enough...,"""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is a comedy and romance movie in which we have a nerdy guy who is virgin and he meets a single mother with who he wants something more than a simple friendship. Also he had all of his friends trying him to laid even for one time with a woman.I did not like this movie because it was not as I expected it to be and I mean that I wanted to watch and had more information about this man and his life or his previous life (some comebacks were not enough). I also believe that the direction of Judd Apatow was not enough to make this movie just great. Although I have to tell you that the interpretation of Steve Carell who plays as Andy was really nice and also Catherine Keener was great.Lastly I want to tell you that ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is not a bad movie or something like that and do not watch it but the only thing that I want to tell you is to not expect much from this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"superb, hilarious, real","saw a free screening of this awhile back and i have been doing my best to make sure it succeeds by telling everyone i know to go see it. i won't waste time telling the plot, all i knew going in was it was about a 40-year-old virgin and that's all you need to know too. i'd consider probably ""wet hot American summer"" to be the funniest movie i've ever seen, but this might actually be a close second. this has slightly less laughs total but is the rare comedy that is hilarious without being exaggerated at all. i think this is probably Judd Apatow's influence, as well as ditching the Wilsons/Will Farrell/Vince Vaughn/Ben Stiller. none of them has so much as a cameo and the movie is SO MUCH BETTER FOR IT. they are not the only working comedy actors today after all, was there a time when they didn't project the aura of guys sitting around congratulating each other all the time? didn't think so. Steve Carrell proves himself to be the gifted comic we all know he is from the daily show, but he's also a very good actor in the times when he's not playing funny. other than him the most famous people in this are probably Catherine Keener (actually sweet and likable in this movie) and Paul Rudd. they, and everyone else, seem to have been given a lot to do by Apatow but also the freedom to do it the way they want to do it. for example: Seth Rogen--the ""fat kid"" from freaks and geeks--is basically here to be the same sarcastic fat guy, but he piles on the personal touch in a way that is pretty much wholly unique, and still funny as hell. even the smallest characters (the other half of the lesbian couple from ""best in show"" that wasn't stifler's mom is incredible as the 4.y.o.v.'s boss) are given screen time that is almost insanely funny. but all of this with a bare minimum of toilet humor, nary a poop joke, and still the raunchiest thing i've seen in a theater in a long ass time. this movie could not be rated anything lower than R. i hope they don't cut a thing from the print i saw and judging from the lack of questionnaires at the end i doubt they will. so yeah, go see it. you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Not a hint of class, but leaves nothing to the imagination!","Steve Carell has made his way into the world of comedy with his natural ability to create a lovable and yet near pathetically awkward character, and his first solo venture onto the silver screen is no exception. ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" provides Carell with a chance to show deeper dimensions (which, ironically seem almost more shallow) to his particular character, as opposed to his rare and laudable role as Brick Tamland in ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgandy."" The child trapped in a man's body motif works well with Carell's sense of humor, which, in turn, is pretty much exactly what Brick Tamlan was. This is where the movie lost points. The beauty of Carell's character in ""Anchorman"" was that his one-timer lines added just the right amount of completely random and yet necessary humor at key points in the movie. In short less is more. However, with Carell's most recent movie, the writers chose to basically use those bits of genius over and over until they lost their glorious appeal. To my pleasant surprise, Carell does seem to make up for the repetition with some real character. No longer is Steve Carell in the background, but rather in the spotlight, and he adjusted his style accordingly. Unfortunately, Carell's acting ability could not save the movie from its extremely vulgar stretches of humor. There are many scenes of obscene and overworked bits of attempted comedy that do nothing but offer a chance for the viewer to adjust in his seat and look around. Overall, the movie has its shining moments, spearheaded by the talented Carell, but the supporting characters are puppets that offer cheap giggles but add no real substance to the movie. Although mainly still portraying an awkward character, Steve Carell showed some promise of being in more serious roles. I recommend that all those skeptical of the movie's worth rent a copy at the local video store and sit down with a couple friends, and at least have a good time with some friends.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

All I can say is that I am scared that anyone over the age of 14 actually liked this movie. Seriously, wow. This is an embarrassment to the world of comedy, reminiscent of Without A Paddle, and makes any Jim Carrey movie ever made look like pure genius. What I thought would be funny for the first 15 minutes of this movie turned out to be not only the first 15 minutes, but the entire movie in a loop. No evolution of thought, character, or jokes. Simply the same penis-oriented garbage from one scene to another.

"The Big Four Oh, Been There","Although, I was never privileged enough to be treated to the preview, the movie poster for The 40-year-old-virgin was sufficiently sweet. Alone, Steve Carell looks up like a naive, optimistic virgin who has not entirely unveiled the world and expects the world from it. However, the movie reveals a different character. Steve Carell plays Andy Stitzer, who has altogether dismissed friendship and romance alike. Andy spends his time alone playing instruments and video games, but mostly painting and playing with collectible figures. At work he is sociable, but has difficulty connecting with his peers.The story begins when the salespeople need another poker player to fill their quota. Though one player believes Andy' strange persona is surely a ominous sign, they have no one left to ask. After Andy's online poker experience forces one player to leave, the play stops and the workers attempt to know Andy better. The discussion turns toward females and Andy is called on to share his dirtiest moment. His discomfort is quite apparent and he simply repeats how dirty the girl talked. No one is convinced and someone insulting asks if Andy has had sex. Andy quickly denies these claims, but the others readily realize its truth and our story begins.The other workers are quick to help and conform Andy. Though initially Andy is quite excited and willing, he soon grows weary of the chase. He has been accepting advice he does not wholly believe and since there have been no results, he no longer has to participate in these foreign belief systems. Andy has given up on eliminating his virginity and is perfectly content to resume life as it was. The reason this story appeals to me so is that I find conflict's necessity to story difficult to accept. Does every story have to have some pain to be interesting? Is life a series of large and small pains and would that be worth living? 40yov achieves a captivating story and almost too intelligent backdrop for many consecutive laughs. Andy does not accept the conflict. Only the other characters that support him see a problem, just as Chancey Gardiner, the lead in ""Being There"", Peter Sellers final film, was oblivious to his inability to fend for himself. The interesting question is which side the audience participates in. Certainly most more sexually active members of the audience that have great difficulty sitting still for two hours will side with the peers or strongly desire Andy himself. However, the audience will inherently accept Andy's view because he is the story. Thus, we are watching a film that has a brilliant, novel story, but rejects the urgency of the conflict. When Andy does not accept the conflict, the plot thins and we are no longer in an analytic film with normal cause and effect. The film takes a continental approach and the character is not pushed in any direction and picks its actions at leisure. Nonetheless, the modern, reflexive humor will appeal to most audiences.One of the film creators must have been inspired by ""Being There"" because no film has used such a similar form to escape convention while simultaneously appealing to everyone since. The film is actually and literally a remake of ""Being There"", which is no small project and entirely unlikely to succeed. Chancey Gardiner is not allowed to leave his home until he is at least 60 years of age and those 20 years make quite a difference, but clearly the absurdity needed to be toned down. Chancey likewise has had even fewer people in his life, namely 2.3 composed of his adopter, nanny, and someone who fixed the wall. He is forced out of the home because a lack of documentation leaves him claimless to the house. He is forced into the world, while Andy has sidelined the world by choice and blithely so. 40yov can be labeled an intelligent recreation, since it rather drastically changes most elements of the film to where most viewers will not see the analogy and actual identity. I recommend a full pardon and fully condone the decision and motivation of the creators. I would go so far as to thank them for the exposure they will be giving to my favorite film of 7 years and creating a perfect experience for everyone.The second part of the film takes a rather different approach. The story eases back into convention, while Andy struggles to fully understand normality. I am not going to elaborate this section, but Andy suddenly becomes quite fearful of how sex could ruin his first relationship. The filming is cheap, but neutral, never adding or subtracting from the key elements of the film. The set and costume designs demonstrated some mastery and enhanced how Andy's absence from the world has let him escape from it. Of course 40yov had a substantial amount of lessons, all of which were directly related to the film and valid. You may see some good Bergman, Jarmusch-Murray, and Van Sant masterpieces in the next few weeks, but they will have some serious competition in 40yov. Vote: 9.3",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

This movie had more bad language, nudity, sexual situations, and everything else that made it funny. The audience caught on to the feelings of confusion, hope, and nostalgia for everyone's first time and also had developing relationships with friends, co-workers, family, and neighbors.There were many great laughs, lots of opportunity to skewer the singles' scene and modern relationships, but there was also a story of people seeking love.

This is a teen comedy made by mature adults.,"Best. Comedy. Ever. Maybe not the funniest but the best none the less! Oh my god!!! How can a COMEDY be this good? I had no idea what kind of an actor Steve Carell was a after seeing Bruce Almighty but judging from that film I'd say he was nothing special. This movie sure proved me wrong! All the references to other movies were great and very funny to watch. And my favorite the ""Dawn Of The Dead"" remake playing on the TV in the background was very funny and great to see for fans of the movie (like me). The fact that they had nudity and it is a comedy and it's not a teen comedy is the most remarkable thing I have ever seen! It was done in such a classy way that I wouldn't even be embarrassed to show this movie to my mom.Now i do admit that i was extremely embarrassed watching this during the first few scenes with the awkward moments and when they all find out that he's a virgin but you know what? That's just credit to Carells acting and the directing. I tell you Judd Apatow is now one of my favorite director/writers. I can't wait to see Fun With Dick And Jane! Paul Rudd the guy from friends who plays David was quite funny in this. You know I always knew he'd make it after I saw him on that show. He's actually very funny. And his acting here in this movie is actually very good and funny! I actually think that the character Andy Stitzer is a character who a lot of people can identify with. I mean at least teenagers who haven't had sex yet. The way he acts and talks to himself like getting all psyched up about every small little thing in stead of just stop thinking and to just do it. Which he does do in the end of the movie.Apparently most of the dialogue was improvised and i gotta say....I didn't notice it that well. I mean the dialogue did seem a bit more natural than in other movies so if you just stop and listen to it closely for a moment I guess you can tell. But this is in no way a bad thing of course. Another thing I loved was the small skit-like scenes with just funny dialogue. I tell you sometimes I thought I was watching a Kevin Smith movie. Like the guy who wanted to buy the high heels shoes or the whole ""Do you know how i know you're gay?"" thing. Now I mentioned this being like a teen comedy right? Well it really isn't but it has the same feel as a teen movie but the difference is that this movie was actually good.All the main actors in this are not teens but in their 20s 30s and (of course) 40s. Such a great movie! I definitely recommend it to everyone because not only is it funny but it's very encouraging to people who haven't had sex yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The movie's poster is funnier than the movie.,"The feeling persists that Steve Carell is somehow smarter than this material. Perhaps it was his association with ""The Daily Show"" that generates high expectations . . . or, if ""high"" is too strong a word, our expectations are raised at least some inches above the curb abutting the gutter. And indeed, perhaps the original treatment intended to be a witty and ironic take on what is and is not expected of males in the sexual arena in our modern society. Blah blah blah.But that's precisely the sort of movie that Hollywood would never bankroll, and so such idle speculations are really a waste of time. Carell and director John Apatow keep the material strictly aimed at the most lucrative target audience of 18-to-25 year-olds, as well as the younger adolescents who will view the DVD later: morning stiffies; ""you-know-how-I-can-tell-you're-gay"" wisecracks; plenty of T & A; a chick barfing in some dude's face. Carell achieves at least one original moment, to put it charitably (others may call it an all-time new low): he literally gets his hirsute chest bloodily waxed before our eyes. Laughing yet? Yeah -- nothing for adults here, even though the title informs us that it's about a 40-year-old.Then it occurred to me that I was AGAIN witnessing a film featuring both Carell and Paul Rudd. The last time was in *Anchorman*. *The 40-Year-Old Virgin*, therefore, firmly belongs within the Wilson/Vaughn/Stiller/Ferrell/Rudd Nexus of Bad Comedy that I railed about in my review of *Wedding Crashers*. Now, we can add another forward-slash, followed by Carell's name, to the Nexus' lengthy prefix. I suppose one ought to be thankful that Will Ferrell doesn't put in a cameo in this one. Indeed, I almost raised up the rating for *The 40-Year-Old Virgin* to 2 stars out of sheer gratitude for this fact. But! -- Luke Wilson is referenced by actual name when one of the sexy females in the movie compares the Carell character to Wilson, physically speaking. (Carell, who wrote much of the screenplay, proves once again the eternal egotism of writers.) Now that was just one reference to the Nexus too many; therefore, back down to 1 star.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I can't say I am a Steve Carell fan from his show ""The Office"" on NBC -something about the networks seems to make them adept at taking something cool and making it so...not cool. I think it would play better on cable. But I digress, this movie made me laugh until I wanted to stop. I think my only critique would be the run time seems a little long (206 min, I think). The supporting cast is great, the story avoided falling into the clich√© third act conflict that you might expect. Steve Carell is a master at subtle expressions, which makes for half the humor in the show in my opinion. A study said recently that the best way to get women in a receptive emotional mood is to take them out where they will laugh -leaving the theater I have a habit of checking out people's expressions- I noticed the women's faces last night had a BIG afterglow on the way out.

There's nothing ashamed in being a virgin.,"People lose their virginity at certain ages; some lose them at a young age around middle school or high school like this girl I knew who got pregnant at fourteen while others wait until they go to college to experiment life. But if you're Andy Stitzer at age 40 and haven't had sex, it's nothing to be ashamed about.In Judd Apatow's comedy, Steve Carell plays the title character of the 40 Year Old Virgin as Andy Stitzer. He works at a Circuit City wannabe store where on his spare time he collects action figures and rides a bicycle to work along with other places instead of driving a car or picking up women for the matter. He's a nice guy but doesn't have to courage to come out of his shell; even the workers he associates with from David (Paul Rudd), Cal (Seth Rogan), and Jay (Romany Malco) find him a bit disturbing thinking to a point where he might be a serial killer. It's not until Andy reveals at a poker game that he's been a virgin all his life due to the fact that he couldn't get it on with chicks during high school. The trio help Andy find women by taking him to bars and giving advice on how to pick up women. Their plans fail where women think of Andy as too odd while one of them throws up on him when getting a lift home. It all changes when Andy meets Trish (Catherine Keener) at his workplace and helps her out in choosing a DVD player where sparks fly and maybe he'll have his opportunity to lose his virginity.The 40 Year Old Virgin is not only one of the funniest films I've seen, but it's also one of the those comedies where it doesn't really have to be offensive to the subject of sex or those who never had experience sex and want to try it out. I also love the Steve Carell character where he was believable to make me want to watch the rest of the film without having to walk out on a good-to-be-true comedy that's just a riot from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Gets funnier every time,"From a purely objective standpoint, The 40 Year Old Virgin is probably not one of the greatest films ever made. It is not epic like The Godfather, revolutionary like Citizen Kane, or even a new type of comedy like Airplane! was. From my subjective standpoint, though, The 40 Year Old Virgin is one of the best movies around. The reason is plain and simple; the movie's goal is to make you laugh hard and often and to sympathize with the main character, and perhaps no other movie so perfectly achieves the goals they set out as this one does.Steve Carell is Andy Stitzer, one of the nicest men around, but a man so hapless with woman that he once kicked a woman in the nose while she was licking his toes. When his co- workers find out that he is a virgin, they begin an epic quest to get him laid. The first half of the movie is pretty much Andy going through a series of hilarious and humiliating failures; the second half focuses on a blossoming romance between him and Trish (Catherine Keener). As their relationship progresses, Andy's fear grows; he knows he will eventually have to tell Trish about his sexual history (or lack thereof).The 40 Year Old Virgin is raunchy and ridiculous, but not in a pure gross-out way. It's not just a movie for foul-mouthed teenage boys; my mom loves this movie. The reason that this movie is loved by so many people is that it's not just a series of pointless gags. The scenes and characters are important; Carell plays Andy so innocently that we feel so sorry for him, even as we laugh at his misfortunes. We're rooting him on just as hard as his co-workers are. The rare combination of hilarity and realism is what separates The 40 Year Old Virgin from your standard run-of-the-mill comedy.Besides the two excellent leads, the supporting cast is fantastic as well. Standard Judd Apatow players Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, and Leslie Mann are all hilarious as his two friends and potential hook-up partner, respectively. Of particular greatness is Jane Lynch (Best in Show) as Paula, Andy's boss who is willing to help him out with his little problem.The 40 Year Old Virgin is already a classic, a comedy that pushed the envelope and got away with everything. While some people might think that once the romance between Andy and Trish starts, the movie will die down and get sappy, they are sorely mistaken. The movie is hilarious from beginning to end, including an epic song to close things out with a bang. The 40 Year Old Virgin is funny to all people, regardless of age, gender, or maturity. Give this one a shot if you haven't seen it; it's great the first time and just gets better upon multiple viewings.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This movie is the funniest of the year,"Steve really has it down in this one. He is a true comic gem and really shows his stuff in this funny and surprisingly sweet film. Character development is really well done and rare by todays movie standards. With a society that is so caught up in losing their virginity as quickly as possible, showing that you can wait for love and the right person for your first time is really refreshing for a change. Also showing the many sides of how men look at and chase women from the splendid supporting cast is really a treat. You will laugh hard with this one. I hope Steve has a long and rewarding film career, because he is really one of the few comic actors out there that is shining right now and really deserves a fantastic career in the future. Paul Rudd really is becoming quite a comic actor as well, and is super funny in this one. Remember- Sex is great but sex with someone you love is wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Best Guy movie in years!!!,"For guys and girls this movie is awesome. In fact, it is the best guy movie i have seen in years and even has some mushy stuff for the girls. like most of the best movies, it dares to go where most have not gone or don't dare to go. the best thing about it is: it's true to life. every guy knows the feeling. it makes light of an every day subject that almost all guys discuss together. it's funny and true to life. lots of good jokes to boot. What's funny is this is the kind of stuff that my co workers and myself talk about everyday. The movie rocks. It's a don't miss for the guys and I can only guess the girls will like it too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Steve Carell and Judd Apatow are HILARIOUS,"I have been a fan of Steve Carell since I originally saw him as a correspondent on Comedy Central's Daily Show though I never imagined him branching out into feature films; I definitely didn't foresee him headlining his OWN movie. Carell portrays Andy Stitzer, the titular virgin who's co-workers make it their ultimate goal to help Andy get laid for the first time. Simple premise, hilarious pay-off. I can honestly (and easily) say this ranks as one of my favorite comedies; it has also brought Steve Carell, Seth Rogan, and Paul Rudd to my attention as some of the funniest actors working today.A good portion of the movie contains improvised dialogue, which helps give it a genuine feel of chemistry between the entire cast. It really was the cast that made this movie so enjoyable. Steve Carell's great performance is backed up by Seth Rogan (one of my favorite recent comedian/actors), Paul Rudd, Jane Lynch, Romany Malco, and Gerry Bednob. The combined comedic skills of this cast make it one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Keeping the movie grounded is a Catherine Keener as Andy's love interest, Trish. Keener provides some laughs, but she primarily keeps the movie from feeling completely low-brow by giving the movie it's heart.This movie also helped me realize just how desensitized I've become to modern movies. I've only ever seen the unrated DVD, never the theatrical release. Before I'd actually watched the movie, I heard all the stories about how raunchy it was and how crazy some of the scenes were. After watching it, sure I'd laughed myself crazy but I still couldn't help but wonder...what's the big deal? I'd recently discovered the ""unrated"" version would've been NC-17. Whoa. Once I thought about it, yeah, I guess I can see where some of the risqu√© moments might've been a bit much for someone who's a bit more sensitive about the subject matter (i.e. Mooj's relationship advice). So, yeah, if you're more of a conservative person, maybe you should avoid this little gem (though know, you are missing out on a hilarious film). Judd Apatow's feature film directorial debut should NOT be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This movie is awesome.,"This is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. It has some of the same cast as Anchorman, so you know it's going to be good. Steve Carrell is hilarious. I definitely recommend, not for children though. But definitely for adults. If you liked Anchorman, you will like this movie. When Andy's friends try to get him laid, everything is a disaster and he ends up having a relationship with a no sex policy. The ""Do you know how I know you're gay"" scene is just hilarious. Everyone should see this movie. You can really relate to it. It's not like it's way out there and you can't relate to it. It could happen to anybody. That's what I like about this movie. How Andy tries to play it cool and gets totally smashed could happen to anybody.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
VERY funny,"AFter receiving free-passes to a screening of the 40 yr old virgin, I wasn't expecting much, but was very pleasantly surprised. This movie had me in tears in several places from laughing so hard. There's a fair amount of swearing, drug references and some nudity, but the story is good, the jokes are non-stop and hilarious. I highly recommend it. You'll notice some familiar faces if you've seen Steve Carell in other movies like Anchorman. In Virgin, he re-teams with Paul Rudd, as a co-worker in an electronics store, as well as Seth Rogan. Ca There's a cameo from David Koechner (Anchorman) and Nancy Walls (Daily Show, SNL).",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Dumb film for a dumb audience,"At least with the teenage geek gets the girl films, the guy is usually unpopular with girls. In the 40 Year Old Virgin he is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women but somehow has remained a virgin. But then you are not supposed to engage your brain with this film or did I miss the bit about him being comatose for 20 years?One of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent TV comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs. They've done the gross out movies. They've done the let's act like all Americans have a mental age of 15. Where will they go next?This film is crass and crude entertainment with nothing to recommend it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Surprising Raunch-fest, Funny Movie","I was able to see an advanced screening of this film last night. I was extremely surprised. Having spent the last two rainy Saturdays seeing ""Wedding Crashers"", this was a nice supplement to a summer of surprisingly funny movies. The previews do not do this movie justice. Generally, TV spots and trailers for summer comedies highlight the funniest parts of the films, and audiences are left with the scraps that somehow made it past the cutting room floor. Not the case with The 40 year old Virgin. This may or may not do well in reviews, it's not ""Sideways"" with scenes that are funny because they are so dark, and yet captured with complete realism. And yet it's not over the top, absurdism like last summer's ""Anchorman"". It's somewhere in between and makes use of the difference.Steve Carell, as suspected, can hold his own in feature films. His demeanor and delivery are on target in every scene. He's able to capture the candid, sardonic wit that a 40 year old man would possess and yet captures the inexperience, anxiety, and childish nature that are associated with the ""virgin"" connotation. The supporting cast, including Paul Rudd and Catherine Keener, are great and all provide various insight to the connundrums of modern-day manhood and the emphasis placed on sexual experience.40 year old is raunchy, punchy, and steadily brings in the laughs. Worth seeing this summer. Will also make a great DVD to compliment ""Old School.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
He is still a virgin.,"In this movie Steve Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a stock room worker at a stereo store. He is a pretty average 40-year-old guy, except for one thing, he is still a virgin. Now that all his co-workers know, they are on a mission to change this.If you like 'Wedding Crashers' and 'Anchorman', then you need to see this movie. It is hard to put into words just how funny it is. In my opinion, it is about time Steve Carell had a starring role like this. In this you have the misadventures of Andy Stitzer as he tries to 'grow up'. Despite the pressure from his friends, he is in no hurry to change. Andy wants finds true love with Trish (Catherine Keener) and does not want sex to get in the way, at least not yet.Teamed up with fellow 'Anchorman' alums Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and Judd Apatow (director of both films), 'The 40-year-old Virgin' is a must see for the summer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Loved the first half, huge fan of all the quotes i picked up in this movie","Huge fan of the quotes in this movie!!!! To be honest i didn't so much like the second half it got really mushy, but that was to be expected. The first half though was hilarious, i cant remember the last time i laughed so much, so loud. I have seen it twice already and my friend has seen it 3 times and we plan to go again its just a fun movie to go see, and i don't usually go see the same movie in theaters so to me that says a lot that i would. I think Steve Carrel (andy) seriously lived up to expectations and i hope to see more from him.

"A guy who has not grown up and is a ""40 year old Virgin."" Rides a bike to work & collects action figures","THIS MOVIE WAS BAD! The script was amateur and the acting by Carel was poor and uneven. Steve Carel is great in, The Office TV series. But, in 40 year Old Virgin, he was uncharismatic and uneven. There was no ""ring of truth"" to the performances any of the characters or the story-line, which was as hackneyed as it could possibly be. There were, of course, at least a few funny moments (jokes that worked) and a few laughs. The attempted ethnic humor was quite heavy hitting and simply trite, not funny. It came off as racist without any of the requisite humor to justify it. The director must be largely to blame for this film's failures, but the script did not give him much to work with. It seemed an amateur attempt at best.The oddest thing to me is that it is a huge financial success and in being so, there is no incentive to not make crappy unfunny movies of this kind.Adam Sandler's movies are often guilty of some of these same short comings but at least he can be genuinely funny and you can like and sympathize with his characters enough to forgive the poor script and direction. The 40 year Old Virgin has none of the charm of an Adam Sandler film and all of the short comings.This is one to miss. Instead, rent Sandler's Big Daddy, again, at least you know what you are getting.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""Virgin Is Without A Doubt, The Funniest Comedy In Years.""","Andy Stitzer is a toy collector, who plays video games, rides a bicycle to work and has never had sex. When his co-workers need a fifth poker buddy they ask Andy to join in on the fun. After some raunchy sex talk they discover that Andy is in fact a virgin and they make it their mission to get Andy laid. When Andy meets a beautiful woman who is divorced and has kids, he falls in love, and finds it hard to keep his virginity a secret.Steve Carell is a funny guy, you have probably noticed him in many comedic films as the asshole, Bruce Almighty, the creepy guy, Achorman, and loser, Sleepover. In virgin he wrote the material, so he knows how to play the character perfectly. With it's R rating, Carell and co were able to let anything fly in terms of their sexual innuendos.Judd Apatow has his directorial debut with Virgin, his previous work including off beat comedy Undeclared and Freaks and Geeks. When the director and actor both write the film and both get what is funny about it, it makes it a lot easier to connect to the audience. It is a raunchy movie. The sex jokes are everywhere, the swearing is everywhere. But it all fits in this movie. Carell is so innocent in the movie, so seeing him curse so much is odd in a funny way. Catherine Keener looks and performance good in this film, but it's Carell's friends that are funny.The film has many comedic highlights, unlike other comedy films that may contain only one or two. Birgin manages to keep the laughs coming and each time they do, they get longer and louder. Carell wax chest scene had me in tears and the fact that everyone knows that it was real made it even funnier. Seeing the reactions from the actors in the room was priceless and Carells ""cursing"" was hilarious. Another highlight was Carell trying to put on the condoms. He has trouble of course cause he has never had sex. So when the condom snaps and hits him in the penis you can't help but laugh. To add icing to the cake the kids enter and see the ""used"" condoms on the bed and ask how many times they did it. The ending song credits is one of the funniest moments, if you know where the joke is.Virgin is indeed the funniest movie of 2005. It is hilarious and has a good message about abstinence. The only downfall of the film would be it's running time, it goes over 2 hours and they could have easily cut some of the material out. During the film I had mixed emotions about the length, at first I did not want it to end, then I was thinking to myself, this is a long movie.Carell's talent in other films and the office were not really noticed. Now that he has a successful film under his belt, his previous work will be acknowledge and his future projects will be plenty. I'm for one glad to see new faces in comedy rising and hopefully others will be fading, Sandler and Stiller.In the end, Virgin is the laugh out loud comedy of the year and you should definitely check it out if not for the laughs, then for the message.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Tenace Reviews All the DVDs He Owns,"I was hesitant to see this one at first, despite all of the glowing reviews I heard/read about it. I don't like romantic comedies, and especially frown on those about nerdy loser guys that somehow transform into suave Casanovas. I figured this would be just another body for the Lame Rom-Com pile, and that it would disappear from the scene as fast as it had arrived.But no. This movie is head and shoulders above the rest of its genre. The writing is surprisingly true to life and almost completely devoid of the telegraphed pratfalls and manufactured sappiness that I have come to expect. It also features a dynamite cast of supporting characters. These characters can always make or break a movie, and in this one their parts are all handled perfectly. It's safe to say this is one of the best-acted rom-coms that I've seen in years.In short, this is a romantic comedy that does everything right. It's still ultimately predictable and a bit soft, but easily gains an 8 point rating. For those of you who always love a good rom-com, this movie could be a 9 or a 10.Next Review: Alien // Previous Review: 2001 Maniacs",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I found it foul and vulgar. I haven't said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill. The humor is sophomoric and crude. I am not a politically correct person, and even I found the gay jokes, not only not funny but downright offensive ( I'm not gay).

Comedic gold,"""40 Year Old Virgin"" is one of the best comedies of this year. It is, of course, full of sexual humor and some people wouldn't like it because of all of this raunchy type of humor.

After his shows as supporting actor in other films such as ""Bruce Almighty"" and ""Anchorman"", he finally gets his own movie, and he doesn't waste the opportunity.

He pulls off the innocent guy routine so well, and you should be sympathizing with him by the end of the picture.A movie that is absolutely hilarious.

Crude and funny,"I enjoy comedy movies by Judd Apatow and this movie is no exception. This hilarious sex comedy starring Steve Carrell as a 40 year old man who, as the title states, has never before had sex is had me laughing like crazy in many scenes. The film's use of sexual jokes was quite clever and the casting was just perfect. Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, and Romany Malco were insanely funny.One of my funniest scenes of the movie was the hair waxing scene where Steve Carrell's character succumbs a painful hair waxing procedure which had me laughing so hard it hurt. The second scene I loved was the ""you know how I know you're gay"" scene between Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd. I just think about comebacks they used in that scene and immediately start laughing.(8/10)This is one comedy everyone needs to see!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Surprisingly more than just a 'comedy',"I have been hearing of this movie for many years, but have never gotten around to watching it. Finally, one decade after its release, I have sat down and watched it. Heading in, I didn't expect anything more than a typical comedy that didn't have much to show for besides being funny. To my surprise, I found myself tearing up at the end. Whether this is because I seem to be more emotional during movies, or just because that's how it's supposed to be, the film sends a strong message. That message? Love wins. I don't normally feel the need to give comedies high praise, but I feel this film deserves it. Not only is it funny, but it teaches an important lesson in life. To my delight, Seth Rogen stars in the film and plays one of the many funny characters. I had only expected to see Steve Carell as the one actor I would recognize, but I recognized quite a few. The chemistry between the core group of characters works and flows naturally. It is quite the experience seeing how things unfold for the 40 year old virgin and I promise it will entertain.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
worst 12 quid I ever spent,"I fail to see how anyone found this movie remotely funny. If I hadn't been there with someone who actually wanted to watch it I would have walked out. This was probably the longest 2 hours of my life.I think the script (if indeed there was one) was written in an afternoon by a couple of 13 year old boys. The real problem being that after they had written 15 mins worth they had to pad out the other 90 with the most inane dialogue I have ever heard.If you get a chuckle out of hearing the F word or the 100's of euphemisms to describe genitalia then knock yourself out.

Real and real funny,"Right from the moment you spot the poster for this film, you know it's going to be funny. The unspoiled bright-eyed photo of Steve Carell says it all: this is the kind of movie that he was born to star in.If you can accept that the character of Andy Stitzer exists, the events that transpire throughout the course of the movie are at least believable if not seemingly honest. Andy's actions are understandably na√Øve but not so over the top absurd that you can no longer sympathize with his character. This grounding in reality gives the film a day-in-the-life feel that might be unexpected given the sophomoric overtones of the title.Overall, the character development makes the film. The relationship dynamics between Andy and the other characters maximizes the impact of the story and, more importantly, the jokes. This movie operates on all cylinders, delivering humor on many levels beyond the straight up bawdy sexual humor that's naturally expected.There are a few significant lapses in reality, most notably when a love interest is inexplicably sparked, and when the usually bumbling Andy suddenly begins spouting sarcasm. These lapses can be easily forgiven given the fact that they would have likely gone unnoticed in a lesser comedy, and, in the case of the latter, add to the overall entertainment value of the film.This film isn't everything to everyone, but it is funny. Really funny. Also, make sure you watch till the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Formulaic but funny,"This film isn't going to win awards for originality - for all intents and purposes it's American Pie but it simply transposes the role of Jim and co onto a group of people more than twice their age. The film isn't the funniest that you'll see and at times it IS essentially a teen comedy but it manages to steer clear of more of the lowest common denominator which blights that genre.In many respects, this has taken the awkward humour from that but aged it up and taken the pointless schmaltz and replaced it with a more realistic and less saccharine romance.This film is rather gently paced, you won't be reeling from continuous never ending jokes but there is a gentle and pervasive character humour here that is what makes the film more interesting than most. While the ending is pretty obvious from the start, you still will our hero and his friends to it.All in all, this film despite it's somewhat limited nature, manages to be amusing and at times quite endearing.

The characters were all funny especially Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen and even the smallest role characters had great lines that made the movie hysterical. I couldn't help but notice that this was an original but an odd film in many reasons. I watched the unrated version and couldn't notice of how long it was. 2 hours and 13 minutes is pretty long for a comedy!

A  Steve Carell Comedy Classic,"Steve Carell has proved himself to be a comic genius with his first starring role in The 40 Year Old Virgin he had supporting roles in Anchorman The Legend Of Ron Burgundy , Bewitched and Bruce Almighty.Director Judd Apatow made an excellent choice when casting him as the main character, Carell's own brand of humor is crazy, hilarious and charming. For the whole two hours I laughed so hard because this is one of the funniest films that I've ever seen before.The scenes were really funny especially the one when his character is getting his chest waxed, the chemistry between Catherine Keener & Steve Carell is heartwarming and romantic they made a cute couple.Andy Stitzer (Carell) is 40 years old and lives a quiet life he has an apartment filled with every action figure toy and video game imaginable and a job at an electronics store but there's one thing that he hasn't done that most men do at that age he's never ever had sex.

It shows off his uncanny ability to tell an intriguing story and also pack it full of absurd, vulgar, and hilarious jokes. There is not a dull moment in The 40 Year Old Virgin. It's wall to wall laughs with every scenario getting wilder and funnier. Even clocking in at just under two hours, or two hours and 13 minutes if you watch the unrated version, the film is still funny and wildly entertaining from start to finish.Apatow deserves a lot of credit for his directing and writing, but the actors in this film deserve just as much. The film is crammed with stars and the amount of cameos is brilliant. Some of the celebrity faces we see in this film weren't even big stars when the film was released, such as Mindy Kaling's cameo as an ex-girlfriend of Paul Rudd's character. In 2005 she was just beginning her role as Kelly on The Office, but today she's incredibly popular. But that's just the tip of the iceberg.Steve Carell is obviously hilarious as Andy and the film would not be the same without him. But the star studded supporting cast is just as impressive. Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Jane Lynch, Leslie Mann, Elizabeth Banks, and a brief moment from Jonah Hill give this film comedic life all the way through. Much of the script was improvised on set, which produced hysterical results. This is a perfect cast to pull off this level of improvised hilarity and it gives the comedic stylings of this film a fresh and natural feeling which makes it all the more hilarious.The 40 Year Old Virgin is modern comedic genius. It's unforgettably hilarious, incredibly quotable, and shockingly vulgar, but in a good way. It will probably always be the glimmering peak of Steve Carell's film career, even if it was so early on in that career. Apatow will probably never surpass this film in anything he writes, directs, or produces. The 40 Year Old Virgin is simply too funny.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Grossly OTT,"Given the premise I thought the film could and should have been much better. Yes, if you cut through the unlikely attention given to Andy's virginal state by all and sundry, the number of women who were attracted to him, not least his Boss at the TV store, his unlikely stance and manner when addressing the babe in the book shop, there was a core story of real substance and meaning. It's not good enough to suggest that sex had just 'passed him by' when he was a good looking, healthy male specimen. For me the piece was played like a farce, and looked for laughs, when a little more depth and subtlety could have given us so much more. Plus it was too long by half an hour. All those meaningless conversations by Andy's 'buddies'. Just not necessary. If more time had been spent on developing Andy as a character' if we had 'seen' more of the guy maybe in flashbacks, in situations, resulting in his state, it would have made his final triumph that more satisfying.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Perfect Virgin Picker-Upper,"Steve Carell bursts out of the closet of support acting to star in his own hit movie. I can't imagine someone better for the part than this man. The movie starts with a continuous stream of funny scenes and moves into a romantic mood leaving you feeling good about yourself.The producers were thrilled when their low budget movie was met with such enthusiasm and made the top ten list in most of the cities it was shown in. This proves that our age is not ruled by high-tech, state-of-the-art effects movies with violence and nudity.A great picker-upper for virgins and a great movie to watch with someone you love. I highly recommend watching it and buying it on DVD because this will definitely be a future collectible.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Sweet and Gross at the same time,"Wow. I didn't know if it'd be possible to mix this much raunchiness and sweetness together in the same movie and have it turn out good. This film somehow manages it.I suppose the real criticism I have with the film is that it does go on too long. Granted, I was watching the Unrated Edition, which adds on 17 more minutes of footage; I think at least 20 minutes needed to go, because I was getting a little tired towards the end of the film.But that didn't stop me from liking it. The characters are all very well drawn, have their own foibles and the side characters, as simple as they are, are not entirely stock. The film focuses on an awkward shy virgin, Andy, played by Steve Carrell. What I like about Andy's characterization is that he's not an ""empty"" character, but is surprisingly sociable for being a bit of a shut-in--this is a nerd with depth.Anyway, I don't need to explain the premise to you, but some of the situations that Andy is put in by his friends or by his own bumbling are hilarious and sometimes they're incredibly disgusting. At the same time, there's a surprising amount of pathos put into even some of the gross-out scenes. The directing isn't exactly brisk, but it keeps the mood and sets the tone of the film well. This isn't a dying-of-laughter comedy, but it had me smiling inside, which being grossed out on the outside, which doesn't happen frequently.Some of the jokes don't work so well, including the improvised ""You're gay because..."" series that permeate the latter half of the film. Still, the funny is more hit than miss and I really like how the film has something good to say about the pressure to have sex. And then there's the non-sequitar ending--but you'll have to watch it to know what I'm talking about. A solid comedy, but you might consider finding the theatrical version to keep the pace up. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Flawless Carell!,"This is a decent comedy picture. Steve Carell performed flawlessly, handling comedy, romance and serious acting with ease - this guy is seriously talented and he's done a fantastic job. I expected the plot to be one dimensional, focused on only getting Andy (Carell) to lose his virginity but there were some decent sub-plots and his character's journey was engaging and flush with original comedy moments.This to me was a very different American comedy, laughing close to the bone; Andy's loneliness, self-alienation as well as some tough jokes about Al-Queda and Indian-Asians. Plently of inter-textuality; name dropping recent events, pop news and perhaps too many similies to American celebrity's meant a lot of jokes were wasted on an English audience.A strong supporting cast did well especially Seth Rogen who is sure for bright things, he played his role quietly and had some excellent delivery. But a word on Paul Rudd who played the ex-girlfriend pining David. His story was boring and tedious, his whinging about his ex-girlfriend was empty and his performance in the film was woeful. Timing way off and improvisations weak. Inevitably the weakest parts of the film were Rudd's scenes. I felt actor Paul Rudd had requested more lines and story-emphasis such was amount of weak lines and go-nowhere dialogue he spouted.40 year old virgin is a strong comedy, the script isn't dynamite but Steve Carell makes weak gags strong with a mockery style tone, he really did an incredible job and he's a name i want to see more of. I feel with out Carell this film wouldn't be nearly as funny, he makes laughs at minutes, turning the bad jokes upside down.Fans of the Office and Arrested Development will particularly enjoy this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Virguoisity good comedy,"If you have not been de-virginized by inserting yourself to see the lauded ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", then you have not reached the ultimate climax in film comedy for 2005. The laughable Steve Carell stars as Andy Stitzer, a sound-store stock supervisor who has never made love to a woman in his 40 years of dull existence. That does not ""sound"" very good for Andy! He has ""come"" close but no cigars! Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen co-star as his partners in virgin watch whom are determined to come to a means to an end to get Andy out of the morbid state of ""Virginia"". Catherine Keener plays Trish, the E-Bay products store owner who auctions herself to Andy as his potential ""virgin breaker"", or in other words Trish is the tasty dish that Andy falls for. The film is packed with side-splitting gags that are of the ""sexual comical healing"" material. The masturbating ""hello"", condom for dummy virgins, and most notably the chest hair waxing scenes will be the ""hair apparent"" supreme comical scenes of the year. Carell's subtle but yet magnetic performance should break him in as one of the superb comical actors of our present time. The great Keener always contributes excellent keen thespian awareness to her roles and here is no different as Trish. Rudd also contributes an amusing performance as the heartbroken porno-enthusiast David. Rudd was ""porn to be alive"" to play that supporting role. Director Judd Apatow does have a juicy raunchy appetite for comedy and shows that Judd is no comedic directorial dud. However, his only misfire was to elongate ""The 40 Year Old Virgin's"" running time 30 minutes over its satisfactory climax level. Nevertheless, Apatow & Carell which by the way also impressively scribed the film, are on their way to comedic greatness in pleasing all our comedy film desires for many years to ""come"". **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Truly one of the worst movies I've seen,"I was embarrassed by the movie's first 1/2 which should have taken place in some 16 year old boys' basements, not 30 something grown men. It was really ridiculous. Steve is very very funny, but the director or producers should have worked to make it a more likable movie. Catherine Keener...now that's a different subject. She was fantastic! I'd love to have lost it to her. How the same actress from Being John Malcovich could have been drawn in to this is baffling. And what was up with the ""Dawning of Aquarius"" dance sequence at the end? Had they found some film left over and needed to shoot it so it wouldn't go to waste? Too bad..they wasted it anyways. They could've saved the day by providing out-takes instead.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very funny!,"My husband and I laughed throughout the whole movie! The whole theater was cracking up. Very funny! There was a lot of humor that came pretty quickly, and teens and young adults may not even get some of it. The choice of music was funny, too. I loved it that he had an Asia poster and then later they played an Asia song. We are both around 40, so we related with a lot of the humor. I have always been a big fan of Carolyn Keener, and it was fun to see her in a light role. It's not going to win any Oscars, but it was a really fun night out. We have been quoting a lot of the lines since. There is a lot of swearing and frank sexual language, though, so if that offends you, you might want to see something else.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Carell goes all the way to make you laugh.,"I popped my 'Judd Apatow cherry' with Knocked Up, and the experience was less than satisfying: rather awkward, painful at times, and not something I was in a hurry to repeat. However, with The 40 Year Old Virgin, I really got in the mood, and by the time the end credits were rolling (just after the entire cast had performed their excellent rendition of The Age of Aquarius), I was completely spent, having shared two hours of my life in the company of a film that really knew what it was doing!The plot sees Steve Carell's likable nerd Andy Stitzer coerced by his work buddies into admitting that he has reached the grand old age of 40 without having sex. On discovering that Andy is still a virgin, they vow to help the poor guy get laid. It's a simple premise that delivers plenty of vulgarity, nudity, and childish humour (all of which I am in favour of), but at the same time allows you to care for its characters, even managing to throw in a bit of genuine romance and drama for good measure.Carell is great as the geek who has to grow a pair and confront his fears in order to find happiness, whilst the supporting cast who play his pals (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco and Seth Rogen) are all excellent in their respective roles. For me, however, Catherine Keener was particularly outstanding as the love interest, looking very hot for a 46 year old.At nearly two hours, the film is perhaps a little overlong and some judicious trimming could have improved the flow somewhat, but, on the whole, The 40 Year Old virgin is a very funny film and recommended to all open-minded viewers looking for a laugh (unless you happen to be a 40 year old virgin yourself, in which case you'll probably spend the whole movie cringing whilst pretending to laugh at the jokes. If that's the case, avoid it completely or watch it alone¬ówhich I guess you probably would do anyway...).",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Commercial comedy meets quirky comedy........,"Even though in India its fully acceptable to loose the Big ""V"" after marriage (no one really knows what happens though), but even here especially among the ""cooler"" guys, as a 23 yr old virgin (can guys be virgins?), I will occasionally get the ""Are you mad"" looks.At 40 even a person in India is considered weird and I was sure in the great land of America a similar situation would lead to nothing but laughs.And sure enough this movie was absolutely hilarious....Steve Carell did a brilliant job as the protagonist, the movie is not your normal run of the mill slapstick comedy but has the ""clerks"" sort of feel to it and a similar background, also unlike most modern comedies that are very situation and event based this movie has off-beat humour that involves lots of funny situations when just a bunch of guys are talking.This makes the movie like a multi-genre comedy with a fair amount of character, situational and quirky-conversational comedy, also a small dose of satire.The rest of the cast to is excellent with some hilarious performances all around I particularly liked Gerry Bednob as the abusive salesclerk of Indian Origin.Technically the film was OK with nothing really standing out the background score was also nothing special.There are however does have some stretches of boring moments and not so funny scenes especially in the second half AT 133 MINS THE UNRATED VERSION MAY NOT BE OF EPIC LEGNTH BUT IS A GOOD HALF LONGER THAN MOST COMEDY FILMS.Most of the conversations are hilarious standalone and you will laugh every time you remember them but the sheer number of these (check the quotes to see what i mean) mean that after a while they don't have a similar impact on you.Besides the hilarious quotes and one-liners this movie has some hilarious scenes as well especially the speed-dating one.In all a great comedy with fair bit of all kinds of humour, that ironically gets hampered by the sheer number of hilarious conversations and some ordinary scenes towards the end.

"A bit too long, perhaps, but otherwise charming and funny","Following a couple of supporting roles in Bruce Almighty and Anchorman (not to mention a regular presence on Saturday Night Live), Steve Carell rose to fame playing the lead in The 40 Year Old Virgin. The title might make some believe the movie's gonna be two hours of puerile jokes, but that's far from true: it's actually a really smart and interesting comedy, as well as a showcase of Carell's star power.His character, Andy Stitzer, leads a pretty dull life: he collects action figures, goes everywhere by bike and has no social life (except for a neighbor with whom he watches Survivor). Then one night he's asked to join his colleagues from the hi-fi store for a poker game. Once the guys start talking about their sex lives, it turns out Andy's a virgin (who else would say a woman's breasts ""feel like a bag full of sand"" ?). Since that's a quite embarrassing condition for a 40-year old, his ""pals"" see it as their duty to make sure Andy finally sleeps with someone. Hence a series of increasingly awkward situations involving drunk teenagers, speed dating and male prostitutes (you know, just in case our man doesn't like the ladies). In the meantime, Andy has managed to find the woman of his dreams: Trish (Catherine Keener), a single mother who sells things on e-bay. There's an obvious spark between them, with only one blatant problem: how long before Andy will have to tell her the inconvenient truth?The charm of this film lies in the direction the story takes once the premise is set: what started as a mere search for sex turns into a quest for true love, as the protagonist struggles to get to the end of the story without jeopardizing his relationship with Trish (the chemistry between the two characters is truly moving). Instead of another gross-out comedy, director Judd Apatow (who also co-wrote the script with his leading man) has delivered something a little more profound, with the occasional bits of mandatory slapstick (Andy getting his chest waxed... ouch!). The only real criticism I can raise about The 40 Year Old Virgin concerns its excessive running time: being almost two hours long, it seems like some set-pieces were added just to keep the movie going before it reaches its predictable yet enjoyable conclusion. It is, however, worth watching, both for its absurd but believable concept and the hilarious Carell, who proves to be a genuinely funny guy, with hints of an ability to tackle more mature roles as well (as he did superbly in the splendid Little Miss Sunshine). This film deserves all the praise it has received for putting such a talented comedian on the map.7,5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""40-Year Old Virgin"" is an adolescent comedy.","""40 - Year Old Virgin"" is a slapstick comedy that will definitely entertain the adolescents in the crowd.

Many of us older fogies got a lot of belly laughs as well. John Stewart gave it a good review on his Cable Network show ""Comedy Central"", and the plug was well taken. One should not expect to see an academy award winning performance by anyone, but give it a chance and have a great time at the movies.

Being a virgin really is something to laugh at,"You can't help but think that this movie is somehow going to fail. Once it starts, you hope you are wrong. Thanks to the fertility gods this movie was hilarious. There is something very special about Steve Carell. His subtle approach makes practically everything he does or say worth paying attention to. Even the scene where he (this harmless, naive 40 year old going through his first childhood still) verbally abuses an innocent woman is hilarious even though all the while you can still feel sorry for the poor lady. But heck, even she is laughing. They must have forgot to tell her to act. The only bad part is not worth mentioning except I don't want to leave the impression this movie is perfect. It is too long by about 20 to 30 minutes because it does have that slow part in the middle and towards the end that just about all comedies have for some reason. All in all, this is as perfect as any comedy can get.

Awesome movie!,"I was really skeptical when I first heard of this movie. I didn't like Steve Carrell in Bruce Almighty, but I did like him in Anchorman.

I cannot stress enough that you should see this!!,"The 40 Year Old Virign is a refreshingly raunchy film. This film, and The Wedding Crashers, are a sign that the R-rated film may be making a comeback. In a tepid desert of PG-13 films, we adults need a true oasis of mature comedy every now and then.Already a profitable venture after only a couple weeks at the box office, this film is sure to launch actor/writer Steve Carell into orbit as a major star. The film is crude, but in a Blazing Saddles kind of way. Crudeness if done with good intentions can be the most hilarious kind of comedy. The film does a wonderful job of creating multi-dimensional characters the audience can actually care about. The film never bogs down, and that is quite an achievement for a comedy that spans nearly two whole hours.Steve Carell plays... well like the title says: a forty year old guy who has never had sex. He's had his chances, but blown all of them. After time he just seemed to give up as a younger man. He retreated into his own little world of video games, vintage action figures, and celibacy. Once his friends at work learn his secret, they set out to get him laid by any means necessary leading to one hilarious scene after another. What's odd is that Carell's character seems oddly at peace without the need for sex. He seems happy enough without it, but once he meets a woman he really has feelings for, sex becomes inevitable.What was crude about it? Well.... there were numerous racial jokes, but you have to understand where they were coming from. There was nothing mean-spirited about any of them, but I'm sure some people would be offended. Some people are always looking to be offended. There are gay jokes, drunk driving jokes, you name it. Maybe we shouldn't be laughing at these things, but dammit I was. Again and again.It was strange. Not too many other people at the showing I saw were laughing all that much. Maybe it was because it was an early afternoon showing and people weren't geared up to laugh yet. I hate to be the only person in a theater laughing out loud, so I had to try and stifle my laughter but it seldom worked. This film is a hoot, and I'm glad it is scoring as highly as it is so far on this site. Even stuffy critics like Roger Ebert seem to have been won over by this film and its charismatic star.If you are looking for a truly funny film then go see this one immediately!!!

Too Gross for Me; Very Good Carrell,"""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" Too gross for me, but the audience loved it.Reviews, articles, and even an interview on Terry Gross' ""Fresh Air"" lead me to believe that this movie was a tad more adult than it is.In fact it is a gross-out, teen-boy comedy. It opens with a graphic description of a stage show involving a horse and a Mexican girl, probably a sex slave.It includes graphic scenes of vomit and urine being splashed in the main character's face.Women's bodies are major sources of humor, with punchlines like, ""Don't put (vulgar term for women) on a pedestal,"" and visual gags like a woman's breast coming out of her shirt, with the completely unlikely result that she is unaware of it and fails to cover it up.All the male characters, no matter their chronological age, are boys. There is a lengthy scene where two unattractive men (what happened to the cute, young Paul Rudd of ""Clueless""? Is he already fat and balding?) play violent video games while making homophobic ""jokes."" As in all the teen boy gross out comedies, from ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" to ""Wedding Crashers,"" though these boys are terrified of homosexuals, the only ""love"" they are capable of feeling is for other men.The audience I was with loved this movie. They laughed out loud in several spots; there was much more laughter than in any movie I've seen in a while -- certainly more than at ""Wedding Crashers."" Steve Carrell was wonderful. ""The Daily Show"" didn't prepare me for how much movie star charisma he has. The scene where his chest hair is removed is an instant classic, and will become a kinky favorite among some fetishists, I'm sure.Otherwise, though ...

Although, I don't know what that has to do with it. I just felt like getting it off my chest. I did like Carell as Uncle Authur in Bewitched, which I only watched because I am a Nicole Kidman fan. But, that's it. Nothing else. Sorry.Neither have I seen Paul Rudd in anything but Friends, and was a virgin on all the other characters, with the exception of Catherine Keener, whom I've seen in The Interpreter, S1m0ne, and Out of Sight, and who I hope to see soon in The Ballad of Jack and Rose, which I immediately ordered, and Capote, when it gets to the hinterlands.

His store pals, who seem to have materialized out of an old MARRIED WITH CHILDREN episode, decide to do something about his condition and take him in hand, literally and figuratively. The first half of the movie is a raunchy, American PIE-type comedy. The second half, about the guy's romancing of a middle-aged divorc√©e complete with kids, is a sweet take on adult relationships. The ending, a very funny sendup of the movie HAIR, completes the no-longer lonely guy's journey in a truly bizarre manner. Steve Carrell, a character actor last seen in ANCHORMAN, is the aging virgin and plays the role as if he were channeling Ben Stiller in MEET THE PARENTS. Several other ANCHORMAN performers are on hand for the fun and merriment, most notably Paul Rudd as Carrell's lovelorn best buddy. That DEATH TO SMOOCHY gal, Catherine Keener, plays Carrell's love interest. Highly recommended, but only if you're an adult. This could easily have been an NC-17, and the extended and deleted scenes on the DVD prove it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Hearing the word ""P***y"" after the 5th time just stopped being funny","Thumbs down - save your time & money, see something else.Funniest moments were while Chinese women wax his hairy chest as this clean-cut guy hurls gutter-language like a sailor. I've never heard the word ""pussy"" so many times in 2 hours. It stopped being funny. I started feeling kind of creepy. I was glad I was not on a date.If you like skin flicks, the movie will disappoint you because it is 99 1/2% free of nudity. The main characters are all guys who do not have any sex successes. The main female character is definitely NOT hot (she's a grandmother, honest).To summarize, on a light insubstantial level, movie kind of grosses-creeps-weirds you out by hearing ""pussy"" and other pre-teen slang for a woman's bottom maybe 200 times. On a more serious-quality movie level, the movie never even pretends to have any meaning.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""I'm very discreet, but I will haunt your dreams""","It's rude, crude, and irreverent, and it's one of the best films of the year! It's the Forty Year Old Virgin, a film that is so full of gross-out gags and cheeky humour that most viewers will be aching with laughter. Together with a hilarious, acerbic script, sharp performances, great characters, and a willingness to tackle taboos, it's also a charmingly engaging love story.Like one of the plastic-encased action figures that line his Studio City apartment, Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) is all wrapped up. A stockroom manager at consumer electronics store, in The Valley, Andy's never learned how to drive, never had a steady girlfriend, and, at the ripe old age of 40, has never had sex. His sexual history is a chronology of embarrassing near misses. He certainly likes women; he's just a victim of circumstance.When his brash, beer swilling colleagues David, Jay, and Cal ((lovelorn Paul Rudd, quirky Romany Malco, and rakish Seth Rogen) invite him for an after hours card game, they find out that he's never been with a woman. So they set out to rid him of his wretched virginity by helping him find a girl ¬ñ any girl. They are full of stupid schemes, the point being, of course, that they are even more childishly screwed up in their relations with women than he is, and delusional as well.Amongst the drunken girls, the partying, the dope smoking, and all the embarrassing humiliating moments, Andy meets a Trish (Katherine Keener ¬ñ just wonderful!). Trish is a real woman, a laid back, middle-aged divorc√©e, who has been around the block a few times. She's nearly Andy's opposite, Even her job - running one of those we-sell-it-for-you-on-eBay stores - is symbolic: She spends her days trafficking in other people's unwanted goods.So it comes as no surprise that Trish is attracted by Andy's innocence, even turned on by it - before she knows why he's so innocent. While Andy is inspired by her to finally let go of his childhood childish things, Trish, along with Andy's timid blessing, is more than happy to develop a relationship without sex for a change.Carell so fully inhabits this role, making Andy a handsome but dorky kind of guy with a too bright smile that flashes nervously. He's is a man who has more testosterone than he knows what to do with; his over exercised chest bristles with thick, dark hair, and one can just see the sexual frustration dripping off him. But Andy's inhibitions go so deep, that he's almost sad to watch: he clings to his childhood toys for safety and closes up with a tense angst at the slightest suggestion of sex.The romance comes alive every time Catherine Keener is on the screen. Keener has a big smile and a husky laugh, and she's such a warm charmer that it's impossible not to fall in love with her. The supporting players are spot-on and lend their own liveliness to the proceedings: both Elizabeth Banks and Leslie Mann shine as predatory women who terrify the hero, and Jane Lynch, as the tough boss at the electronics store who suddenly softens and takes a shine to Andy, is hysterical, especially when she breaks into a tender Guatemalan love song in an effort to seduce him.Yes, it's all pretty ridiculous, and some of the scenes verge on the offensive, but the characters are played with such understated charm and extremely quick wit, and there's real chemistry between all of them.The film has a raw, natural tone that infuses even the film's most outrageous sequences: there's the chest-waxing scene, which mixes authenticity with toilet humour, and the sex clinic workshop which touches on people's real insecurities, even as it maintains a wildly comical tone. Along the way the clever script genuinely taps into issues of masculine insecurities, male obsession, and even female attraction.Ultimately, The 40Year Old Virgin is the story of a rather lonely, insecure, and reserved man who becomes a better lover for having been abstinent. Yet throughout Andy's journey there are arguments to be had, temperamental adolescents to be contended with, and unavoidable truths that must be revealed.Along the way, The 40-Year-Old Virgin is mercilessly honest about all this, even as it is being ruthlessly funny. Perhaps then, the movie is ultimately an ode to the benefits of virginity, an irreverent and bawdy advertisement for the saying that ""only good can come to he who waits.""

"Hilarious, dirty, cute and Just Fun!","I was reluctant to go to this movie and especially to bring my nearly 15 year-old son. Not to worry, it is dirty, filthy and has terrible language, but that is the way it is in 2005. Most of all, this movie is funny, sad, cute, rude and just great! So many funny scenes I don't want to give it away, but you really start to care about the characters, even the ones who are less than nice.

"40 Year Old Virgin - Hilarious ""Romantic"" Comedy","40 Year Old Virgin is the funniest movie I have seen all year. Steve Carrell is not only a genius comedian but he is also a great actor, even in the more delicate scenes. But let's face it, anyone who goes to this movie is going for the comedy, and you'll get plenty of it. From the same director of Anchorman, and also many of the same actors, I personally find 40 Year Old Virgin to be much funnier. With less of the ""stupid humor"" and more of the random silly humor, 40 year Old Virgin makes it good to be crude, rude, and ridiculous. Not for the more conservative members of our society, this film is filled to the brim with cursing, drug content, and sexual innuendo. But, it also has the sweet innocence of its main character and the woman he falls in love with. A great date movie (for those that aren't timid), the 40 Year Old Virgin is a wonderfully hilarious romantic comedy, with all the laughs you could ask for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An intelligent sex comedy,"A writer for THE PITCH(an independent Kansas City publication) wrote that,in the hands of somebody else, the eponymous character of this movie would be some sort of ""plastic freak"" and would've been played for ridicule. Instead what we have here is a nice blending of ballsy sex comedy mixed with a genuine sweetness,an affinity for the title character whose struggles are as sympathetic as they are hilarious.Steve Carell,the co-writer as well as star of the show is Andy,a man who at forty seems okay with his life as a seemingly monastic bachelor,working at an electronics store. That all changes when his peers at work discover that their quiet but friendly coworker has never ""completed the deed"". When they decide to try and help him ""pop his cherry"",they only end up getting him frustrated(and themselves in trouble). That is,until Andy meets a single mother(Catherine Keener),with whom he strikes up a warm,mildly sexual relationship. Since she is somewhat reticent about jumping back into sexual relationships,this naturally creates more conflict.Great performances and a smart script(also co-written by first time-director Judd Apatow) make this film above average for the ""gettin' some"" themed movie. This film could've been so easily mucked-up by lesser talent. As is,this film has the somewhat rare ability to be crass,bawdy and yet gentle at the same time. A film worth seeing if you're tired of movies that act as if anybody who hasn't ""done it"" as being abnormal. Funny and insightful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A disgrace to cinema. Disastrously awful.,"This was an absolutely appalling film. It was neither funny nor interesting - it was one of the worst two hours i have ever spent in the cinema. Really NOT recommended to anyone who hasn't seen it - it was a low budget film with Z-list actors, a terrible screenplay and dire plot. The main character is dull, irritating and unabsorbing, and the supporting roles were as bad. Look at the title. Look at the cast. Look at the director - does it spell a good film... NO! This was certainly the least funny comedy I have ever seen and I would not even be paid to see it again. To see it is a waste of time and a waste of money and I really cannot see how anybody could find this film remotely entertaining.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Excellent, even for the non-virgins out there","The movie is awesome - funny and good-hearted at the same time. Fans of Undeclared and Freaks and Geeks will find lots of extra jokes as they watch. The movie dialogue is pretty true to form relative to the subject matter, at least as far as how my friends and I discussed those things. There are lots of somewhat unrelated funny bits that pop along during the story which draw the length out past the magic 90 minute mark. Personally, the movie was funny enough and paced well enough where I didn't mind. There are lots of laughs and comparatively sensitive moments between the more colorful bits to help keep the wives/girlfriends along for the ride. Totally recommended - and the DVD has lots of great extras.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Best Movie Ever,"40 Year Old Virgin is without the best movie I have ever seen. I have seen it four times so i could spoil it but you have to see it in order to understand the movie because I don't tell stories very badly. If you see it you will never forget it because he is very good at portraying a virgin who is 40 years old, how else would he have gotten the part, huh? It just so happens that this movie is #1 so everyone has seen it and if you don't then don't you think you'll be left out? Steve Carell is one of the funniest comedic actors and I have been watching him since he was on The Daily Show. He is very funny in this movie and I advise everyone reading this to go see the movie.

Bad bad movie,"This movie insults my intelligence. They could have made a better movie and left all the slap stick stuff out of it. If I had gone to see it in the theater I would have got up and left. I think a man had to have written the screen play because I can't imagine any woman writing such crap. If anyone thinks watching women fondling each others breast's, kissing each other and sucking alcohol from each others navel's, and fondling themselves is funny, then you've got a sick sense of humor. Some guy showing his buttocks on 50 TV screens in his place of work is not very realistic. Who does that?

I'm a virgin. I always have been.,"Compared to the fact that anybody who is still a virgin is often ostracized by non-virgins for not getting. YOu wonder if it's all worth it whether it be the wrong or right person. This movie will please a lot of religious conservatives who make the presumption that you are any less because you are still a virgin. This movie allows a great comedian like Steve Carrell to play the oldest virgin known to mankind because he is so good at acting in general. We grow to admire and like this character unlike his television show. The fact that he has to come forward and admit his virginity is kind of like coming out of the closet. I love Jane Lynch. She is such a great actress and comedienne and deserves to be recognized. She is wonderful in Christopher GUest films and I saw her last night on Charlie Sheen's show and as always, she is wonderful. This movie is good to show for its lightheartedness and its attempt to be different. It's successful at that. It shows virginity in a positive light rather than as a freak show. There a lot more virgins out there but I'm not one of them sadly. I grew up where getting rid of your virginity was a top priority and how sad is that to give it to somebody who never calls you back.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wonderful Comedy!,"I am so glad *something* came out of Hollywood that was actually worth my time and ticket price to go see. I haven't actually laughed out loud at a movie in a long time. The cast is perfect here. They play each role exactly as each should be, no one goes over the top and makes their role a caricature. Everything was believable which really makes the comedy work.One odd note from my own personal experience. Don't ask me why I remember this but I took Spanish in high school as so many of us did. We all probably remember that each new chapter in a Spanish textbook usually started with a dialog between two or more people in Spanish of course. For some reason all these years I remember one of those dialogs which translated ""When they clean my room I can't find anything"". Well, remember the part in the movie where Andy's manager started singing a supposed love song in Spanish? I caught the words and they weren't about love - it was the same dialog from my old Spanish textbook! Guess the scriptwriter and I took the same course!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A good movie, but not because of the stars","This is one of those movies where i found the main characters annoying... in my opinion the real stars are Seth Rogen (Cal), Romany Malco (Jay), Gerry Bednob (Mooj) and Paul Rudd (David). Their improvised scenes, both in the main movie, and in the DVD extras are hilarious. as far as the stars go, Steve Carrell is just annoying, I really feel he is overrated both as an actor and an improviser. Catherine Keener plays her character well, but she was given precious little to work with. The highlights of this movie for me were the argument between Mooj and Jay over a customer, and the performance of Aquarius during the closing credits. None of the characters is overly sympathetic, and the story is uninspired. But its all in the improv, hence the 9 rating.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This movie is hilarious.,"I liked this movie because I, Ted Danson, could relate directly to the theme of the movie. After working with Shelley Long in Cheers, and being shot down repeatedly, it was time to get in touch with my roots, and this movie allowed me to do that. For that, I thank Steve Carell for his fine acting job, and I would also like to thank his supporting cast. Steve, thanks buddy, you did me a solid on this one. I really enjoy movies, not only watching them, but acting in them, too. I wish I could do more movies instead of sitcoms like Becker and Curb Your Enthusiasm.

A beautiful foul-mouthed joy of a movie.,"I was trying to work out why this movie works so exceptionally well, and why I enjoyed it so much. It finally hit me: it is a genuinely adult comedy. Not a film that just uses crude language (in which yes, this movie abounds), toilet humour, and sex simply to appeal to the teenage market, but one with richly observed characters and genuine heart, dealing with the subject of sex in an adult way. I think the biggest surprise was that, contrary to what you would inevitably expect from the central plot premise, the film does not rely for its humour on the humiliation of its characters. That is an almost unheard of joy in a present day film like this. All I can say is, if you get to the point where Steve Carell starts singing ""When the moon..."" without a huge idiotic grin on your face, then you have my pity. :-)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Maybe it wouldn't rate an 8 in another year, but with movies the likes....","of Fantastic Four, Sky High, Brothers Grimm, this rates high. It's along the lines of wedding crashers. Crude sex humor interlaced with awkward physical comedy and somewhere a message ending. Something along the line of ""Don't give up on true love"" or something like that. Plot doesn't matter, character development doesn't matter, situations don't need to be either feasible no plausible. We merely accept them because the laughs are delivered. And let me be totally honest, if you like crude vulgar humor, the laughs are here. If comedies like Bad Santa, American Pie, Super Troopers, Used Cars and the like appeal to you, see this film. It's raunchy, foul mouthed, and filled with raucous ridiculous situations no sane person would willingly submit themselves to, but it's funny as hell. Steve Carell of the Office plays lonely Andy, the aforementioned 40-year-old virgin. He works at a generic Audio/Video store; and spends his free time collecting vintage action figures. He even has an obscure Million dollar man figure, not Steve Austin but Oscar! For some reason he's invited to a company poker game, where he accidentally lets it slip that he's a virgin. They take him under their wing, with the expectation that they will find a woman for him, and he will lose his virginity. Hi-jinks ensue. Truly. There's the drunk girl that throws up in his mouth, the hot bookstore clerk that gets lost in Andy's double talk (a buddy told him to answer every woman's question with a question, trust me it's funny) and the quirky grandma with an internet auction store that doesn't sell anything in the store.

You know how I know you're gay?¬ÖThe 40 Year Old Virgin,"I will preface this review by saying I have never been the biggest Steve Carell fan. I love his bit parts, but seeing him in a lead role after having a start on ""The Daily Show"" rubbed me the wrong way. Believing that I would hate his writing/lead role debut as much as I do Will Ferrell's multiple attempts, I shied away from checking the film out. Being that director Judd Apatow's sophomore film Knocked Up is hitting theatres this Friday, I decided to bite the bullet and finally see if the hype was true. All I can say is that this is the funniest movie I have seen since Hot Fuzz, and that says a lot since most American comedies of this ilk are fart jokes and horrible. The 40 Year Old Virgin is definitely the funniest film of 2005 and deserves all the praise it gets. Everything worked and I was laughing out loud throughout its entire duration, from the opening sequence of Carell trying to urinate to the ending song and dance routine of ""Age of Aquarius""¬óabsolutely priceless.As everyone who owned a TV two years ago knows, this film revolves around Carell's Andy and his revelation to coworkers that he is a virgin. The film soon progresses with their attempts to give him advice and his journey to get laid and find love in the process. Usually a premise as flimsy as this would not be able to sustain my interest for two hours, especially a comedy because it would be filled with filler gross-out moments that are so random you have to roll your eyes instead of laugh. The Forty Year Old Virgin never has a moment like this at all. Every gag or set piece is true to the story and nothing seems contrived for cheap laughs at the expense of the real story going on. Andy is a dork who has given up hope and decides to play video games and collect vintage toys rather than join the club scene. Although a dork, his coworkers soon find out that he is a funny guy with a lot to offer and they become close during the crusade. The underlying theme of love over sex and the power of friendship are there for sure, but the jokes are what make it all work. The touching moments are never sappy and when the sentimentality reaches the line of cheese, a one-liner or gag is thrown in to keep the pace fast and the story moving forward without pause.Sure the writing is top-notch. Carell and Apatow have woven together a wonderful tale here. The jokes are continuous and smart. There are bodily fluid moments, but the film doesn't rely solely on them. Really, though, it isn't always the script that succeeds, but the actors delivering the words. I can't think of a better foursome than Carell, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen. I have been a Rudd fan forever and he definitely lives up to the reputation; Malco, brilliant in ""Weeds,"" comes in and uses that role with a bit more everyman insecurity and hits it out of the park. As for Rogen, I haven't really seen him in anything. Supposedly he was in Donnie Darko, but don't ask me where. He really shines here and by this performance alone I have made my decision that Knocked Up is my movie choice this weekend and not something more serious and dramatic. Rogen is pitch-perfect in delivery and timing and his facial expressions and body language is fantastic. Mention should also be made for Catherine Keener, an actress whom I am also a big fan of. Her role needs to show her insecurity about dating a ""good guy"" when she has always gone in the opposite direction. There is the right amount of awkwardness between the two leads, but also a perfect dose of chemistry to make the relationship real.Every supporting role is great as well and there are too many to name. Let's just say that I couldn't believe how many bit-players were played by people I recognized from other TV shows and movies¬óCarell even gets his wife into the action. With the ensemble assembled and the writing as good as it is, I don't know why I waited two years to finally experience the phenomenon. Even the soundtrack was mindblowing. Using the songs that are, in the context here, is ingenious. The final song and dance moment had me on the verge of crying and will not be forgotten any time soon. Do yourself a favor and see this film if you have not already.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Overall didn't live up to hype.  Although Carell is pretty funny he's not funny enough to make up for the rest of the cast's lack of improv skills.,"The 40 Year Old Virgin was an OK movie it didn't live up to it's hype or advertising. I feel it's in the same Genre as Wedding Crashers but Wedding Crashers was much funnier due to Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson just being hilarious and their improv abilities. Which brings me to why 40 year old Virgin wasn't very good. You could tell there was a lot of improv and it wasn't very good. I know Judd Apatow is known for letting people improv but you have to have people who have the talent to do it because not just anyone can be funny and improv. The acting was really bad for the most part and when people are trying to improv and they don't know what to do they start swearing which is why I think this movie had so much swearing that wasn't needed at all. With the exception of Steve Carell the actors in this movie just weren't funny It was like they were all competing to be funnier than the other. It's kind of like the saying to many chefs spoil the soup I think that's what happened here. To effectively improv you need a few hilarious people who can improv and then the other actors just play off of those people staying within their abilities. Carell did have some hilarious parts and his comedic timing is pretty good. I also found for such a large budget movie the editing in this movie was horrible. For example when Carell is yelling at his co workers girlfriend telling him to check his ho and stuff all the sudden the camera switches to something else in the store and then the girlfriend has just disappeared it didn't flow right. Then there was a seen in the ebay store where the kid was trying to buy something and it was totally random unfunny and not needed, what were they thinking. Overall I'd give it like a c- letter grade it's a rent worthy movie but definitely not worth shelling out ten bucks at the theater.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Intelligent & Funny ! (5 stars),"I knew when I saw that Judd Apatow was the producer on this that it would rock. He's one of the guys behind ""Freaks & Geeks"" which was canceled after only 1 season.I loved this movie and didn't find it offensive at all (and I AM a female). It was really honest and, at times, hysterical, esp. the ""Know How I Know Your Gay"" scene which coulda been taken right outta ""Freaks & Geeks"" because they sound like two 13-yr-olds.I especially liked how at first his friends are scared and creeped out by him.

"Well, it's a start for Carell...","What can I say? This movie could have been better. I know a lot people will want to kick my butt for saying that. But it's the truth. Although Steve Carell is funny, this movie uses him wrong. It's a good starring vehicle for him, but the movie does not show his natural talent. If you want to see his comical genius in action, watch ""The Office."" That is freakin' hilarious.Overall, the movie was only okay. It is certainly no comic masterpiece. The comedy and the plot is overshadowed and muddled by the over-usage of profane language. There is an f-word in every other sentence, which ruins the comedy. The Indian guy is the most annoying character I have seen on screen since the annoying, squeaky black servant in ""Gone With the Wind."" He is so vulgar that he almost ruins the movie, not to mention almost made me turn off the movie during the first ten minutes.However, the movie is not all lost. Seth Rogen, Catherine Keener, and Paul Rudd save the movie. Rogen is hilarious, Keener is lovable, and Rudd had the funniest lines. The movie even has some funny moments, but it is certainly no ""Hot Fuzz."" (If you're reading this, go out and watch ""Hot Fuzz.""

"Not Generally My Kind of Movie, but It Works","I tend to be drawn to character and plot-driven dramas. The sophomoric sex humor movie doesn't generally appeal to me. My 16 year-old wanted to see this and I thought that there might me a laugh or two.There were many more laughs than that. I was laughing from the first scene to the goofy end. I haven't laughed that much since ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"".I can't really say there was a lot of depth to the characters, but they weren't superficial clich√©s, either. Each character contributed to the setup for the nearly continuous set of very funny lines. The writing is really exceptional. Of course, the jokes are essentially sex humor, but they are exceptionally and unexpectedly witty... and darn funny.There's not a lot of surprise in the plot, of course.

R-rated comedy keeps getting dirtier...and it works,"When this film first came out, I was in total shock that there could be a major film released called ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" It seemed so explicit--a film entirely centered around getting laid? Yes, America, we've come and gone this far, and you know what? It's entertaining, hysterical and even good-natured and sweet.Steve Carrell is the 40-year-old virgin, a tech merchandise salesman named Andy Stitzer whose only life concerns are his job and his action figure collection. He lives by himself, he rides a bike and yes, he's never had sex before. So when his tech store co-workers--who've been laid but still have plenty of other issues--find out, they try and set him up for success, offering him a myriad of advice, most of which is terrible. Andy is reluctant to try, but when he meats Trish (Catherine Keener), that starts to change.Carrell really gets you to laugh in this film, but mostly because you pity his sorry existence. The dynamic between him and his funnier co-stars really works well here. Cal (Seth Rogen) is a weird, overly blunt friend, Jay (Romany Malco) is the married one who's a player a heart and has some aggressive advice and David (Paul Rudd) is the sap who always talks about true love. The scenes of this film mostly result from the terrible advice these hilarious guys give him and often times the weird girls he picks up as a result. Because these guys have bad advice, the language in this film is graphic and some of the scenes are too. If you prefer to keep sex talk to the bedroom, this film will have you uncomfortable 75% of the time.This film is good because you feel bad while simultaneously laughing at Andy. Comedy and empathy are two good things for a protagonist to provide. His misadventures trying to get laid and working out a real relationship with Trish is just really well done by the film's creator, Judd Apatow. Keener is also a great choice for Trish. She brings the film down to earth much like Rachel McAdams does in ""Wedding Crashers."" She's a very believable single middle-aged mom. It's a wonder how this film can be so dirty while simultaneous meaningful and Keener's performance helps make that happen. This was the kind of film she needed for people to notice her talents and recognize her in other work.Though as much as I say this film is sweet, there is no question that this is a dirty comedy first and foremost with some stupid stuff in it no doubt.

Great Movie,One of my favorite comedies. So many jokes. Every time I watch it I laugh harder and harder,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Um... am I supposed to laugh here?,"Since I read Roger Ebert's review of this film, I had been looking forward to it with gusto. It seemed just the sort of humor I could kick back and enjoy without having to tax my brain that much. Finally, just yesterday, I managed to see it on DVD.Immediately, I could see that I had made a mistake. Throughout the film I found myself continuously glancing at my watch and the time on the DVD readout, wondering how long this movie could go on. I chuckled perhaps twice, but spent most of the time just going, ""Huh. Okay."" Despite what the critics and my friends had told me about the movie, I never really felt entertained. Eventually, I gave up and turned off the movie half-way through.This movie tries to be another ""American Pie"" by ratcheting up the immaturity and sex jokes to a new level. The result is just sort of a messy, one-joke car wreck of a film that demands its audience laugh at the cheesy quips thrown out every thirty seconds or so. Sure, there are a couple of funny moments scattered here and there, but otherwise it's just a broken record: ""Ha, that is funny. He's so awkward with women. Ha ha ha."" If you must find a immature movie to watch right now, go back to ""American Pie"".",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Catherine Keener Sparkles in Virgin!,"Catherine Keener really shines and lights up the screen in ""The 40-Year Old Virgin."" Her big smile dazzles and brings the movie to life. Keener plays outstanding roles in ""Death to Smoochy"" and ""Being John Malkovich,"" but really seems to have found her stride in Virgin. This movie starts to sparkle from her very first scene!This is the first movie I've seen Steve Carell in a lead role. In a comedy, timing is crucial and can be somewhat difficult for a newcomer, but Carell delivers. His task is made much easier by a very strong supporting cast.Catherine Keener is very sexy. It is hard to imagine that anyone could go out on twenty dates with her and still be a virgin. All you young (early twenties) Hollywood actresses eat your heart out!

One of the funniest movies I have ever seen.,"Going into this movie I thought it was going to be one that I would laugh at for its crudeness more so than just a true fun factor. But walking out of the theatre I realize that the show is a comedic hit and had me thinking that it might have just been the funniest movie I have have ever seen.Sure the subject material is not thought provoking, how could a 40 year old man looking to lose his virginity among the pressure of a bunch of work buddies be? But the laughter that came bubbling out of me was from good material and true funny moments rather than a bunch of fart jokes and bad sexist jokes.I would definitely recommend you go see this flick.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"This year's ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", only more vulgar","""Wedding Crashers"" was an okay movie. I never understood why it got such a high rating on IMDb. I liked it, but I saw nothing special about it. Nothing that elevated it from similar movies, such as ""Dodgeball"" or ""Starsky & Hutch"". Still, I understood why it had become such a tremendous hit. The leading roles were played by big stars, the pacing was fast and the jokes kept coming. Some worked, some didn't, but it was an entertaining way to spend 90 minutes with your brain turned off. ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" had no really big names in its cast, but was a tremendous hit anyway. I figured that this must have had something to do with a charming story and funny and original jokes. Reviewers (including Roger Ebert, who once again doesn't have the same opinion about a movie as me) were raving about how lovely this little flick was. And last but not least IMDb users gave this movie an amazing 7.7, a rating comedies rarely receive. Once again IMDb has misdirected me. ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" sucked big time!First off, let me make clear that there's nothing ""charming"" about this movie. The characters are as unrealistic as they are unlikeable. I really have nothing against rude jokes as long as they have a punchline or a point, but ""Virgin"" is full of vulgar talk that's just not funny and often at the expense of ethnical minorities in a primitive way. Within the first 15 minutes the movie gets boring as there is no real development in the story whatsoever. The dialog is predictable and extremely lame. The most painful thing, however, was that it didn't take much more than the mention of the word ""pussy"" or one character asking another to have sex with a goat, to make people in the cinema go wild. God, I hated it when the old couple living above Andy first commented on how Andy was going to get laid that night and then talked about how they were going to have sex themselves later on. Is it that easy to get the audience to laugh? Are people that stupid or am I missing something? Hell, I can even chuckle at the worst mindless sex-comedies √† la ""Van Wilder"" or ""TomCats"", but this movie just left me absolutely cold and caused no reaction other than extreme boredom. I hate it when immature comedies like this one pretend to be open minded whilst covering all stereotypes and dragging every little weakness of its characters through the dirt.I didn't think it was romantic, either, not for a second. The scene with Trish discovering Andy's porn was the worst. It was so implausible, it insulted my intelligence. As if all that wasn't enough, the director did an absolute horrible job. The movie looks like it had been made for T.V. without one creative shot in there.The cast wasn't half bad. Catherine Keener (who has gotten extremely old in just a few years it seems) does an okay job. Steve Carell acts as natural as he can under the circumstances and thankfully doesn't try to be a cardboard copy of Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller or Will Ferrell. I didn't like him too much in the American version of ""The Office"", but he convinced me here.Unfortunately, that isn't enough to save this horrible movie. Apparently I'm in the minority with my opinion, though. Like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" some years ago the success of this boring mess is a phenomenon, which is beyond me. If that's what people want to see these days, then people have become incredibly undemanding.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wonderfully funny surprise,"I won tickets to an advanced screening of The 40 Year-Old Virgin and couldn't have been more horrified when I was told the name of this movie. I recall trying to give my tickets away saying ""There is no way I'm seeing this movie!!' I'm so very glad I decided to go. I've not laughed this hard at a film in too long to remember. I loved the film so much I decided to see it again when it opened with a group of girlfriends. That's right - I'm one of the women who came to see this movie in droves. The film is raunchy and it makes no apologies for it - but it also is a very sweet film. I cared about these characters, which is not what I was expecting.If you are put off by large amounts of profanity and frank discussions of sex you may find yourself squirming in your seat. There were a few moments I found uncomfortable but given the movie's title what else could you expect? It is funny that the lead character seemed to echo some of my own thoughts when the raunch got to be a bit too much.I've heard some complaints about the movie's length. It is very near two hours and I did find myself checking my watch about 10 minutes before it was over. I can understand - it is the first starring role for Steve Carell, his first film to co-write along with first-time director Judd Apatow. They were just having too much fun to stop! I'm trying to think of any scene that could have been cut to make it just a bit shorter and the thing is I can't think of one. It all just works so well together.Initially I was a bit turned off by the ending. No spoilers, but it just seemed to veer off so wildly that it made no sense. Upon seeing it the second time I realized that it made no sense and yet it made perfect sense. How else could it end? Go see this film with an open mind and you will not be disappointed. In fact, you will want to see it again as soon as possible.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A Nutshell Review: 40 Year Old Virgin,"With a title like that, it takes little imagination to know that this film belongs to the sex comedy genre which has gained popularity ever since American Pie started it all from 1999.Virgin adopts a similar formula, even from the start, we are introduced to Andy (the Virgin) in his suburban home, and his stiff unused woody (Yes, it's that blatant. Expectations, remember?) Andy's the guy who somehow couldn't grow up, with his extremely cool collection of collectible toys and comic books, custom made video game chair and home decor adorned with pop culture posters. His predicament would probably be appreciated by many guys - with a life like that, interest from the opposite sex is hard to come by, and not to mention a disastrous experience which left him scarred.Andy works in an electronic store, which is the setting taking up almost half the entire film. Not that it's bad though, interesting hilarious stuff do happen. And it is his colleagues, upon learning his ""secret"", vow to make things happen and present to him various opportunities and tips. Even his female manager subtly propositions to him as a f-buddy, bringing on some laughs as she delivered it multiple times in a deadpan manner.So begins various set pieces like the first pick up in a bar with a drunken babe who drives him to her home, the speed dating segment where he meets a butch wanting to go straight, and another who had a wardrobe malfunction, the pain-inducing chest hair waxing session gone awry, and Beth, the demure bookstore chick, who's more than meets the eye. Eye candy galore though in these scenes, so all the hot blooded males out there wouldn't be complaining at all, akin to the strategy adopted by American Pie by featuring attractive actresses.It works on another level though. With his friends providing weird and sometimes crazy ideas and advice, we are presented the flipside of their own predicament, insecurity, and troubled relationships. This movie seemed to spread the message that sex isn't everything, and while journeying with Andy to his first lay, most can identify with many of the issues and relationship problems presented.And on that note, this film at some times feels like Will Smith's Hitch. Andy, while listening and accommodating his buddies' advice, instead goes against these well intentions to set his sights on Trish, a woman who works on the opposite side of the street, selling stuff on E-Bay. In this storyline however, it's the usual boy-meets-girl, fall in love, loses girl, gets her back clich√© formula. But it's the delivery of both leads Steve Carrell and Catherine Keener that keeps it from being boring.Despite casting relatively unknowns, just as American Pie did, the actors seem to have loads of fun despite the stereotypical roles. This film should gain recognition for Steve Carrell, just as Pie did for Jason Biggs, Some might have remembered Carrell as the funny newsachorman in Bruce Almighty, and I'll be awaiting in glee for him to star in one of my favourite TV series Get Smart, as Maxwell Smart (somewhat a dead ringer for the late Don Adams I tell ya).Surprisingly, you'll hardly feel it's a two hour long film. The pace is quite even, despite the meshing of 2 parallel plot lines following American Pie's and Hitch's. I dare say the Virgin does swallow the Pie, with a more mature and responsible feel to it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Worse film every,"My Wife and I went to see this film due to the funny trailers on TV and the supposedly high ratings everyone gave it, also on TV. Well I have never been this disgusted watching a film that uses such language (I have worked in factories for many years, so yes I have heard and used these types of words). After watching this film for an hour hoping it would get funny I realized that I was 54 years old and had less years in front of me than behind me and that I was wasting what time was left to me watching this stupid movie. At that point I asked my Wife if she minded if we left, trust me, she didn't mind. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very Impressed,"As big a fan as I am of Anchorman, this movie blew that one out of the water! Steve Carrell really proved himself as a lead comedy actor. In other movies, he was simply the scene stealer; in this one, he was the scene. I laughed so hard through the whole movie, I thought I was going to crap my pants. I went with my brother and fianc√©, and we did not stop laughing. I normally don't do this, but i even spoke to the screen a couple of times. (Of course, I was high, so I spoke up during the weed references!) Even though I was the stoned one, my brother laughed harder than anyone. I would go see it repeatedly if I had the time to do so. This movie also boasts an excellent cast of supporting actors, who took their turns to shine. I still can't get enough of Paul Rudd.

Funny!  Sweet.  GREAT.,"40-Year-Old Virgin is a nearly perfect date movie. It's funny and sweet (but not sickly sweet), with feel-good moments galore. Somehow it manages to be both wacky and yet completely believable. This is a movie that likes all its characters and treats them well, unlike some that use ridicule to generate humor. And for those who might want to debate this movie's ""moral message"" -- though I can't imagine why you'd want to -- it gets even that right, managing to have fun with sex without trivializing it.

Everybody likes Andy.,"After years of writing some of the funniest things on the Daily Show, Steve Carell takes to his own, this beast that he and director Judd Apatow penned together, The 40 Year Old Virgin.We've had a lot of gross-out humor movies come and go in the past few years that have had decent parts to them, but very few (Old School, Something about Mary) have ever been complete films. So many just dig directly for the jugular and try to just make you completely forget about an actual storyline that people can look at and identify with, in the least. But Virgin achieves this. It's character development in Andy, the main character is good, along with all secondary characters trying to help this guy get out and let it all hang out, to find that one who's going to get the years of frustration out of him.Catherine Keener is a steady love interest in this movie, too. Whenever it seems to slow down or the movie comes to a point of eye rolling, the chemistry between Keener and Carell save it, and bring you back around again for another round (of well placed) silly jokes, including that scene that everyone's seen on the commercial, the done-in-one take chest waxing. Why would Carell do that? Because, he wants Andy to be real, he wants the audience to cheer on his dorky forty year old through all of his action figure collecting quirkiness, and by the film's conclusion, there isn't a person in the house who doesn't like him.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

But definitely go see it. It's an eye opener. :-)P.S.

40-Year Old Virgin,"Steve Carrell is becoming a big thing in Hollywood ,after his ingenious performance in Anchorman, and it's easy to see why in this film about one man who has never had intercourse in the whole 40 years of his life.

Extremely humorous and full of heart,"Directed by Judd Apatow and co-written with the movie's leading man Steve Carell, the 40-Year Old Virgin is extremely humorous and full of heart.Andy Stitzer (Carell) has never done the deed and it becomes known to three co-workers, who make it their duty to correct this anomaly. Andy prefers to compensate by creating seemingly healthy obsessions such as collecting action figures (including the Six Million Dollar Man's boss), gaming and the like. Just in case you forgot, he is 40-years old. As we come to learn through flashbacks, he really has tried, but just has not been ""successful"".Until now Carell's possible career highlights have been as a ""Daily Show"" correspondent and the lead on one of the most under-looked and great groan-inducing comedies, ""The Office"" (American version). He has also stole scenes in ""Anchorman"" and ""Bruce Almighty"". This role showcases his expert timing, charisma, knowledge of constructing a joke and romantic/dramatic reach.Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco are cast as the co-workers and eventual buddies who insist on passing on their collective wisdom, baggage and mistakes. Each character is perfectly honed, project great matter of fact sensibility and hilarious in every scheming scene/disaster. The stage is then set for two crazy encounters, which continue to reinforce his decision to remain a virgin for all eternity. I must mention Leslie Mann (the drunk), Elizabeth Banks (the sex freak), Jane Lynch (the boss) and the elder Indian co-worker, each of whom generates great laughs and support in their roles.Andy insists that he will do this the right way, which at once is ambitious...finding a perfect woman, building a relationship and making it work (I should take some notes). His buddies come to realize that there is a degree of merit to the approach, which they have come to have forgotten through their encounters over the years. He believes he has found this in Trish, played by the always stellar and exuberant Catherine Keener. Do you want to know why this woman is a star in my eyes? Witness their first encounter...she is effortlessly vulnerable, insecure and sexy. Their chemistry is wonderfully playful, sincere and believable given both their characters' background.Whilst in one case the film resorts to a low-brow gross out gag, it doesn't allow the crude and now clich√©d driven Farrelly-brothers set-ups to ensue and overtake its huge heart. The movie is also insightful as can be seen in the expertly written send-up anti-gay-bashing scene "" I know you're gay because...""Ultimately, the movie is a brilliant piece of comedic work and is set to a great accompanying soundtrack, which itself strikes a euphoric chord. However its true worth can be seen in the way it is elevated by the writers' projecting our own bouts of sexual anxiety, their ability to construct jokes beyond a level of crass running gags and the credibility of every single cast member's performance, especially the genius Steve Carell.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Next Woody Allen?,"Steve Carell, Emmy nominee for THE OFFICE and the only actor who came close to stealing ANCHORMAN from Will Ferrell, lights up the screen in THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN, a completely winning and original comedy, co-written by Carell and Judd Apatow, that turned out to be one of the most refreshing and drop dead funny surprises of 2005. Carell and co-writer and director Apatow, have managed to create a comedy that is not only hysterically funny, but undeniably warm and charming. Carell plays Andy, an anal-attentive electronics store salesman who cooks gourmet breakfasts and has an expensive collection of action figures (when you remove them from their original packaging, it decreases their value)who agrees one night to an evening of poker with three of his co-workers (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogan), who manipulate Andy into admitting that he has never had sex with a woman. We then spend the rest of the film watching poor Andy getting really terrible advice from his well-intentioned buddies about the best possible method of ""deflowerization."" Such a premise would expectedly lead to a smarmy sex comedy, but that's not what we get at all here. Carell and Apatow's razor-sharp screenplay is smart and almost always takes the high road, in the best tradition of the Woodmeister, and every time you think you know where it's going, the story takes a complete U-turn. Catherine Keener, one of Hollywood's sexiest and most intelligent screen presences these days, is sparkling and vivacious, as Trish, the businesswoman and single mom Andy falls for. Rudd has some very funny moments as Andy's buddy who is still obsessing over an ex and Jane Lynch is also amusing as Andy's self-absorbed boss. As I watched this practically perfect screen comedy, which works from start to finish, and remembered that Carell co-wrote it as well as starred, I couldn't help but wonder if Carell is going to be the next Woody Allen. If this winner is any indication of where he is headed as a writer and performer, he is well on his way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The plot was good and flowed smoothly. The dialog, although crude at times, is an accurate portrayal of how guys talk to each other about women. You can't help but root for Andy (Steve Carrell's character).

What passes for a thoughtful comedy these days.,"A lot of reviewers seem to think that this is a thoughtful movie, a film that really captures some elusive truth about - I dunno - male/female relationships, or our society's attitudes towards sex, or whatever.But in reality, this is pretty much your average sophomoric comedy, with perhaps a tiny bit more insight than you'd expect. The title character is presented in a somewhat sympathetic fashion (I guess), and I suppose that's surprising in a good way. However, this movie only appears sensitive and smart when viewed alongside, say, South Park; it's hardly a great character study like The Odd Couple, or a really novel and intelligent comedy like Groundhog Day.The problem is that everybody in this movie is grotesque. Carell's character is an endearing dweeb, somewhat reminiscent of real dweebs, but in the end I found him too weedy and bizarre to be genuinely likable. His oversexed friends, meanwhile, are all pathetic jerks themselves, and the various chicks who show up during the film are usually trashy and scary. I suppose the only character who's really supposed to be nice is Carell's main love interest, Trish, but she comes across as bland compared to all the lunatics on display.But maybe the real problem I had with the movie is that it's not actually laugh-out-loud funny. I thought they really tortured the scene when Carell's chest hair gets ripped off, for instance; it would've been boring enough at half the length. And some of the ""famous"" lines - ""they felt just like bags of sand!"" - really ain't as hilarious as all that.Yeah, I think this movie ultimately doesn't know what it wants to be - insightful social commentary, or dumb frat-guy comedy. It settles for a middle ground, so it gets a middling rating from me. Just don't be fooled by glowing Ebert reviews or anything like that.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Sweetness Rules,"Disappointed by ""Wedding Crashers"" lack of true comedy and lame attempt at a love story, I awaited ""40 Year Old Virgin"" with the same hopeful anxiety I attach to the Chicago Cubs, hoping for greatness but anticipating tragic levels of failure. I am pleased to report that this film is more like the Boston Red Sox, every time you think you've seen it all, it's finished, there's no hope left for sex-comedies, it will forever be an endless parade of fart jokes and catchphrases, out pops this gem. Don't get me wrong, this movie is crass, it is rude, it assails your sensibilities and outrages uptight Christians. But it bears a closer resemblance to ""There's Something About Mary"" and not as much to ""American Pie"", it's teenage counterpart. See, this film is produced, written, directed and acted by genuinely funny and intelligent people, and what results is a genuinely funny and intelligent film. It's imperfect, sure, but it aspires to achieve that which it achieves, and that's a lot.I can't think of a film that makes the non-virgins look sort of uncool too, unlike the equally virginity obsessed ""American Pie"". But this film is a film about four men growing to true sexual and emotional maturity, albeit through some particularly hilarious means. Steve Carell plays the affable Andy, a closet virgin who has tried over the years but just ended up blowing it (pardon the pun). He works at a low-wage electronics store job and is surrounded by other stunted youths. Their obsession with sex is his obsession with action figures; it's pleasurable and it's fun, but they don't realize that they don't get it.One of Andy's coworkers is a pensive dude who at first seems like the sanest one but soon comes off as the most confused. Then you have his black friend who is convinced he has to be a playa to not be a playa hater.And Paul Rudd portrays a sympathetic loner who obsesses over a girl he never earned and wishes he was still dating. Compared to these three, who gode Andy into sexual maturity, Andy seems relatively stable. But it takes some real shaking up for the four friends to realize that real sexuality is about more than ""getting lucky"" with hot chicks. And then there's all those parts that are just hilarious. And that's the thing about this movie, it makes its point without sounding like a Republican senator or Pat Robertson. It's a bunch of hip dudes realizing that sexsexsexsexsex isn't all it's cracked up to be, and maybe we should all slow down and wait it out, be careful, see what happens. Andy learns the value of relationships and then is free to explore sex with a clean conscience, something we all would love no doubt, in hindsight after all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Don't wait til it comes out on DVD - go see this now!!,"V V funny - steve carrell is an absolute genius physical comedian. the supporting cast had plenty of one liners but the majority of it was to set up steve. there were plenty of gross out comments and scenes and overall it was consistently funny from start to finish. the way the character ""andy"" was came across as touching and engaging and his romance was believable - christine keener seemed an unusual and non mainstream choice for this role but she was a perfect foil for andy. paul rudd was exceptional too - loved the drunk videotape antics in the store. and the ending - weird to say the least! thoroughly recommend this - way above average quality comedy. watch it at the cinema - don't wait to see it on DVD!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The reviews have misrepresented this movie a bit,"It does not simply have ""some"" crude humor, most of the movie is gross and tasteless. It's only saving grace was Steve Carell himself, and Kathrine Keener, both of whom managed to maintain their dignity (more or less) in an otherwise juvenile movie seemingly targeted at 13-year-old boys. (Well, I'll modify that somewhat -- Kat Dennings turned in an honest and touching performance as Keener's daughter, without appealing to any of the usual stereotypes of teenage girls.)It's sad in a way. While it's understandable that a movie with this theme would include some crudity, it's obvious that far too much is simply gratuitous. From the good parts it's clear that writer/director Judd Apatow could have constructed a better movie -- he just chose not to.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"a great, fun and entertaining movie!","I remember when the movie came out. I wasn't much into it thinking that its just another comedy about sex and all that stuff thats just spouse to bring young sex-minded teens into the cinemas. So i avoided it and years later i ended up with the DVD. I sat down thinking the same but i was open for any surprises and yes- i was surprised. The movie is great! Starting from the cast, the movie isn't blinded by big names or by new names... its all in the middle with actors you might have seen before, or not. As far as the acting goes, its great and the cast fits perfectly with the variety of characters and that variety just adds to the freshness of the movie. The story- as shallow as it seems its well told with a lot of feelings and simple but still funny dialogs and situations. Its a great movie that I've seen many times since i first have and I'm gonna see it again- right now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
What can I say I cried,"We went because we really could find nothing else, after persuading the husband the reviews were fair we were still unprepared.What can I say its starts a little to much the crudeness of ""something about Mary"", but it left it far behind with real adult comedy. There are far too many scenes that left us both crying with laughter, in fact the end scene and titles left the muscles in the back of my head hurting.It was slap stick with just the right balance, mixed with content that does really have integrity and romance.All I must say is see it then tell all you friends to go, it was a surprise a joy and if nothing else a real good laugh!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Terrific, Brilliantly Acted","I recently caught the eye to see this film in theaters, and when I walked out of it, I had all to say about it.Before I get into my schpiel on how terrific this movie was, I'd like to say that we will never see a movie that funny, and yet so original ever again, like the greats always say, with great risk comes great reward.OK, so here it goes. The story begins with a nerdy salesman Andy (Steve Carrell). Andy collects almost every action figure and video game possible and he works at an electronics store with several other execs who are much ""cooler"" and ""in"" than Andy is. One night, Andy is invited to a Poker game with these guys, and when the topic of sex is being discussed, its Andy's turn to reveal his dirty secret. And, so the secret is revealed, the guy hasn't gotten much (I apologize, NONE)time in the sack with a woman, other than the other times that he's tried and failed.Immediately, the group tries to get him laid by doing all means necessary. They start with the basics, using pick up lines, forms of masturbation (forcing him to watch a box load of porn), and taking him to bars with brilliantly pretty woman to waxing his chest and actually talking ""suave"". Eventually, it all cans out when he meets an EBay Marketer (Catherine Keener), who, after a series of dates with him, is dying to give him the time. Problem is, she's unaware of his issue. Will the issue effect the relationship? There are absolutely some good laughs in this one. As always, the funny Steve Carrell puts on a nice show as the scared, boyish Andy. He foils out Andy Stitzer, and shows why he is the way that he is. A man afraid of change, stuck inside his own little world, and afraid to crawl out of it and explore the meanings of adult sexuality, something he has never experienced.As for the lovely Catherine Keener, she plays the pretty Trish exceptionally well, as the innocent, yet pushy single mother. As for the rest of Carrell's supporters (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen), they are terrific as the bozo's that they are, and make the movie even more funnier to support the already chuckle burner in Steve Carrell.Don't keep this issue a secret. I certainly won't if you don't.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Weak,"I really don't see why this got such a high rating. To me it was very average, and nearly bored me to death. There was not a single actually funny moment in this 2+ hours drag, just some slight chuckles here and there. Perhaps the movies of recent have gone so bad that people don't recognize what's actually good anymore.This film doesn't know if it wants to be a gross slapstick movie or a romantic comedy. Sadly it fails at both. Actually from the other reviews, i expected this to be a comedy with really gross humor, but there were none of that, just utter boredom. And this was the unrated version. Just one mildly sick joke involving a woman and a horse. The language used a lot of the F word, which is just a sad attempt to make it look 'funny' or gross.Only thing good was the ending, which had this pretty humorous dancing sequence. So to put it short, don't waste your time with this. Watch Airplane or some other actually funny comedy instead.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
What a movie!  Don't let the raunchy-ness scare you...it's actually OK!,"This movie was funny, Funny, FUNNY, F-U-N-N-Y!. In a world where sex is king (and queen) this movie breaks down all the barriers and gets real where sometimes we all are just barely holding our own! The motif could not have been better and the characters accurately scripted. I'm a pretty conservative guy and normally, this movie is shunned by my piers and avoided as crap but I must say that the topic was compelling and I related to the obvious pain of being so human in a world where one can be judged way too easy. I took the viewing risk and I'm glad I did. The language was straight from the street alright and the culture clashes were accurate (well... maybe a little exaggerated) and the weirdos were REALLY WEIRD. But, what a blast! Too bad most of my friends will never see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funniest movie to come along in a very long time,"First of all I went into this movie hearing all of the comparisons between this movie and Wedding Crashers. The ""general consensus"" was that The 40 Year-Old Virgin was far funnier than Wedding Crashers and let me start off by saying that this movie blows away Wedding Crashers and quite frankly a list of other comedy movies I have seen recently. In my opinion, this film may be one of the best comedies ever created.The opening scene of The 40 Year-Old Virgin is one that had the whole theater cracking up. This trend of uncontrollable laughter continued throughout the entire movie and there was rarely a period of time without an explosion of laughter in the theater.I feel that Steve Carell was perfectly cast for the lead and I can't really think of another actor who could have pulled it off. In addition, the supporting roles played by Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen really brought the movie together and provided plenty of laughs.The 40 Year-Old Virgin is no doubt a laugh-out-loud movie that may give you the urge to see it again right after you leave the theater the first time. Although this film may seem to be directed at a younger crowd I was very surprised to see a good amount of older people in the theater, and they were nearly falling out of their seats like everybody else in the theater. I recommend this movie to nearly anyone who enjoys a good comedy and isn't afraid of explicit sexual themes. Two very big thumbs up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Overrated,"I saw this on 8/20, and I must say I was disappointed. I saw a lot of hype about it from critics of all people, saying it was right up there with ""Wedding Crashers"" for comedy. My wife and I enjoyed ""Crashers,"" so, despite pore-hype and review misgivings, I figured it would be worth it to hear her laugh that hard again.Well, I didn't hear her laugh very much. I had a couple of chuckles, but let me assure you this is nowhere near the level of ""Wedding Crashers'"" relatively low bar.It did have its moments, but it seemed to be ""let's cuss a whole lot; that's always funny.""

"Well worth the price of admission, good information for women of all ages.","Being a person who rarely sees movies in the theater much less opening weekend, I made an exception after seeing the trailer.

For my 17 year old daughter, it proved to be an excellent lesson in how many different types of men think and judge all the many types of women. I would pay to see it again in the theater, I may even buy the DVD as opposed to renting. Tons of fun, loads of laughs - the must-see comedy of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Will Ferrell should be worried,"This movie is awesome and I laughed out loud through much of it. The best thing about it is how it took its subject matter mostly seriously. This movie very easily could have come off as stupid and corny but what we get is a story that's moving and characters that we like. The supporting cast, in particular, is fantastic. I hope that future comedies take a cue or two from this movie.I've been a fan of Steve Carell for quite some time now because of the Daily Show. This is a guy that knows how to be funny but not in a cheap way. I'm glad he now has had his first moment to shine in Hollywood. Will Ferrell should be worried that the bell is tolling on him. Despite being Hollywood's Goto Comedy Man the last few years, he is way over-rated and this movie proves it.Go see this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Raunchy with a sweet after taste,"I have seen this movie twice and I must say it was well worth the money. This is raunchy enough for the men with a sweet under tone for the women. It makes you laugh in all the right parts and the cast could not have been more well assembled. Steve Carell has most definitely made it as a Hollywood star. This movie made me laugh from beginning to end. A warning: this movie is not for those who are uncomfortable with the topic of sex or who are extremely religious. The dialogue is graphic but realistic. Every conversation that took place between ""andy"" and his friends reminded of every conversation I have ever listened to coming from my guy friends. As for the sweet undertone it is there. Catherine Keener was absolutely magnificent and true gem on the screen. She was believable in every way and I am proud to say that she attended both my old elementary and high school. The cast was incredible and the direction of the movie was fantastic. There's only one thing left to say and that is Mr. Steve Carell you have arrived!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
It was worth the wait...,"You can't walk down the street without seeing something that uses sex as advertising. Clothing, entertainment, and everything under the sun uses some form of sex to sell an product. For men it is hard not to notice and start thinking about it. But some guys live they're lives with not a care in the world. That's where Andy Stitzer comes in...In The 40 Year Old Virgin, Steve Carell play Andy, your average nice guy living alone with his action figures, comic books, video games, and his bicycle. He works at a local electronics store where his co-workers are primarily guys. When the guys invite him out for a game of poker, he is all in sort of speak. As the game goes on the topic of sex is brought up. With all this talk about sex and erotic adventures, Andy is a little uncomfortable trying to mask his secret. But eventually the beans are spilled...Andy is a virgin.So what's the big fuss over not having sex? It wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't surrounded by David, Jay, and Cal (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen) who are undeniably infatuated with making Andy into a man. They give him all sorts of helpful ideas like hitting on drunk girls, talking dirty, and getting a full body wax. Andy tries to do what they tell them, but his past sexual encounters have kinda left a scar that isn't easy to heal. His desire has burnt out in a way. He just needs a spark in the form of maybe Trish (Katherine Keener), a woman who runs her own store where she sells stuff on eBay for people. With Andy's situation brightening and his co-worker's love life dwindling the movie really kicks off.Judd Apatow has written some funny material like Heavyweights and the TV series Freaks and Geeks. But nothing compares to this one. Carell is perfect as the humble yet ready for anything Andy. His side slitting humor is fantastic. Rudd does a great job as a man recovering from a hard breakup...two and half years ago. Malco and Rogen both give their take on women and either way it's hilarious. These four men are without a doubt one of the funniest ensembles put together. They rag on each other and push everyone around, but it's just what guys do. Everyone has met at least one of these characters before at work, school, or just noticed one.The 40 Year Old Virgin will have you rolling in the isles and wiping tears of joy from your face within the first two minutes. This laugh out loud comedy is a little too old for young teens so the R rating is necessary. This one perfect for those who like Old School, Wedding Crashers, and all of those recent off the wall comedies. So go out and enjoy this movie. Andy might have waiting 40 years to 'get it on' but you shouldn't wait to see this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
How much would you pay to swim in 900 people's vomit?,"My friends wanted to see this; I thought it might be cute. Unfortunately, it was far from cute, and nowhere near enjoyable. It wasn't crude humor, not even risqu√©, just ultra gross. Within 3 minutes of the intro, I was highly disappointed. Within 15 minutes I was retching and wanted a refund. It was beyond filthy, it was rancid. I walked out of the theater, and I never do that. It really was heinous. Utterly abominable. Absolutely disgusting; nasty; heinously offensive to all decency; gross!If you like to watch losers make sentences and entire conversations out of nothing except the F word and gutter synonyms for genitals and sex, then you might like this show.

Funny and unexpectedly sweet,"I think what I had to love about this movie is that, when we went to see it, it was because we have a very close friend that this movie could have easily been written about. We snickered as we bought tickets expecting to find ourselves saying, ""It's ...!. We didn't. While parts of this movie most definitely captured our friend, it also captured ourselves. I think parts of it will capture everyone. While the title of the movie suggests that it's going to be about deflowering a 40 year old virgin, it makes us question our own insecurities about sex and love (mostly love) and there are some really, really sweet scenes. Andy's friends from SmartTech are more experienced sexually, but none really have a clue as to how to have a relationship with a woman. They mean well - they want Andy to experience this part of his life he's been avoiding until age 40, but as his teachers they do some hysterical things to (for?) him that keep you laughing.

Funniest Movie Ever!!!,"The plot: a nerdy misfortunate 40 year old who has not yet blossomed into a man and his jock friends goading him into getting into bed with a girl. And I voted 10 out of 10 on this? Yes, and would go so far as to say this film is a new classic in the comedy aisle of your local video store. Because as much as this film lacks propriety and sophistication, it offers the viewer clever situational comedy, brilliant writing (Carell and Apatow are a pair of geniuses!), and excellent acting to keep you in stitches from the time Andy wakes up to the ""cherry on the sundae-perfect"" ending.

If you are looking for a light-hearted comedy, this is it. My make-up was all gone, because I was crying so much from the laughter. The humor is subtle and for mature audiences.

Austin Movie Show review,"The first time we see Steve Carell (who plays ""Andy,"" the 40-year-old virgin with a vast collection of action figures) on camera, he's waking up with morning wood. Yes, it's vulgar at times (like the story about the lady having sex with the horse in Tijuana), but it's highly intelligent and perceptive vulgarity. When his co-workers learn about his virginity (the dead give-away was when he compares women's breast to ""bags of sand""), they make it their mission to get him laid, and the joke never gets old! Andy's masturbation scene is priceless. He lights candles, gets into silk pajamas, and plays Lionel Ritchie's classic, ""Hello."" But the reason I truly love this film is because it really is a beautiful love story about a guy who had lost all hope at ever finding love, but then finally meets his soul mate. It's not a movie about loosing one's virginity ¬ñ it's a story about falling in love for the first time¬Ö even if it takes 40 years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Pathetic,"Dreadful 'sex' comedy that only the most repressed among us could find shocking. It's like being stuck on a bus with a bunch of fourteen year-olds. The plot makes no sense (they come after hours to play cards at the Best Buy-like electronics store where they work? And there are no security guards?) and the tone is set right at the top by a simple-minded sight-gag having to do with a morning erection. This is followed by Steve Carrel having trouble peeing, which is an OK idea till one remembers that you can't pee with an erection. That's the reason we have them in the morning. And so on. I only lasted about 20 minutes before the witlessness got too much for me. To judge from this, Steve Carrel doesn't have a funny bone in his body.Compare this amateurish bilge with a real sex comedy like The Closet and you'll see what's missing.

Carell and Apatow do justice to the human race.,"Thank god for Steve Carell and Judd Apatow who single (or would that be double) -handedly have saved American Comedy, a dying breed, I know. The 40 Year Old Virgin is the fun, raunchy, and downright heartwarming tale that Wedding Crashers tried, and mostly failed, to be. Steve and the entire supporting cast including the gorgeous Catherine Keener play the movie straight, and the laughs are never forced or farcical. I'm going to go ahead and disagree with other comments that claim the movie's long running time works against it, by saying that it's refreshing to see a movie that isn't always rushing to the next gag, but hitting its marks like a professional. Me and mine haven't laughed so much at a comedy in years, and we're fairly certain that if you don't find this funny and claim to be a fan of movies, you either need to lighten up or get laid. Funniest movie of the year is a given, but it may just be one of the funniest in the last ten years. A real charmer that both guys and gals will enjoy equally.

The view according to www.georgevader.co.uk,"Steve Carell (Anchorman, The US Office) stars as Andy Sitzer who's work mates discover one evening is a virgin, a 40 year old virgin.To Andy this has never been a big deal but to his colleagues it is and they are determined that he should 'score'.Now this could have turned into a Road Trip/American Pie style 'sex comedy' but instead is quite a thoughtful and charming comedy.This is mostly due to Carell who really is the nice guy, and throughout the movie, yes, you hope he gets his 'oats', but above all, you hope he finds the partner and love he deserves.The only slight down part to the movie was the length. I thought Hitch and The Wedding Crashers were fine comedies but suffered from a drawn out final third, this film suffers the same problem with it's running time of well over two hours.Never the less it is still a very funny and charming movie and is highly recommended .",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
its a good Steve Carell movie!!! worth my bucks!,"I was at the Gateway Mall around 2pm this afternoon. It's been a month or so since I last watched Bewitched, which on my opinion is dragging, trying to be hilarious and disappointing.Now, I was long been preparing again to watch a movie. Honestly I can buy a pirated version of it but I decided to try the ambiance of the cinema. I became fond of Steve Carell when I've seen Bruce Almighty. I first heard of the movie ""The 40 year old Virgin"" while watching ET, The Insider and the E!. I was so curious that I really wanna watched it by the time it hit Manila Theatres.My choices: Corpse Bride (This should be next!), Deuce Bigalow (I think I should watch on DVDS instead), and others were serious that I didn't mind what's on the now showing listsOK, so I watch the ""The Forty Year Old Virgin"". I was surprised to see more people (mostly college students) on a Monday afternoon watching it. I cannot believe myself that I could burst into laughter on its beginning and I actually didn't feel bored watching it and I was really laughing till the end of the movie. It's been a long time since I last laughed on a movie from start to end. Steve Carell was great portraying an innocent man though he got 2 kids and I might believe he lost his virginity during college because of its plot. You know in order to act innocent is when you know the rules of sex. He must have done research on this things. It was a funny movie and it's worth my 120 bucks. Though I only recommend it to the open-minded people who just wants a good funny movie. conservative people will consider this so awful because of the sexual content of the movie. and it is also R13 here in Manila. By the time this movie hit the shelves, I gonna buy a DVD of this because i loved it.Also, Steve Carell is losing some hair and he might have used a wig on this film to make him look younger.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
the feel-good movie of the year,"As much as you might, don't think that this movie is a raunchy sex comedy with borderline porn material in it, because it's not. What you'll get when you watch this is a clever, smart, and hilarious romantic comedy that anyone can enjoy. My 58 year old stepdad and 51 year old mother loved it. I (17) loved it. My older sister (23) loved it. All my friends loved it, too.The film stars Golden Globe Winner Steve Carell in a breakout role as Andy Stitzer, your every day nice guy who is 40 and has yet to consummate in a relationship. He reveals it sort of accidentally while playing poker with a few co-workers. Soon, Jay, Cal (Seth Rogen), and David (Paul Rudd) will attempt to get Andy laid, hooking trying to hook him up with a crazy drunk girl (Leslie Mann) and a sexy bookstore employee (Elizabeth Banks). But all this doesn't matter to Andy, for he has found a woman that he's infatuated with: entrepreneur Trish (2006 Oscar Nominee Catherine Keener), a gorgeous single GRANDmother who's business will amuse us. Andy and Trish eventually begin to date, and we see how their relationship is affected by Andy's big secret and his desire to not tell her.The supporting cast is off the wall hilarious, especially Seth Rogen. This is also a breakout film for him, and he'll be remembered for a while as 'that big, funny guy from The 40 Year Old Virgin'. Of course, the film's success rides on Carell's shoulders, and he is just awesome. He makes Andy such a likable character, and throws in the occasional joke. Most of the humor comes from the supporting cast. Even Catherine Keener has some really funny lines, like when Andy calls her, but doesn't tell her it's him, and she thinks he's a telemarketer. That quick little exchange is really funny. Also a nice surprise is Jane Lynch as Andy's boss, who offers to be a special friend with Andy.What makes this film so warm-hearted is it's light humor, yet raunchy and hilarious moments. They are all gelled together so well, and it makes the film great. The only downside to the film is that it is far too long for a comedy. The unrated version (which, had it been in theaters, it would have easily been rated NC-17) is even longer, almost 2 hrs. and 20 mins. It is because of this that the movie does drag a bit, but Carell manages to keep it interesting the whole way. The ending is excellent as well. The 40 Year Old Virgin is a comedy cult classic, with stupid, smart, and raunchy humor wrapped around the core that is a great romantic comedy. It's a film you'll watch again and again, just as I have.8/10 --spy",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Penis Jokes Don't Make a Funny Movie,"Despite the fact I went to a free, advanced showing, I feel I deserve a refund! From the opening scene where Andy wakes up with a fierce morning erection to the constant barrage of penis, ejaculation, and ""bitches"" jokes, I quickly realized the IQ level requirement for this movie was lower than I had expected.Although, the underlying issues (dead-end jobs, male bonding over misogyny, and sexual differences within relationships) are powerful and poignant in our post-industrial society (thanks to Tomas), the director could have chosen a better canvas on which to deliver his message. Instead of focusing on how many one-liners ending with 'penis' can be crammed into the span of about 2 hours, Apatow should have ordered his writers to create characters and situations that didn't make me want to vomit.Movies don't have to be artsy or uber-intelligent to be successful in the theater; movies DO have to have some semblance of a plot not based on dirty jokes found at a frat party. I love a penis joke every once and awhile, but when it becomes the movie's foundation, rather than secondary to character development, I have to draw the line.Don't bother with this film...save your $6.50!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Another crude and funny sex-crazed comedy,"Just like ""Wedding Crashers"", ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is an R-rated romantic comedy that was released in 2005 and turned out to be a box office success. I wasn't too interested in either of them during their theatrical run, but I stated in my review of WC that it was highly recommended to me in early 2006. At the same time, I was told this film, starring Steve Carell, was also a must-see. So, I watched this for the first time shortly after my first viewing of the other crude 2005 comedy, and I think I found it to be the superior of the two, though neither of them was bad. Giving both films a second viewing over three years later, they both improved, as films sometimes do with more than one viewing, and now I can say more confidently that both are funny, especially this one.Andy Stitzer is forty years old and single, living alone with a collection of toy action figures and comic books. He doesn't own a car and rides his bike instead. He works at an electronics store called Smart Tech. One day, several of his co-workers invite him to a game of poker, since they have nobody else to invite. During the game, they figure out that Andy has never had sex, as much as he tries not to let them know, and Cal, Jay, and David soon begin to help him try and lose his virginity. However, despite their efforts, they can't seem to succeed in helping their co-worker. The nerdy electronics store employee finally falls in love when a woman around his age named Trish comes into Smart Tech as a customer and talks to him. Across the street from the electronics store, she runs a business where sells people's unwanted stuff on eBay. Unfortunately, Andy's troubles aren't over yet, as Trish also has secrets.I couldn't remember all of this film from the first viewing, and that includes the part around the beginning with Cal talking to Andy about a woman ""f&%*in' a horse."" I'm sure a visual presentation of that would have been revolting, but the character just talking about it made me laugh. Mooj and Haziz, two argumentative Indian employees of Smart Tech, have some really funny lines, though just about everyone in the movie does. There are so many memorably funny parts, such as David complaining to the boss, Paula, about the Michael McDonald DVD always playing in the store, Andy in a car with Nicky, a drunk driver (even when she throws up on him, as nasty as it is), Andy on the phone with Trish, unable to tell her who he really is, so she mistakes him for a telemarketer, a lot of conflict amongst various Smart Tech employees, etc. There are way too many to mention! The funniest part is perhaps the chest hair removal scene, which really cracked me up both times I saw it! The film doesn't have the greatest plot, but there are so many good gags, and some likable characters (including the lead one), that it doesn't really matter.Yes, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is a comedy that many people would hate. The crude sex jokes pretty much just keep coming throughout the film, it's quite immature, and as one would probably expect with an R-rated comedy like this, there's also a lot of swearing. I don't mind these things, but obviously, a lot of people do, and they may believe that anyone who likes this type of humour must have something severely wrong with them. The film is not for those who are easily offended and can't stand political incorrectness in comedy. It's obviously not meant to be taken seriously, though many viewers obviously have anyway. This probably includes many politically correct extremists, for whom I cannot feel any sympathy. However, if you don't take it too seriously and you're willing to laugh at crude, immature sex jokes for two hours, there's a good chance this R-rated 2005 romantic comedy blockbuster is for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A Raunchy Romance,"Comedy is probably the one genre that is most difficult to hold up over time. It's the one genre that isn't timeless. Most jokes rely on pop culture references, but The 40-Year-Old Virgin manages to do the impossible, make a timeless comedy.In my opinion, this is Steve Carell and Judd Apatow at their best. While most Carell roles are filled with goofy and over-the-top humor, and most Apatow films are overlong and too raunchy, this film hits on all those cylinders in a good way. This is one of the dirtiest and raunchiest films that I've seen, but I can't picture it working any other way. Especially because that side of things makes you appreciate the really sweet romance between Carell and Catherine Keener. That relationship only works if you understand the world he's living in outside of his romance with her, and the stakes that the film sets up.This film also features what is perhaps the greatest comedy ensemble of this generation. You have Carell just beginning to hit his prime, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, and Romany Malco all rounding out the work group of friends pushing him to lose his virginity. That's not even mentioning Keener, Jane Lynch, Leslie Mann, Elizabeth Banks, and a young Kat Dennings and Jonah Hill. All of them create such memorable characters and scenes with the help of Apatow and Carell's hilarious dialogue. And yes, Apatow had done a bit of television work prior to this, but it's his first directorial effort for a feature film. Quite the impressive start.There are so many infamously memorable scenes. From the body waxing, to the poker table, the condom scene, the shenanigans from Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann drunk driving, or the speed dating scene. From beginning to end, this was comedy gold. And surprisingly, every joke hit just as hard as it did when I first saw the film years ago. Sure, it's hard not to acknowledge the films raunchy humor, but the romance is just as good.+Still holds up+The work group is perfectly cast+Balance between comedy and romance+Impeccably written9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
You'll love this Virgin,"It's nice to know that a funny R-rated comedy is still out there. There haven't been too many anymore, but when they work, they work. Steve Carell plays Andy, a geeky 40 year old who lives by himself in an apartment with more video games than your average teenager and an ASIA poster mounted on his wall. He also has more action figures than my son. When his co-workers find out that Andy is a virgin, they make it a point to get him laid and rectify the situation. Keep in mind, that none of these guys are prizes themselves and have their own relationship issues. After all, they work in a stereo store and most of them are in their 30's and some are older than Andy. When Andy does meet a sweet woman named Trish (Catherine Keener) he keeps his secret to himself out of fear of embarrassment. Trish, herself has 3 kids of her own and is a very young grandmother.There are a lot of big laughs in this. Poor Andy endures some body waxing, a crazy drunk bar pick-up, and some other scary dates before he finally gets up the nerve to ask Trish out. The bulk of the humor is pretty adult and their is also plenty of profanity and nudity. There is a real sweetness to the film though, and Carell's performance is right on and should launch him to A status if he isn't already there.""40 Year Old Virgin"", along with films like ""Wedding Crashers"", ""Anchorman"", ""Old School"", and ""Office Space"" would make a nice marathon on an evening when there isn't much to do. they're all funny, raunchy, and a really good time.

One movie never to watch with your grandma,"I remember it like it was last summer, because it was. I was rifling through the boxes of movies my grandmas friend gives to her. I have been itching to see this movie for quite some time now, and I figured well if we watched super bad last night than this couldn't hurt to try. Well within the first 5 to 10 minutes Seth Rogen starts talking about a horse having sex with a women; my grandmother just turned and gave me that look. Other than that it was a really funny movie with some really funny people. Who can forget Jonah Hill , and the goldfish heels. As always Steve Carrell manages to make an extremely awkward movie lovable ,and unforgettable. Almost as unforgettable as the look on my grandma's face during the penis slide show in ""super bad"". You should definitely see this movie, but not with your grandma.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"If you like the f word, you'll love this movie","So I went to this movie hoping to get a few laughs, and came out of it very disappointed. While I believe Steve Carrell's character was pretty funny, I found his band of misfit friends a headache. I know we're in the 21st century here, and I know cussing is a normal thing. However, saying the f word 500 times in a movie doesn't make it more interesting. In fact, it kind of degrades the script quite a bit. The material was funny, but would have been funnier without the language.Coming from a woman's point of view, the way his friend's talk about ""pussy"" was quite annoying. I can take a crude joke like the best of them, but again the endless string of comments get tiring after a while. I mean how many times can you say ""you're putting the pussy on a pedestal""? Sadly, I know some guys talk like that and that's pretty pathetic. But seriously, a few ""p"" jokes would have been sufficient enough.However, the only thing I will give it credit for was the underlying message. It's okay to be who you are, virgin or not. I found Steve's character rather endearing and more attractive than his loser friends who try to change him. And as it turns out, the ""nerd"" won out in the end.But seriously, unless you think it's cool to cuss all the time and make offensive jokes about women, I wouldn't sit through this one. You'll be very disappointed. It just might be too much for your virgin ears. (oh the pun!) ;)",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Fresh Virgin,"We first see our hero Andy (Steve Carell) waking up, and at attention (so to speak) in his tidy apartment. His ""crib"" is populated by hermetically boxed action figures, Play Station Games, and a framed poster of '80's rock group ""Asia"". He cooks a healthy breakfast, dresses geeky, and rides a bicycle to work. Andy is a supply clerk at an electronics super-store somewhere in West Los Angeles. The guys at the store need a fourth for their ritual poker night after the store closes. The delivery guy, Cal (stoner funny Seth Rogen) suspects that Andy might be some closeted serial killer. He really does. However, the rest of his crew, David (Paul Rudd) and Jay (Romanny Malco), invite Andy. Andy accepts. In an inept technical story, Andy comes out. No, not gay. He is a 40 year-old virgin. But instead of ridicule, Jay (slick street funny man, Romany Malco) declares that his life's mission is getting Andy laid. David and Cal are also enrolled in his community project. This is what is so charming, hysterical, and unexpected about Writer/ Director Judd Apatow's ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin."" Along with star and co-writer, Steve Carell, ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" is absolutely raunchy and graphic funny, but it is never mean-spirited. Never. In fact, the movie has a sweet love story, and an off-beat sense of true friendship. Much like ""Wedding Crashers"", ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" is a smart, absolutely funny R-rated comedy with the romantic foreground.The story by Apatow and Carell is clever, hysterical, surprising, all with a light touch. In an unexpected scene Andy asks the always together Jay, ""Do you think that I am good-looking?"" Jay tells him, ""...Yes."" The exchange is sincere. Yes, Andy is some sort of loser with the action figures, video games, and zero fashion sense. Well, at least initially. But with the good-souled and so very earnest Carell as Andy, we get that there is perhaps more to him. Perhaps, Andy gave up on sex and really on love a long time ago. Carell pulls off Andy as some sort of celibate hero, not so much pathetic, rather really a good guy. Like his co-workers, the audience has a genuine affection for Andy. So when his Viking-like boss Paula (an imposing funny sexy Leslie Mann) personally offers to make Andy a man, the effect is hysterical.There are hilarious bits involving speed-dating, porn, body waxing, and projectile vomiting. Eventually, Andy meets Trish (quirky and completely charming Catherine Keener). Trish is a 40-ish mother of three, who owns a ""sell it on E-Bay"" business. She has an office across from the electronics store. Andy meets her when she comes in looking for a VCR. Yes, VCR. His crew is behind Andy, and he musters up the courage to ask Trish out on a date. It goes so well, that they agree not to have sex for 20 dates as they get to know each other. No, this is not a big deal for Andy. Managing the rest of his life is.""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" runs a little too long, so to speak. Perhaps, it's only short coming. It is predictable, though completely hilarious with a universally satisfying charm. Steve Carell as Andy has a geeky charisma, for what could have been a pathetic characterization. Carell instills a great humanity and vulnerability in Andy. Catherine Keener is an amazing surprise as Trish. She is smart, funny, and extremely sexy. She is so believable as a 40 something single Mom, running her business, raising her kids, and looking for love. The rest of the cast are outstanding. Paul Rudd has great presence as David, the heart-broken guy who waffles between new age man, and woman chaser. Romany Malco is so versatile as Jay. He is the ultra slick dude, who ends up being a true friend to Andy. Seth Rogen is hysterical as the guy's guy Cal. There is a lot more to Apatow and Carell's ""Virgin"" than drop dead laughs. It's got a good story. Definitely see ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A funnier, closer to geriatric, American Pie","It's a tragedy how many comedies just aren't funny anymore...however, The 40 Year Old Virgin was a shining star in the black hole of comedy space. Crude, offensive, poor-taste sex humor generally make for a good film, but in this movie the jokes were so driven and so unapologetic I was a Persian kitten's whisker shy of urinating in my jeans. Funnier than any one of the American Pie movies, Steve Carrell scored big with his humble character stricken with no lady luck. When his friends from work find out he's STILL a virgin, their mission becomes getting him some lady loin. This is not just another situational comedy or reconstituted drivel we've all seen a thousand times. The 40 Year Old Virgin was probably the finniest film of the year and it wouldn't surprise me if it remained funnier than comedies for the next five...all I really want to say is, ""See it!""",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
So this is what passes for comedy these days?,"The trouble with watching ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is that you know Steve Carell is so much better than the awful material in this film. Because I've seen him be much funnier on ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart."" Then again, he was working with some of the funniest writers on TV on that show and had the luxury of playing alongside the likes of Rob Corddry, Stephen Colbert and my pick for the funniest woman in America, Samantha Bee.What's most surprising about ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is that it was co-written by Carell. It's the reason I went to see the film. And what a tremendous disappointment it turned out to be.Critics gushing over this film and tossing accolades at it must so starved of good, genuinely funny comedy, that they quickly to embrace anything with even a modicum of humor. The same critics who thought this year's terrible ""Fever Pitch"" was funny stuff.But this is a one-joke film and the joke runs out of steam within 10 minutes. And from there on, the writers, Carell and Judd Apatow (who also directed this embarrassment), simply keep regurgitating the same joke over and over and over and over again. Notice how many times the opening visual joke gets played in one form or another throughout the film. It doesn't get funnier simply because you keep playing it again. I don't mind scatological humor, even juvenile laughs. But the jokes need to work. They need to be funny. They just aren't here.I sat there utterly bewildered during this film, wondering why on earth no one involved in this mess realized the film wasn't all that funny. Yes, it's sweet, at times. It tries to be heartwarming, too. But those things don't necessarily make the film good or funny.But Carell and Apatow's idea of great humor is to have a man film his derri√®re or have a couple of chaps toss back and forth why they think the other is gay. The trouble is their put-downs aren't even remotely funny in the least. They're juvenile in the worst manner.The film is riddled with interminable lulls where the story just doesn't move along. The film's sole saving grace is watching Catherine Keener try to rescue it with her inimitable charm. Unfortunately, she's not working with sub-par material; she's working with execrable material. Frankly, Keener could make the afternoon traffic report on radio sound interesting, and she does a brave, but, ultimately, wasted, attempt at trying to salvage this film.Wasting a talented actress of Keener's caliber on material like this is a travesty. You want to see Keener in a good film? Watch ""Being John Malkovich"" (1999). Heck, even her small role in the Sydney Pollack political thriller, ""The Interpreter,"" makes for better viewing than this awful picture.Carell's a funny man. A very funny man. I loved him in ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" (2004) and his bit in ""Bruce Almighty"" (2003). As he's proved so often, he's good as a supporting player. ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is his first shot as a leading man. He doesn't make a convincing one. And he won't. Not until he works with stronger, funnier scripts.This purported comedy not only doesn't have good laughs, it's also an utter bore.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hilarious raunchy comedy! You pull for the loner underdog just because he wants to score with a female!,"I must say that Judd Apatow done a brilliant and beautiful job with this raunchy and foul comedy. It's something that seems down to earth and very funny that most can relate to that's relationships of finding the right one and sex. Only this comedy is a tale of a man that's a 40 year old virgin! You must say how sad and awful, but it's happened I'm sure. You have Steve Carell as Andy Stitzer a nice and shy loner type who can be described as a hard working electronics sales clerk, yet he's a nerd who loves his action figure collection(which his life is built around)and he spends most of his time playing video games and reading comics. Then one night over a game of poker with friends it's revealed he's a virgin! It's so apparent when he compares a females breast to feeling like a bag of sand now how funny! Andy must then go thru torture and shame from friends and co-workers, they try everything to get him to score by taking him to bars to try and pick up sluts and drunks to dating games to just about everything. Then finally he meets a hot and attractive grandmother(played by Catherine Keener) and it first seems so odd, but slowly and surely a relationship develops finally it turns to a pleasure and satisfying end! Really the gags and crudeness of talk don't take away from the film it's entertaining and funny very memorable scenes are the chest waxing, and the scene of Andy's struggles with how to put on a condom! You as the viewer also feel compassion and happiness for a lonely character of Andy's to finally score but more importantly find life long love. Really a great comedy with plenty of laughs even though raunchy the compassion and emotions overrides and produces a memorable comedy. Great acting from Steve Carell and well done and written by Judd Apatow.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A comedy done with charm and sweetness,"""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" / 2005 / Directed by: Judd Apatow / Written by: Judd Apatow and Steve Carell* * * GoodI like and admire Judd Apatow's story telling style. I was impressed, more than expected for this film. Most Hollywood comedies are ""by the numbers"", juvenile and predictable, best appreciated by adolescents or adolescent minded adults.This sex comedy, would seem to be yet another mediocre and immature Hollywood comedy, however, director/co-writer Apatow, shows some honesty and insight into human nature and relationships between the sexes. Sometimes ordinary comedy, sometimes special, the film does have moments of genuine charm and sweetness.This is only the 2nd Apatow film I've ever seen. first was: ""Knocked Up, 2007"". Both films share a lot in common, showing Apatow's signature style. Apatow is good at writing a variety of interesting and relate-able characters and being truthful about the insecurities of dating, sex and heterosexual relationships. Comedian and co-writer Steve Carell does a good job at portraying this sexually repressed, adolescent minded virgin middle aged man.The story setup of the main character is a little overdone, attempting to show the nerdy life of a 40 year old man stuck in adolescence, with his collection of childhood toys and addiction to video games still with him. Overall, the film is a works, as it balances comedy, honesty, charm and sweetness, which are Apatow's talent and trademark.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A Very Fun and Lively Comedy,"A delightfully awkward and very funny comedy, The 40-Year-Old Virgin can at times be a bit obvious and formulaic, but it is one enjoyable time. Steve Carell provides a perfect grounded performance in the lead role as Andy, a man who is 40 and still a virgin. The supporting cast is also very amusing, and the best roles are played by Romany Malco, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, and Seth Rogen. The film can be a bit tedious at times, but it is also wildly entertaining, with you fully rooting for the character of Andy and his journey, despite how obvious it may seem. The film is full of some very hilarious gags, of which are quite impressively pulled off considering most were ad-libbed, or even done in a single shot. Judd Apatow truly shines his directorial brilliance by allowing the movie to feel emotional while also remaining fun, one quality a comedy can not so easily balance nowadays. In the end, The 40-Year-Old Virgin is a very fun comedy, that I would not mind watching again. It's full of a lot of great talent and plenty of funny moments to keep you entertained, despite it being repetitive some of the time.

I adore Paul Rudd and figured if nothing else I'd smile.So I went into this thinking ""It'll be funny but nothing to write home about."" I absolutely fell in love with Steve Carell's character.

"Never cruel or mean-spirited, sometimes crude and raunchy, but always endearing and heart-warming ...","""Father of the Bride"", ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" or ""The Hangover""¬Ö most of the successful comedies originated from simple ideas with great comical potential; you got the original idea just by reading the title. And Judd Appatow's ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is one of these comedies.Yet, relying on an excellent premise wasn't enough to be considered one of the funniest films of the year. Had the screenplay tried to mock the hero's condition and featured desperate attempts to have sex with a girl, in a sort of cross between ""American Pie"" starring the kind of characters that Adam Sandler could have played, the film would have been 'another mindless sex comedy'. Instead, it's a witty and heart-warming little gem centered on one of the sweetest and most likable characters: Andy, played by Steve Carell. The critical success depended on one factor, simple but vital: the main character and I guess the surprise of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is even more pleasant when you expect a raunchy slapstick comedy with no heart.But as soon as we meet Andy, all the suspicions are swept off. He's a bachelor who works in a TV store and after many failures that suspended his trust on his own capacities, he abandoned the idea of ever having sex, and filled his life with toys' collections, virtual games, on-line poker, music and little-figurine paintings. He's not the typical dork with no-life, on the contrary, he has too much life, too many occupations working as time-fillers not to think about sex. He doesn't even compensate through masturbation or pornography, he is not mono-sexual but asexual. But Steve Carrell has a way to incorporate the flaws and the shy mannerisms of Andy with the right balance between charm and pathos. We feel sorry for him but we don't pity him, and never does the rooting process ever stop.And while the script, written by Appatow and Carell, could have take Andy's personality for granted as a source of gags, the masterstroke came with the peripheral characters, especially Andy's colleagues. David (Paul Rudd), Cal (Seth Rogen) and Jay (Romany Malco) invite Andy for a poker. And the inevitable happens, when invited to share a sex-related memory, Andy loses all credibility when he compares women's tits to bag of sands. This is a cleverly written scene, not just as a pivotal moment but because it's all in the reactions and the way we expect the male conversation to turn to sex, and from sex to the revelation. It's also a very well acted moment, where you can also notice the subtle performance of Rudd, and the way he observes Andy as if he already understood.The pay-off doesn't work on a comedic but rather on a human level. Cal is happy to learn that Andy is not the creepy 'serial killer' he expected, while Jay doesn't mock him, on the contrary, he believes it's an opportunity to help Andy, not help out of pity, help out of a feeling of true virile camaraderie. The point is that Andy is less a freak than a guy who didn't get his break, and each buddy, guided by his own view of life, elaborates a personal diagnosis and remedy to Andy's condition. Andy should learn to stop putting women (a subtle anatomic metonymy is used) on a pedestal, to go to parties where the drunker a girl is, the easier she'll be to get, all naturally, all these strategies end up failing, providing some hilarious gags in the process.And it's fitting that they fail, because the point is to provide insights on male perceptions about sex and women but it's only by controlling the situation that Andy has to succeed. And he finally meets Trish, an e-bay vendor working in a neighboring store. Keener delivers a sweet and tender performance as a woman who's not your typical cynical single-mom but rather kept her faith on men, and developed with Andy, a mutual fondness. She sees, like us, something in him. He's a good man who doesn't see sex as an Alpha and Omega, Trish also believes that they should put sex on stand-by, a convenience that naturally satisfies Andy. And that's the core of the film, sex doesn't make happiness like money, but like money, its lack can be handicapping. And Andy's friends welcome the new relationship but still advise him to get a sexual experience not to disappoint Trish.We know it's inevitable that she'll suspect something, but meanwhile, the film unveils some other aspects on the supporting characters. David can't get over his ex-girlfriend, Jay admits his lacks of self-confidence, the boss, Paula desperately needs sex, this puts their advice into perspective and show that no one is better than Andy. At the end it's just a wonderful and colorful gallery of characters that the film assembles to provide some insights about sex, gender and race, in an adult and never offensive way. Whether it's the staff mocking the two Oriental workers or the unforgettable ""I know why you're gay"" exchange between Rudd and Rogen, the film has a way to take risks and never sounding offensive, quite a performance in our era poisoned by the tyranny of political correctness.""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" starts with a cruel premise but the treatment of Andy's social handicap is never mean spirited and only works as the occasion to approach sex, and the way it helps or undermine love. It's an endearing love story between two sympathetic characters, and a wonderful casting celebrating in apotheosis the triumph of love through a hilarious musical parody at the end. It's one of the best comedies of the 2000's that didn't get any Golden Globe nomination, not for Carrell, not for Keener, not even one for Best Comedy¬Ö and that's the only feeling of disappointment the film inspired me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
40 - Year old Virgin is for the under 40's,"""40 - Year Old Virgin"" is a slapstick comedy that will definitely entertain the adolescents in the crowd. One should be warned that every other word is the ""F"" word or something similar. However, it is rated R and therefore entertaining to the younger folks without reservation. Many of us older fogies got a lot of belly laughs as well. John Stewart gave it a good review on his Cable Network show ""Comedy Central"", and the plug was well taken. One should not expect to see an academy award winning performance by anyone, but give it a chance and have a great time at the movies.

The kind of film anyone can relate to,"The film debut of the usually extremely funny Judd Apatow, The 40 Year Old Virgin is arguably his best movie. It's certainly his most consistently funny. A large part of what makes the film so funny is, in my opinion, how relatable and believable the conversations the characters have are. Yes, the dialogue is very vulgar, at times offensive, and at others quite graphic, but let's be honest, that's how a lot of guys talk to each other and about each other. A prime example is the scene where Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd take potshots at each other's supposed preferences by pointing out moments where they behaved in a less than masculine way; guys do stuff like that to annoy or just rib each other all the time. Helping matters is the endlessly quotable script, as well as some hilarious scenarios; the chest waxing scene alone is worth the price of admission. Even the dreaded misunderstanding scene is made tolerable by the writing and performances. If you had asked me after watching this the first time if I had any complaints, it would be the ending; I thought it was a really dumb way to end the film. Now, I think it's as funny as the rest.A comedy is only as good as its cast, and this film has a darn good one. Steve Carrell plays one of the most relatable protagonists you'll find in a comedy; he's awkward and weird, but likeable, charming, and handles the jokes and slapstick well. He has great chemistry with the adorable Catherine Keener and with his three onscreen friends. Speaking of, Rogen, Rudd, and Romany Malco are all fantastic as said friends, as are Jane Lynch as their boss and the rest of the cast. Even the usually awful Kat Dennings has her moments.Overall, The 40 Year Old Virgin is an absolute classic that never stops leaving me in stitches.

Not worth the wait...,"NOT WORTH THE WAIT...a review for The 40 yr. old VirginThe 40 yr. old Virgin Universal 2005 Color 116 mins. Comedy Steve Carrell, Catherine Keneer, Paul Rudd, Elizabeth Banks and Kat Dennings star. Written by Judd Apatow and Steve Carrell Directed by Judd Apatow Rated R for raunchy language,sexuality, nudity, drug use and vulgar toilet humor. After a few good reviews and some once trusted recommendations I persuaded myself to attend a mid afternoon screening of the late summer comedy hit the 40 yr. old virgin. I went with my very good friend Melanie who can make anything into a good time. Despite the trailer making it look somewhat entertaining I just got a bad feeling about it and decided to skip it and see Red Eye a few more times. Boy was I right! Joining the ranks of other uncomfortable comedies such as The American Pie trilogy, The Meet the Parents films and The Analyze This films among others. Now don't get me wrong this is not a wretched review for this film. it's not a bad film it's just far from being a good one. Steve Carrell of Anchorman fame stars as Andy Stitzer. A homebody, sweetheart of a guy whose a 40 yr. old virgin. he spends his time working as the stock manager at a electronics store, collecting toys, doing solo karaoke, reading comic books and riding his bike. He tries his best not to interact with very many people especially the opposite sex. Than one night when the guys are short one for poker. They invite him along and discover his big secret. Immediately becoming alarmed they decide to take action and influence him to loose his virginity as quickly as possible. Crude situations follow. And this film is crude. Thats mainly the reason why it exists. The depiction of virginity, women, sexual intercourse and humanity are all degraded to the fullest. And not with a winking eye or guilty chuckle but with a devilish stare none the less. Carrells characters is put through one humiliating situation after another. Now I never get offended and when I do there is good reason. I know people like the title character and although I myself am not a virgin I do hold their decisions in high regard. And I would never endorse anything that exploits that, especially for trashy, mindless humor. To assume that you can take an individuals physical awkwardness towards their sexual awakening personally insults me. And than to handle it's touchy subject matter so shamelessly and carelessly with not a speck of originality or intelligence. The film packs it's sluggishly paced 2 hours with raunchy language, ridiculously drawn life lessons, nauseating bathroom humor and immature revelations. Add that with a particularly lame chemistry free romance between the underused Keneer and Carrell and the finished product is one of regret. Although not a total waste of film Carrell's performance is one of comedic promise still and he must search for a better comedic vehicle.Despite all the film's problems there are a few gags that still inspire a giggle or two. But in the end the 40 yr. old Virgin is just a mediocre lay a grouping of wasted potential. What could've been a heartfelt, hilarious little comedy. ends up being an immature, chauvinistic romp that lacks any real conviction in it's subject matter and the laugh department. My suggestion is if you must wait for DVD and catch The Wedding Crashers again cause this film just ain't worth the wait. ** (out of five)",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Standard for Outrageously Funny Comedies,"The standard for all screenplay writers can be found within the comedy & hilarious hysterical laugh per minute script & film. The writing and acting is second to none. The comedy and some improvisation from Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, and Seth Rogen are second to none. Including all the other supporting actors and actresses as well. The 40 year old Virgin takes a sociological approach in its well written screenplay, as the film has laughs and all types of comedy from black humor to flat, naive humor that occurs in everyday laugh. By doing so, this movie is a definite gut wrenching comedy with hilarious comedy in its screenplay and acting, by all personnel within the film. At times the humor was so intense, when I watched it the second time, I literally fell out of my chair, trying to catch my breathe from the incredible level of every day happenings, with a twist, which allow one to look at life itself, their own lives, and laugh at it. By far the best comedy film of the year it came out. The first viewing I took my Father, Son and 14 year younger brother who was then 38, which made for 4 generations of humor, with all of us, liking every different type of humor. If this movie doesn't make you laugh all throughout it, then your a bore, lacking the ability to laugh or see life in the humorous eye. Steve Carell has a great cast of comedians around him like Seth Rogen & Paul Rudd, yet its Carell who comes out on top as far as the funniest character by far. This movie is so very important to Carells career as it launched his illustrious career full of great films, such as Dinner For Shmuchs. Carell's participation as the main actor, or shared with the actual writer of the Office, which is played by the actor known as Dwight, in the Office. Personally, I am stunned the OFfice lasted beyond its six showings, in which the show is either canceled or revised for a longer contract. The Office actually brings Carell's comedic abilities & spontaneity improvisation with his characters lines, by pulling him down, acting in a TV Show which is below his true abilities, which does Carell no justice at all as far as his abilities to make people laugh. Although at that time right after the release of the 40 yr. old virgin, Carell needed to stay in the publics eye, until he could make more comedy films. Carells true calling is definitely not in The Office, which bland humor written by the character who plays Dwight, is just too far below Carells true abilities as an actor & comedian. Carell can't and has never failed in bring his audience the highest form of laughter & comedy, in all of his films, as in Dinner For Shmucks or any movie he has had a leading role in. The 40 yr. old virgin not only launched Carells future, it brought him a lot of movie acting offers, of which he is being written out of the TV show The Office, so he can dedicate his work time to making movies full time. Bravo Steve, for making such outstanding movies. This is a must see, with all forms of comedy, from dry wit, to black humor, slapstick, all other forms, including the most important, it leaves us with a sense there is humor in every aspect of life, no matter how messy life is. Bravo, 10 stars out of ten. I've got to mention Rogen tho' as being one of the best comedy writers of his time. Whatever he touches turns to gold. As does Carell in all of his films, this one, I would say is my favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Fantastic,"I'll make this short and sweet - this movie was extremely well scripted, and just as well acted. I think Jon Stewart said it best when he interviewed Steve Carrel about this movie and said: ""You were on the Daily Show for several years, and you were not good. This movie was amazing. What happened to you?"" My stomach hurts from laughing out loud so much. There were countless quotes and statements that I wish I could remember because they seem like the kind of natural expression that needs to become part of my day to day repertoire. I was really watching the movie and thinking to myself, man, how did I not think of saying that when situation X presented itself to me. Definitely seeing it again. Only thing bad was the first 10 minutes - but I have a suspicion this was deliberate to make you think the rest would suck too, or at least ease you into laughing your brains out. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Best comedy for many a moon,"Given the generally dire state of cinematic comedy it is not saying that much to call 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' the best comedy of the 21st century (so far) but it probably is. Indeed it's probably the best since the inexplicably under-rated 'Kingpin'. For comedy to really work it has to come from character and not just from situation and what sets this apart from 'Wedding Crashers' and even the mighty 'Anchorman' is that the characters are genuine and there is real pathos (although not sentimentality). Steve Carell is excellent as the hero, and it is surprising and refreshing that his virginity, whilst used for comedic purposes, ultimately isn't sneered at. The supporting actors were all well-cast and the movie, while a shade overlong, managed to maintain a pretty high level of laughter throughout - the chest hair scene is a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wonderful Sex Comedy....,"After seeing all the funny trailers of this movie, I knew I had to see it. Everyone was excellent in the movie especially Andy's Co-workers.... There was a lot of graphic sexual talk that might make some people upset,Truthfully the movie didn't need as much f-words as it used but it sure was funny!!! There was all different age groups in the theater with me...and they all were laughing(many senior citizens) Basically if you are a prudish type of person who gets upset about sexual talk then you shouldn't go to a movie called ""the 40 yr old virgin""....BUT if you love raunchy comedies that have you rolling in your seat...then RUN don't walk to this movie!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Should Have Neutered This Virgin,"If being vulgar were the same as being funny, this would have been a funny film. Instead, it comes off like something some naughty high school boys made up.I was able to put up with the juvenile sex and vomit jokes, but the racial jokes were the most offensive. Of course, if there had been anything actually funny it would have made up for it.I didn't think Steve Carrel was a very likable character and I never really cared about him or rooted for him. The directing is like a made for TV skit. I think the choice of songs was supposed to be funny, but I can't be sure.If I hadn't read the reviews, I would think only teenagers would like this film. This is the worst film I have seen this year!",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of the very best hollywood comedies.,"A very funny comedy starring Steve Carell. Very well acted with some great gags throughout. The later DVD release runs 17 minutes longer than the original cut but never drags or bores. Recommended with guaranteed laughs, especially the hilarious speed-dating scene. So refreshing to see an original and highly enjoyable 'Rom Com' and there is a bit of the central character in every man.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The 40 Year Old Virgin,"Creative, funny and lighthearted.This movie shows that dirty movies can still be funny, a lot of the time these sort of movies are overly sexual and perverted but this one has a balance. It has creative and funny jokes but also a bit of Andy's personal life. His childish behavior, hobbies, persona and the fact that he's a virgin. The movie shows that relationships don't necessarily need sex, if you want a strong relationship you need to get to know the person and develop a connection between one another. The acting in this movie is also spot on especially from Steve Carrel, it's realistic and really elevates the movie. Overall a great comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The movie (and I'm stretching here because IMDb.com won't let me post a comment that is under 10 lines) is well-written, each scene is handled in an appropriate manner, nothing humorous is too far into the toilet.

The worst film I think I've ever seen...,"If only I could give this film a negative scoring I would. However, as 1 is the lowest score I suppose I have to go with this. The 40 Year Old Virgin was not in the slightest bit funny. I sat thinking the film would get better as it went along only to find it just got worse. The acting was bad, the storyline (was there one?) was very weak and the only bit that I found remotely entertaining was the Trish character played by Catherine Keener. I'm sure by appearing in this film she would have done great harm to her career although I sincerer hope not. The dance scenes after the wedding were just appalling and just not in keeping with the rest of the film, although I don't think anything could have redeemed it, to be honest. Please don't waste your money renting or buying this film. I'm sure you'll not only be as disappointed as me but always quite angry that you wasted your money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""40 Year Old"" is not racist","There have been claims that ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" was racist. I would just like to say that nothing could be farther from the truth. Yes there are racial jokes in it, but it is not a racist movie and there is no seriousness behind the joking. In fact I was rather impressed by the racial element in the movie. Compare it to a typical Adam Sandler movie where there is no one besides white people. In ""Virgin"" Paul Rudd's character can't stop thinking about his ex, who turns out to be of Indian origin (I'm guessing, it isn't actually discussed in the movie). I saw it with a group of Black friends and none of them had anything to say about the movie having any racist overtones at all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hilarious,"The 40 Year-Old Virgin is one of the crudest things ever to hit the big screen, and one of the funnyest of the year. The 40 Year-Old Virgin also has a very sweet ending, very, very sweet. That seems more than a little uneven and a little disappointing, in fact it might have worked better to have an ending that was similar to the rest of the film. Or they could have done the ideal thing and made the whole film have moments of sweetness. The film is none the less well written and the performances by Steve Carell and Catherine Keener are exultant, and I haven't laughed so much in a long time. The film also has a slight problem of using one joke many, many times. It may have some other good jokes but the one about him being a 40 Year-Old Virgin is use way to many times. All in all a hilarious film but an uneven one to and not one to race to see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Sexy and innocent,This is a great comedy. We have such a big number of great comedy actors. All the characters are big names whose movies I always want to see. There was even a young Jonah Hill. Steve Carell as the main guy is absolutely perfect. The idea itself is pretty funny and is also well written so it is entertaining through the whole movie.

The Funniest Comedy of 2005,"I recently seen this movie and I have to say hands down the funniest comedy of 2005.

This movie should appeal to all types of race and creed as no one is safe in this flick.Steve Carrel as I remember from the Daily Show and Anchorman puts his comic skills to the test and passes with flying colors. Lots of one-liners that I picked up from Andy's (Steve Carrel character's name) from all three of them.Not too much else to say but get off the computer and get your a** to the theater and pay the 8-10 dollars to see this flick to help keep Hollywood to make these films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

This is a piece of comic genius,"This movie did not impress me the first time I saw it. However, it took multiple times for me to watch it to appreciate the humor and in conclusion this movie is a piece of comic genius, not only for the puns, punch lines, and one liners; but for the way it accurately portrays each personality type depicted through each character. Andy (our hero played by Steve Carrell) represents innocence and integrity, and is portrayed with naivity, fear, and curiosity. Many kids 16-30 can not only relate to one of the many characters, but ultimately know other people who do as well. None of the characters are mean-spirited or necessarily ""bad people"", but each have a varying sense of morality. Additionally, the situations are real to life and modern day singles can relate to the material as well as the characters. What's scary is that many of these scenes are improvised, and some of the best jokes that have been used in the movie and DVD outtakes are on the fly. Many of the one liners can be heard repeated throughout college campuses everywhere. In conclusion, this movie is a diamond in the ruff and takes a unique personality to appreciate.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One long tasteless joke and not a very funny one,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsThe gross-out comedy looks like it will strike another hit with The 40 Year Old Virgin, as well as make a big star out of Steve Carrell, waiting for his big break after supporting roles in films such as Anchorman and Bruce Almighty.He plays Andy Stitzer. Andy works in an electronics store. He fits in with his work colleagues, does his job well and doesn't stand out that much other than his funny dress sense, the fact he rides a bike to work and his virginal qualities that his mates have started to notice. When his 'shameful' secret is revealed, the mates go to extreme lengths to get him to pop his cherry, but as events roll on, Andy discovers it's best to just let life roll on as it will and let things happen in the natural scheme of things, as he develops a relationship with a woman who is set to become a grand-mother at roughly the same age as him.The film is too long. This might not have been such a problem had the film had more of a sentimental edge to it, a la Mrs Doubtfire, but it entertains it's near-the-knuckle laughs side a bit too much to really make it this way. That's not to mention the NTK laughs that actually cross the boundary into tastelessness, i.e. the drink driving scene with the woman with her own breathalyser and Andy in the car, which the many families of DD victims might want to complain about. You could argue the whole film is like this, but, that's your opinion. Successfully, I found the film to be rarely funny, extremely funny when it is but not that often.It may have just caught me on a bad day and Carrell does have what seems to be a promising future as a leading man in comedies, but the impression I've initially come away with isn't much of a good one. **",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN is Naughty Fun,"Steve Carell has been a fixture on Comedy Central for years and had scene stealing minor roles in feature films like Anchorman and Bruce Almighty, but with his first starring role as The 40 Year Old Virgin, he has struck pay dirt. Although crude in its humor and at times graphic in its display of sexual conduct, the film has a core story that elevates it above most gross out comedies and does keep the funny lines coming fast enough to amuse most.Andy Stitzer, a painfully shy 40 year old, works as a service tech at an electronic entertainment showroom. He is friends with three salesmen who soon find during a poker game that Andy is a virgin, never having had sex with a woman before. It seems Andy never got around to that experience although his attempts are hilariously recalled. Because Andy is humiliated and embarrassed at the barbs and jokes at his expense, his buddies band together to help their fledgling. The aid comes in the forms of speed dating, roaming the singles bars, hitting on book store clerks, and propositioning the showroom's customers where Andy meets an attractive woman, Trish (Catherine Keener), a single mother who has a small business. The two instantly hit it off, but when it comes time to consummate the relationship, things go awry and Andy becomes more despondent when he cannot bear to reveal his deep secret to the woman he loves. It's time for a momentous decision in Andy's life.Carell co produced and stars in what is his pet project. Judd Apatow (The Larry Sanders Show) directs the script he co-wrote with Carell. True, some of the jokes crash and burn badly or misfire and fizzle, but enough keeps coming to raise some good roaring fun. As Andy, Carell plays an everyman kind of role, and his friends who on surface seem like chauvinistic frat boys, do care and come to his aid in an endearing spirit. He is so adept at the nuances and exaggerated movements of physical comedy that he needs to exploit them further (as he will in the big screen remake of the TV spy show, Get Smart). Among the numerous scenes, the standout and most talked about one is the infamous hair removal at a waxing clinic where Andy attempts to make himself more physically appealing. The results are disastrous, and it is well known that Carell performed the scene for real and suffered for his 'art'. Catherine Keener is a breath of fresh air and quite appealing in her realistic role of a single mother looking for love in the most unlikely of places. The relationship between Trish and Andy develops earnestly and serves to anchor the sillier aspects of the storyline. And there is silly aplenty with some outrageous lines of dialogue and vulgar asides. In some ways, this is about a man who finds his own sense of manhood and maturity after being a boy for a long time. There are subplots involving each of the guys that are amusing but don't really add anything to the story. Also good is the developing relationship Andy has with Trish's daughter. The final scene is pretty nutty and clever as the credits roll.On the surface, this film would appear to have all the ingredients for an over-the-top comedy like Animal House or American Pie. Indeed, there are a couple of scenes that are quite sexually explicit. It takes its R rating seriously. Don't be misled. This is not a one note comedy but rather a romantic tale. At its heart, it has a well intentioned theme of longing and frustration with some genuine compassion. If you go in knowing you may be grossed out at times but still induced to laughter, then that pretty much sums up the appeal of this energetic film. In a star making turn, Carell is one to watch for quite some time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I was expecting a clever and unusual script and, of course, some great jokes.

Now don't get me wrong, I do love a bit of swearing but in this film there is overkill to the point of tedium. There is even a sixty year old Pakistani character whose sole purpose is to shout out the rude stuff.There are some funny moments but you can count them on one hand and the film drags on for far too long.

"The 40 Year Old Virgin: Crude, Funny, and a Must See","The 40 Year Virgin is one of those titles where if you've seen the film will think of humor, sex and almost everything else but hardcore logic.

"Dull in most spots, although Catherine Keener is great","As the clever title might indicate, Steve Carell (late of Anchorman and ""The Daily Show"") plays a man who's sort of missed out on the amorous adventures of one's youth. Carell is Andy Stitzer, a low-wage lackey at a Circuit City-type store who ashamedly reveals to his three coworkers that he has yet to do the deed. Naturally, they view this as a challenge.Andy's never really grown up, as evidenced by his extensive video game and action figure collections and his habit of riding a bicycle to work every day. He never interacts with anyone outside work, so when he's asked to play poker with his coworkers, Andy accepts. Imagine his embarrassment when he's kind of forced to admit his ""problem."" Andy's stereotypical in many ways, which allows the audience to identify with him somewhat. We've all either been or known That Guy, the one who was still as dorky as an adult as he was in high school. Andy's extensive ""toy"" collection is his pride and joy, and one look around his small apartment indicates a stage of arrested development. It's not that Andy's not a nice guy, of course; that's actually the trouble. He never had much (any) luck with the ladies when he was younger, and as he's aged he's more or less given up on the whole idea. Too old, you see.Various plans are hatched, but the lady who catches Andy's eye is Trish (Catherine Keener), who owns a shop across from Andy's store. Trish is an older woman (at least compared with the ladies that Andy's buddies at work are trying to set him up with), and she seems to sincerely dig the someone na√Øve Andy. But is there relationship doomed? Will Andy confess to Trish that he's still untouched? I like Steve Carell, especially his fantastic Daily Show work, but I think he's a little underwhelming here. Carell doesn't act so much as react to the madness around him. That might work with some actors in some movies (such as when the chaos is continuously and uproariously funny), but the result here is a sometimes-sluggish mishmash of scattershot jokes and pathos.The real shining star of the movie is Keener, who's practically unrecognizable as Trish. You might remember her from Being John Malkovich - the slinky sexuality of Maxine gives way to the earthy-dreamy concoction of Trish - and she's as spot on here as she was in that one. Some day, Keener will earn an Academy award. It won't be for this movie, though.Andy's coworkers and other supporting characters are okay, if not particularly developed. You have the pervy guy, the flashy hip black guy, and the guy who's constantly bemoaning his ex, who dumped him two years ago. All bring a little something to the puzzle that is this film, but none of the pieces fit all that well.For what looked like a laugh-a-minute comedy about a poor schlub who's about to get off the schneid, Virgin is disappointingly slow in spots; Carell simply doesn't lend enough gravitas to the lead role to be particularly interesting.The 40 Year Old Virgin: **",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A great movie anytime,"Full of one-liners and hilarious scenes ""The 40-year old virgin"" is a comedy that delivers. Andy (Steve Carell) has managed to go through life with one mishap after another and as the title implies has ended up a virgin still at age 40. In this day and age with sex as pervasive as it is in our culture it's surprising to think that someone could end up at 40 a virgin if they didn't actually choose a life of chastity as an ordained minister or nun. The film is ultimately a romantic film about love and the relationship that we are all looking for. As part of the film's message that sex definitely complicates a relationship we get to witness the amusing dating that takes place when sex has been moved off the table. Full of a cast of supporting talent; Cathrine Keener, Seth Rogan, Paul Rudd, and others the film is a continuous crack up throughout. Yet it still remains sincere in it's message and depiction of what really is involved in a loving relationship and courtship. Although there is crude humor this is a perfect date movie anytime as men and women will both enjoy it equally.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Great film, it's a must see.","Forty years old, still not a manThe Forty Year Old Virgin is about Andy (Steve Carell) who is a forty year old man yet to have sex. Andy who is a nice genuine individual works at an electronic store. His fellow employees are, in a sense, mean to him. They think of him as being rather nerdy. When his fellow employees discover that he is a virgin, they consider it their duty to help him. Despite their advice, it did not work for Andy. He just cannot find the right woman. That is until he meets Trish, a mother of three. His friends are excited thinking that this is the one he will lose his virginity to, not knowing that they agreed not to have sex.I feel that the reason Judd Apatow developed this film is to say nice guys finish last. Andy's friends throughout the film are portrayed as players. They get their women by being completely phony. It is like all they have to do is tell the women what they want to hear and they continued to get lucky. Then there is Andy, a kind hearted gentleman, who is so good and true to these women. Apparently nice is not what these women were looking for. Apatow really shows how hard it is for a good man to get ahead. Andy finally got his chance, but of course he is the last to do so.This is one of the funniest films of the year. The casting is absolutely perfect. All of the characters are great. I could not stop laughing at Steve Carell's character Andy; it was in most part his friendliness and lack of knowledge of women. His friends from the electronic store cracked me up while trying to help Andy. I felt an emotional connection to Andy due to his authentic personality. Instead of being a stereotypical macho man, he is a kind and considerate person. In the end I felt a sense of pride towards Andy. He is a nice person who deserves a good girl.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The replacement for Kevin Smith...,"Well, the title prophesies what we're gonna watch, doesn't it? For those who miss the early years of Kevin Smith or the Farrelly brothers here comes Judd Apatow to take over from them all after an intense career as a scriptwriter. Loose laughing at Steve Carell's character expenses: the pathetic existence of a 40 years old dude that hasn't ever had sex and that fills his life with video games, internet, an iron discipline... but at the end of the day sex is always knocking' at the door. 40 years, Jesus Christ!!Maybe the weak points of the movie are its excessive length (more than 2 hours for a comedy doesn't sounds very nice) and the flirting with the romantic comedy at the end. Without that it would be a perfect comedy, so rowdy and foul-mouthed. At least is one of the most funny ones that I've watched lately.*My rate: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Pop my Cherry,This movie was a great concept that the viewer knew was going to have many funny situations to work with. I can't comprehend how one stays a virgin for 40 years. Andy makes me believe it is possible. Tons of hot girls flowing throughout this movie and it had an actual plot other than just getting a 40-year-old virgin a girl. The focus comes more to knowing there is also the right girl out there. So this is not just full of pointless dribble.The only complaint I have is I felt it way too drawn out. I think they could have shortened it quite a bit. All and all it was a riot and I am glad it ended the way it did.Enjoy!,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A new version of American Pie with the age twist, making it funnier.","I'm probably not smart in comparing this to American Pie because really they are two different types of movies, American Pie is about teens trying to lose their virginity before high school ends. The 40 Year Old Virgin is about a man (Steve Carrel) who has long past graduated from high school, and college. I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying that he's a 40 year old virgin. Is the movie funny? Absolutely. Have I seen funnier? Yes.The performances in this movie are what really kept it going. Steve Carrel is I think, one of the funniest men in the business as of now. He was good in Bruce Almighty, and probably to most a favorite character in Anchorman, and now his biggest role, in the 40 Year Old Virgin will be talked about as a symbol of his comedic genius. Really just a funny funny movie with a great all around vibe.P.S. This movie has to make EVERYONE feel foolish, either that or you have a really big head to carry on your shoulders. You gotta laugh at it and yourself.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Big O in Laughs,"Steve Carrell is a middle-aged man who works in the stockroom in an electronic store, who rides a bike to work, and who has never had sex with a woman. It just never happened. He probably only half-heartedly tried, but was always awkward with women and never felt secure enough to really be the aggressive type. So I gather from his disposition. Then he meets Catherine Keener, who has an eBay store, to sell your items online! Is she the one? I am reviewing this movie, despite the already numerous reviews, to add my two cents and to encourage people to see this really funny movie, which started the raunchy film craze such as ""Superbad, ""Knocked Up,"" ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" and ""I Love You, Man."" (Not counting the ""American Pie"" film series.) ""Wedding Crashers"" was made around the same time as ""Virgin,"" I believe. But while these other films may have their defenders and fans, none of them can claim to have the heart this film does, and the presence of the disarmingly funny Steve Carrell helps. Granted I did like ""I Love You, Man,"" too, but this film just has everything right with not a single false note, and the performances by Catherine Keener, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Jane Lynch and Elizabeth Banks were right on track and made the whole film complete. I don't mean to repeat myself, but this film is just so genuinely funny. Some may be turned off by its unChristianlike language, but other attempts to replicate this success of the film really failed in my opinion. I give it a 10 for the best time you can find in movies where the adults are behaving badly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Not a Dull Moment, Very Funny","The idea of a man being a 40 year old virgin is funny by itself. Seeing his lifestyle and actions are even funnier. Being through tough times, Andy decided to give up on trying to lose his virginity. His co-workers find out, and try to help him by taking him to clubs, giving him advice, and setting him up with different women.The plot was simple, a 40 year old man who never had sex who tries to have sex, simple enough. There were many one liners that were hilarious and had the entire theater laughing. Some scenes did not have talking at all, and were still comical. This movie reminds me of There's Something About Mary, there were a lot of moments that you wouldn't forget. Very funny, there wasn't a moment where I didn't want to watch. 9 out of 10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Don't judge by the label,"This movie is just so good at what it does. It is streets above the likes of 'American Pie' or 'Road Trip' which, whilst very entertaining, have the boardroom touch all over them in their calculated, controlled (commercial) approach to 'gross-out' and nudity. 40-Year Old Virgin, on the other hand, seems to have grown unchecked from the rich material of a guys night out. This is boys talking like boys - and little-known actors having an absolute ball. The aim is not to shock the audience for the sake of it, but merely to give an honest account of male preoccupations. Neither is the tone cruel; you never feel that people here are scornful of the central character, but that they genuinely want to help a repressed and overlooked man discover his potential. This film, perhaps above any other, show that potty talk, machismo and alcohol can be the greatest means through which to communicate real affection between mankind (as opposed to womankind). Conservative America probably wouldn't be able to spot it, but this film is warmer than a thousand and more 'family' films... oh and it's damn funny too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Andy Sitzer is the new Napolean Dynamite...,"I compare the 2 characters because both are nerdy and had weird social lives. This movie is about a guy, Andy, who is 40 and still collects toys, sits at home,and doesn't date. He gets outed by his friends at work as a virgin. So of course they want to help him get some. They take him out and tell him how to talk to women, but something always happens to mess up the evening. Then he meets the one, and he finally asks her out. And it's easy to guess the ending.While the plot isn't much, the script was great. A lot of funny moments and comments are made by Andy. It's more funny because you could picture a nerd like that in real life being the same way.And the film's funny without a lot of gross humor.FINAL VERDICT: It deserved the hype. And it's worth watching twice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Infectious fun,"Most comedies are nothing but joke sequences. 'For a comedy to work, it needs to make you laugh,' a successful director once explained. But this movie here, despite its horrible title, is much more than that. It is a genuine feel-good movie, thanks to a radiant cast that just seems to have had a great time working together. The characters are all infectiously funny but totally believable - I actually wanted to MEET these people, a very rare occurrence indeed.The matter-of-fact treatment of sex probably makes the movie unbearable for certain people, but nevertheless: Strongly recommended for anybody who has a sense of humor about life & love - whether you're 14, 44 or 70.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Outstanding adult comedy,"Taking out untouchable comedy classics (mainly Coen brothers' works, Monty Python stuff, Young Frankenstein, and Annie Hall which I think are flawless and beyond compare at this point) ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" might be the funniest movie I have seen in my entire life. Better than recent screwballs: Wedding Crashers, Old School, Elf, and There's Something About Mary. All of which I loved. In 40V, there's not a bad bit or wasted gag or line of dialogue in the whole thing and it's riotously funny and bawdy from the first minute to the closing credits. Clearly, you have to be in the right mood and probably need to be in the target audience (as the title suggests children of the '80s). If you were born between 1965 and 1975, can handle a little modern Vaudeville and are impossible to offend, this movie is damn near perfect. It's just wrong on so many levels. (And if you love Catherine Keener as I do, that's a big plus.)-gig",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Give It Up for Feig, Carrell & Co!","Parents, please stop taking your kids to Rated R movies! Okay, now I can continue with my review¬Ö The 40-Year-Old Virgin is a smart, raunchy yukfest reminiscent of American Pie and There's Something About Mary. While not quite as enjoyable as the latter, it offers a buffet of twisted humor and some sentimental messages to boot.The film was co-written, produced, and directed by Judd Apatow, best known for his work on one of my favorite TV shows, Freaks and Geeks. The under-appreciated Apatow may finally have a hit on his hands, thanks largely to his co-writer and leading actor, Steve Carrell.Carrell (Daily Show, Anchorman) plays geeky, electronics store employee Andy Stitzer. Andy leads a solitary life, filling his time and modest apartment with collectible toys and video games. Despite its subtle kinship with Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Andy is not just a man-child. He's a sweet guy who's reached his 40s without having had a real relationship or the physical connection that typically accompanies it. Once his younger, sex-crazed co- workers learn of his plight, they make it their personal mission to ""get their buddy laid.""The movie works not only because it's chock-full of laughs, but also because of its realistic depiction of male behavior. We see the demented male psyche from nearly every conceivable facet, which proves both illuminating and frightening. The film's potential classic status is marred only by its lengthy running time. Nevertheless, if you're in the mood for something profanely endearing, this is the one for you.Rating: B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The best  and funniest sex comedy of the last decade.,"It's pretty easy to describe the plot of this film. There is a guy. He is aged 40. He has not yet had sex.Am I going to fast for you to keep up? No different to dozens of cinematic abortions that pass for teenage sex-comedies: American Pie, Road Trip, Everyone Must Get Laid Before Graduating 3, Hey Smell My Finger etc¬Ö only the age of the protagonist has changed, meaning he must deal with different circumstances and impediments than the typical horny teen.(I'm not saying that there is no place for teen sex-comedies, only that once you are no longer in the target demographic I find it hard to root (so to speak) for the generally loathsome guy to get the hot blond chick. (The Girl Next Door is the only notable example of a smart sex-comedy for a few years.) The 40 YOV also launched several careers, notably Steve Carell (though this is still his high point unfortunately), Seth Rogen (heavily faux-tatted here), Jonah Hill (in a bit role before Superbad) and Paul Rudd as a go-to comedy guy, (he NEVER gets I Love You, Man or Role Models without this, let alone Forgetting Sarah Marshall).Furthering the plot description. Andy is the titular virgin, an ultra-nice guy who works in the back office of an electronics store, he is conservative, shy and keeps to himself in a home that only a teen-who-won-lotto would consider normal. Let's just say that computer games, karaoke, comic books, action figures and ""army men"" are prevalent in Andy's after-hours activity.He also rides a bicycle everywhere - and this guy can't pull the ladies!?! One evening in a poker game it comes to light that Andy is somewhat inexperienced and his workmates set about remedying that situation, not realizing that Andy is basically happy with his circumstances and aside from the normal bodily urges has no overriding desire to change who he is, (or who he does).The remainder of the movie sees Andy have misadventures with drunk women, chat up techniques, speed dating, workplace relations, transvestite call- ""girls"", male grooming and of course self-lovin'.After a time though he coincidentally meets a woman who works nearby, (played by Catherine Keener in the only straight role in the film) and the two start dating, leading to the inevitable ""next step"" decision.So I guess The 40 YOV is a non-teen, non-sex comedy for the most part, although it does have as much crude humour as you can poke a ""big box o' porn"" at, and does have various nipple sightings along the way.One thing it is though is funny. Funnier than every film (excluding Hey Smell My Finger, that was genius!) listed above combined.The reason for that? The premise is amusing but will only take you so far, the primary reason is that the cast interact in a believable way for the most part, and you actually can see most of the events here happening, but the banter, teasing and ad-libbing that fills every scene here is always amusing and frequently hilarious.Because early on in the film Judd Apatow chose to go just a little further with character development than normal comedies, we know how each of the four main workmates will react: Andy (Carrell) ‚Äì Conservative. Will sheer away from confrontation or ""adult situations"".Cal (Rogen) ‚Äì Pothead backroom guy. A pervert.Jay (Romany Malco) ‚Äì Not the token black guy but an ""urban"" presence nonetheless, a habitual cheater always looking for an angle with the ladies.David (Rudd) ‚Äì Acts like he is newly single but in fact has been for 2 years after a brief relationship.The four guys share most of the first half of the film together and are responsible for almost every laugh in the film, they banter and tease one another in a totally realistic way, and even the step too far ""You know how I know you're gay"" bit is almost replicated by thousands of straight guys in normal conversation on a daily basis.By the way, it doesn't go too far in any homophobic way, they just kept the joke going too long until the laughs ran out.This movie is actually to blame for dozens of sh*tty comedies made in recent years, and also indirectly for Will Ferrell's success, as the ad-libbing element that worked so well here has been done to death. Here ad-libbing means ""just keep the scene going until you run out of stuff, then we'll move on and in the edit I'll keep the funniest take. Nowadays it is ""Let's see what inane description Will Ferrell can yell this time, before he runs out of ideas and simply takes his clothes off. Again."" Surely that is still hilarious? The strength of The 40 Year Old Virgin is that the film keeps moving, Apatow wisely keeps the plot moving and allows the actors and the action to create the laughs. There are many scenes that still are funny the 4th or 5th time around, the dialogue is at times gross without overstepping, and the bit parts (MOOJ!!) add to the comedy even if they do little for the plot.Oh, and it helps that you actually want Andy to do well for himself. So much so that by the end when he is faced with two distinct choices (one a hot young Elizabeth Banks in a spa just gagging for it no less!) you want him to choose the right one.Even if you absolutely would not in the same circumstances. Final Rating ‚Äì 9 / 10. Probably my favourite comedy of the last decade, smart, charming, gross, and hilarious, all in the proper proportions.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
