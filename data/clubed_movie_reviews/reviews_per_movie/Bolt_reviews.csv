Some of the most fun you'll have at the movies this year,"Standing out in the crowd is not always the easiest thing to accomplish for an animated film, but above what you may expect, against WALL∙E's heart, and Kung Fu Panda's slapstick hilarity, Disney's Bolt jumps forward as simply the most fun.What makes Bolt noteworthy as well as a success on its own terms is its ability to take an age-old message about being true to oneself and finding your inner hero, and mesh it with a unique storyline that ends up spawning what, at first glance at least, seems wholly unique. Coupled with the expectedly bright crisp animation and stellar voice work, makes Bolt better yet, and a sure contender for best animated film at this years Oscars. Bolt also reclaims the original song work of Disney past, conceived between its also star and teen sensation Miley Cirus and Jenny Lewis and both compilations are memorable and sweet. Bolt never dives for the heartstrings, but scores its emotional points through well developed characters and thoughtful situations.Bolt opens with a very entertaining action sequence in which Bolt (voiced to surprising effect by John Travolta) and his master Penny (Miley Cirus) are chased by well equipped super villains which plays out in the vein of The Incredibles. The genetically altered canine can leap helicopters in a single bound, melt evil with laser eyes and destroy villains at a whim with his super-bark. It is soon revealed that the action speckled lives of Penny and Bolt is in fact a hit television show, which requires Bolt to be kept in the dark about the nature of his existence; in brief, he actually believes he has super powers. But after a cliff-hanger ending of an episode in which Penny is taken, prompts Bolt to escape, determined to reclaim his friend and master. Embarking for the first time into the real world he haphazardly enlist the help of a very reluctant cat (Susie Essman) and a fan-boy err...fan- hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton) and along the way learns, and earns, the true stripes of a hero and that of friendship.If everything I mentioned above was not enough to make you see this film, I can also reveal that Bolt is an at times hilarious send-up of the movie industry and genre clichés. Propelled by the hilarious supporting voice work including Malcolm McDowell, Dietrich Bader and James Lipton the blend of comedy, drama, and flat out entertainment value is unmatched. Also worth an enthusiastic mention are the pigeons that show up throughout the course of Bolt's adventure. Not only (as with all) is the voicing perfect but the physical humour implored is gut-busting, with the feathery fools twitching their heads in a pigeon- esquire way during their meetings with Bolt to glorious results.If you have a chance, you obviously should see this film in 3-D, however it is still well worth your money viewed in a traditional medium. Bolt is a reminder of why Disney was such an animation juggernaut and it is pleasant to see them recapturing some of their past glory. And just in case you want it mentioned bluntly, yes there are many jokes that older patrons will more then enjoy. It is always refreshing to see an old formula revamped so effectively and certainly always welcome to see a movie that can put a smile on faces of all ages.8.5 / 10.0View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun action packed Disney adventure,"Bolt follows a canine actor known for playing a super hero on a TV show, he is supported from his owner and must find his way back to her, all while believing he truly has super powers.Bolt is loads of fun! There are lots of creative action scenes, plenty of funny jokes, and even some emotional scenes.
Bolt has the makings of a Disney classic, but it does come up a little short of the usual Disney magic.Firstly, the story lacks depth, the story basically tells itself in the first 30 minutes, then fuels the rest with action, comedy and drama.
Secondly Miley Cyrus proved to be an annoying choice for voicing one of the main characters, not only is she an ear-sore, but she struggles to express different emotions vocally, her voice feels fake and just detracts from the overall film.Luckily there's still plenty good in Bolt, it's definitely a great choice for a family friendly action comedy!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Would Our Pets Still Love Us If They Knew The Truth?,"My kiddos liked this a lot, better than some other middling Disney movies from this era, like Home on the Range. They enjoyed the like-able main characters, including the cat; the exciting cross-country adventure; and the bond between the girl and her dog that held the movie together. So the basics were well done, as was the animation. Still, I thought it's most interesting as an allegory - Bolt is deliberately fooled by humans, and overestimates its own self importance (and, by extension, the importance of her owner Penny); similarly, the agents and producers overestimate their own performance. But once the illusion has been shattered, Bolt is able to still find meaning in his companionship with Penny. As new rabbit owners, we realize that this is more a dog thing. Rabbits, for example, are realistic like cats, but less cynical: they expect food from us, and love to play with us as long as we keep bringing it!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
So delightfully entertaining!,"This film is about a dog that believes his friend is in grave danger. What he does not know is that he is the star of a reality TV show.Who would have thought ""Bolt"" would be so thrilling and entertaining! The opening action sequence is rushed with adrenaline, it excites me even though it is an animation! The plot is intelligent, interesting and fun, the great thing is that it entertains without the need of any toilet or gross out humour. The super-bark and laser eye scenes are so hilarious, in a cute and mesmerising way. In addition, the transition of Bolt from being a super dog to realising he he has no powers is very well presented, that it makes me feel sad for Bolt. The animation is flawless, and all the characters in the animation are super cute. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of ""Bolt"", I think it makes perfect family entertainment.",,Anonymous,Animation

Canis familiaris,"Story-wise, there's nothing remarkably new about ""Bolt,"" Walt Disney Animation's latest feature to hit the screens, but considering its patchy recent filmography, it's certainly a step to the right direction for the animation studio, now headed by Pixar-meister John Lasseter. While it's far below the sophisticated narratives and well-drawn characters of Pixar classics such as ""Toy Story,"" ""The Incredibles"" and this year's ""Wall-E,"" ""Bolt"" nevertheless charms its way to the screen with its eager-to-please lead character and diverting visuals.Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) is the canine star of a TV show where he plays a superdog whose lifelong mission is to protect his ""person"", Penny (Miley Cyrus), from the evil forces around them. Problem is, as the creators of the show fervently believe that the show's success lies mainly in its realism, they have gone to great lengths to lead Bolt into believing everything is real and everything seems to be going well.That is until a studio mishap has Bolt improbably shipped across the country from Hollywood to New York. With the help of Mittens (Susie Essman), an alley cat who strangely knows more about dog ways than Bolt himself, and Bolt-fanatic hamster Rhino (Mark Walton), he goes on a long cross-country tripping to find his way back to Penny.Byron Howard and Chris Williams direct a calculated script by Williams and Dan Fogelman where nothing is terribly special, especially if you're not a dog-loving tween girl (I do love dogs, though), though it has enough sensitivity (that's Lasseter working) up its sleeve for some unashamedly touching moments. And with its cheery visuals, lively characters and a breezy pace, it also has enough going for the adults as well as the kids. It's safe harmless stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Tough to rate, it's cute but very unoriginal","Bolt, I honestly don't know what to say about this film because honestly I feel bad about saying this, I love Disney so much, but this movie didn't do anything for me. First off this was one of the strangest casts, I do like John Travolta, but I just couldn't see him as Bolt for some reason, his voice just threw me off completely. Miley Cyrus, this movie became more about her and I think they were just trying to attract her fans to this movie. The only thing that I really did enjoy from Bolt was the hamster, Rhino, he was just absolutely cute, he could have been annoying, but he's like the ultimate fan that loves you so much that it turns around and you like him right back. The animation, it was decent, 3-D is just becoming so huge this year I think. The story is just The Truman Show with a dog, it also kind of reminded me of Homeward Bound, so this is something we've seen before.A super-dog named BOLT, whose days are filled with danger and intrigue-at least until the cameras stop rolling. When the star of a hit TV show is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood sound stage to New York City, he begins his biggest adventure yet-a cross-country journey through the real world to get back to his owner and co-star, Penny. Armed only with the delusions that all his amazing feats and powers are real, and the help of two unlikely traveling companions-a jaded, abandoned house cat named Mittens and a TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino -Bolt discovers he doesn't need superpowers to be a hero.While I wasn't into this movie, I think it's a great family film, especially for the kids, it's a guaranteed fun time for them. The characters are cute, but it's Rhino and Mittens who steal the show. I don't know about you, but I think this movie had a little bit of a rip off from Animaniacs, those pigeons in the beginning reminded me too much of the Goodfeathers and Mittens reminded me a bit of Rita, if you've seen the show, you know what I'm talking about and will agree with me. Bolt is worth the look, but I'm not that impressed with it, watch it with the kids and for the fun 3-D stuff. The story is just a little unoriginal but the characters make it worth your while.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A VERY fun movie for old and young alike,"Its an animated movie about a dog. GIVEN, its a 'kids' movie. Unlike many animated movies, the dialog isn't full of innuendos or 'hidden' humor that only adults would 'get'. Its easily understood by kids, the animation is top-rate (as would be expected) and the characters are engaging and easy to enjoy. I admit that even though I love animation, I went to this sneak preview with a few misgivings. The trailers didn't look all that exciting, and I didn't expect to see anything I hadn't already seen. On one hand, I was right. The animation WAS very good, but nothing that hadn't been done before. But on the other hand I was pleasantly wrong. The formula works perfectly for Bolt. It was fun, didn't have any 'dull' spots, and while my theater was filled with a fairly consistent mix of children and young teens, and a relative smattering of adults, everyone seemed to enjoy it. Laughter was pretty consistent among the old and young, and at the end of the flick I heard something I rarely get to experience in theaters these days: applause. Granted, the adults were the ones applauding, and I joined in enthusiastically. The wife and I agree that this was one movie where we felt we got more than our dollars' worth. Thats a rare treat. Bolt did not disappoint on any level -and will find a spot in our library when the DVD eventually hits market. I fully expect this movie to do very well.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great animated action/comedy.,"I saw a preview screening of ""Bolt"" just a short while ago. The theater was packed. It turned out to be very funny and enjoyable film. Bolt is a dog that thinks his superpowers are real. He works with his owner, Penny, in a action shown on TV. Bolt runs away when Penny leaves him for the night. He goes all over the place to find her and meets some other animals along the way. The characters in the movie are all very creative and funny, especially the hamster who turns out to be a big fan of Bolt. There is also a character named Mittens (a stray alley cat) that Bolt meets about half way through the movie. This may not be the best animated film you will ever see, but it is still one worth seeing. I would recommend this movie to anyone- not just kids.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bolt brings back true Disney,"I have been anticipating the release of Bolt for several months. I had an opportunity to see a screening of it and it exceeded all my expectations. Bolt is a wonderful movie with a good story and heart, something that Pixar has done well but Disney has struggled with. I believe the addition of John Lasseter to Disney Animation has made a significant impact on the quality and continuity of this film. Yes, it is CGI. You may ask, ""Why is Disney doing CGI when Pixar already does?"" All the studios are doing CGI right now. I have been very impressed with Pixar's CGI detail, however the detail in Bolt is even better. Creating a dog with fur that gets dirty, wet, wind-blown and looks real is very impressive (at least it is to me). In addition to better detail, the color and light of this film is so true to life, you'll think it's the real thing.I laughed, cried, and was on the edge of my seat. Disney has created some lovable characters who will definitely win the hearts of millions. Congrats to the entire Disney Animation studio, well done.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixa- I mean Disney at its finest,"Lets face it, the early 00s were not kind on Disney. The Renaissance was over, their loyal target audience was in college and thus not interested, Pixar was doing the whole CGI thing way better than them and all in all they seemed to have lost their touch. Until this film. Oh sure, it's still very much like something Pixar would have done and a bit missing on that Disney magic, but it's still a very good film that allowed them to get back on their feet.And when I say it's something Pixar would have done, I mean that in a good way. Kind of. The plot features a dog, raised to believe he has genuine superpowers, suddenly being separated from his loyal owner Penny and now having to make his way back across USA to reunite with her. All the while having to learn that the world does not in fact play by his rules. Sounds like a Pixar movie, doesn't it. But then again, Pixar is a great film studio so that's not exactly an insult.And the story and the characters are very good in their own right. Bolt, the eponymous main character, is very gruff and no-nonsense, but also delightfully naïve about the realities of the world, while Mittens, his new cat sidekick/helper/kidnap victim is pretty much the exact opposite. And then there is Rhino, a hamster trapped in a plastic ball and also one of Bolt's biggest fans. Rhino is awesome.And yeah, it's kind of silly that I keep complaining about the fact that it's so much a Pixar film. It does make it seem a bit artificial in a way, because you know that they're copying much of their good material. But it's a good film, when all is said and done. Do see it, if you have the chance, is what I'm saying.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Easily my favorite Disney film, and perhaps my absolute favorite movie of all time","The 2000s have not been very kind to Walt Disney Animation. While there has been the occasional Emperor's New Groove or Lilo and Stitch, the majority of their films from this decade have been rather mediocre (most notably 2005's Chicken Little, which - ironically - remains the studio's highest-grossing film of the 2000s). With that said, I initially had some doubts about Bolt, despite hearing that it would be Disney Animation's first film supervised by Pixar founder John Lasseter. The surprisingly positive reviews posted shortly before the film's release convinced me to buy a ticket. Thankfully, I was forced to eat my words; welcome back, Disney.The film revolves around Bolt, a white German Shephered who has spent his entire life on the set of a TV show in which he portrays a ""superdog"". As a result, he believes that the events on film (and his super powers) are real. When he is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood soundstage to New York City, he embarks on a cross-country journey to reunite with his owner and co-star, Penny. Along the way, Bolt teams up with a jaded alley cat named Mittens and a TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino who also happens to be an extreme Bolt fanboy.First of all, the effects in this movie are unbelievable. Everything in the movie looks so realistic and yet doesn't contradict with the animated cartoon-esquire characters. Also, while Bolt is obviously the star of the movie, the real comedy comes from his unlikely companions. In fact, my favorite character of the bunch is Mittens the cat, voiced excellently by Susie Essman. Very seldom do I hear/see a character and say ""I can't imagine anybody doing a better job playing him/her"", but Essman really brings a lot to this already memorable character. And though I found him to be pretty irritating at first, some of the best lines in the movie come from Rhino the hamster.Lastly, in one of the opening scenes we see Bolt as he is in the TV Show to set the understanding of Bolt's world. Seriously, that was made of awesome. The scene was action packed and full of excitement. I would watch the show that Bolt is in. If I had to have a complaint, it would be that it takes some ideas from several other films (such as Homeward Bound, Toy Story, and The Truman Show). That said, it still manages to feel like its own film, and with grace.With terrific animation, an incredibly heartwarming story, and some of the most endearing characters I've ever seen on film (animated or otherwise), Bolt has not only become my favorite Disney film (Pixar included), but perhaps my absolute favorite movie of all time. It feels strange saying that, especially considering that I didn't even expect to like the film, but I simply can't think of a movie that I've loved more. It's also one of the very few films that manages to bring me to tears every time that I watch it, and when a movie is able to affect me on that kind of level, it automatically becomes a winner.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Grande,"I was really not expecting much, was looking to one of those generic ""newgen"" 3D animations but, oh, I was so wrong. I can easily say Bolt is pretty much at par with Wall-E, the 2 21th century animations that conquered my heart.Few times I laughed, few times I had watery eyes, and it's impossible not to adore the characters and be at the edge of the seat as you follow the story. Also really loved the ""authentic"" finale with Penny and Bolt.The Real D (my first ever 3D glasses movie too) was the cherry on the cake with the astonishing graphics.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Electrically entertaining from Trabolta,"In Bolt, a TV-show canine (John Travolta), who doesn’t know he’s on a TV show and therefore has no super powers, races across the country to find his TV girl-owner (Miley Cyrus), convinced she’s in the clutches of the evil Dr. Calico, the bad guy on the show. Aided by a cynical alley cat and a hamster in a transportation ball, Bolt must fight the forces of gravity and the other laws of physics to be reunited with his Penny in this sweet, charming Disney animated film.It’s encouraging to see a good Disney-only animated film for a change. Bolt does what an animated movie should do – it has a quick pace, it’s humanistic, it’s funny, and it’s adventurous. Oh, and there’s character growth. It’s no surprise that the intended audience – little kids, not me – found this entertaining, on average.Bolt, an American White Shephard, escapes from his trailer on the set of his hit television series and finds himself shipped to the East Coast. Thinking that his Penny is in imminent danger from the man with the green eye (played with the usual maniacal glee of Malcom McDowell), Bolt tries to use his super powers – super speed, the ability to shoot lasers from his eyes, a Super Bark – to rescue her. Of course, since he’s just a normal dog, these super powers don’t work, but they do lead to some hilarious physical comedy.One departure this movie offers is the casting of unknowns in key roles. Mittens the Cat is played by Susie Essman, and the scene-stealing Rhino the Hamster is voiced by Mark Walton. Who and who? And yet both actors are perfect for the roles. Sometimes it pays to cast someone based purely on their fit for a character, rather than hiring a “name” actor and letting their celebrity overtake the character completely. Which is how Disney did it for years and years; when the studio enjoyed its resurgence in 1989 with The Litter Mermaid, it cast Buddy Hackett amid character actors, and the landscape of animation changed. Next thing you know, you had Robin Williams in Aladdin and James Earle Jones in The Lion King. Not that these were bad casting choices, but they represented a change from olden times, for the most part.Travolta is excellent as the intrepid, resilient, and initially deluded Bolt, a canine who learns that his super powers come from within him. Why, he had the power to save Penny all along! All he had to do was click his heart together, and.. Oh, never mind. The point is, Bolt learns that help can come from unlikely sources (a cat!), and comic relief is always welcome (a hamster!) And Cyrus – who has limited screen time, compared with Travolta – is spot on as the innocent Penny, who pines for her lost pup. In fact, if it weren’t for an extended musical montage (sung by Jenny Lewis), this would have been a great movie instead of merely a very good one, but you can’t please everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Extremely entertaining - especially in 3D,"We got the opportunity to see this in a sneak preview in 3D and were very entertained. Great plot, great animation and the 3D was amazing. Sometimes felt like Bolt's head was towering over the audience. Good thing he didn't drool!All the characters were great. The pigeons were great comic relief. It's amazing the amount of detail the animators put in. Watching the way the pigeons moved their heads was entertaining in itself. Rhino and Mittens were also hilarious while having more depth as well. A lot of Rhino's great lines were in the preview but didn't exactly play out in the story the way they seemed like they were going to. Even with that, he was hilarious. Obviously the plot is predictable but it's a very fun story. We were laughing out loud throughout this movie.Skip Bond and see Bolt.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lassie has a Truman show's syndrome,"Bolt is Walt-Disney animation feature that tells the adventures of Bolt, a dog actor, and his quest to find his master after a series of events brings him to the other part of the USA.The story uses well-known traditional stories, a dog going back to his owner after traveling hundreds of miles, and the story of a character that believes the world that surrounds him is real and not built to make him believe so. In fact, you find the same elements in the old classic Lassie, and in the modern classic The Truman's Show. In that regard, Bolt is a revamped Lassie with a Truman's syndrome. These elements are well mixed and twisted to create an original, enjoyable and humorous adventure of love, faith, and identity.I found the first minutes, with puppy Bolt adorable. Then, I was quite irritated with the first minutes of the action movie, until the original story starts. So, if you don't feel appealed by the James-Bond-ish persecution, just wait a few minutes and give the movie a chance.The characters are very likable, especially Rhino the overweight excitable hamster, masterfully voiced by Mark Walton, the mater-of-fact but helpful cat Mittens, voiced by Susie Essman, and the several groups of pigeons that appear in the movie, which I found hilarious. Bolt's sweet confused character is voiced by an almost unrecognizable John Travolta, while sweet Penny is voiced by another unrecognizable Miley Cyrus. In fact, all the dubbing is terrific.The animation is very good, especially the gorgeous mate-painting backgrounds, which portrait with accuracy and lyricism the diversity of the USA's landscapes, and make the trip through the country real and believable. Some of the details of the vegetation are just amazing, as well the landscaping layout, house architecture, the colors, and a magnificent lighting. The drawing of the leading characters is just OK, a little bit chunky and lacking in detail and limited movement for both Bolt and Mittens. However, the ensemble is very good, and the dubbing helps tremendously to make the characters come to life.An lovely family film with great animation, entertaining plot, characters and soundtrack",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Truly A Disney Film!,"I can't remember any film produced by Disney that I ever disliked. Every movie they made, whether it's Pixar or not, is a great movie to watch. Bolt is no exception. In fact, this brings Disney to another level.This film is about the bonds of friendship between Bolt, a ""superdog"" and Penny, a young actress. Bolt thinks he has super powers but he he obviously does not. He realizes that when he takes a cross-country trek with a mangy cat and a weird hamster to save his human companion.I guess you could say the voiceovers are great. John Travolta and Miley Cyrus certainly did a good job.I liked the music in this film. I shouldn't be surprised because Travolta did star in Grease thirty years ago. The duet with Cyrus is a great song.This movie deserved to win some bigtime awards. The only reason this did not happen because Wall-E overshadowed this film.This is one of the best Disney animated films this decade. Actually, most of them are great animations. Anyway, I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Couldn't Get Into The Characters Or Voice Of The Dog,"I find most animated films of late to be very entertaining. The best are the ones with a lot of humor. There are exceptions to that (""The Polar Express,"" for example) but humor seems to go hand-in-hand with animated feature films.I say all of the above because this Disney animated film, ""Bolt,"" wasn't too funny. Thus, at least for me, I didn't think this was involving and entertaining enough for me to care about the story much after the first half hour. I didn't find the characters appealing nor the story and I thought the graphics were overrated.I disagree with most of the national film critics who thought this was great. ""Penny,"" voiced by Miley Cyrus, was a bit aggravating and John Travolta doing the dog's voice was just too weird. Maybe I'm just not used to hearing Travolta's voice on animated films, but it just did not sound right here. It would up being a distraction from the story, and I see other reviewers here agree with me on that one.They lost me early on when the dog was shipped a long way in a box with no room to breathe, no air holes, and yet.....no problem. Hey, I know it's just fiction and a fun, animated movie but let's have some sense of realism on things like that.I'm normally easy to please with animated stuff, so it's unusual for me to be disappointed as I was with this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The Incredible Journey...of a Dog, a Cat and a Hamster","After numerous duds, Disney has finally brought some quality entertainment on screen. Perhaps John Lasseter had a lot to do with it. The animation is similar to that of Pixar, detailed, vivacious and colourful. The story moves at a steady pace and even though it isn't anything new, it has its own charm and the adventurous feel. I loved the characters Bolt, Mittens and Rhino. They form a very entertaining trio. Travolta, Essman and Walton are great together. The Penny character is clichéd and Miley Cyrus's bad voice acting doesn't help much but thankfully she's not the main lead. I am also additionally glad that none of her songs appeared in her soundtrack other than the one she terribly sang with Travolta. The pigeons were laugh-out-loud hilarious. I loved how they moved their heads in a darting motion. If one took notice, the three pigeons in the beginning move differently from the three that appear in the end. 'Bolt' is the Disney movie that one has been waiting for. It's probably been ages since they have had a winner (the last one being 'Lilo and Stitch'?) and it's good to see them back with something solid.",,Anonymous,Animation
A fun time even if it's a little cliche,"Many people have said that Disney Animation Studios had a second fallow period after the great Renaissance in the 1990s and prior to the second Renaissance in the 2010s. Bolt was one of many films that didn't exactly light audiences on fire, and it's understandable why it might have struggled. The lost dog traveling a long distance to reunite with his owner is nothing new, and you can't say that Bolt was a film that broke much new ground in its other plot points. In fact, the other part of the plot (the character who is living in a fantasy and can't accept the truth of his place in the world) is just a rehash of Toy Story almost beat for beat. Yet despite the familiar tropes it utilizes, I still kind of like it. For one thing, I love dogs, so I certainly found some moments between Bolt and Penny in this movie that warmed my heart. Sure, I would rather a movie glorify someone finding a pet at a shelter and adopting them while villainizing pet stores which typically use puppy mills, instead of the other way around. But there's no denying how cute Bolt is in this film, and the animators nailed the mannerisms of a typical dog quite well.The premise of the movie is one that I like and hate in equal measure. On the one hand, that opening sequence alone was great and they could have easily made an entire movie that legitimately was about a super-powered dog saving the day. On the other hand, the concept of maintaining the illusion so a dog performer would give an authentic performance was simply ludicrous. Even if they could have all the special effects work on cue while filming and could shoot multiple big stunts back-to-back-to-back, there's simply no way they could predict how the dog would react. It's just so dumb that my brain struggles to accept anything else in the film. But I know this is all intended as entertainment for young people, so I try hard to just let go and enjoy myself. Somehow I was able to do that through most of Bolt, when I don't have as much success with other animated films. There's just a lot of heart in this movie, and it connects with me on some level. Admittedly, the dog thing still might be a big part of my enjoyment, but for whatever reason I laugh and have a good time throughout Bolt, even if others think it's one of Disney's lesser efforts.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Alright Disney Experimental era film,"Bolt is the Disney experimental era film that focuses on the dog named Bolt who stars as an action star of his own show but he doesn't know it is a show. One day he accidentally gets transported across the country and gets a reality check. I find Bolt has a similar journey Buzz Lightyear had in the first Toy Story. They believe they are one thing but the events that were laid out to them made them have a reality check that lets them come back better than before. It is like Illumination's The Secret Life of Pets duology in that it is about pets and what it means to be a pet. Comparing Bolt to the Secrets Life of Pets and Toy Story 4, you could see how computer animation has evolved. Lighting has gotten better. Animating humans seems to have gotten better. What interests me in watching all these computer animated films is that I could see how computer animation has evolved. It gradually evolves over time. That could expand to animation as a whole as hand drawn animation seems to become smoother over time. As well, disney is the biggest animation studio and has been going on for 90 years. I do prefer films from the Renaissance and the Revival era would be a close second for me when it comes to all the eras of Disney.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Only Dog Movie Saved By A Cat,"The premise of this movie isn't very appealing.

That's the only way to make sure that he will display the real and raw emotions, the audience loves so much about the show.The movie really starts to get funny, when by some accident Bolt is shipped to New York and - for the first time in his life on his own - has to get back to L.

In the last chapter, ""Bolt"" is getting highly dramatic and emotional.""Bolt"" is surprisingly well made. It might seem like a by the numbers plot, but hardly ever do those numbers add up as well as they do here. This is obviously the work of highly professional people who loved what they were doing and wanted to do it as good as possible. In retrospect, they were pretty successful. So don't let yourself be put off by the silly premise and introduction. When Mittens, the cat appears, everything will be alright.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Slight but very charming,"The plot concerns a dog (Bolt) who doesn't realize that his entire life is just a TV show. So, when he accidentally gets lost in the real world, he cannot understand why his super-powers have disappeared. And so, until he meets a wise and worldly cat, he flounders--unable to figure out how he got there or how to get back to the little girl he loves.This is not the deepest story I have ever seen for a computer animated movie, but it was quite charming and fun--something that many other family movies could emulate. In fact, compared to previous Disney-produced CGI movies (other than those from the separate Pixar unit), BOLT is a significant improvement--both in story and in animation quality. If you don't believe this, just try watching CHICKEN LITTLE some time--it lacks the charm and universal appeal of BOLT. In other words, CHICKEN LITTLE was purely for very little kids--adults would mostly be bored by the film. MEET THE ROBINSONS was a bit of an improvement, but with BOLT I could finally enjoy the movie along with my kids.Fun, well-animated and different. While not exactly a must-see, this is a very good film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney Animation finds their footing on their thrid attempt in 3D animation,"Bolt (John Travolta) a white Swiss Shepherd is adopted by a little girl named Penny (Chloe Grace Moretz) after the two meet at an animal shelter. Five years later Bolt and the now 12 year old Penny (Miley Cyrus) now star on the hit spy-fi TV show also called Bolt where Bolt plays a superpowered dog but to maintain believability the show is staged in such a way that everything is arranged in such a way that Bolt believes it to be real. When the network heads decide the formula of the show needs to be shaken up to improve ratings, the writing staff arrange it so that Penny is kidnapped at the end of the episode in a cliffhanger ending leaving Bolt panicked and desperate to rescue her. After escaping from his trailer, Bolt is accidentally shipped to New York City where he meets a trio of Pigeons who use Bolt's ignorance of the real world to convince him that stray cat Mittens (Susie Essman) who runs a protection racket on the pigeons is involved with Penny's kidnapping. Bolt takes the reluctant Mittens on a cross country journey to help him be reunited with Penny, and along with an enthusiastic superfan of Bolt's, Rhino the hamster (Mark Walton), the trio cross the United States with Mittens dealing with Bolt's delusions and Rhino reinforcing them as Penny is pressured by the network to move on from Bolt for the sake of the show by the executives.The third CG animated feature from Walt Disney Animation studios, Bolt originally began life as a project from Lilo & Stitch director Chris Sanders titled American Dog. While American Dog shared the same central gimmick of a TV show dog leaving his scripted life and forced to confront the real world, the original intention with American Dog was intended to be more offbeat and quirky much in the same way Lilo & Stitch had been, with side characters such as a one eyed cat and radioactive rabbit making up the dog's traveling companions. While Sanders' success with Lilo & Stitch had been the impetus behind the greenlighting o American Dog, once John Lasseter took over Disney's animation division they'd attended two test screenings of American Dog and issued a series of notes suggesting story and character improvements which were resisted by Sanders. As a result Sanders was fired from the project and later transitioned to Dreamworks where he'd kick off the successful How to Train your Dragon franchise, while Chris Williams and Byron Howard took over directing duties on the project. Additionally the animation team were only given 18 months to rework the film as opposed to the usual four years. Upon release the film received the best reviews for a Disney Animation film since 2002's Lilo & Stitch and also proved a modest hit generating $310 million against its $150 million budget. Bolt marked a turning point for Disney Animation following a slump and lead to them pursuing projects such as Tangled and Frozen that allowed them to be on equal footing with Pixar. While Bolt is made from familiar parts, it's a likable movie that hits all the right beats.From the opening scene where Bolt is adopted as a puppy by the 7 year old Penny, the movie makes the best impression possible for this story in setting up an emotional core between Penny and Bolt that is successfully built up in the opening act. Once we jump ahead 5 years later with Bolt and Penny now starring in Bolt's eponymous TV show, the relationship is still very strong between them and while Bolt is tempted to play with her on multiple occasions, the nature of the show puts Bolt constantly on edge so he can't just be a dog despite Penny wanting him to. There's a lot of creativity put into how Bolt's TV show is filmed with James Lipton getting some very funny moments as the show's director which gently pokes fun at method acting taken to ridiculous extremes and Malcolm McDowell has a lot of fun as the show's antagonist Dr. Calico with him devouring the scene. Bolt does a good job of making the show within the film cheesy, but it still makes the show feel like something you could see being made for TV without doing purposefully bad acting or subpar sets putting cracks in the logic so it's considerably more subtle parody than similar attempts.John Travolta is really good as Bolt and with Travolta's natural likability as an actor he plays the good natured naivety of Bolt very well and makes for a solid protagonist worth rooting for. Mark Walton is also very funny as Rhino the hamster whose near encyclopedic knowledge of Bolt's TV show and history and makes him a funny but affectionate parody of superfans and he walks that delicate line between endearing and annoying and falls more within the former than the latter, but it's unmistakably Susie Essman as Mittens the street smart cat who reluctantly gets roped into (literally) Bolt's cross country escapades and tries to keep Bolt and Rhino at least somewhat within the realm of reality only for her words to be ignored. Miley Cyrus is also quite good as Penny and her exchanges with Bolt really make you care about their relationship and root for their reunion. There's no major surprises in Bolt nor is it explosively funny, but despite using the same buddy comedy/road movie dynamic you've seen with the likes of Brave Little Toaster or Toy Story it does create a feel that's all its own and its easy laidback pace coupled with its likable and surprisingly deep characters earns it a lot of leeway.Bolt is a sweet and likable film that uses that likability to good effect at overcoming a familiar story. The animation is really solid and expressive with detailed character models for both humans and animals, and there's some decent humor poking fun at the nature of TV and the fish out of water antics of a dog who believes fantasy is reality. The performances by Travolta, Essman, Walton, and Cyrus are very well done and math their characters quite well and it's a very heartwarming movie with a lot of likability to it. While it is unfortunate that Chris Sanders was kicked off the project that was his idea, given how some of these projects with musical director's chairs have turned out (such as Home on the Range) Bolt is far better than we should've expected.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Was expecting more...,"I felt like Bolt was a wonderful children's movie, but left nothing for adults to be entertained by. I didn't think the one-liners were very witty, nor did I think the story idea was very original.

They should have put more humor for the adults that are the majority of the audience for the film.

Disney finally puts out a winner!,"Over the past few years Disney track record in new movies has been questionable. With the exception of Meet the Robinsons (which I quite liked), Disney has done nothing but pump out rehashed ideas in the form of inane sequels to classics loved by my generation or weak under developed characters. Well not this time. I managed to see an advanced screening of this tonight with my daughter and it had both of us highly entertained. Bolt the ""super"" dog was full of funny and emotional characters the likes of which Disney has not produced in a while. And for once the comic relief characters, of which there are many, did their jobs and pulled even the slowest of moments out of the trash and send you rolling in the aisles. Rhino the hamster was my personal favorite. After seeing this movie all my daughter could say was how awesome it was and ask if we could see it again. I had to remind her that it actually does not come out until next week. Well to sum it up I would recommend to children young and old and while I have not seen it yet in 3D I plan too because it was easy to see that 3D is going to make the movie even more exciting.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

It made you feel like you were right there helping out Bolt and his friends. The character traits and development were well done. From the pigeons of New York to the pigeons in California every character had their own special personality. The graphics were superb and it made you feel as if the movie was real. John Travolta does the voice of Bolt. I wasn't sure if at first he was a good choice, but he made Bolt his own. Miley Cyrus was really good as the voice of Penny. She did well and her timing was great, but the real character that made this movie was Rhino the Hamster. He steals every scene and you and your kids will be quoting his lines for weeks to come.

"Not quite a Disney classic, but one of Disney's better films of the 00s","I have been a big Disney fan all my life. After quite a solid Renaissance, with only Hercules and Pocahontas lacking that extra Disney magic, the Disney movies of the 00s have been mixed. Emperor's New Groove and Lilo and Stitch were great, on the other hand Home on the Range and Chicken Little were forced, predictable and forgettable.Bolt did have me interested, but I wasn't as enthused with the initial casting of Miley Cyrus, who I can't stand. Actually in the movie, she does okay and her character is quite cute.While it is far from amazing and far from a Disney classic like Beauty and the Beast, Pinocchio, The Lion King, Bambi and Sleeping Beauty, Bolt is one of the better Disney movies of the 00s. It does have its rushed and predictable spots, especially with the ending, and the human characters excepting Penny aren't as appealing and aren't given as much attention to detail as they ought to have done.But what does compensate are some stunning animation with excellent character design, amazing colours and beautiful background art, a rousing soundtrack, a fast-paced and heart-warming story overall and witty scripting. The voice work is top notch, while John Travolta is suitably eloquent as the title character the real plaudits go to Susie Essman as the best character of the movie Mittens and Malcolm McDowell as Dr.Calico.In conclusion, a surprisingly enjoyable family movie and one of the better Disney efforts to come out so far in this millennium. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Other 2008 Animated Movie,"In 2008, the Best Animated Picture Oscar race was one for the ages. At one end there was one of Pixar's best: ""Wall-E"". On the other end was one of DreamWorks best: ""Kung Fu Panda. These were two landmark films that left a lasting impact in the world of animation and in film. ""Wall-E"" became the first film entered in the Criterion collection, and ""Kung Fu Panda"" went on to be a billion-dollar franchise. ""Bolt"" was the third film nominated that year. It... also exists.This still marks the time where Disney's computer animation was still struggling to get a hold. They had ""Dinosaurs"", ""Chicken Little"" and ""Meet the Robinsons"". This one marks some improvement for the studio, but yet to have them get their rebirth that came after ""Tangled"".This film may have failed to leave much of an impact, critically or financially, but did it deserve such an underwhelming reception? Pretty much, yeah.It may not be as bad as the concept looks like from the trailer. A talking dog voiced by John Travolta and the owner voice by Miley Cyrus isn't a combination that sounds primed for high art. The movie does have some legitimate laughs. Some good jokes about the filming industry and solid gags from the title Dog thinking he has superpowers lead to some good moments. The back and forth between the hopeful Bolt and cynical cat, Mittens, is where the main meat of the movie comes from.But on the negative side, the movie is very by the numbers, not many surprises to be had. In fact, the premise of a dog who thought he was a crime fighter, but it was just a TV show was the same premise as two other Disney properties. Both ""Rescue Rangers"" and ""101 Dalmatians 2"" has already used this same set up.The movie loses its momentum as they get to their final act. Every time the movie cut to Miley Cyrus's Penny it becomes less interesting. And the movie has not just one, but two tragic misunderstandings that lead to character break ups.The movie isn't anything special, but for what it is, it's fine. Nothing to go out of your way and see, but if the kids like talking dog movies, there are a lot worse out there.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Locked Door,"This is a children's film in the modern mold. That means it has to have cinematic values that effect and impress, and at the same time sport an acceptable message. Usually it about the value of family and finding self; here it is both. That means that these films have a built in bicameral tension, one foot in the future, danger, adventure and the other in manufactured notions of domestic comfort.Regular readers know that I am a student of folded narrative, a simple example being what we have here: a film world within a filmed ""real world."" There are all sorts of narrative advantages that result from this device and they seem to work better when the film is animated. Something about acknowledged abstraction. The tip-off is in the first seconds where you see that the girl is redheaded.Supposing you can tolerate or are immune to the dangerous ""message,"" this will be great fun.There's a sort of metastory here, like that one of fifty years ago when Disney changed the nature of cinema everywhere. Here it is Pixar  and specifically John Lassiter, changing film AND Disney.Pixar has three signatures; you can see them all here plus a quote.The first is the obvious: the ability to render and move three dimensional characters in ways that more acutely convey the dramatic effects. All of these ways have their origin in ordinary theater well before film. But here they are engineered to be conveyed in ways impossible with real humans.Pixar was the first and for a long time the only animation studio to actually worry about the story. Disney now in this does as well.Pixar still is the gold standard for experimenting with the use of space. I mean that both in the sense of framing the scene physically and with the camera. The combination of the two is especially advanced. As with the acting, the goal is to do things that work and enhance the goals of the narrative, but which are not physically possible with ""real"" sets and cameras. You can see that used here, especially in the movie-within chase scenes at the beginning, which notably are more extreme than the rest in all three of these values.Quite apart from the general Pixar influence, you can see it in each of the three script teams.The basic script team owns the story with the pretty sophisticated notions of folding and redheads.The comic script team owns the gerbil. He's probably a quarter of the film and 80% of the laughs. You can see his importance in the folding as well: when you do something as here (where one character is ""bolted"" in/into two folds), you need to have an observer who similarly spans the two. Hence the gerbil. But then he was turned over to the comic team.You can also see the influence of a third team, which I am sure came from Pixar. They own the pigeons. There are three main groups of three, plus others scattered around. Their rendering and motion can be traced all the way back to ""For the Birds."" All their jokes are Pixar in-jokes. All their mannerisms are more nuanced, and I imagine that they were actually used in educating the Disney crowd. In true selfreferential style, they left references in.For instance, when we first meet some pigeons we see the theatrical personalities in their head cocking. Then they talk about it and instruct Bolt in how to hold his head (to extricate from a fence). Later, we see a similar tutorial from the cat to the same character for begging. Students of animation will know this as an exercise to move Disney away from their similar keynote scene in ""Lady and the Tranp"" of 50 years ago.There's the Nemo joke, tied to aliens and when we first see aliens in the ""new"" film within, it uses a shot taken, yes, from Nemo which in turn is patterned after Ridley Scott's film. Not ""Alien"" exactly but ""Bladerunner.""Check out how the ""moviewriter"" pigeons send one off to get whole grain (which is not whole wheat) and how that is mirrored in the all-important introduction of Mittens.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Animation
The end of an era,"This film marks the end of a short era in the 2000s when Disney was experimenting with ideas that departed from their classic fairytale formula.

The premise is definitely unique, I'll give it that.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Paint By Number Of Highest Quality,"Although this largely is a ""been there, done that"" experience, it manages to be very entertaining throughout and even a bit moving in the right places. Says something of the developers involved i suppose. Quite reminiscent of films like Ice Age and Finding Nemo, parents wont mind seeing this, in fact they might chuckle as much as the little ones.Its about this dog (Bolt) that is made to believe he has super-powers in order to extract the best performance in a action-filled TV-show. When through an accident he is separated from his beloved co star, the girl Penny, he naturally starts to search for her. Assuming that she has been kidnapped by evildoers. Along the way he encounters some seriously funny (albeit somewhat annoying) characters that help him in his quest, with becomes as much a tale of self-discovery. Its definitely better then Finding Nemo, i mean, that one didn't have any character development at all, but its also a bit derative.First i figured i would give it an 8 but then i figured it isn't memorable enough for such a grade, even if its of highest quality.

"Wow, this is Disney at it's best","Now don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of animation and I loved recent films like WALL-E and Kung Fu Panda, but this one is without doubt the best animated film this year or the last.Bolt is a hilarious, funny, sometimes sad and incredibly enjoyable film. The characters are highly memorable and the story far more engaging and exciting than most other animations, yes WALL-E included.It carries the classic elements of a children's story, combined with a modern day setting. Think Dick King Smith's 'Find the white horse' mixed with 'The Incredibles' and that gives you a scope of the feel of this film.Without doubt this is a classic that brings back Disney's claim to fame. The plot is clever, with several homages to earlier Disney films and will keep you engaged all the way through unlike in WALL-E or Kung Fu Panda, which are both brilliant (The latter more so) but have some scenes where you want to leave the cinema quickly and go buy more sweets until the good stuff comes back.WALL-E will beat this film in rating (Thought this one deserved to be better) for the simple reason that more people will pay attention to a film about a little lost robot, than a film about a dog who thinks he has superpowers. Go into the cinema, with an open mind and no prejudice, i.e. 'said film' is better so I refuse to enjoy this!and you'll see exactly what I mean. Trust me I didn't think it would be good but Wow was I wrong.This is an excellent film with none of those, 'Geez i'm glad the kids didn't understand that joke' moments which makes it all the better than films that try to sneak those in every so often. Bolt is awesome!I wont give you any spoilers other than rhino the hamster is hilarious and all three of the main characters will make you laugh out loud, I've never been in a cinema with so many people laughing before! Long story short, watch this film, trust me, it's engaging where others are not, its funny and the characters are lovable. This is Disney's best yet, that includes anything PIXAR have done and deserves to win whatever awards it's nominated for. Great for kids and adults alike, you wont be disappointed.

"Bolt is another animated hit from Disney and features a dog, a cat, a hamster, and a sweet-hearted young actress....","Bolt is another animated hit from Disney and features a dog, a cat, a hamster, and a sweet-hearted young actress. This feature is about a loyal young dog who uses his super powers to protect his owner from the forces of the evil green-eyed man. However, early in the film, the audience finds out that the poor pup is being tricked into believing he has super powers by the movie studio so that his acting will be more realistic for their hit action show. It takes an unlikely pair in a cynical alley cat and an obnoxious hamster to help him realize his value as a regular dog. The animation is quite good, but the 3D doesn't add much in my opinion. The CGI is plenty good by itself with its crisp and clean realism and its bright colors and lighting. John Travolta, Miley Cyrus, Susie Essman, and Mark Walton's voices are perfect for the characters, especially Essman's as Mittens, the cat. The soundtrack is good, but too much attention is being paid to ""I Thought I Lost You"" by Travolta and Cyrus, which was recently nominated for a Golden Globe. Instead, one of the highlights of the movie is when Jenny Lewis's ""Barking At The Moon"" plays during an especially sentimental sequence.

The protagonist is quite naive to believe that he really is a superdog, but on his journey back home he learns what it is to be a common dog, but without leaving aside the love he has for Penny.

Disney learns from its past mistakes. Great!,"Yes, it has seems that the comeback of good-quality family movies from Disney is near. Having learned their mistakes from duds such as Underdog and The Shaggy Dog, Disney presents to you ANOTHER dog movie... but wait! This is a whole lot different and better in every aspect. Taking a new premise with a predictable story is no surprise, but the filmmakers add heart and soul to it, thus making it another Disney classic.Take the characters for instance. Their designs and voices are so convincing to the audience; it makes them cute and lovable as ever, and makes you just want to hug them. Travolta adds likability to the title role, and surprisingly, so does Miley Cyrus as Bolt's owner/co-star Penny. Susie Essman adds wit to her feline character and that hamster is just very funny.The cinematography is great, the special effects a treat for the eyes, and the music score by John Powell is rousing. (Coincidentally, during Bolt's ""mission"" in the beginning, Powell's score contains shades of his Bourne scores).Overall, a pleasant surprise from Disney and definitely a step up.

An enjoyable family adventure,"Bolt and his owner Penny are superheroes, thank to a treatment from Penny's dad, Bolt has powers greater than your average dog and endlessly has to use them in big action sequences. Or at least, this is what he thinks. The reality is that none of it is real and it is just a TV show, with the facade kept up to ensure Bolt gives a great ""performance"" each week. Chance separates Bolt from Penny though and sees him accidentally shipped to the other side of North America. Once free from his packaging ""prison"", Bolt surmises that this is the work of his nemesis and sets out to locate and rescue Penny. The other animals he involves in his quest meanwhile, wonder how to break the news to him that he is, well, just a dog.There is a downside associated with Pixar making so many good animated films and that is that the bar is raised so high that ""good"" films are judged harshly against criteria that they weren't really setting out to achieve. This happened to Bolt, although it fairness it doesn't help itself in the comparison stakes by essentially being the Buzz Lightyear part of the Toy Story films. It ended up being criticised for its lack of depth for adults and how the sentiment is just that, rather than emotion. This is perhaps unfair because Bolt came out in the same sort of year as Wall-E did, the latter film dominating all before it and rightly so.What Bolt delivers is a plot that allows for comparatively simpler emotion that is just about enough for adults without being too much for children, the message is simple and it is delivered well. The majority of the film though is about comedy and action. It opens with a greatly inflated action sequence from one of the bolt TV episodes that shows good awareness of the action-movie genre and entertains as such. From here it goes the familiar path of self-realisation along Bolt road trip back to Hollywood and this aspect is perhaps not as complex or as engaging as it could have been but at least it is entertaining. Most of this comes from the side characters as Bolt himself drives the plot more than the laughs. The animation is impressive of course and the direction is good, again with its visual references to other things and also the delivery of shots that would not be possible in ""real"" action. I saw it in 2D so I can't comment on the 3D effects.The voices are good although the stars don't really steal the show as they can do. Travolta isn't anything special but does the job as Bolt without bringing a lot to the character that isn't delivered by the animators. Cyrus is OK and gets to sing the song in the film as well. Essman and of course Walton are the real good turns though, mostly due to them having the better material  likewise the pigeons, who are all good characters. McDowell, Bader, Lipton and a few others add colour but have smaller roles.Bolt is not Wall-E and in fairness it should not be judged by that yardstick. However, what it is is an enjoyable family film that delivers a good plot, great animation and regular laughs  and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Not exactly a shocker, ""Bolt"" is a great family film","Things haven't exactly been great for Disney animation sans Pixar lately, so while it may be a surprise to you when I say that ""Bolt"" restores some faith to Disney's silver screen products, it shouldn't be a surprise that it was produced by John Lasseter, the man behind Pixar.""Bolt"" is not just some bizarre plot concoction like ""Chicken Little"" or ""Meet the Robinsons"" were. It's an adventure, action and friendship story that works like any good Disney film used to: with heart-warming and lovable characters as well as some silly ones. It appeals to boys with the action, girls with animals and a female human protagonist, and of course enough jokes to keep adults entertained (although this is its weakest area.)Bolt, voiced by John Travolta in sadly his best role in recent memory, is the star of an action TV show, but he's been groomed to believe the world of his show is reality. When producers demand more from the show, the plot has Penny, Disney teen sensation Miley Cyrus (a smart call on Disney's part), Bolt's co-star and owner, kidnapped. Only Bolt believes it's real and escapes into the real world to find her. To make things tough, Bolt gets shipped to New York, across the country. He befriends some critters of course, a cat and a hamster, while learning tough real world lessons on the way.The concept alone is smart when you think about it. Smart at least in the bankable sense. Superhero action movie, combined with animals, combined with an adventure that seeks to reunite two separated friends. It's like rolling ""The Incredibles,"" ""Toy Story"" and ""Homeward Bound"" all together. Genius. The script is really quite genuine and touching, though not as humorous. It's much more geared for families and that's nice to see for once. No serious under-the-radar adult jokes. Perhaps the best line of the movie is one that directly references Pixar's ""Finding Nemo.""Disney plays it safe with ""Bolt."" If Pixar does all the riskier, more unique films, perhaps Disney animation can get away with good old formula stuff. That's definitely okay, especially if they have as much heart as ""Bolt"" does.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another awesome Disney film.,"BOLTI am a huge Disney fan... but had never seen this one before.It did not disappoint... I loved it.It is about a dog who is an actor in a TV show, but he doesn't know he is acting. He believes everything that is happening and even believes he has super powers... until he escapes the set to rescue his owner and discovers he is a normal dog.The story was really good, pretty much a typical Disney film. It had action, adventure, sadness, happiness and fun! The only thing this film didn't have which is always expected from a Disney film was songs... there were no singing and dancing in this film at all.The voices were provided by John Travolta and Miley Cyrus. I couldn't actually tell if Miley was the voice of a cat or the little girl. But John Travoltas voice is unforgettable. You knew his voice as soon as his character spoke.This is a great Disney film, but it is not as good as a lot of the other classics. Disney lost it's touch a little bit. They made amazing films like The Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty & The Beast, The Little Mermaid to name a few... but unfortunately they don't seem to be as good as those any more. They pulled it back with The Princess & The Frog and Tangled which were awesome.

Exceptional!,"I think the title of this review, in my opinion, sums up Bolt in one word. The adorable characters and the action-packed sequences left your emotions going all over the place in this one of a kind animated adventure.The outline story is about a dog, but this dog is slightly different from the rest, he is a legend of the small screen as the star of his own TV show, Bolt; a super-dog that will do all it takes to protect his owner and best friend, Penny. There is just one big problem, Penny is Bolt's actual real owner, who never gets any time with Bolt outside filming for the TV show, and Bolt believes that the show that he stars in is actually for real. He believes he has superpowers and is always on the looking out stop the 'green-eyed' villain from getting hold of Penny.One day in film production, a scene featuring Penny being kidnapped by the bad guys sends Bolt running out of the studio and going to look for Penny believing that she really has been kidnapped.The film sees Bolt in the real world (where he has no super powers) and discovers who he really is. Along the way he 'captures' a cat (who he sees as a villain) called Mittens, and bumps into a rather hyper-active hamster (Rhino).The films has a mix of genres, and Rhino provides a lot of funny dialogue, which works really well.Another treat in this film is that you can see it in 3D, and it really makes it so much more realistic, I loved how the 3D made the action sequences so realistic. at you from the screen, one bit that really sticks in my mind was the syringe coming at you! I would definitely recommend seeing it in 3D.However, there is one thing that, for me personally, made this fantastic. From what I've heard and read many people have said that it was 'hilarious' and a great animated comedy. For me, I don't think the comedy was the best bit. What I really liked about this film was that it had heart. I loved watching Bolt making discoveries about himself that he never knew about (e.g. the window on the trailer scene) which was full of warmth, music in these scenes in particular worked very well indeed. It left you feeling really emotional. But then it was a scene near the end that really did it for me, after all the action, the heart and determination of Bolt really did bring a tear to my eye, something I don't think any other animated film has ever done. Was it the 3D that made it so realistic (you could almost feel Bolt's fur) or the great work done on the animation, a combination of both? Never have I come out of an animated film feeling so emotional. Before seeing this film I read a quote from the chief creative officer of Disney animated studios who said that he believed in the words of Walt Disney himself ""for every laugh, there should be a tear"". They got it spot on in 'Bolt'.Overall, I can't express enough how awesome 'Bolt' is. By far I would recommend you see this one of a kind film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Cute dog, good animation","Bolt is a Hollywood star of a spy thriller TV show. The interesting thing is that Bolt doesn't know the show is fake. He believes he's an engineered superdog in reality. When Bolt gets accidentally shipped to NYC, he must travel cross country back to the studio.It's got a cute dog and a workable premise. Although a dog with real superpowers would probably work even better in today's superhero obsessed movie world. The constant superpower delusion does get a little tired. It goes from being cute to making the dog look stupid.Eventually, he does figure it out. The movie needed it. It's not going to win any awards but the quality is there to compete.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Makes a change to see a kids film that was good.,"Being a mom means you have to take the kids to the cinema. Over the past couple of years I have seen some awful films, Monster House and Cars are two that come to mind.Bolt, to be honest I wasn't looking forward to seeing it, but I am glad I did, I loved it, it wasn't overly preachy or sentimental. It was well paced and didn't try to be something it wasn't. There were no innuendo jokes that were there for the parents and the thing I did notice was that the parents were laughing a long with the children.Some wonderful lines, good animal characterisation, and a kick-ass hamster. What more could you ask for.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Delightful!,"Oh, how utterly delightful! This is a film young and old can enjoy!Apart from the great animation, the film tells a really good story. The underlying theme is friendship and loyalty. This is a cute story of an actor dog believing his movie world is real. When he finally discovers the truth, the film is sort of a coming of age story - of a dog!There's lots of action, adventure, suspense, humor and plenty of emotion. The action is fast-paced and the humor is really funny. And Bolt is one of the cutest dogs around! Absolutely adorable! I love this film!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good day guaranteed!,"Ridonculous! Bolt has the audience in the pad of his paw from beginning to end.A white American shepherd who plays a hit TV series' superdog hero, Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) leads a Truman Show life: he thinks his superpowers are real and believes that his sci-fi adventures with his person Penny (Miley Cyrus) are serious. When Bolt accidentally strays from the confines of his studio lot world, he embarks on a real-life quest to find his person and protect her from the evil Dr. Calico. He gets into true-to-life troubles himself, encountering genuine characters along the way: a trio of pigeons, Mittens the alley cat (Susie Essman) and fan-hamster Rhino (Mark Walton). Ally McBeal's Greg Germann provides the voice for Penny's scheming Agent, while The Drew Carey Show's Diedrich Bader is the voice for the Veteran Cat.It may be executive-produced by Pixar's John Lasseter and has tinges of his comedy stylings, but Bolt is fully a Disney creation. Having Lasseter on board ensures that the adults in the audience will probably have an even better time than the kids. The animation is impressive, as it delivers the drama and emotion, as well as the laughs and the Fully Awesome action! It would just be really difficult not to smile and swoon at Bolt and his sidekicks. Watch it and have a good day guaranteed!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Different movies bolted into one,"This is three entirely different movies bolted into one. The extended opening sequence shows Bolt as the superhero in a sci-fi TV action programme, with lots of shooting, explosions, creepy characters and military hardware, and is far too scary and aggressive for young children.Then there's an extended Bolt-in-Hollywood section, with lots of nods to the adults, in which virtually everyone is cynical and extremely unsympathetic, while Bolt with his delusional pumped-up ego also was hard to warm to. The (in-)jokes simply weren't funny, and everything left such a sour taste in the mouth that I switched the movie off after 38 minutes... my two kids (10 and 7) didn't protest, which says something.I later watched the rest alone to be able give this movie a fair review, and discovered the lengthy cute though also rather predictable middle section, which is suitable for younger kids, but probably would bore the over 10s. The end section is a kind of Frankenstein attempt to bolt all elements together, and in doing so tries to be all things to all people, and rather predictably failed. The movie is beautifully drawn, but the story simply does not hold together, and only the hamster provided some laughs.Finally, is it just me or is an obsession with military hardware and uniforms and violence beginning to creep into all American children's' movies? The relentless exposure of kids (and adults) to military-style footage, costumes, weapons, communication, language, action, etc implicitly legitimises war. IMDb's Parents Guide section, with its endless lists of ""facts"" without providing any context, also has has become totally useless in warning us which kids' movies glorify the military and violence, and which don't. ""Arthur Christmas"" is another example: no warning whatsoever that Santa's exploits are presented like a military operation, complete with flak jackets and the lot.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A welcome eye opener to where the animated film industry may be headed.,"It's getting to the point now where, introducing the latest three-dimensional feature with an introductory paragraph relating to the history and general makeup of the 3D movie is becoming redundant. In today's cinematic climate, it is quickly becoming common to see 3D glasses being handed out every month or so; for those of us who have shared in the gimmick up until now, it's not exactly a promising sign, but it's a product of change we must accept nevertheless. Yet there are reasons as to why I always discuss the similarities between such features before going into details and that is simply because, like many other subgenres such as the ""J-horror"", the 3D movie usually sticks to traits which work as a deterrent to entertainment. Sure, the images are stark and glossy- they pop out at us and briefly take us aback, but then we slowly begin to realise that everything behind all this glitter is ironically flat. Of course, there have been rare exceptions to this general rule of thumb, and yet most seem to the stick to the same adage of your average 3D attraction at theme parks; distract first- tell a 'story' second.Then there's Bolt; Disney's latest animated feature touting anthropomorphised melodrama aimed at kids but not completely useless for adults. They're been doing it for a while now, but not necessarily in ""true 3D"". As a somewhat sophomoric experiment for Disney, one would expect Bolt to be hard pressed in finding its feet, and yet this is thankfully not the case. Instead, those guys from the Magic Kingdom have delivered a 3D experience that although suffering from many defects- at least doesn't pander to the technology that drives it. Indeed, rather than tell a story that feels weak and formulated for the sake of dazzling, Bolt dazzles through its characters and story which although comes off as tiresomely derivative and predictable at its worst moments, at least delivers on something other than cheap sparkle distractions. The result is a heart-warming experience that engages for the most part in a traditional manner whilst providing some awesome sequences for the eyeballs to chew up all the same. It certainly isn't perfect, no, but it's a fine effort nevertheless and a welcome eye opener to where the animated film industry may be headed.For all intents and purposes however, it 's certainly worth noting that while Bolt certainly does offer a breathtaking and very impressive tour de force of animation technology, the spectacle of the movie could still be just as effective in regular two-dimensional rendering. The movie's plot which centres around a brainwashed dog who goes astray in the real world only to find out he's not what he thought he was, is the first and foremost attraction to what is on offer here. Following a sweet, albeit overly familiar Buzz Lightyear complex of realizing your disillusions have been brought on by outside forces (here, they are represented by the special effects of Hollywood), Bolt tells a story that works on a literal and very touching, emotive manner for those less occupied with the intellect; granted, the pacing is irregular throughout act two which mostly follows a mundanely formulated animal-buddies-road-trip structure, but bookends one and three deliver many punches that never feel as cheap as those moments within the middle. Most importantly however, children will love it; it's sweet, funny, thrilling, slapstick and emotionally rewarding.For all the more reserved of viewers however, perhaps escorting the little ones to the cinema selflessly, Bolt isn't a misfire by any means. Sure, around half of the aforementioned qualities won't do much to invigorate the senses, yet the movie does well to work in a simple, albeit welcome allegory of disillusionment caused by the glitter and glare of TV screens, movies and celebrity magazines. In a sense I was taken aback when I was suddenly thinking about Fight Club in all its counterculture, frustration-and-disappointment-through-false-expectation thematic material, but pleased all the same. That's not to say that Bolt in any way starts overtly preaching or giving lessons on the crushing realities of life in the manner to which Fincher did ten years back; no, here the moral is closer to that of The Wizard of Oz than Jack's gloomy existentialist nightmare, yet it's this fine blend of intellectual substance loosely tying together a soft, sugary story that makes Bolt a much more rewarding experience than your average tepid animated fare.As previously mentioned, the aesthetics present here are wonderful; in fact, I feel no unease at claiming Bolt to be the best looking 3D animated film to date. Sure, it's a niche market at this point in time, but that doesn't detract from some of the movie's breathtakingly crisp action sequences that test the medium to its capabilities. The performers do a fine job too; it's nothing as remarkable as everything that surrounds them, but most do a fine job with what they are given and never succumb to the distant numbness sometimes associated with big stars playing polygon puppets.Conclusively I must reiterate that while Bolt does have its fair share of wonderful moments, a distinct lack of such during the movie's middle act inevitably hurts the momentum and overall impact of its greater parts. Nevertheless, those looking for a heart-driven tale filled with sweet characters, thrilling action and some genuinely laugh out loud gags, could certainly do a whole lot worse than taking a trip to catch Bolt. That being said, it's also a testament to the movie that I didn't grumble on and on about the evils of that often flat third dimension; Bolt showcases the idea that 3D can be more than a cheap gimmick to sell tickets. Instead it offers such technology as a well intended after-thought that only adds rather than detracts to the real reasons we as audiences sit down to watch movies in the first place.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,Animation
Just another cartoon...,"OK... so I am not one to go to the cinema to watch animation films and I really am against this trend of paying ransom money to hear the voices of so-called superstars but there was nothing else at the time and so I had no choice !

"Better than I was expecting. Cute, sometimes touching.","Bolt- The canine star Bolt (John Travolta) of a fictional sci-fi/action show that believes his powers are real embarks on a cross country trek to save his co-star human Penny (Miley Cyrus) from a threat he believes is just as real. Basically it's ""Underdog"" meets ""The Truman Show"", but there is nothing new under the sun, so no sense beating it up for that. I was expecting a snooze fest only palatable for small children, who will delight in this by the way. I was mistaken. Though the premise is shaky, with obvious plot holes as big as you like (Since when do Dogs act?), it's a sweet little movie, and the kids won't care. The humor is pretty broad but there's something for everyone.John Travolta, an actor I haven't liked in quite some time, gives a genuinely cute performance as a young dog coming to grips with reality. Miley Cyrus also gives a decent performance. It's nice to hear Susie Essman (Here playing the cat Mittens) without the trademark F-bombs dropped in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"". Who is absolutely wonderful, and I doubt I'm alone on this one, is the little couch potato hamster Rhino (Mark Walton, who has made his career with this). He's an obsessive fanboy of Bolt's TV show, and has such aplomb and over-enthusiasm that he steals every scene he's in, and probably the entire movie too. He's probably my favorite ""side character"" in years.It's a nice film, with decent laughs and some fun action sequences. Once it sheds the convoluted TV show premise the film is allowed the breathe and have more fun. While it's hardly in the ranks of WALL-E, The Incredibles or Ratatouille, it's still a fun movie.

I guess it was a good thing that I didn't even know it was him right away. The characters integrate into the plot nicely and the action is fast-paced without rushing anything. There is some exciting cartoon action sequences that can only be pulled off by computer animation that will keep the kids excited and the drama high.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
neh...,Hmmmmmmmmm... definitely not what I expected. Good story. Good characters. Good graphics and use of 3D. But for some reason the movie falls short of being one of the better animated movies.

Good entertainment if a little complicated,Bolt is surprisingly complex and involving. I expected to take the kids and then sleep but I enjoyed it more than them - the kids are very bright but still found the idea of a superdog who isn't a superdog but still thinks he's a superdog a little too much...However by the time Bolt gets to New York that was all sorted out and they enjoyed the movie - especially Rhino the Hamster who was funny.Good animation throughout and lots of adventure and excitement make this easy viewing (I'm not convinced it is really worth an Oscar nomination though) there is a lot to see and take in but we were surprised at how developed the plot was.All in all a fun movie with some good moments!,6.0,Anonymous,Animation

I soon became bored of the dull speech and could have written down what was going to happen, after watching a dozen other Disney films.The only really well made part of the film was the animation itself, which, apart from a few continuity errors which you would've thought would've been noticed, was very good and pleasing to watch.You probably won't enjoy watching Bolt, but I would recommend to any child under 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bolt is a fine computer-animated feature from Walt Disney Pictures,"Though my friend who works at a movie theatre had already seen this, he agreed to watch it again with me.

Fine Family Film about Plucky Pooch,"New Disney animated film that reportedly went through some development problems early in its production finally appears as a kind of unofficial semi-sequel to 2004's THE INCREDIBLES (had that film also included a family superdog), about a young White German Shepherd named Bolt (John Travolta, strongly used during the first hour or so but whose voice largely disappears during the last 20-30 minutes), employed along with his young owner Penny (the ear-popping Miley Cyrus) in the production of outlandish adventures for an unnamed studios' output of media and theme park attractions. When awakened to his contradictory usages by several of the other animal actors at the studio, the little pup goes off on his own by unexpectedly getting shipped to the East Coast and forgotten by everyone except Penny and her mother. Joined by an amusingly smart-mouthed alleycat named Mittens (Susie Essman, whose voicework skillfully displays comic skepticism without becoming one-note or overly hostile) and an overfed TV addicted Ohio hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton), Bolt decides to make his way back home somehow and prove to Penny and the audience that his life matters to what they have asked of him. Slightly longer-than-normal film of its type at first uses the additional material with seemingly traditional cartoon-movie reinforcements like a song midpoint (albeit good) or the moral that money can only exist to ultimately feed business kingdoms and royalty so don't make it do anything else. But alongside these genre tropes directors Byron Howard and Chris Williams inject energizing and inventive elements, particularly through the dedicated verbal character interplay of Bolt and his bizarre animal contacts (including blankly-eyed head-bobbing pigeons and dialog-feeding actor felines), or their encounters with a wide range of human physical types who come off more realistically American proletarian lower-class lifelike than most animated features usually include. In fact much of the film's comedy, starting with Bolt's own unintended myopia during the first half, is so low-key in funnily suspenseful scene transitions and delayed verbal punch lines that the standard animated movie audience may be taken somewhat aback if expecting constantly bawdy SHREK-like pop-media satire or romantically-/matrimonially-angled narrative sideroads (the Disney cartoon epics of the 1990s and 2000s). Like its little hero BOLT instead constantly keeps its head low and quite honest and is all the fresher for it as the little trio charmingly continues through the American Mid- and South-west and Bolt himself steadily learning his own sadness & disappointment can be offset and made palatable as he learns the value of real friendship and a sensible life goal of his own might see him through. Another successful element is the remarkable range of moods and settings the animators create by juggling sunsets, twilights, and light intrusions in shadowy cramped spaces (much of Act II takes place after dark and I was marveling at how the directors and their visual crew were keeping very strong pace through the lower-key nighttime lighting and compositions with the storytelling; when the action literally explodes at an all-night Ohio animal shelter [!] the resulting screams and chaos come off much funnier like a group of real animals and people were all just woken up and startled into disastrous realizations at the same time right at 3am). It all grandly combines near the end when little Bolt returns to LA just as the mourning Penny is involved with the climactic staging of a dangerous epic fire stunt that suddenly goes awry, and joined by his new friends along with the overtaken firefighters descends into the maelstrom to rescue his beloved owner for real and prove to himself and his audience what he's really made of. Its story elements a little creaky, its voice & star-speeching maybe a little too cut off before the final minutes, BOLT does finally combine its' modest strengths together into a rousing ending in the finest Disney way that bodes well for its new Pixar management and the imaginations of children who will find a little canine hero that they can learn from.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Bolt out the door to see or purchase this one, it is very fun & cute","Bolt the dog (voiced by John Travolta) is the star of an espionage television series. His owner, teenager Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) is his co-star. On the show, Bolt possesses ""super"" powers and is able to stop trucks with his paws, start explosions with his ""stare"" and outrun the bad guys. However, he lives on the set, in his own trailer, and never leaves the premises, not even to go home for the weekend with Penny. Consequently, he is unaware that he is an ordinary dog but, instead, he truly believes he is a superdog. Therefore, on the day that two pestering cats entice him to leave his trailer, he finds himself out in the ""real"" world. After a mishap, he ends up in a delivery truck to New York City, far away from Hollywood. Still thinking his special skills will get him home pronto, he is in for a rude awakening. But, through the help of a stray cat named Mittens (Susie Essmann) and a hamster named Rhino (Mark Walters), he begins the long cross-country journey. Will he make it? This film was cute and fun, with very nice animation and a clever script. There is a touch of violence, especially at the beginning, for the world of the superhero is rarely without danger, even on a television show. So, perhaps the film is unsuitable for the very youngest viewers. However, the cast is wonderful, with Travolta doing an excellent job as the voice of Bolt. Cyrus, too, is touching in her role as Penny, while Essmann and Walters are really superb additions to the film. All of the lesser characters are voiced very nicely, too, especially Malcolm McDowell as the pipes of the main heavy. The animation is colorful, skillful and very realistic, resulting in an attractive movie. Then, too, the score is quite fine, with Travolta and Cyrus doing a duet near the film's end. All in all, if you care about quality films for families, bolt out the door and arrange a viewing of Bolt. Everyone will be yapping with delight as the film runs its course.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Good, not great, but an immense improvement since Disney's CG debut.","Hats off to Disney for improving their CG that much in just three years. If you try looking at Chicken liitle which established Disney as capable of making CG-animated movies, you will know. Bolt is also waaay more likable than Chicken Little.Now for the actual movie.

But it turns out that he really believes this and when he escapes from the studio he must deal with not having super powers and come to terms with reality.The plot is pretty similar to The Truman Show, and since I know that movie, Bolt became rather predictable to me. It is cute seeing him interact with humans and hanging out with a feline he meets along the way home to the studio, but that was just not enough to make it a classic.The voice actors did good jobs, that's for sure, and some action scenes are well made, but aside from that it's pretty average.

Bolt (2008),"Perhaps I went in to the theater with expectations that were a little too high. I did enjoy many aspects of this film, such as the many Pixar references and the spoof of the Hollywood entertainment industry in general. The gags involving the pigeons from around the country was clever, and I loved the heavy national theme of this film. When I first heard about Bolt I was hoping for a scene like the one in which we see Bolt, Mittens, and Rhino traveling through the United States from East to West, and I was happy to see that they delivered in that respect.I found the plot to be a little unoriginal, as it reminded me of Homeward Bound, Finding Nemo, and even a little bit of Toy Story 2 all rolled into one. The Toy Story 2 similarity (Involving Mittens), however, was done very well and quite subtle, moreso even than Toy Story 2. I guess I've just been spoiled by Pixar, but I think it's clear that Disney Animation Studios hasn't quite broken out of its tendency to cater specifically to children, and I feel that Bolt is no exception.I did appreciate the imagery very much though; I felt the animation and settings were superb. It had a real sense of culture in addition to its emotional content, which is what reminded me of Finding Nemo. I actually think the best part of this film involves a certain character learning to let go of the Hollywood lifestyle and live more simply, with the help of those around him; that seemed to be a very universal message, and should have been the main plot of the film, I feel, because it was done so well, and was very heartfelt and sincere. I think this is a story that is going to hit home the hardest for animal-lovers, as they will be able to relate best to the main plot, but I feel that everyone can find something about this film to relate to and laugh about, no matter what your age or geographical location.A respectable 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Although met with flaws, it is a pleasant ride that ultimately delivers an entertaining product. Particularly I find sometimes tiring and must add eye-rolling to see the typical boring way to portray dogs as good and cat as evil or mischeavous; it's been done to death, it can frankly be a bit tedious to insist on that absurd rivalry. Nowadays you don't really see that kind of repetitive dynamic recklessly thrown into a movie plot, fresh ideas were desperately needed in order to turn around animated films depicting animals as characters.

I smiled almost the whole way through. The only set back was that I simply DESPISE Miley Cyrus. Besides that, I enjoyed this movie more than Kung Fu Panda which I also loved, but doesn't quite live up to Wall-e.If your given the opportunity to see this movie, don't hesitate. It's worth the money and is STUNNING in 3D digital. 9/10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A surprising treat,"I enjoyed this slice of Disney fun. No songs which makes a nice change (although Disney do great music). Travolta does well..it seems he is a better actor behind a microphone than in front of a screen. The beginning of the film is cleverly done and hooks you instantly. Although the rest of the movie does not keep this pace and excitement, it is still a great buddy movie with lovable characters and a decent journey to follow. Bolt definitely shows off some significant leaps in animation with some nice effects on the animals and the environment. Not at Pixar's level of course, but still with a CG sheen that now defines the later Disney films. I particularly loved the pigeons throughout...the characteristics are spot on, as are the little nuances used in the animation. Brilliant.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent Family Movie,"I saw this in 3D at the local IMAX and was very impressed with the story and the animation was superb. Seeing it in 3D really added a lot to the experience, although I'm sure it's just as enjoyable seeing it on a regular screen.The plot summary is Bolt is a dog who is a TV action hero (in Hollywood) who is kept in an artificial environment (similar to ""The Truman Show"") so that he actually believes he is the super action hero portrayed on the show. When he is lead to believe his owner, Penney, is in trouble, he escapes to try to save her but somehow ends up in New York City. Most of the story is his ordeal of getting back to Hollywood, with various sidekicks he picks up along the way.This was an excellent Pixar film, as enjoyable as ""The Incredibles"". Take the family, a date, or see it by yourself. It's a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney taking time over release.,"Went to see Bolt last night. FANTASTIC MOVIE absolutely loved it. Saw it in 3D and the trailers for future movies seemed to almost all be in 3D on initial release. What is it with the 3D thing. The 3D effect in Bolt only really worked nearing the end of the film.I don't understand what has taken Disney so long to release it in Britain. When Enchanted came out in the States in mid November 07 it was released here 1 month later. For Bolt we've waited 3 months. It's due out on DVD in the States on 27th March. By the time it comes out in Britain, most will have bought the USA region 1 version. This makes no sense Disney. In times like these when studios are fighting illegal downloading and piracy, what is Disney playing at?The movie was worth the wait though. Go see it if you haven't.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bolt from the Blue,"The next film alphabetically on Disney Plus was ""Bolt"". I'm sure I've seen ""Bolt"" before, though I had very little recollection beyond the premise. Despite starting to show it's age a little, it was a pleasant surprise that it was much better than I thought it would be.Bolt (John Travolta) is a dog with superpowers who, along with his owner Penny (Miley Cyrus), fight against the schemes of evil Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell). Or at least, they do in a weekly TV show that unfortunately Bolt doesn't know isn't real life. When he escapes the set on the last day of outside shooting, he has to cross America to head back to L. A. Accompanied by Mittens (Susie Essman), a cat and Rhino (Mark Walton) a hamster, Bolt will come to learn the truth about his heroism and the value of friendship.Whilst I wouldn't go as far as describing ""Bolt"" as some massively underappreciated gem, I would say, given that I thought it was going to be rubbish, the fact that it was pretty decent was a pleasant surprise. The story was quite good. Applying rigorous logic, it's a bit of a stretch to believe that Bolt accepted being put in a travel cage each night but it's a kids film, so I'll forgive it that and say that when you see Bolt in action within the show, they do a very good job of explaining how it all works. The travel aspect of the story is spun through pretty quickly, though this makes sense when you understand that two large scenes were cut from that section.The animation on the animals is quite good still, with Bolt in particularly looking and moving like a dog. The humans though are a bit less effective. They're stylised quite a bit, but also oddly ugly and flat still. Disney hadn't quite nailed down that signature Disney look yet. I liked the performances too, with Travolta mining a lot of humour from the earnestness of his character and Essman allowed to be funny. The standout funny character is Rhino though.It's not where Pixar were, or where Disney themselves would get too in the next few years, but it's solid enough to have kept me watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

John Travolta is life,"John Travolta plays a dog in this movie. Normally this movie would be nothing special, just a cute little kids film to show your children. But because the dog is voiced by John Travolta himself, that makes the film an absolute must watch for any breathing thing.He truly steals the show in this flick, as he does in every movie he's ever starred in. He enthralls the audience with yet another one of his Oscar worthy performances that movie-goers of future generations can look back at with the same amount of amazement as we do today. The very presence of John Travolta's voice is enough to watch this film at least twenty times a year.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The story is somewhat predictable, but it's sweet and happy and the animation is first-rate.","Bolt is by no means a dog of a film, but he does not teach any fresh tricks to an ancient genre either.It's a fish-out - of-water tale, if the fish were a dog actor raised to think that he's a superhero who suddenly discovers himself without his power, and the water was the way he's compelled to move from New York to Los Angeles.John Travolta gives a good vocal performance as the title dog, Miley Cyrus does the same as Bolt's co-star (the two sing a duet over the closing credits), and Mark Walton gives a lot of laughs as Rhino, a television-obsessed, overweight hamster (one likely has to do with the other).The tale is predictable somewhat, but it's nice and happy and first-rate animation.It's the first feature since John Lasseter took over the creative doings at Disney Animation from Pixar's genius-in-residence, and although it works at kid level, it doesn't give the layers of pleasure and wonder that the finest offer from Pixar.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty much perfect!! Phenomenal 3d!! A MUST own!!,Great voice talent Travolta is spot on as bolt and it's a story for the whole family although my wife and I are in our late 50a and watch it by ourselves and enjoy the heck out of it. The 3d bluray is a must own and is incredible it's a shame people didn't get the incredible effect 3d has on movies when done right.

A family movie,"With Bolt, a winning 3D-animated action-comedy that marries the best Disney traditions with Pixar polish, Disney animation takes a tentative step out of the shadows of Pixar. Though this road comedy about a lost TV star dog doesn't compete with the classics from Disney's computer-animation pioneer partners, it is the first in-house Disney animation to be compared to the Pixar gold standard, following the mediocre Chicken Little, The Wild, and Meet the Robinsons.We're treated to a sort of Bolt Supremacy in a dazzling 10-minute opening, the adventures of a teenage girl and her ""genetically altered"" super dog, a canine capable of leaping over black helicopters in a single bound, blowing up objects with his glower, and flattening armies with his ""super bark.""But it's not just for laughs. It's a cartoon that goes out of its way to mimic and mock real dog behavior, much of which Mittens has to teach Bolt, who has never had to beg with those puppy dog eyes. It's about a girl who adores her dog and the dog who adores her in return. And with that heart, Bolt is the best Disney cartoon that doesn't bear the Pixar name since Lilo & Stitch.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Bolt,"This starts off quite entertainingly with ""Penny"" and her super-hero dog ""Bolt"" having to thwart the evil plans of the dastardly ""Dr. Calico"". She's on her glorified scooter and he just on his four paws - but they are not daunted by the overwhelming forces arrayed against them as they try to get to the airport. Well, that's when we realise that this is a television show and there'll be another edition tomorrow. Or will there? ""Mindy"" from the network comes to tell the rather fastidious director that the demographic is a bit bored with formulaic television and so he's going to have to introduce some jeopardy or it's the can for all of them! The subsequent attempt to revamp the brand results in ""Bolt"" thinking his pal really has been kidnapped and ending up in a box full of polystyrene packing many, many miles away in NYC. Can he get back in time to save her from their evil nemesis? Well, en route he meets the street-smart ""Mittens"" and they have quite few adventures as he tries to get home. It's a perfectly watchable family adventure film, but like the television show it's based around, it's entirely derivative and formulaic. Plenty of set-piece action scenes before a conclusion that rather reinforces the unoriginality of it all. It's busy, colourful and the younger amongst us will probably quite enjoy it, but I reckon unless you're a grown up pet lover (dogs especially) you might struggle to remember this.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
INSANE,I haven't watched this movie in over a decade and when I last watched it I was too young to actually get the plot and I kinda just liked the talking pigeons in it but the plot just got explained to me by my sibling and now it's my favourite movie in the world and it needs to win an oscar because this is so well written like there are live action movies for like adults that aren't this good like even multi millionare productions can't make storylines like this ok so this movie is the greatest movie ever and it deserves way more love.

"""Bolt"" comes to a relationship much like that of a child with your pet. The agile rhythm jokes works and the audience have fun","Some films are treated as landmarks, or for their technical excellence, for its storytelling and engaging characters or shed some new technology. Bolt is not proprioamente the launch of a new technology, but the incorporation of 3D by Walt Disney Pictures. Previously, the company had already launched Chicken Little (2005) and Meet the Robinsons (2007), which were previously released in this format by the studio, were converted to 3D after being completed.Following the purchase of Pixar by Disney Bolt - Superdog is the first feature film studio produced under the supervision of John Lasseter, the director-general from Pixar / Disney, and has failed to realize the very hand of the director in this production sign as an executive producer. He along with the producer Clark Spencer then called a team to develop the script, composed by Dan Fogelman - one of the writers of Cars (2006) - and rookie Jared Stern, who joined the screenplay with fellow directors of the film, Chris Williams and Byron Howard - who had already participated in the development and animation department of Mulan (1998) and Brother Bear (2003), respectively.With the script finished and directors chosen, then the choice to begin the voices of the animated characters. For the protagonist Bolt, chosen to lend his voice was John Travolta. Here it is for dubbing girl Penny were chosen two actresses. Initially Chloe Moretz who would give voice to Penny throughout the feature film. After their work is complete that Miley Cyrus was hired for the role, Moretz fitting to dub a character just as a child. Another main character's animation is the cat Mittens, voiced by Susie Essman, and the hilarious hamster Rhino, who won the voice of Mark Walton. Incidentally, as a curiosity, the character Rhino in his plastic ball was based on the pet hamster John Lasseter, led the animators during the development of filme. Bolt (John Travolta) is a dog who stars in an action series on TV, in which has superpowers. His companion is Penny (Chloe Moretz / Miley Cyrus), who lives several adventures. But Bolt does not know that the world around is false, believing that actually own special gifts. When trying to achieve also other age group of audience, the writers of attraction plan the kidnapping of Penny by Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell), the villain of the series, he manages to escape the van in which they live and part behind her. By a confusion in studios in Los Angeles, Bolt crosses the country and will stop in New York. When dealing with real life is that, gradually, he becomes aware that he has no superpowers and is a normal dog. In this journey he also meets a trio of doves, a complicated cat Mittens (Susie Essman) and hamster Rhino (Mark Walton), Bolt's # 1 fan. With the help of these last two, Bolt attempts to return to Hollywood in order to save his owner from the dangers to which it is exposed.When starting the plot, directors Chris Williams and Byron Howard present the protagonist Bolt, a puppy, meeting for the first time with the girl who would be his owner, Penny. The story progresses few years. Penny is now a pre-teen and Bolt is now more adults. The officers knew very well how to make clear to the viewer that the world thinks that Bolt is a living and the real world is another. Shown is a great persecution that seems to be real, but in the end we realize that all this is a program in which Bolt star with Penny, he thinks he has superpowers and protecting the villains of the series. To keep the genuine reactions of the dog, the director of the show filmed all in one take without letting the cameras are perceived by Bolt, who think everything that happens is real. The directors, after the first sequence, make another scene showing this time the crew and all your effort to capture the images.With the two realities (the Bolt and real) established in one of the episodes Penny is kidnapped by the villain of the series and Bolt, thinking that its owner is actually at risk, manages to escape the van in which they live and part behind her, but ends getting lost and ending up across the United States. From there, the movie becomes a kind of ""road movie"" animal, where Bolt and his friends which include the cat Mittens and Rhino hamster need to cross the country to save Penny. It is on this journey of self-discovery that Bolt begins to realize that does not have super powers and must learn to behave like a normal dog. Therein Mittens, like a cat street, teaches Bolt to order food for humans to play, bury a bone, among other things show to be a normal dog can be very good.Counted for nothing this fun journey if persnagens were not charismatic and by whom torcêssemos. Bolt must learn to live in the real world and discovers his true place in the world and its significance for his owner Penny. As for the supporting cast, as usually happens, they end up having the best scenes and gaining total highlight. The cat Mittens is sarcastic and smart. If at first you can leave the impression that she is a villain by forcing the pigeons to work arranging for her food, then we know the best, realizing that it is all trickery he uses to survive on the streets. The discovery of a sad part of the past of the character just makes us even more like the cat. Already Rhino is the other leg of the tripod head, and without a doubt is plucking more laughter from the audience, with a greater focus to please children and minors. At first it can be considered small and without much function inside your plastic ball. But over time, as well as your way exaggerated and hilarious, we realize that nothing prevents you from accomplishing what you want, and your courage is remarkable.Besides engaging characters, the animation is very well done. There are countless scenarios that show various locations outside the United States and also internal locations within the Hollywood studios. The art director Paul Felix with all the detail and complexity of the landscapes and scenery is of a consistent quality at a production Disney / Pixar, as well as moral lessons and positive messages. In Bolt have valuable lessons of love, friendship, confidence, search our place in the world to believe in dreams, now presented in a tone of comedy, sometimes in a tone more dramatic and exciting. There is also space to criticize the Hollywood studios looking to the audience at all costs, in addition to satirize action movies with the right slow motion close-ups and minimalist.The soundtrack is composed by John Powell always perfect, even the Happy Feet (2006) and Kung Fu Panda (2008). In the instrumental track have ""Dog-Face Boy"" sung by Motörhead, ""Barking At The Moon"" written and sung by Jenny Lewis and, of course, ""I Thought I Lost You"", written by Miley Cyrus and Jeffrey Steele and sung by Miley itself Cyrus in partnership with John Travolta, who appears in the closing credits.Just like Toy Story that deals with the relationship of a child with his toys, Bolt comes to a relationship much like that of a child with your pet. The agile rhythm jokes and funny and we also have a great Brazilian dubbing with names like Leandro and Maria Clara Hassum Gueiros certainly the journey of the protagonist meets well the premise to please all audiences with mastery.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A super-powered canine adventure,"""Bolt,"" directed by Chris Williams and Byron Howard, is an animated film that combines humor, adventure, and heart. The story centers around Bolt, a dog who stars in a television show where he believes he possesses superpowers. When he accidentally gets shipped from Hollywood to New York City, Bolt, voiced by John Travolta, embarks on a cross-country journey to reunite with his owner, Penny.The animation in ""Bolt"" is crisp and colorful, capturing the excitement and action of Bolt's imagined superpowers. The film's humor is well-executed, particularly through the character of Rhino, a hyper-enthusiastic hamster who adds a lot of comic relief.While the premise of a pet on an adventure is familiar, ""Bolt"" stands out with its unique twist of a dog that doesn't realize he's acting. The movie explores themes of friendship and self-discovery, making it enjoyable for both kids and adults. However, the plot can be predictable, and some emotional beats feel a bit forced. Despite this, ""Bolt"" remains a charming film with enough action and heart to entertain.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fulfilling fun film,"Bolt is a fun easy to swallow romp with a soft accessible palate of caricature and lush picture-scape that easily pleases the eyes. It does not boggle the imagination nor is it an exercise in stylistic pacing, comedy, or characterization, but it's a welcome family film without pretension that offers a feel-good adventure that I certainly enjoyed. The film does have a surprising amount of human touch despite the formula and pre-packaged cute that I expected the film to use as its main source of energy. It follows yet another journey (typical of the 'cgi talking animal family film' genre) of a Buzz Light year-esquire white American Shepard with an altered perspective of reality, a notably emaciated cat, and a hamster that derives it's laughs from being a parody of the overzealous fan-boy that says ""Awesome!"" all the time (quite effectively, however). In the film Bolt is actually disturbingly exploited, as he is made to think he and his owner are in actual danger on a consistent basis. One wonder's how his supposed loving owner Penny would be able to take one day of that, but alas it isn't taken so seriously, as it's a premise needed for the film to exist. It was due to this however that I sympathized with his character, and the added lack of humanity came from the fact that Mittens, Bolt's accomplice for the journey, is a stray that once had a home. The emotion in this respect is treated rather typically but it strikes the right chords to teach a valuable lesson which is often absent in films featuring cute dogs and cats. The only main character un-abused by people is Rhino the hamster, who offers much of the comic relief between the confused Shepard and the captive struggling feline. The film is animated well, no shocker there for films from high-end companies like Disney, and the character movements, especially from the pigeons, keep up the spirit of animated zest. There are even some great action sequences; the fake scenes from the TV show (that are featured in the previews like they're the main film) are great as well as the more down to earth scenes. The conclusion's emotions are a tad forced, and a lot of other elements are predictable, but Bolt picks up enough steam and plays with it's situation enough to warrant it's place as a genuinely good animated film.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I wouldn't say it is amazing, but pretty good.","This movie is quite generic. The animation isn't that good, it has celebrity voice actors, the story is generic.... But it is cute and sweet. The premise is so unrealistic that it is laughable, but it is interesting. I like the side character Cat, and Bolt is a decent protag. There just isn't a lot to talk about. It was pretty entertaining through out, but wasn't laugh out loud funny or that emotional. It is just average. If I would I would rate it 6.5 out of 10, but I can't because it doesn't let me.

"Bolt, Buzz Lightyear rip-off?","Although the cast of characters didn't seem to be too much of a challenge to create (like how many doggie-kitty movies can you count?)I find Bolt's profile and personality very similar to those of Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story series who also believed that he was a hero until Woody talks him out of it saying that ""he's just a toy"". Disney is still contributing to the cliché that ""dogs are dumb, cats are sinister, mischievous creatures and that the hamster is, well just a hamster."" The animation and production are superb but what the story lacks in huge amounts is innovation. Probably because they refuse to take risks anymore like they did in the past. Let's not forget what happened when they launched ""The Wild"" in 2006 shortly after ""Madagascar"" showed up and got obscured in the box office due to its similarities with both the cast of characters and structure. And now they seem like they're following a loop for success imitating other Pixar titles such as ""the Incredibles"" and ""Toy Story"". Hopefully kids will never notice that. But then again I wasn't one of those kids.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant and beautiful,We just went to the sneak preview on 11/15 and loved it as did the rest of the audience. I haven't seen this movie advertised that heavily but it should be a hit. It's a great film for parents and kids. From a storyline standpoint - It's helpful to explain the story a little bit to kids under 10 for them to be able to follow it. It plays well to both kids and adults though. The main characters are very well developed and endearing. Loved the hamster and the cat too.

A very good movie from Disney,"Bolt is the latest Disney's animation movie and the first made specially in 3-D. The movie is about A dog star of a fictional sci-fi/action show that believes his powers are real embarks on a cross country trek to save his co-star from a threat he believes is just as real. The story is good but it leaves you the sense of already been watched previously and the plot is pretty convincing although a little predictable. It is pretty enjoyable for the little kids but the adults will spend a really good time too. It is funny and it has pretty good action and adventure. The cast of voices is very good featuring John Travolta as Bolt and Miley Cyrus as Penny. The characters are very funny, specially Rhino the hamster and all the bunch of pigeons that appear throughout the movie. The animation is excellent already a constant on all Disney movies and if you watch it on 3-D even better.

Great Story Of True Friendship,"I saw this movie on Saturday with my girlfriend and we absolutely loved it. I can't remember having this much fun watching a Disney flick besides for Wall-E, but before that, jeez, Aladdin comes to mind. Yet this movie along with Wall-E were really, in my mind, the boosts that Pixar needed to really pick up from their last few films, that one with the rats (not Ratatouille), Shrek 3, Shrek 2, and others. Bolt is a heroic dog on a television show, yet he has no idea that it is a show and he believes that he has all these superpowers and what not. When Penny (his owner) is ""kidnapped"" he flees the set in hopes of finding Penny. Little does he know of the dangers that await him.Bolt is voiced beautifully by John Travolta, who I was skeptical about at first considering how old Travolta is and Bolt looking like a very young and restless pup. Yet Travolta's energy and charisma bring a wonderful dynamic to the brave lil pup. I hate Miley Cyrus, but her voice can be quite charming at times, I was actually drawn in by her. Mark Walton does the voice of Rhino, a fat hamster who is Bolts biggest fan. His crazy antics and adorably funny lines such as ""I eat danger for breakfast"" we'll have you laughing throughout the whole film.The pigeons in this film are, like others have stated, truly stunning. Their motions are perfect, including one beautiful scene when they fly off. The delay of the lift off to the actual movement of the wings is unbelievably choreographed. Great job on the pigeons Pixar! The animation of this film is great, definitely on par with other Pixar greats like Wall-E and Shrek.Overall, a great family film. I would recommend this to anyone who wished to avoid the Twilight crap, or someone who is just looking at watching a movie with some great laughs, along with some subtle comedic references to other media, and just altogether fun.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

And my son loved it, too.While the movie was predictable for the most part, the action sequences were as good as anything in the Incredibles (though perhaps a little more fantastic), and the story had some heart in places. The interaction between Bolt and his com-padres was a bit under-developed, but it worked for the most part.Parts of the movie are very funny, and some of the bit characters (including the pigeons) are well sketched and a riot. They definitely show the touch or philosophy of John Lasseter.The 3D aspect is cool and great for the action sequences, but the glasses are always a hassle.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Nutshell Review: Bolt 3D,"To echo the biggest fan in the film, Bolt is fully Awesome! Or at least the 3D version of this film, especially the first 10 minutes where we see the superdog in action, showcasing super powers such as his eyes shooting laser beams, speedy acceleration, super strength, and his signature super bark. These are the avenues where 3D gets put to good use, but don't expect every aspect of the film to come flying toward you from the screen.Disney continues its fascination with the canines this year, having seen the likes of Beverly Hills Chihuahua, its collaboration with India in Roadside Romeo, and now, venturing into the 3D arena with Bolt the superdog. Man's best friend probably never had so much cinematic exposure in the same year, and 2008 ends off with an American Shepherd being the star of the show.Like The Truman Show, Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) is brought up as the unwitting star of a Hollywood television series, and is totally clueless to the world outside of its sound studio. Thinking that everything's for real, he becomes the perennial fish out of water, having been accidentally shipped from Hollywood to the Big Apple, and thinking that his person Penny (Miley Cyrus) is in mortal danger. Hence comes the road trip back to where he belongs, together with some serious questions asked in dealing with culture shock as he discovers his mortality and his being nothing but a normal mutt.Joining him in the adventures are a cynical cat Mittens (Susie Essman) who shovels the cruelties of the real world down Bolt's throat to awaken his idea, as well as a very zealous fanatical fan in hamster Rhino (Mark Walton). There's nothing groundbreaking here in its character development because it's tried and tested formula, as you'd come to expect everyone ironing out their initial differences to come through stronger as a combined unit than individuals out to fulfil their objectives - Bolt wants to return to his owner, Mittens just wants to rediscover love lost, and Rhino, well, is simply enjoying every minute spent in hanging around his idol.There are plenty of laughs coming from the initial half of the movie before Bolt's attempt to unlearn what he has learnt. The downside of course is that most of the funniest parts of the movie, already made it to the trailer. That aside, there's a very powerful message contained within for the young in reminding them not to abandon their pets, which is almost THE message that gets put into an animal-friendly/centric movie. Love and Friendship are the usual themes used through which to tug at your heartstrings, with enough moments to go ""aww"" and fight that tear or two in staining the 3D glasses which have to be returned. And of course with any dog movie, Loyalty is never far behind.For a few dollars more, you can choose to watch the 3D version of it, and trust me, it's worth every minute and every cent extra, even if there aren't many moments where you'll duck at objects flying towards you. It's quite obvious that unlike Journey to the Center of the Earth that the set action pieces here aren't designed explicitly for this format, but it still offers extremely good digital quality in the rendering of images that pop and provide you that extra dimension, so realistic that there will be moments where you'll be tempted to reach out and pseudo-pet the dog for a job well done. Visually, Bolt 3D is stunningly beautiful with wonderfully designed characters, and photo-realism aside, it's Disney at its best in designing characters with visual and character appeal, that can translate easily to merchandising dollars.Bolt 3D lives up to its novelty, and will instantly become a fan favourite amongst the kids and adults alike. I can picture busy cash registers for Christmas already.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fair - but all too forgettable - kid's flick.,"I liked parts of Bolt, but it has so many flaws and logic inconsistencies that I eventually had to shelve a 'normal' review and remind myself that 'it's just a kid's movie'. Funnily enough I never have to do that with Pixar films.Bolt (John Travolta) is a scrappy little white superdog with a spunky little 12 year old tomboy owner named Penny (Miley Cyrus). They adore each other and spend each day saving both each other and society Only they aren't. It's all merely a top rating TV show in which everyone is in on the ruse except Bolt himself – he is apparently a better actor when he believes it is real. At the conclusion of each day saving the planet Penny takes Bolt to his trailer, gives him some food and a hug, and leaves until next time. There is no offscreen cavorting or playtime. (Which if you think about it is especially cruel once you realise why.) Bolt is frankly amazed one day to find that he does not actually have a superbark, laser eyes or the ability to leap dozens of metres. This unfortunate day happens when he is accidentally posted across the country from Hollywood to New York, immediately deciding he has to get back to LA as Penny is no doubt worried and susceptible to evil without his protection.Now without effects, hidden stunt wranglers and choreographers Bolt is merely a little dawg, even his distinctive bolt shaped marking on his fur proves false. He cannot do anything super or extraordinary, and pain is now very real. What he can do is talk – but of course – which enables him to converse with a scrawny streetwise alley cat named Mittens, who Bolt bullies into providing him with assistance in getting cross country.Along the way they meet a hamster named Rhino, who is not only aware of Bolt's TV identity, but who considers himself Bolt's biggest superfan. He tags along to form a trio of furry fun, only he never leaves his exercise bubble along the journey, a cross country trip that was never destined to go smoothly.Meanwhile in Hollywood Penny has already realised her buddy is lost and is desperately trying to track him down even as the TV studio exhorts her to move on and find another dog to play the role the show really must go on with or without Bolt.Bolt has a couple of reasonable action sequences – most notably the opening few minutes before the audience is let in on the facts – and a few reasonable jokes, mainly from Rhino the deluded hamster.I found Travolta a strange choice as Bolt the dog, I know he boasts 'star power' but is that really a determining factor when the audience is always going to be predominantly children? Miley Cyrus is a similar 'name' choice, but at least she sounds like a young girl.Final Rating – 5 / 10. Ultimately Bolt never proves itself as anything more than a kid pleaser, and even then it is bettered by many other films. The opening sequence grabs you and Mittens and Rhino are reasonable kid's flick characters, but Bolt collapses under its own lack of logic.Put another way my 4 year old gets to watch a movie per week in 30-40 minute installments. He has seen maybe 10 films including Bolt. He continually asks for Nemo and Toy Story again and again. Bolt hasn't been mentioned since first viewing furthermore I don't plan to offer it up as an option.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A truly memorable affair,"The animated movie scene is on a roll this year. It started with Dreamworks' Kung Fu Panda, then with the joyous Pixar gem Wall-E and now, with Walt Disney's heartfelt treat, Bolt. This movie is just fun from the minute it starts until it ends and they didn't forget to put in some heart which then makes some lasting impression to the audience. You will laugh at Rhino the hamster's overeager attitude and snappy dialogues, Mittens the cat and the pigeons were great comic relief but the star of the show Bolt, is the one who truly shines. He's just too darn cute in his Truman Show world, they gave him a distinct memorable character and John Travolta's voice work gave it life. Bolt's person, Penny who is voiced by tween popstar Miley Cyrus fit the character well. Seeing as this is her first time doing a gig like this, I can say she got the job done and very professional, I might add. As long as she's doing voice over gigs and gets second billing, that's fine by me.Ultimately, I think what made this movie really work is John Lasseter. The Pixar brainchild who transferred to Disney. He gave Bolt a touch of Pixar that we all know and love but still separates it from other animated movies and giving it a distinct trait that we all knew and love in Disney classics like Snow White and Cinderella. All in all, Bolt is one of 2008's must-see movies, trust me, you wouldn't want to miss it for the world.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly good!,"When I saw the previews for Bolt I wasn't expecting much. Your typical kid's film, really. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Bolt and recommend this film to others.The voice acting was very well done. Mark Walton, the voice of Rhino, really stole the show here. I was a bit disappointed that they used Miley Cyrus for Penny because it seemed like a cheap advertising gimmick but she did a half-decent job.The animation was superb. The action scene and the very beginning of the film is very well done and the rest of the film is a treat for the eyes as well.I loved the characters, and although the plot was predictable and not very original the lovable and funny characters made up for it. I rarely laugh at movies but Rhino the hamster made me chuckle many times.Overall I recommend Bolt to anyone expecting a fun movie. It's not up to par with many previous animated movies but regardless it's still very entertaining, even if you don't like kid's movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Oddly - Gripping,"Lovely film. I'm odd as I'm 18 years old and still cry at movies like this. It's a touching piece of cinema. Bolt has tons of character, as does Mittins the cat. I actually hadn't heard of this film at all but gave it a shot anyway. And I'm glad I did.The story itself is brilliant, and brilliantly told too. Bolt - who thinks he has superpowers is lost and sent to New York, he finds out his superpowers were fake (all part of a TV show) and does a road trip back to Hollywood. I wasn't expecting the story to be so good.In terms of art style I wouldn't rank it too highly as it seems every animated film is capable of this type of stuff, but the points where the characters aren't talking still shine. Bolt is a hyperactive dog, and this is a hyperactive movie. It works well.The voice acting is superb. Unlike Madagascar, the voices fit with their characters, John Travolta does a superb job of Bolt and Susie Essman does a great job with mittens. They're subtle performances and don't stand out too much like they do in other animated films (aka Madagascar, where none of the voice actors are particularly good).There are a few points in this movie that are really funny. Namely the bits with Rhino and the Pidgeons. Again... All superb voices. The bits that are funny surpass the competition. Ice Age (2 and 3), for example, are no where near as funny or touching as this movie.The ending (no spoilers) is lovely. Well worth watching. Again and again. I'm off to find a BluRay copy!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I would not watch this movie again,"I was very unhappy with the movie ""Bolt"". As I watched this movie I grew to become a little angry with just the concept of the movie. I tried to give this movie zero stars and unfortunately it wasn't possible. As i began to watch the movie i found it very borning and don't know how any child could watch this. The cast seemed great i genuinely thought this would be another DIsney classic but I was wrong. I was so glad i did not waist my money on buying or seeing this movie is was complete garbage from start to finish. The movie is one hour long and as soon as it got to 10 minutes i had to stop the movie and think ""why are you watching this"" but then i resumed the movie because i thought maybe it was just the beginning. After i got to 30 minutes I then turned off the movie it was the most uninspiring movie i've ever seen there was no lesson learned either. After finally playing the whole movie it left me wanting more but not in a good way I feel like this movie was somewhat imcomplete i was wondering where the rest of the movie was. I don't think this is a movie anyone should waist time or money on it was very borning and my eyes only stayed on the screen for no less than 2 minutes. I had to google search this movie and even see if it was a disney movie because it was a discrace to the name ""Walt Disney"". Therefore, i would not recommend this to anyone or let my future children even sit through an hour of this garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too Disney,"Bolt is a star. He's an actor playing a superhero dog in a series in which he and his owner, a little girl, go through several ordeals trying to save the world and themselves. The good thing is, he's doing a fine job and everyone likes the series. The bad thing is, he doesn't know he's an actor and actually believes he's a superhero. When an event is created that takes his co-star, who he believes to be his owner, away from him he thinks it to be a true crisis and goes to the rescue.So far the story. Good enough, it's only a simple animation film after all. And like most of todays animations it leans a lot on the actions of several side characters and their interaction. I love the cat best, and the hamster plays a good part too. But all in all the combination just doesn't work out too well. It is too much of a standard story packed into too much of light headed animation. The animation is up to par with what can be expected today, nothing wrong there, but it doesn't really add to the story and that makes the ending result just too thin.Added to that is the fact that this is a pure Disney film and that is seen in the way the story flows - all the elements of the classics are there and it has to be said that the day for the classics is done and should be changed into a new rhyme instead of repeating it over and over.5 out of 10 super barks.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
No doubt a choice for a family night movie,"I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Disney movies and 3D animation. The movie is fun, beautifully animated, and funny. Voices of the characters are very good, especially John Travolta, since I didn't realize it until mid in the movie since it fits the character so perfectly. The most important lesson of the movie teaches kids that you don't necessarily need to be a super hero or have special abilities, fly or shoot laser to help others. You simply can be a friend's, or the family's hero by just being there for them in the time of need and help and support them to the best of your ability. I would definitely Recommend this movie for any family movie night or any one that is the fan of Disney movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Terrific Disney Film For Viewers,This is a great Disney film for all viewers to watch and enjoy. The storyline got a bit lost throughout the film but it was still alright. I still enjoyed watching it. The cast selection was fine. They really committed and connected to the storyline. This film reveals to viewers that everyone has a different limit. My limit has always been and always will be short. Nothing will improve it and people who are around me like to test my limit. I have no idea why. People like to get me real started for no reason. I am better off by myself. It might be different for other people. This is a great Disney film for viewers to watch and enjoy.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The cat was my favorite from her voice to her lessons.

Bolt: A Story of Underdog Triumph,"""Bolt"" is a heartwarming and visually stunning animated film that tells the story of a dog named Bolt, voiced by John Travolta, who is the star of a hit television show and believes his powers are real. As he sets out on a journey to save his owner, Penny, voiced by Miley Cyrus, he discovers the true meaning of being a hero and the importance of family and friendship.The animation in ""Bolt"" is top-notch, with vibrant colors and dynamic action sequences that truly bring the story to life. The voice acting is also noteworthy, with Travolta and Cyrus delivering heartfelt and relatable performances. Additionally, the film's message about the importance of self-discovery and acceptance is woven seamlessly into the narrative, making it a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.Although ""Bolt"" may not be as well-known as some of Disney's other animated films, it is a hidden gem that is sure to delight audiences of all ages.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bolt review,"""Well I'm still yet to see an animated film that can topple the mighty 'Toy Story', 'TS' still sits on its throne with the number one spot. But Bolt is a nice film, very sweet, very nice, a touch of emotion and you have a good solid performance.The story is as usual pretty unoriginal but it still works well, it has a touch of 'Lassie' in there and 'Homeward Bound' with the cross country trek to find the owner but this does give it a soft touch that can pull at the heart strings in places.
It starts off kinda weak, your not too such what the films tag is or where the plot is going but it soon starts to pick up when Bolt reaches NY.
It looks great with some very detailed fur action going on and brilliant movement copying with other animals such as the pigeons. The funniest parts tend to be with the funniest character...that being 'Rhino the hamster', an almost Jack Black type rodent haha not an overdose of humour in the film but most comes from Rhino.Solid film for all but still cant compete with the mighty 'Toy Story' trilogy.""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A joy,"Excellent.'Bolt' is all a joy to watch. On paper, the premise can look a bit ridiculous, don't get me wrong it is, but the film manages to not only make it entertaining but to also make it both amusing and heartwarming.The opening scenes are superbly done, when the cat (dog?) gets let out the bag, so to speak, it does take a few moments to regain its footing but quickly turns into a lot of fun. It's got a pleasing adventure, heartfelt feelings and comedy to keep it fresh.The cast are very good, too. John Travolta (Bolt) and Miley Cyrus (Penny) do very fine jobs in their respective roles, but it's actually Susie Essman who stands out most to me - she gives a super performance as Mittens. A few of the other voices do solid stuff, also.Thoroughly enjoyed this.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not Feeling It,"First I should say I get teary-eyed every time I watch ""Wall-E"" - so I know good animated movies. This movie is just not getting me very interested (watching it now and soon to turn it off). It was cute in the beginning as the dog's behaviors were really cute in mimicking an actual dog. Then, once the plot became clear and the dog's voice (which doesn't fit as others have stated) was revealed, the movie went down hill. I don't understand how people can say this is funny. It just goes to show that people really don't think and/or aren't honest and say things are good because they SHOULD be good (being a cartoon). It's almost like people force themselves to like things. It shouldn't be hard to like things - it should be natural. But this cartoon/movie just really isn't good. It has potential (or should I say had), but it just isn't (enough). I heard of this movie before, but now I see why it wasn't a blockbuster. I'd be surprised if it made $45 Million. I'll look that up now and then I'm done with ""Bolt"". 3 for animation but a plot that was doomed to failure as well as weak anthropomorphic screenplay. I just don't care about these characters...even as someone willing to make the imaginary stretch (as we do when we watch any movie - animation or otherwise).",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
The BEST action adventure movie for kids in a long...long...time.,"Bolt (voiced by the talented John Travolta) is a pooch that was found by his person, Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) and was altered by Penny's father (voiced by Ronn Moss) into an ultimate and indestructible canine partner. He's strong. He's fast. And he has Super Bark. That and the fact that he doesn't know that he is in a TV show and that he is the most convincing animal actor ever, since he's not in on the whole scheme.One day, after a demand from the studio that the director make a more thrilling and suspenseful storyline (a.k.a. cliff-hanger ending), Bolt breaks out of the studio, trying to find Penny, whom he thinks is really kidnapped by the evil Dr Calico (Malcolm McDowell), who really doesn't exist. Being swooped away from his former life, he now has to make his way home (the studio). Easy enough, except the fact that his power is now disappearing...at least that's what he thinks. We get to see him finds his way home, while making friends along the way.This is the BEST action adventure kids' movie I've seen in a long time. And to think that Disney did it alone (without the help of Pixar) is very overwhelming. Although not nearly as good as Wall-E, Bolt does deliver, it has energy, the story develops nicely and in the end, it's a very fun movie.It's pretty much like The Truman Show, except Truman accidentally got out, and THEN found out that the world in which he used to live in wasn't real.The vocal cast is very impressive. Travolta sounds very young and quite the hero he portrays. Cyrus did the best she could with her character, which is not in on the action for most of the movie. But what really DELIVER the movie are the supporting casts. Mark Walton is the one that stands out, voicing the deranged and slightly mental hamster, named Rhino, who is also the biggest fan of Bolt. He is everything you see in the trailer and more. He's funny, loud, and wants to be in the action (being Bolt's #1 fan and all), and he keeps blurting out crazy and funny quotes. He introduces himself to Bolt by saying, ""I'm lightning quick; I have razor-sharp reflexes. And I'm a master of stealth."" Funny considering he's a fat, round hamster who does nothing all day but watch TV. And when he sees a guard at the animal shelter, he quotes, ""I'll snap his neck.""The cat Mittens (Susie Essman) spends the entire movie trying to convince Bolt that he's not a superhero and that it's okay to be ordinary. This is a good lesson for the kids.Finally, does this movie bring anything new to the animated world? Perhaps not. But considering it wasn't made by the giant company like Pixar, it's quite an achievement. This is what I want from Disney in a long time. Well done!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Doses of reality of life were added to the old dog-trying-to-rescue-girl-owner plot, making it less corny and more moving. The voices were also done quite well-I was especially impressed by Susie Essman as the jaded stray cat.

The biggest delight of the year,"It's been a while since I've been this pleased with a film I've seen in the theater. ""Bolt"" was a film that all ages could enjoy.

The plot twist toward the end, which I won't give away here, was one of the most pleasant movie surprises I've seen in a long time, and I had to check my tears at this point. The opening scenes are some of the most exciting action-packed scenes I've ever seen, especially for a kids movie. Aside from all of this, ""Bolt"" may not be the most original movie I've ever seen. It has elements of previous Disney films, such as ""Toy Story"" (1 and 2) and ""The Incredibles."" It's not entirely perfect, as some occasional supporting characters can be annoying after a while. Nevertheless, I was able to overlook all of that considering how much I enjoyed and was touched by this film. It's easily the best film Disney has released since ""Enchanted."" A few more pleasant surprises like this each year would be great. This is the first film I've seen in a while that I've been eager to recommend.

Full of Friendship,"This movie seriously reminds me of the Disney works from the 90's, full of friendship, adventure, good feelings and vibes between a dog and his owner. The all concept and storyline is very clever, and in the middle also brings the touch of reality with the difficult but relevant theme of companion animals abandon, and the black holes of Hollywood multi- million dollar cinema industry. Bolt offered us an extreme positive message – unconditional care and love are far more valuable than self- interest, money, fame or notoriety. On the other hand, the viewer is also presented with a huge amount of humor and action, brought by another amazing characters like the pigeons or the hamster.

Bolt falls in the forgotten Disney years when Pixar was completely blowing them out of the water. It honestly feels more like Monsters v Aliens or one of those cheaper, early DreamWorks films.Multiple times during the movie, my 8-year-old son would say, ""But why?"" in response to certain plot points.

Good entertainment value,"With many good animation flicks in 2008, Bolt has rightfully cemented its place among Disney/Pixar's masterpiece CGI/animation collection over the years which began with Toy Story over a decade ago. While it will not be a classic like Finding Nemo nor as good as one of my favorites, The Incredibles, it is a very enjoyable animation movie.Bolt has the right touches of heartwarming moments, action sequences, and funny scenes (some of Bolt's thunder were stolen by a hamster inside a ball named Rhino so watch out for them), and the concept was quite different in that the protagonist thinks he is an actual super dog. That was new.My wife and I saw this, and we have to say that we left the movie theater feeling good and entertained. It will have to be tied with Wall-E for 2nd best animated movie that I've seen in 2008, behind Kung Fu Panda and ahead of Madagascar 2. I went into this not having as high expectations like when I went in to see Madagascar-Escape to Africa... my expectation coming in was just OK; it was comparable to when I went to see Kung Fu Panda (which was far exceeded by Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, and the rest of the Dreamworks' team). So it was a pleasant surprise that there was something different to the plot, and that the funny moments were well placed.The movie may be less star studded compared to KFP or Madagascar 2; sometimes in the other movies, you can imagine the famous actor while he's delivering the funny line (say, Jack Black as Po or Chris Rock as the Zebra) so it's a little different with Bolt because neither John Travolta nor Miley Cyrus is as well known for their over-the-top comedic voicing, but I think that the casting was quite solid.The guy voicing Rhino was pretty good, especially considering the producers could have gone with one of those well known ""big"" comedy guys like James Belushi or Kevin James. But here was a guy voicing a really funny character pretty well, so kudos to the movie's producers for going against the grain and not following the usual Hollywood thing and hire someone well known.Overall, the movie was well-paced, the story was simple but clear, and there was a good balance of entertainment value.Something worth watching, guys!

I loved it!,"I have a 3 year old female Westie who gave birth two months ago to a happy-go-lucky boy. A friend told me I'll love the movie, and lo! Five minutes in, I called them both to me (even though the Offspring wet my bed only an hour earlier), and just cuddled with them for the entire duration of the movie. So, if you have a dog, don't miss this unpretentious little film. And if you don't have a dog, see the film and get one right after! :) or a Cat. or a Hampster (an excellent character, funny and witty).And show it to your kids.

"Brilliant, Funny, Heart Rending","Disguised as a ""family"" film (aka ""kiddie""), this is a great comedy-adventure with a lot of depth and truth to it. You can take ""the kids"" to it, but you don't need a kid as an excuse to see this film. It's laugh-out-loud funny and cleverly written for an adult sense of humor. It has a couple of tear-jerking moments about lost love and abandoned pets, but it isn't maudlin or belabored. This would make a great date movie rental. If your date doesn't laugh or shed a tear throughout the entire movie, dump them FAST! They might be a sociopath. Other than Travolta and Miley Cyrus, there are few big names in the cast, though a few gems such as Malcolm McDowell (""A Clockwork Orange"", etc.) and cartoon stalwarts such as Phil Lamar, but the acting is flawless, demonstrating the wealth of talent in ""voice acting"". I have no idea how well this movie works in other languages, but in English, it's a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A transcendent movie,"The best movies transcend their subject matter. Rocky won Best Picture and Rocky Balboa (Rocky VI) should have because the focus of the movies went well beyond boxing and appealed mightily to those who had no interest in the sport. And so it is with Bolt!, a Disney movie.On the surface, Bolt! is an animated kid's movie about a TV super-hero dog raised on a TV set,who never sets foot outside the studio. He is enormously believable in his TV role because he truly believes he IS a super-dog. The enemy falls at his superbark, walls tumble before him, iron bars bend in his paws, his Boltstrike causes bad guys to collapse as he valiantly saves his little girl partner Penny from doom.Then, to enhance his concern for the next show, a kidnapping is staged. Penny is kidnapped, but only until tomorrow's show. But to Bolt, it is real. He escapes to save her and by a fluke is transported across the country. When he breaks out, he is not in Hollywood, but in New York..and in the never-before-seen Real World.Slowly (and humorously), he realizes that his Super-powers are not real. But his resolve never weakens. Told repeatedly by a cat he picks up that humans do not really love animals, that a fine free life awaits him on his own, that Penny has replaced him by now and shorn of his powers, Bolt's relentless drive to return and save Penny from danger shines like a beacon on his cross-country voyage back to Hollywood and the girl he loves.Along the way, he picks up the hilarious Rhino the hamster, a big fan of his show. Rhino talks like a macho movie hero ""(""it's a good day to die!""), but he is of course a hamster. He believes in Bolt, the superhero. In the end, Bolt is forced to deal with a very real danger without his powers and with only his hamster sidekick and his courage as allies.In sum, the movie offers great humor,excitement and a display of nobility of character you won't see often. Take a kid or go with adults. Either way, you won't forget Bolt!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Even, Bolt and Penny are acting in the second TV show, that scene is also awesome and cool. Even, Penny looks very cute. When, Bolt, Mittens and Rhino are travelling by a train, that scene is totally awesome and thrilling. When, Bolt and Penny are in a cabin, that time Bolt is very funny.

"Skip Madagascar 2, this is the one to take the kids to","In Bolt, a small American White Shepherd dog has amazing adventures, not realizing that none of it is real. The little guy (whose voice is provided by John Travolta) is actually the star of a highly rated action show for kids, but the show's director is a believer of method acting, and wants the dog to think the things that happen to him on the show are real to get a more natural performance from him. On the show, Bolt the dog travels with his young human owner, Penny (Miley Cyrus), cross country searching for Penny's father, a scientist who has been kidnapped by the diabolical madman, Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell). Bolt has been genetically enhanced to have super canine abilities (actually special effects that are performed right there on the set), and uses those abilities to battle Calico's forces.The concept of an actor on a TV show living in a make believe world, and not realizing his every move is being filmed by hidden cameras reminded me greatly of the Jim Carrey drama from 10 years ago, The Truman Show, and made me wonder if this was going to be another look at the same idea aimed at a much younger audience. The movie drops this idea fairly early on, and turns into a standard road trip comedy, but I wasn't disappointed. The film has plenty of wit, charm, and heart to go around. Bolt is forced to hit the road when he believes Penny is in danger. The most recent episode ends with a cliffhanger where the girl has been kidnapped by Calico. After the shoot, Bolt is sent to his private trailer as always, but believing that Penny has actually been kidnapped, he breaks free and ends up accidentally inside a shipping box which is sent to New York City. In his strange real world surroundings, Bolt initially doesn't understand why his ""powers"" don't work like they usually do. He's still determined to track down Penny, even in his supposed weakened state, and forcefully brings an alley cat he finds named Mittens (Susie Essman, wonderful here) along for the ride, believing that she has ties to the evil Dr. Calico and can tell him where his human is.The relationship between the delusional dog and the street wise, sarcastic cat is at the heart of Bolt, and also what makes the film work above all else. I loved the way that Mittens the cat begins to train him in the art of being a real dog. Bolt has been living a fantasy his entire life, and has never even experienced the joy of playing with a chew toy or sticking his head out an open window with his tongue flapping in the breeze. With so many animated films forcing the idea that animals are just like us, only with fur, here is a movie about a dog who learns to enjoy the simplicity of a natural life. I liked that angle, and I liked the way that Mittens slowly warms up to Bolt's situation. She's a cat with a past, as she used to belong to some people who were forced to abandon her when they moved. She doesn't understand Bolt's devotion to Penny, as she believes humans can only hurt. The spot on vocal performances by Travolta and Essman add a lot of the heart the character's hold.Also along for the trip is a pudgy little hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton), who is familiar with Bolt through watching his adventures on the ""magic box"" from his cage. He's mainly there to provide comic relief, and though kids will likely enjoy him, I found him a little grating. Fortunately, the movie never allows him to distract from what works. I was surprised by how sympathetic Bolt is, and how much I ended up caring for the characters. Even young Penny gets some effective moments. The preteen actress has always felt bad about having to lie to the little dog, and make him think their adventures were real. When he runs away, she feels responsible. As mentioned earlier, Penny is voiced by pop singing sensation and actress, Miley Cyrus, and this movie hints that she may have a future after the Hannah Montana fad comes to an end.The film is wonderful to look at, too. The visual style is bright and vibrant, and the character designs carry a lot of personality. When we see Bolt as a puppy at the very beginning of the film, playing with a toy, it's filled with much more character and emotion than any of the live human actors can muster in this weekend's other big release, Twilight. I also greatly admired the attention to detail in many of the film's settings. There's a brief montage where the three traveling animals visit different landmarks as they make their way cross country, and a shot of them watching the famous ""water show"" outside the Belagio hotel in Las Vegas looked like the real thing. This movie makes even the well animated Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa pale in comparison. The fact that this movie has some actual soul and heart behind it, unlike that mediocre cash-in sequel, certainly helps.Over the years, the Disney studio has been trying to catch up to the works of Pixar with some of their own in-house computer animated films, and the results have up to now been middling. (Does anyone really remember Chicken Little or Meet the Robinsons?) Bolt is by far their best effort to try to capture the tone of a Pixar film, and while the film takes a few wrong steps (mainly with its unfunny comic relief character), it's definitely the closest they've come to their league. Bolt proves you don't always need original ideas as long as you have a lot of genuine emotion and likable characters on your side.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
More babysitter than others...,"Overall, I don't think it's a bad movie at all. The story and characters are ""ok"", and the animation is pretty good, with enough pace to maintain the attention of the little ones.Having said that, the first act was so incredibly boring to me. It's so predictable, you can skip around 20 minutes and you wouldn't miss anything.Plus Travolta's voice just doesn't fit as a sweet puppy (Bolt) and Miley Cyrus was just abhorrent. But thanks to Susie Essman and the surprisingly clever (more often than not) humor, the last 2 acts of the film go smoothly towards the very unsurprisingly ultra-saccharine ending. It's fine... and better for kids.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Strong outing from Disney - voices a bit weak,"Overall I thought Bolt came together very well, hitting all the notes of humour, action and some genuinely poignant moments. The only area which I found a bit weak were the two voice leads, Travolta and Cyrus depend far too much on their physical personas in their acting to convincingly inhabit their characters, frankly they are a bit boring.The exception was Mark Walton as the hamster Rhino. Who is this guy? He nailed his part, and obviously had a lot of fun with it, a very impressive performance.As others have mentioned, this movie was much better than the trailers suggested. Or perhaps it is because the trailer itself didn't try to include all of the ""best bits"" of the movie, like so many do. Not a bad idea to tone down the trailer a bit so that the audience can still be surprised by the originality and spunk of the script.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Rendered a Soft Appeal & LookSolid Entry in the ""Cartoon"" Canon","Cute and Cuddly at times, this Disney Animated Feature is far from a perfectly conceived Story that has a Familiar Feel, but is Loaded Up with Laughs and Endearing Characters. The Triple Bonding of a Dog (Bolt), a Cat (Mittens), and a Hamster (Rhino) on a Road Trip is the Stuff of Life Lessons and Content of Character Building.Despite some Clumsy Storytelling and Transitions, like the End of the First Act, threatens to make the Movie a Chore to Sit through, it does become more Engaging as it Settles into the Story Conceit and Fancy Footwork.Although Rhino (the Hamster) has many Fans, He really is the Weakest of the Lead Trio, and often seems like He is there to give some Confidence to Folks Forever Fighting Weight Problems and is the one relied upon for most of the Comedy Relief. He is Upstaged by the Pigeons.Overall, it's a Charming Children's Film that has some Appeal for Grown-Ups.

Such an underrated film,"This nice animated film totally deserves more love.It wasn't made by Pixar, but it was pretty good, having very good animation, many funny moments and very likable characters.In my opinion, it was the best thing that Disney (without Pixar) have done in a long, long time. And from my personal taste, I enjoyed this way much more than ""Tangled"", mostly because ""Bolt"" feels way more honest than that film (Which seemed mostly like a desperate attempt to resurrect the classic animated fairy tales done by Disney)The voice acting was pretty good, I never thought that Miley Cyrus was able to do such a good performance, and John Travolta's voice acting fits perfectly with the main character.

Bolt — A animation buddy picture with action and fun,"Bolt is a funny animation movie that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults that are kids at heart. The humor is not multilayered so that you can enjoy it on a number of different levels, but it's hilarious.As far as I'm concerned, Rhino is the laugh star of this ensemble, close behind are the pigeons. Bolt, even though adorable, is the least funny one of the cast, probably because he's such a straight face hero. I won't rob him of his glory though, because we want him exactly like that, he's driving the whole film. Mitten fits right in as the unwilling sidekick.The story is very engaging, if without any surprising ideas. The intro is a blast of super powered action. The dialogs are good.

Bolt 2008,"Director: Byron Howard and Chris WilliamsStarring: John Travolta, Miley Cyrus, Susie EssmanBolt was the first 3D animated Disney movie to be released after buying Pixar and it shows. The 3D effects are quite noticeable and true to the high bar Pixar has always set for itself they are natural in presentation.It is a story of a super dog Bolt ( voice by John Travolta) who battles against the bad green eyed villain Dr. Calisco (voice by Malcolm McDowell) with his human girl Penny (voice by Miley Cyrus) in TV. Bolt does not know he is just an actor and that his super powers are not real.As a dog loving person I knew that I would like this at least in some level, but was pleasantly surprised with the quality of both the story and the technology. The animation just looks plain awesome in 3D all those animals hairs look so real and the 3D really works beautifully by making the movie an enjoyment to watch.The animal characters are incredibly cute, but they still have their own personalities and some edge. The dialogue is witty and charming. Bolt is a fun adventure with likeable characters and some good gags. There are also some very good choreographed action sequences.Good Disney movie for all ages.

best CGI movie i've ever seen...,"I really miss the classic 2D animated movies, but Bolt is without a doubt the best CGI movie I have ever seen. I did enjoy some other well done CGI movies like Finding Nemo, but none have ever really intrigued me as much as Bolt did.When I first watched the trailer, I have to say I wasn't totally excited to see it. After hearing a lot of great things about it though, I decided I should give it a chance, and I am SOOOOO glad I did.Being a teenager who doesn't find any interest in doing the typical things teenagers do, I am trying to be a kid for as long as I can and great animated movies like Bolt really help because it enabled me to feel the things I felt when I watched great movies like The Lion King. I laughed, I cried, and I wish more people would have seen this instead of Wall-E, which I did enjoy but I have no desire to see it again (I personally prefer the animated movies with talking animals because that would be a dream come true for me). There hasn't been many CGI movies with talking animals, which is probably why I still like to repeatedly watch the classics like Bambi, Lady and the Tramp, The Fox and the Hound, Oliver and Company, The Lion King, etc. I can watch Bolt over and over again, and never get tired of it. Bolt, Mittens, and Rhino are SO easy to love and are all awesome characters; every minute of this movie is pure entertainment. If more CGI films like Bolt come out in the future, I certainly won't hesitate to see them.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"An energetic, heart-warming animated film.","This film, in my opinian is possibly the beginning of the Disney Revival era. The story and characters felt like how old disney was before it went down hill in the 2000's. All they did was make direct to sequals to classics and made very boring, uninteresting films, with the exception of Lilo and Stitch. But then this film came out and I was blowb away. I didn't see mucb of the trailers back when I was 11. So when i got the DVD for christmas, I didn't know what to expect and I loved it. I have watched this film so many times. And even as a 21 year old adult, I still think it holds up. The animation is really good, the characters are amazing, but it is the voice acting that really shine's. John Travolta as Bolt was an amazing casting decision and tbw other voice actors. My only critisim is that, while she can act very well in this film, Miley Cyrus's voice is so recognisable that it is a little disstractinf, but it is still ok. I would say the climax is the best part of the film. I 100% recommended tbis film.

An Exceptional Animated Film by Disney,"Bolt is directed by Byron Howard and Chris Williams and is the very original story of a dog that regularly stars in an action/adventure television show. Despite it being a fictional television show, Bolt, the dog, believes in every second of it. When he mistakenly gets shipped from Hollywood to New York, Bolt must, with the help of new companions Mittens the alley cat and Rhino the small hamster, get back to Penny in order to save her from the threat that he wholeheartedly believes is real.Bolt is, as far as animated films go, one of the most underrated films ever created. With its combined amazing voice acting, animation, and very clever writing, Bolt is a great film, with a lot of style and substance. Coming from Disney in a dark streak of theirs, Bolt didn't have any expectations from me, yet it impressed me on every level. The low amount of recognition Bolt gets is unacceptable, because it is a substantial film.The voice acting is what really elevated Bolt to the next level. The talent of John Travolta, Susie Essman, and Mark Walton add for a great team littered throughout the film. John Travolta pulls off the brave, big hearted Bolt with a passion that live action actors can't usually bring to an animated movie. Both Susie Essman and Mark Walton as supporting characters Mittens and Rhino back up the lead role with a large amount of vigor, and play their characters considerably.The animation is top notch for the standards held these days, and impressed me greatly. The animators smartly knew to blur the background while giving the foreground much detail, which, overall, made the characters pop like a bubble. Each and every character stood out, be it Bolt, the superdog, or Penny, his ""human."" Although the background was blurred, like mentioned above, it doesn't look cheap. None of the animation looks rushed, and it all looks very clean.My main issue lies with some conveniences thrown into the plot. Despite Bolt's target audience being smaller children, it was obviously directed somewhat to an older age as well, proved by its tear inducing moments cluttered throughout the movie. At certain times in the plot, the characters may be in a place in which the writers didn't seem to have a plan to get out of, yet, soon enough, a large factor in the film will suddenly purpose itself, and everything will work out for our heroes. Although this issue isn't that prominent, it really bothered me, and took enjoyment away from film altogether.The clever writing in Bolt impressed my on a very large scale. Almost all of the dialogue, particularly between the characters of Bolt and Mittens, is absolutely flawless, with great banter and sly exposition thrown in the middle of it all. Once thing going for this is the difference between their species, a dog and a cat. Their characters' contrast added for a great relationship between the two of them; a relationship the entire audience can relate to.Another minor issue I found in Bolt was the slow exposition. Due to the extravagant plot, the film takes its time to set up for the adventure that's about to come. Once the adventure kicks into gear, the film begins to move very quickly, but the exposition seems to drag on just a tad too long. If the script would've removed a few unnecessary characters, namely a pair of annoying cats, then the first fifteen minutes (or so) may have moved faster.The last thing I have to mention about Bolt is the fantastic score. The musical score, composed by John Powell, is absolutely golden. Every single minute that any sort of action was taking place, the score was pounding, demanding that the audience sit on the edge of their seats. The viewer already cared about the characters, and their goals, but with the astounding score booming from the speakers, the audience begins to care all that much more about everything that's taking place in the film.Overall, Bolt is one of the best animated films that Disney has made in a long time. Pretty much anyone will relate to, and enjoy, this excellent movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bolted to a good rating.,"After the very good Meet the Robinsons, I tried not to have too much high expectations for Bolt, as two good ones in a role for Disney animated movies in the 2000s were rare. However, after watching it, I was also pleasantly surprised! It's an interesting story about Bolt, an American white shepherd, who is the star of a fictional TV show, but has lived his whole life on the set and believes he really has superpowers. When separated from the studio by accident and believing his co-star, Penny, really got captured, he sets off on a journey to rescue her. Along the way, he meets Mittens the Cat and Rhino the Hamster and learns the truth about himself.This movie started very heavily on the sci-fi stuff and seemed like a copycat of the motion picture, The Truman Show. In addition, some of the characters including the movie agent and the studio manager acted too superficial. However, what ultimately resulted was more than just typical Hollywood superfluous stuff and cliché action heroes; there were actual meaningful adventures and drama, from Bolt lost in the city when trying to find Penny to him learning the truth about himself and life in general. I've also found that the character Mittens was witty and humorous, especially when she appeared oblivious when Bolt actually thought she was partly responsible for Penny's disappearance. The growing friendship and teamwork that the animal characters eventually formed were also meaningful and gave the movie heart.The CGI animation is colorful and detailed (I especially liked the various cities), and the direction is well-paced - it makes you eager to find out how everything will unfold at the end. Like Meet the Robinsons, it's one of the better Disney animated films from the 2000s.Grade B",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Bolt for president!,"Oh Bolt! How I love you! This is by far one of my top favorite animated movies of all time, and I'm not even a John Travolta fan! My favorite thing about this movie is the opening. If you watch this with someone who doesn't know what is going to happen, the opening credits are fun to watch them be surprised by. I love a good twist! I thought John did a fantastic job (probably because I didn't have to look at his actual face, which was really only good for Grease) and even Miley didn't annoy me the way she usually does. The hamster was a fantastic addition and is pretty much everyone's favorite character. The pigeons were so well animated I was keeled over laughing from how life-like they were and their New York accents just made it that much better!I won't sum up the plot because if you haven't seen it and don't know what to expect from it, there is nothing I can say that won't give the opening credits surprise away and since that is my favorite part about it I refuse to ruin that for anyone.

Two paws up!,"Every time I watch this film, I like it a little bit more. That's three times I've sat through it, and my ever-growing appreciation has increased it's rating from 7 to 8. Huzzah! There's an action packed plot, decent CGI, appealing characters and some great lessons about pet ownership. What's not to love?Bolt thinks he's a superhero dog from a TV show... when in fact he's just a regular pooch. Accidentally knocked out and transported from Hollywood to New York, he is forced to team up with a snarky cat called Mittens (My favourite, both for her species AND her sarcastic demeanor) and a hyperactive hamster who goes by the name of Rhino to find him way home.Bolt's cluelessness about the outside world (he's lived in a studio for all his life) and his attempts at performing his non-existent powers are the basis for much hilarity, along with Mittens's ever sardonic remarks and Rhino's never-say-die attitude (in comparison to his size).But there is something deeper here, about the unspoken bond between an animal and it's owner. Bolt KNOWS his 'human' loves him, despite her being an actress... and Mittens was absolutely devastated to be abandoned on the streets of the Big Apple, unloved and declawed... (A disgusting practice which is thankfully outlawed here in the UK). The speech she gives about why she doesn't trust people late on is heart-rending to the core. Rhino, on the other hand escapes from a trailer park during the movie... and we never hear from his owner again. Well, he seems happy enough...As I've shown, rewatchability is high due to the little things you'll miss along the way, and the end result is one of the most purely joyful ways you can spend 90 minutes. Especially if you're an animal lover. Guilty as charged. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The plot, though predictable (hey, it's Disney. you are expecting a SAD ending?) was well executed, with interesting characters, good script and storyline and what is becoming the usual: beautifully rendered animation. The 3D glasses looked and felt like slightly polarized sunglasses and the effect enhanced the experience.Go see it. Happy ending and all.I feel better now.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Fantastic Animated Film that Will Appeal to Adults,"Last night I watched Disney's ""Bolt"" animated feature from 2008. I knew very little about the movie going into it, and I imagined that since I had heard less about ""Bolt"" than I had about some of the other animated features in recent years (""Brave""; ""Big Hero 6""; etc.) that perhaps the movie would be a flop. I must say that I found myself pleasantly surprised with the film, and it made such a good impression on me that I've given it 9/10 stars.The movie follows the story of a dog named ""Bolt"" who happens to be a television star in Hollywood. Bolt's adventure takes him across the country before working his way back to Hollywood where he's trying to reunite with his ""person"" (i.e. owner), Penny. Bolt is voiced by John Travolta and Penny is voiced by Miley Cyrus, both of whom do great jobs in this movie.If I had any one word of criticism for ""Bolt"", it would be the way in which the film portrays the dog as a movie star and shows behind the scenes footage of his career. For example, you see producers and agents talking with the show's cast, and you see graphics people working at computers to edit the show for production. For me, there was a bit of an uncomfortable vibe there, inasmuch as the way that it's done takes away from the magic of the movie a bit. I felt bad for kids in the audience, many of whom might be seeing a movie for the first time, and who were seeing that movies and TV shows in general are all sort of fake. That in and of itself takes away from the film a bit, but then you throw in the fact that the way in which it was handled might be a bit hard for some younger children to really ""get"", and that raises questions as to whether or not the script for this movie was very well thought out.But, no sooner than I say that, I have to admit that if you can get past the whole ""behind the scenes"" thing that is featured in the movie and just take it for what it is, the film itself is outstanding. This is why I say that the movie will appeal to adults just as much as it does older kids who won't have a problem comprehending the behind-the-scenes technique. Once you're able to forget about whether or not your four year old is going to understand what's happening on the screen and enjoy the movie just for yourself, you'll probably really enjoy this movie.Last but not least, I'd just quickly remark about how amazing the CGI effects are in this film. That's nothing out of the ordinary for computer animation these days, with lots of other movies using similar techniques to offer up stunning computer generated visuals in feature films, i.e. ""Shrek"", ""Monsters Inc."", ""Toy Story"" and the like. But as someone who has only seen a handful of those movies that are becoming more and more plentiful, ""Bolt"" reminded me of what a fantastic age we live in in which animation can be so incredibly sharp, detailed and defined.All that said, if you're watching this movie as an adult or if your child is old enough to understand the somewhat awkward behind-the-scenes technique of the script of this film, then I imagine that you'll find yourself loving ""Bolt"". It's a neat film with great graphics and an engaging story that you may enjoy as much if not more so than your kids.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Cute Film The Kids Will Enjoy.,"The dog of a big television show thinks everything he is doing is real, until he escapes ""by accident"" and is shipped far away to New York. Now he must find his way back to the little girl he loves and protects all while thinking he still has these special powers.The film's animation is nothing spectacular, but will please the little ones. The opening sequence is a scene from the television show, so it's packed with fast paced action and editing. Well done and interesting to see how the incorporated the dog into a superhero fighting everything from guys on motorcycles to helicopters.The story itself is good enough to keep me interested and doesn't really get too stale. It goes through the required clichés of this type of flick, finding out he has no powers, feeling bad and upset, then realizing he still loves the girl and wants to get back to her, blah blah blah. It's all there, so don't expect anything really new in that department.The voice acting is basic, specifically from the leads, Miley Cyrus and John Travolta. Is she in character? Or playing herself? The cat and the hamster steal the show in every scene they are in. Good chemistry between the three characters on their way back to Hollywood, which makes for some good laughs and more toys for the little ones to buy.I can recommend the film because it is entertaining, feels like this years Kung Fu Panda, then again it feels like this years any animated film that isn't Pixar. Give it a look, the inclusion of the cat and hamster characters give it enough of a comedic touch to make it slightly above average.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A lot of Fun,"Bolt isn't the greatest movie in Disney's animated Library, but I can say that it's in my top 20, maybe in my top 10.The plot is standard. A dog is led to believe that the life he lives on his TV show is real, but once he escapes into the real world, he becomes like a fish out of water. He doesn't understand how the real world works, he doesn't know why he doesn't have his powers, and he is in desperate need to find his owner Penny. Along the way he teams up with an alley cat named Mittens, and a hampster Rhino who also happens to be Bolt's number one fan. Back at the studio, the producer is trying to find a replacement for Bolt, but Penny still believes he's alive and will make his way back.It's trite, but it's fun. It has some great animation, fun action scenes, and some very funny moments.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's Best!,"I am a complete movie buff and simply love watching movies of all kinds,it must be entertaining.Disney has produced amazing movies and Bolt is one of their best.But Toy Story will always be on top of my list.Bolt is a story that shows the bonding between an actress Penny and a dog,Bolt.John Travolta and Miley Cyrus have lended their voice to the movie and have done it amazingly.Bolt is a film, very sweet, very nice,with a touch of emotion.The story is as usual pretty unoriginal but this does give it a soft touch that can pull at the heart strings in places.It looks great with some very detailed fur action going on and brilliant movement copying with other animals such as the pigeons.Bolt the dog, is very sweet and cute throughout the movie. The funniest parts tend to be with the funniest character.Solid film for all and one of the best by Disney but still little below my all time favorite Toy Story!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Oh Look. ANOTHER Disney Movie I loved!,"I Actually saw this movie on Starz on demand In 2010. I loved it back then, and now have a strong interest in it. I then bought it and re- watched it. Here's my N and P.Negatives: if you were a 9 year old kid watching this, and you didn't give two craps about what the adults are talking about, like, (agents, Television show making, etc.) then you would find the movie VERY boring. While he's funny, Rhino the hamster was a pointless character.Positives: Amazing animation, Great voice actors, humor is good, the plot is very oringal, Very entertaining.Overall, The movie is VERY good.

One of my all time favorites.,"If you've read my Happy Feet review, you know that it is near impossible to break into my top 5 favorite movies. However, this film managed to make it to spot 3. Honestly, most of why I like it is personal preference, but that doesn't mean it didn't have its general appeals. Every aspect of a Disney animated dog movie had me hooked. I love Disney, I love dogs, I love dog movies, I love Disney dog movies, I love animated dog movies, I love Disney animated dog movies, and this was the first of the latter to release in my lifetime. I'm a love of all pets, so for there to be a cat and hamster in addition got me hooked. The film is very clever and very inspiring, with incredible characters. I will admit it is not as ""actiony"" and fun as some may expect, but that does not hinder it in my opinion. I can't say this film is for everyone, but if you watch it, I'm sure there's a good chance you'll like it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
MAN do I love this caper,"When I first saw Bolt I wasn't into it,but when I decided to give it another shot I instantly became a fan of it. From the director and screenwriter that brought you Disney's 50th Tangled,Bolt tells the story of a dog named Bolt(voiced by Grease's John Travolta)who thinks that he has superhuman powers and that his an actual hero little does he know that its all a pack of lies and its really a TV show where his charcther is a superhero dog and he teams up with a teenager called Penny(voiced by Hannah Montana's Miley Cyrus)to defeat the man with the Green Eye. But when Penny gets kidnapped,its up to Bolt to save her from this villain,and so on his journey he meets a streetwise cat named Mittens(voiced by Susan Essimen)and a bipolar hamster called Rhino(voiced by John Walton)and the two embark on a hilarious adventure together to save Bolt's owner.The story for this movie is brilliant in fact I love animal movies some make me cry actually take that back ALL animal movies make me cry and this one was definitely another one as there was one particular scene that had me weeping but im not gonna spoil it for you all so you have to see the movie yourself.Surprisingly the voice cast was good too in fact it was weird hearing John Travolta voicing an actual dog,while some of the kid's favourite Miley Cyrus was great too.The Animation is flawless you can't complain about CGI cause its taking the world by storm so you know what if you love animal movies like me then check out this sweet charming tale about friendship and courage.Bolt gets a 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
great entertainment for kids,"Bolt does not have a Shakespearean plot or spectacular twists and turns: it's a simple and straightforward (read: predictable) story. However that doesn't mean the film is bad - quite the opposite! The animation is spectacular, the voices are great, and there are some hysterically funny moments (my favourites being the pigeons). I suppose Bolt was made to appeal to younger (and I mean very young) audiences, hence the complaints by grown-ups here. But you know what, every parent appreciates the fact that films are still being made that appeal to kids and keep them entertained! I took my 3-year-old son (who usually has a very short attention span) to see Bolt in the cinema, and he sat through the entire 90-ish minutes of it and enjoyed it tremendously. So, Bolt may not be Oscar-worthy material, but it fulfils its purpose, which is providing some good uncomplicated fun for the entire family -- and especially for the wee ones.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

hilarious,"This was a great Disney animated comedy, and adults and kids will love it equally. It features a dog who's the star of a TV show that features him as a ""superhero dog"" who has a super bark, can melt metal with his eyes, and do a lot of other things. The problem is, this is the only world he's ever known, and when he accidentally gets shipped off in a crate cross-country, he thinks his powers are real and doesn't know how to function in the so-called ""real world."" He gets teamed up with a cat and hamster in his quest to reunite with his ""person,"" Penny, and hilarious situations abound as he tries to enact his ""superpowers."" As you can imagine, towards the end, I won't reveal it, but he does wind up in a situation where he has to be the ""hero."" There are also situations I've seen in films like this.Overall, this was a funny and good movie with a great voice cast, including John Travolta as Bolt.

"Pixar Comes Up On Top,Again","Within The past 20,plus years since Pixar Studios churned out quality 3D-CGI (three dimensional,computer generated image)animation shorts (starting with a short dealing with computer generated dinosaurs running across a field,up to the release of the celebrated Toy Story features,with a new one down the pipeline), they have made a name for their selves as the Czars of computer animation. Despite a couple of less than celebrated releases,they come out on top again with 'Bolt' (originally planned to be called 'American Dog'), about a little dog (voiced by John Travolta),and his owner,Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus),and their adventures as the stars of a television series. It seems that Bolt thinks he actually has super powers,so when he gets loose & ends up accidentally being mailed to New York,he has to find his way back to Hollywood. He is assisted by a cynical alley cat & a domesticated hamster,on the road. What follows is a series of adventures for the trio. Does Bolt get reunited with Penny? All I can say is, check it out for the answer. This animated film is being released in a special 3D edition,but standard flat,2D prints are also available (for cinemas that lack the equipment for screening 3D films). Rated 'G' by the MPAA (suitable for the whole family)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun canine adventure,"Bolt was an ordinary dog until owner Penny's father gave him superpowers; after that he and Penny are up against the villainous Dr Calico and his henchmen... of course none of this is true; he is actually part of a popular television series although he doesn't realise that. One day, hoping to make the show more dramatic the creators make an episode with a cliff-hanger ending. Thinking Penny is really endanger Bolt sets off to help her. This doesn't go well; he ends up in a box and is shipped to New York. Once there he believes the Styrofoam in the box was the reason his 'powers' no longer work. He meets Mittens, an alley cat he believes is one of Calico's minions, and together they set off across America so that he can get back to Hollywood and save Penny. Along the way they meet Rhino the hamster, a fan of Bolt who believes Bolt is a real superhero. As the three continue their journey they encounter various obstacles before the exciting finale.When I sat down to watch this I didn't know about the story; all I really knew was that it was a CGI animation from Disney that featured a dog. This meant as I watched the opening I thought Bolt really was going to be a super-dog. Some might have been disappointed when it emerged that it was just a show within the film but I thought that was rather fun and worked perfectly to set up the rest of the film where Bolt learns that he isn't quite as super as he thought. Once in New York the story is almost entirely about Bolt and his new companions Mittens and Rhino. These characters are a lot of fun; especially Mittens, I loved how she was introduced when we see her running a protection racket against the local pigeons. The story isn't exactly deep but it produces some really good set pieces and some emotional moments. There are some mildly scary parts but nothing that should upset children; the sense of danger doesn't go on to long. As one might expect from Disney the animation looks really good and the voice cast, most notably John Travolta, Miley Cyrus and Susie Essman as Bolt, Penny and Mittens, do a really fine job; combined they make really good characters. Overall this might not be Disney's must memorable CGI animations but it is a lot of fun and can be enjoyed by animation fans of almost any age.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the greatest Walt Disney films full of comedy,"We got the opportunity to see this in a sneak preview in 3D and were very entertained. Great plot, great animation and the 3D was amazing. Sometimes felt like Bolt's head was towering over the audience. Good thing he didn't drool! All the characters were great. The pigeons were great comic relief. It's amazing the amount of detail the animators put in. Watching the way the pigeons moved their heads was entertaining in itself. Rhino and Mittens were also hilarious while having more depth as well. A lot of Rhino's great lines were in the preview but didn't exactly play out in the story the way they seemed like they were going to. Even with that, he was hilarious. Obviously the plot is predictable but it's a very fun story. We were laughing out loud throughout this movie.Skip Bond and see Bolt.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Underrated adventure film.,"Bolt is a super dog that works with their owner ""penny"" to save her father from the EVIL DR. Calico.No, in fact bolt is a fairly average dog who's whole life was raised in a movie set, internally he thinks he's a super strong dog but he's really not. One day he escapes from supposed movie set, and has to adapt to being a normal dog while meeting a few friends that teach him the ways of being a normal dog, all the while bolt is still trying to get back to his owner.This movie doesn't have a villain which is vital for most movies to carry the story, and despite being released in 2008 it still holds up, the good parts overrule the bad parts though, I think this movie is the best dog/cat movie I've ever seen, it includes tropes from movies like ""the matrix"" in the film That are used on the movie set bolts in, and the idea that bolt believes that he's in this fantasy, action world is really interesting, and is totally unprepared when he has to come clean about who he truly is.Eventhough this movie has got a mediocre response from critics, the concept behind the film is really cool, however having bad bits (especially the dialogue) I think it was a decent movie, and if I was the director, I wouldn't be so disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I thought the jokes were really funny as well and when I asked my friends to watch this, they were blown away as well. This one of Disney's best of the 2000's.

My kid and I really liked this one,"I'm not sure why there's not a higher score here. This really was a fun movie. The concept was unique, and the voice acting was exemplary. They really sold it. John Travolta had some really good work in here.The concept is silly, of course, but it's an animated movie with talking animals, so who is going to complain about that? But the idea of a dog thinking he's really a superhero was enjoyable.Animation is really good for the year this came out. Sure, now, 16 years later, it looks dated compared to some, but there are several movies the last three or four years that didn't look as good as this.There was some great work here to really make the animals lovable and, oddly enough, relatable.And the animators really did well with the animation of the animals. Movement was great. And the scene where Bolt has to try to look cute to beg for food was some amazing artwork.Definitely a must-see for anyone who enjoys animated movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A well written animated movie,"We are used to animated movies spreading kindness and happiness among the viewing audience, but Bolt is somehow different. The beginning of the movie is very surprising and the plot unwinds superbly till the end. I enjoyed it a lot, and admired the high quality of everything in it. One of the best scenes in the movie demonstrates the thorough thinking in this movie's preparation: a strong explosion blasts in front of us, and the camera suddenly moves some hundreds of yards away, and we see a Styrofoam glass knocked down very slowly by the blast. It was amazing. The Pixar company has done it again, with the small details that elevate the movie to it's high standards.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Bolt,"Bolt, I honestly don't know what to say about this film because honestly I feel bad about saying this, I love Disney so much, but this movie didn't do anything for me. First off this was one of the strangest casts, I do like John Travolta, but I just couldn't see him as Bolt for some reason, his voice just threw me off completely. Miley Cyrus, this movie became more about her and I think they were just trying to attract her fans to this movie. The only thing that I really did enjoy from Bolt was the hamster, Rhino, he was just absolutely cute, he could have been annoying, but he's like the ultimate fan that loves you so much that it turns around and you like him right back. The animation, it was decent, 3-D is just becoming so huge this year I think. The story is just The Truman Show with a dog, it also kind of reminded me of Homeward Bound, so this is something we've seen before.A super-dog named BOLT, whose days are filled with danger and intrigue-at least until the cameras stop rolling. When the star of a hit TV show is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood sound stage to New York City, he begins his biggest adventure yet-a cross-country journey through the real world to get back to his owner and co-star, Penny. Armed only with the delusions that all his amazing feats and powers are real, and the help of two unlikely traveling companions-a jaded, abandoned house cat named Mittens and a TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino -Bolt discovers he doesn't need superpowers to be a hero.While I wasn't into this movie, I think it's a great family film, especially for the kids, it's a guaranteed fun time for them. The characters are cute, but it's Rhino and Mittens who steal the show. I don't know about you, but I think this movie had a little bit of a rip off from Animaniacs, those pigeons in the beginning reminded me too much of the Goodfeathers and Mittens reminded me a bit of Rita, if you've seen the show, you know what I'm talking about and will agree with me. Bolt is worth the look, but I'm not that impressed with it, watch it with the kids and for the fun 3-D stuff. The story is just a little unoriginal but the characters make it worth your while.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

My first thought was ""Oh no, no another crappy animation film..."". 15 Minutes later I was really surprised how funny this ""crappy"" movie actually was, and many people around me laughed their guts out.Well, it's got the same ""true friendship"" moments you might find in every movie of that kind. And also some of those over the top ""this could never happen by chance"" moments. But thanks to the great characters featured, especially Rhino the hamster and the reoccurring pigeons this movie stands out of all those other animation movies featuring some animals on a difficult task. And the ending isn't even that heart-warming as it used to be in that kind of movie.

Dazzling and Brilliantly Animated For The Entire Family,"13 November 2009. The rich soft texture of the animation makes this film one of the most entrancing and comfortable animated features ever. The balance between reality and fantasy of the animated medium itself provokes one of the strongest storytelling experiences made for just this technique. It is a perfect almost seamless version of an oral history, wrapped in a classic moving canvass. The storyline from THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998) together with THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY (1963) threads this movie into an emotional and surprisingly humane movie about the essence of human and animal relationships, about fame and fiction and meaning. Except for the moderate irritation of the stretched plot points that detract from the rest of the emphasis on reality in an animated medium such as how does a hamster roll so fast as to catch up to a moving truck and such, this movie delivers strongly. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A very cute family film!,"I love all of Disney's films, but Bolt is one that stands out from the rest. Upon seeing the trailer I was eager to see the film and I wasn't disappointed!Bolt and his owner Penny are the stars of a popular TV show entitled 'Bolt', which is about a dog who gained incredible powers in order to protect his master. But there's one thing: the director of the show goes to great lengths in order to convince Bolt everything is real because 'If the dog believes it, the audience believes it'. Because of this, Bolt can't have a normal life and spend quality time with Penny, who is tired of her life and the fact that she isn't allowed to bring Bolt home after filming. Ratings for the show are failing as every storyline is the same and ends with Bolt saving Penny from the evil Dr Calico. To save the show from being cancelled, the director created a cliffhanger ending with Penny being kidnapped. Bolt is horrified and escapes his trailer to find Penny, but in the struggle, he ends up on the streets alone. Still believing Penny is in danger, he is determined to get back and seeks the help of streetwise kitty Mittens and Bolt's biggest fan, the hyperactive hamster Rhino. But as time goes on, Mittens makes Bolt realise he has been living in a fantasy world and shows him how to be a 'real' dog.Personally, I love it. This is one of Disney's greatest films and I can watch it again and again without getting bored. I adore Rhino and if you do too, then you will love the animated short 'Rhino'.I think Miley Cyrus as Penny was a serious case of miscasting, but she isn't in most of the film so I can forgive and forget.If you're looking for a film to watch with the family, something to watch alone or to give to the little ones, then Bolt is a sure thing. The entire film is very feel good and you will love the perfectly fitting soundtrack.",,Anonymous,Animation
