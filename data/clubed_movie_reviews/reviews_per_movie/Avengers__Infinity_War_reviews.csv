To this day one of the most impossible films to pull off,"This film is an achievement unto itself. Unlike any other marvel movie, this deserves to be praised for bringing around 25+ popular characters and putting them all in a cohesive narrative thats unlike anything that came before it.At least 20 movies filled with characters and storyline nuances were successfully kept intact here yet the main character was the villain that had barely had any screentime previously, yet was written in a way that you could empathise with him and tied him into prior events like the new york invasion.The movie itself is structured perfectly, from the perspective of Thanos putting him in a heroes journey making him go to different locations to collect the stones from different heroes weve come to know, and pairing different combinations of heroes in an insanely well written way so every character stood out and had an iconic moment to shine.All in all the scope of this film is beyond anything that has come before it and even more so than Endgame, but they kept the narrative grounded and paced it perfectly. And the ending of the movie is one of the best endings ever. The best superhero/ comic book film of all time after The Dark Knight.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER,"Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.Rating: 9.6.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A superior avengers sequel,"Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.Overall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A film that pulled off the impossible.,"Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.But it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.This movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours. Hats off to the writers, directors, producers, and Marvel Studios.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than Endgame,"Infinity war is one of the best MCU protects. It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking. If you aren't a Marvel fan or haven't watched most of the previous MCU movies this however, won't be something for you. Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero.

Best Cliffhanger of all Time,"A meticulously planned film down to the last detail, where you can see how much love is behind it. Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Somehow they pulled this off,"I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations.I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas.I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony.I give this movie my highest recommendations.

It all led to this: superhero film at its best,"#MCUrewatch. A confrontation that has been in the making for dozen of films. Thanos finally arrives. And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...).

The best,This is is the best marvel/avengers movie every minute is very great no cap.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much better than END GAME,"AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR,to say in one line,is perfectly balanced as all things should be. It was the most anticipated movie of the decade,and it had to deliver what seemed impossible-bringing together two dozen superheroes,combining plot threads from the previous 18 films,introducing the biggest villain onscreen and perfectly balancing humor with emotions and action with drama-all in a single film-and the russos nailed it.... Mild Spoilers follows... The main attraction of the film ,is no doubt the Mad Titan. Thanos is not your usual villain. He is complex and multi-dimensional. He is cruel,ruthless,kills but at the same time, he mourns,shows compassion,and above all-he has a reason for his actions-and that's what makes him the most interesting and dangerous villain. He gets the most screen time than any other hero...It is as if he is the central character. Its as if we are following his journey of collecting the six infinity stones so that he can destroy half the universe. He wants to wipe out half of the universe,not because he sees fun in it nor he wants to rule. All he wants is to achieve balance in the universe. According to him if the universe is left unchecked,then the universe might destroy itself due to overpopulation. He wants to do this action so that the other half and the future generations can thrive....he describes it as mercy. Along with him ,the film also gave us sidekick antagonists in the form of black order. Among them,Ebony maw was cool to watch. The actions and choreography were amazing. If you thought the actions in the trailers were awesome,o boy...u aint seen nothing. The people behind the camera ..they did a fantastic job. The art work was good ...and the cgi and vfx looked realistic. They did a remarkable job in capturing all the facial expressions in josh brolins face. Nothing to say about screenplay...its just ....I cant imagine how they delivered it ..and like a star wars movie we got to see different parts of the galaxy-From the sanctum sanctorum to New avengers facility. From wakanda to New york. From Nevidilir to knowhere and from vormir to titan and finally to wakanda...The shifting of story from one scene to another scene and location without confusing the plot was executed perfectly. The dialogues were sensible..and the film is filled with lots of pretty and punchy one liners that will fill you with laughter,and some that will make you emotional. The character interactions...well this was what we wanted to see more than anything...and trust me ,the russo brothers delivered more than what we expected. Not only that, the film gives adequate time for characters to grow and develop in such a short time frame that you feel for each and every character ...its a treat for those who have followed all mcu films and had made the characters part of their life.....the interaction between these different characters is what makes this film unique.....there are reunions...there are first meetings..the plot is written as such that each and every character is vital to the story... The guardians get a lot of screen time...and Thor-guardians interactions are one of the best and most entertaining moments in the film .The trio formed by dr strange,peter parker and tony stark was also very amazing..The first meeting between earths mightiest heroes and the guardians of the galaxy is very funny ...The thanos-gamora relationship is very well explored ..the film also gives ample time to vision-scarlett witch romance that was teased in the trailers... captain america has a grand entry ..we get to see black panther...bruce banner ..o well he has his own arc in the film and is funny.. and so on...
Its the darkest and most emotional movie in the franchise..as the first scene itself sets the tone for the entire film. The stakes are higher than ever and the ENDING will just make you numb .....,
Its not just a superhero movie..Its a movie about love,relationship,sacrifice and above all asks a moral question- ""under what condition is it just to trade one innocent life to save others"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unlike anything ever done in the history of cinema,"This movie is the beginning of the culmination of Marvel's masterfully woven cinematic universe. Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just ""world domination."" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies.

"Thanos and Bubbles, Kiddie Mickey Mouse Style","I don't recognize the THANOS The MAD TITAN from the comic books. Thanos would NOT waste his time balancing the universe if he didn't get something out of it which was Lady Death's love. Lady Death's influence with romance makes more sense. Disney's Mickey Mouse version of Thanos was easy on the Avengers. The MAD TITAN in comics books would have not been sooo fun loving and bubbly, hilarious. Thanos motive in Disney's Mickey Mouse Avengers Infinity War movie is stupid and illogical. Mickey Mouse has turned Thanos into an EMO CRYBABY. Booo!!! Kiddie Disney ruined Avengers Infinity War which is really the Gauntlet story. DIsney can't get the titles right either.

Just as soulless and predictable as others but more compact,"If i can somehow oversee the fact that this is just another glorified cgi fueled version of wwe, its an okay action movie.It's still very much soulless, incredibly predictable and nothing that happens in this movie matters in any way because there can be infinite amounts of prequels and/or sequels and also, certain people can control time in any way they desire. I see that as a self-destructive element in the story, because well... nothing matters.Whats good in this movie is, it felt more grounded to me. In other superhero movies i usually get these moments of ""wait, where are we?"" or ""wait, why are they fighting again?"". This one felt more compact to me.

The second best movie of Marvel,"I love this movie, i love it.
It must gross a maximum of 2.5 billion dollars at the box office worldwide.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Bordering on a comedy, ""Infinity War"" is overhyped, lacked direction, but at times impressed","""Avengers: Infinity War"" may well have hit the consumer sweet spot formula: the all-important kiss to boost the box office, heavy emphasis on comedy, loads of explosions, and a story that enthralls above all else. 
That being said, this latest installment plays it safe and rode on a long hype train spanning back over a year - Infinity War opts for the tried and true with the odd tweak thrown in, it's ambition is to be an amusing superhero popcorn flick, nothing more, nothing less; and on that count - it perhaps succeeds.Not really accessible to new viewers of the franchise.Infinity War is not for the entry-level viewer (if you want to fully understand it, at least) - lacking accessibility, it offers little explanation of the prior plot to the newly introduced - 31 movies have led up to this in one way or another: to an all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. 
Infinity War assumes you haven't been living under a rock and have seen (at least some of) the previous movies, to some viewers this will be a deal-breaker.
 
So, for those reading who have no prior investment in the universe and its characters - this may be a disappointing watch. To those who have seen previous films, it still may be disappointing - the story is nothing to shout about.Great CGI.No, really, I will praise the special effects. Staggering stuff, and no doubt what helped make it one of the most expensive films of all time to produce.Too many characters.The Russo brothers were tasked the impossible job of covering a very broad cast of some 35 characters to the best of their ability within the 2 hours and 40 minutes run time, and to say the least, they were stretched thin. 
For the average fans, more characters is a major selling point - to those more concerned with the fluidity of the film-making and storytelling, it didn't work. The story felt somewhat fragmented as the plot's focal point kept shifting to accommodate the sheer number of characters.It bordered on a comedy.For some that's okay, in a film that is meant to be a culmination, the big showdown of epic proportions - I was surprised how dependent on comedy it was. I would have liked more story-building dialogue and character development instead. It didn't match the vibe of stopping a dude (Thanos) that could potentially kill trillions of people. 
While some of the slapstick humor was welcome, at times it went too far, it felt as if it didn't work alongside the serious scenes and situations that it often tried to segue into seamlessly - to no avail.Geared towards a younger audience.As a heads up, this movie without a doubt is meant to appeal towards Marvel's biggest target market - kids and early adolescents.It makes little to no provision for those into well-written, sophisticated plotlines that transcend shooty guns and big explosions. 
Most of us have outgrown the cliches.Poor ending.Most of the audience remained seated in the cinema expecting some closure, but the credits just kept rolling.A poor cliffhanger ending that just tries to sell the next film.Overall 6.4/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
boring,This movie was kind of like an episode of TWD. Just a bunch of people chit-chatting with each other with boring action sequences.

Avengers Infinity War: Marvels crown jewel,"Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?The Good:Children of ThanosThanosAll out action as expectedTies everything together nicelyThe Bad:Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)So many characters were spread too thinThings I Learnt From This Movie:If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weirdDishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Breathtaking,"Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields.Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet 'Titan' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it's unpredictable. It's full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That's not to say they don't get anything to do because they do, it's just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it's a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon's need for artificial limbs, Thor's new haircut and Drax's constant quips.There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don't look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it's a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that's just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its ""baggy"" or ""overlong"" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

You will know what it's like to loose.,"Avengers: Infinity War is a movie that brings together a decade's worth of Marvel superheroes into a movie.

Extravagant clash of the titans,"Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me.Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever.More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character.Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion.'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart.Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored.Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The standard for every crossover movie,"Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly.

A snore -- literally,"This film was complete and utter tosh. Judging by the way it has been positively reviewed by some other IMDB members, I cannot help but wonder if we watched the same movie. I fell asleep repeatedly during the opening night screening in my city and I lost most interest in it after 90 minutes or so. (The run time was much too long.) While I've enjoyed quite a few of these Marvel big-screen productions in recent years, I didn't enjoy this one very much at all. Unless you're a comic book fan, I'd take a pass on this one.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Stream of Now,"How long has it been since the Dark Knight? The DC film that defined how an epic comic book fantasy could wrap a world around a hero and a villain.Marvel have a different way of building product, and the Avengers universe has spread over many instalments. And while the last two Captain America films have escaped popcorn and can be seen as real achievements, the Avengers have kept to a more Disney comfortable spectacle.We ride from fight to fight, changing scenes but staying firmly locked into a fantasy present with no solid meaning, much better explored in comics. But even this limited form is broken here - with the idea of a villain who is neither camp nor fickle. By developing Thanos the film actually makes it's normal limitations feel worse. There is an empty parade that is supposed to support the narrative but can only manage sputtering buddy humour and colourful mayhem. From this thin gruel we are expected to construct a framework in our minds to justify the story. While enjoying the expensive antics, the attention wanders through the inevitable plot holes, pointless scenes and rolodex of similar heroes.Better to keep to the single dimensional tunnel of the continuous spectacle, or dare to write a proper film. This fails to do either, rendering the final scenes like a Monty Python sketch without a punchline.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Perfect mix of a lot of superheroes.,"Is it possible to put a lot of superheroes together in one movie? Avengers Infinity Wars attempts that, and succeeds in spectacular fashion! All the Marvel movies before this were building up to this epic movie, and you are a fan of the Marvel movies and have been watching them, you will feel really good watching this, as a lot of favourite characters from previous Marvel movies appear here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Cinematic Event,"A massive achievement in film! Unlike any other MCU movie I've seen, this film deserves every bit of praise it gets. It manages to bring 25+ popular characters together and tie them into a single story.After at least 20 movies filled with characters and storylines where the main character easily wins, and the villain gets about 25% of the screentime, this film makes you understand where Thanos is coming from. It also ties in with other events, such as New York.The movie is structured perfectly, from Thanos' perspective, putting him on a hero's journey. He travels to different locations to collect stones from heroes we know and love. We also get to see heroes that don't usually interact, and the movie is filled with iconic moments because of this.This film is unlike anything I've seen in the MCU, and while I love Endgame, I find myself more of an Infinity War type of person. The ending is absolutely insane-a bold and creative choice, which I think is something everyone loves about this film. In my opinion, this is not only the best MCU film, but a top 3 comic book movie.Overall: 9.6/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Overall glad I had a discount on my ticket price,"I am going to say straight away I am not a die hard Marval fan as it all seems a touch far fetched for me, but having said I did enjoy the last avengers film and most recent Spiderman.
However this, although not a terrible watch was as if they had given the film makers unlimited access to budget and special effects. And the result was as if every instrument in an orchestra was all playing very loudly and all at the same time.
Parts felt like I was just watching a computer game and the cgi, and there was a lot of it didn't feel as good as in others. 
That being said there were more funny parts in this film compared to the others, but was I left thinking about it the next day? No. Would I watch it again? Not unless somebody else asked/forced me to.
So overall 6 but more like a high end 5/10 than a solid 6 and I was glad my ticket price was reduced due to an offer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the biggest loss of time lately,"I was so angry after watching that I had to write something. Boring boring boring, the biggest reason for that is scenario 0/10. It is too long, if I hadn't go to cinema and bought ticket there is no way I would have patience to watch it until the end. Everything already seen in previous marvel movies, it seems that every new is even worse with lower quality and I didn't even have big expectations before the movie. The main reason I decided to watch it is IMDB rate 9/10 which is total fraud and paid advertisement. There is no guarantee if some character is dead that he will remain dead, everyone could resurrect...Go watch anything else than this. My last marvel movie for sure, so angry that I don't watch american movies in cinema any more, all the same, low quality in recent time, just to make many fast, without proper scenario...bull..it",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I love it!,"Infinity War is a favorite among superhero fans. It tells the story of how the Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, confront Thanos, an Eternal, who is determined to gather all six infinity stones and wipe out half of the universe's population. The fate of the universe rests on their shoulders.It begins with a high stakes opening sequence on a ship, where Thanos and his children are introduced with well-written dialogue and a powerful score by Alan Silvestri. The Hulk's confrontation with Thanos showcases the sheer might of the Eternal, establishing him as a formidable adversary for the Avengers.Despite a large cast of characters, it balances them well without feeling overstuffed. It tells a compelling story in two and a half hours, maintaining consistently fast pacing. It features notable performances from actors like Josh Brolin, who plays Thanos with great intensity and Robert Downey Jr., who delivers some of the best-acted emotion in the entire MCU, adding depth to his character.However, some parts of the movie are criticized for feeling contrived or lacking in visual appeal. For example, the moment when Starlord punches Thanos feels forced, and the CGI and aging effects on certain suits are questionable.Despite these flaws, Infinity War is a monumental achievement in the MCU's early phases and stands as a convincing assertion that these films are indeed a form of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers: Infinity War: A Spectacle of Epic Proportions,"Avengers: Infinity War, the culmination of Marvel Studios' decade-long superhero saga, stands as a cinematic masterpiece that defies expectations and delivers an exhilarating and emotionally resonant experience. The film masterfully weaves together a multitude of storylines, bringing together an ensemble of beloved Marvel heroes to confront their most formidable foe yet: Thanos, the ruthless cosmic warlord seeking to restore balance to the universe by wiping out half of all living beings.At the heart of Avengers: Infinity War lies a complex and compelling narrative that explores themes of power, sacrifice, and the delicate balance of fate. The film challenges conventional superhero tropes, questioning the very nature of heroism and the cost of saving the world. Thanos, portrayed with chilling intensity by Josh Brolin, emerges as a formidable villain driven by a twisted sense of righteousness, adding a layer of moral ambiguity to the story.The film's action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking, showcasing the impressive power and skill of each Avenger. From the intense clash between the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thanos's Black Order on the planet Titan to the epic showdown in Wakanda, the film delivers a visually stunning and visceral spectacle that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats.Moreover, Avengers: Infinity War excels in its character development, giving each Avenger ample screen time to shine. We witness the growth and evolution of beloved characters like Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, while also introducing new heroes who make their mark, including the brilliant Doctor Strange and the enigmatic Scarlet Witch.The film's emotional impact is profound, as we witness the bonds of friendship and camaraderie forged among the Avengers tested to their limits. The loss of beloved characters is handled with sensitivity and depth, adding a layer of tragedy and realism that makes the stakes feel incredibly high.Avengers: Infinity War's most defining moment, the one that will forever be etched in the minds of MCU fans, is the ending that leaves half of all life in the universe decimated. This shocking and heartbreaking twist serves as a devastating conclusion to the film, leaving the audience reeling with questions and anticipation for the future of the MCU.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wonderful penultimate adventure,"The ending began slowly for me, but everything quickly picked up steam as the film progressed. You could really empathize with the characters and feel the urgency and dread as time ticked away.The MCU was a powerhouse before this film, and the film cemented its place in pop culture. Even if you haven't seen the movie, you've likely heard of and know what film is being referenced when someone says, ""the snap.""Ensemble pieces really hinge on the chemistry between the cast, and everyone here played so well with each other's characters, it was a real treat to watch.

One hot mess,"Two other titles came to mind as I watched this. ""The sum is much less than the parts"", and/or ""Way too much on the plate"". As I've said in an earlier review on the Avengers, you get into this superhero escalation where the next movie has to be even more threatening and the evil even more evil than in the last one. Avengers 1 was the best superhero movie ever made period. Avengers 2 fell into the problem I just noted. Avengers 3 has just way too many important characters, story lines, plot twists, issues, blah blah blah. And the motivation and plan for the villain is about as sophomoric as you can get. One good thing - Doc Strange is actually using spells now, not just body throws. There's a number of good moments in this movie but it's just way too much and at its essence way too stupid.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Great popcorn film, surprises the series with fresh takes","Well, Well, Well....I was so ready to tear this down - 19th MCU film, too many stars, bloated CGI, first of a two parter, and so on and so on...Yet, this is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under ""popcorn film"" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either.The DC people must be kicking themselves. The lightness and comedic touches are brilliant. You are laughing out loud, comedy level, but at totally organic character humour. It means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running time.The other big surprise is Thanos himself. Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos and Josh Brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains and I never thought I would write that.The stakes are real, the charisma levels are amazing, it is like ""Oceans 28"" and I can't wait for the sequel...that says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!!,"Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. 
So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). 
Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. 
And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. 
I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come.I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don't, I would be betraying myself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Marvel's best,"I saw Iron Man in the cinema when it first released in 2008, and still remember it being ground-breaking and awesome. Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.Avengers Infinity War reignited my interest in the MCU, as the movie itself was really well done in pretty much every way.

Thanos the Emo Crybaby...Thanos Mickey Mouse Style,"12 jokes within 3 minutes in conversation between Doctor Strange, Hulk and Iron Man in the beginning of movie. Too silly then super serious, switching back and forth. There were more humorous moments in this movie than any other MCU film, more than Thor Ragnarok. Avengers Infinity War should have some comedy description or category. Disney needs to stop with the excessive humor.Thanos motive is weak and uninteresting in film. 
I don't recognize Thanos THE MAD TITAN from the comic books, he's too simple in this movie. LADY DEATH's influence over Thanos is more coherent. But that's what happens when a children's company takes over a sophisticated comic book company, they change the stories for kids and add lots and lots of humor.One more thing, title of movie is incorrect. 
This movie is Disney's adaptation of the Infinity Gauntlet series, not Infinity War. 
What was the point of Disney' mixup of titles? The answer is Disney wanted to confuse people that might spoil movie with their comic book knowledge. This avoids negative reactions from social media during production to post production. 
 2/10 stars because of Disney's cheesy Mickey Mouse adaptation of Thanos the Emo Crybaby, Peter Quill should dance for Thanos to cheer him up.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good story, but lack of entertainment","I dip in and out of the Marvel Universe as after a while they all seem to follow the same trend. Hero is loses. Hero comes back even stronger. Big fight. Hero wins.However, the good thing about a cross over is that there is a bit more of a story, and that statement is certainly true with Avengers Infinity War.Overall, I enjoyed it. The story was good and I like that the ending wasn't a cop out and that it sets up for another. However, of the 20+ Marvel Hero's this film introduces, about 6 of them have decent air time. I love that Thor teamed up with the Guardians, this made for great comedic viewing, but for fans of the Black Widow and Captain America, prepare to be disappointed. The Capt punches some people and looks sad, BW has ' a girl fight' (which to me seems put in there, purely to please female viewers (which I doubt it will)).To sum this up in a sentence, it was a good film with an enjoyable story line and certainly continued the Marvel world, however, IT WAS NOT ENTERTAINING!!!!

A celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun,"Avengers: Infinity War is the seventh film in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the nineteenth film overall. Directed by The Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War), it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near-perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten years.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes, with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.Avengers: Infinity War is more than a typical MCU superhero film. It is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun. While the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act, its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings. The film's ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal domination. His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. Despite the film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). As is the tradition, be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scene.I rate it a solid 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An outstanding watch,"This is exactly the sorta thing I want from an Avengers film! Full blown, no punches pulled action. In that regard, it's an outstanding watch!Despite knowing practically little about the MCU up until a few weeks ago, I still knew this was a film that was going to see - so to speak - excrement hit the fan... and boy did it! It's a great ride.Like 'Captain America: Civil War' did, 'Avengers: Infinity War' does an incredible job at juggling the gargantuan number of characters. It's ridiculous, but totally awesome, how many faces we see appear again. I thought they got the screen time for all, more or less, down to a T. Not an easy job, that.Speaking of the cast, it's Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Josh Brolin who stand out most in my memory. Them three are excellent, especially the latter. Away from those lot, it's very cool to see all the other worlds - including from 'Doctor Strange' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - come together into one film. As for new additions, there aren't many - Peter Dinklage being the pick.There are many references that I had already become aware of just via the internet, so it was quite amusing seeing them all unfold here and there. The effects looked great to me, as they have basically all the way up until this point of the MCU.

Just wow. For a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release, it's incredible when it not only meets expectations, but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered. There are so many words to describe Marvel's latest - emotional, epic, fun, stressful, scary, hilarious, incredible. In about 2 and a half hours you will laugh, you will cry and you will cheer. It's a phenomenal achievement, the biggest marvel of Marvel yet, and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film. You don't need to be a fan to love this film.It's a very simple story without lots of twists and turns, making it very easy to follow - that is, provided you've seen all (or at least most) of the films so far. For those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series, everything will make sense and the characters are already known. By letting the previous films set everything up, that allows Infinity War to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word 'go'. The ever-important Infinity Stones themselves are much more than simple McGuffins - the film makes the audience care about them, Thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects. It's not just as simple as Thanos collecting six stones, however. Instead this doesn't follow the usual superhero story or structure, instead being utterly unpredictable, allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs. This is a very different type of superhero film, Marvel able to break away from the mould. This is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it. This is best seen in the ending which will go down in history, along with the likes of The Italian Job. It's a bold, brave finale - in a way I would have preferred a slightly more rounded end, but the film is too daring for that, instead setting things up for Avengers 4 perfectly (even in the post-credits scene).Considering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise, the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters, all seen through the structure of the film itself. Structured more like an episode of Game of Thrones, we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head. One moment we'll be with Iron Man, Dr Strange and Spider-Man, the next we're journeying across the galaxy with Thor and the Guardians, and next we find ourselves with Cap, Falcon and Black Widow. No character seems particularly side-lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen-time.Whereas Age of Ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters, Infinity War is the complete opposite, the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself. It's a relief then that, besides all characters having a fair amount of time, they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film, every group seeping excellent chemistry. It never feels forced or gimmicky, but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together. It also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years, able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly. With so many characters, a film like this shouldn't work, but incredibly it does and is all the better for it. None of the groups are ever the default boring one (unlike Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings), but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines. On top of that they're all hilarious. As ever, Drax might be the funniest; but there are jokes from Stark, Strange, Quill, Groot, Rogers, Okoye... the list is endless. In a film with so much heart and action, it's amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy. It's beginning to sound like a cliché, but this is absolutely the funniest Marvel film yet - certainly funnier than the majority of ""comedies"" that come out these days. Even the new character Eitri played by Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage gets his share of laughs. The biggest surprise with regards to characters however is Thanos. While his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland (with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary Ebony Maw, played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Infinity War's central villain Thanos is an exceptional antagonist, brilliantly played by Josh Brolin. As terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be, there is a quiet, emotional side to him. Unlike many villains, he's not looking for power for the sake of power. There's an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what he's doing is for the good of the universe. This is not an antagonist to add to the ever-growing annals of forgettable villains - Thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted. No longer will Loki be the best Marvel bad guy by default. Will he go down as the best superhero villain since the Joker?Of course it's not all laughs and chasing stones. As expected in a film like this there's action - lots of action. It's appropriate that the word 'war' appears in the title since this is by far the most action-packed Marvel film we've seen. Despite the nigh-on non-stop action, it never gets boring or seems like too much. With a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles. No two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh. It's a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another. The CGI and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed. Definitely worthwhile being seen in IMAX!The biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next, with no clues in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp or Captain Marvel in the interim (since they're set before the events of this film). Still, if the next Avengers film is anything like Infinity War we're in for another incredible treat. With terrific character interaction, hilarious comedy, sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night - it's all perfect. The 10 years Marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it. A splendid and monumental achievement. All hail Marvel - but beware, Thanos will return...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's odd how dull a film stuffed with action can be.,"I wanted so much to like this film but for me it came out as too knowing, self referential and repetitively dull.

The Marvel punch,"When I was a kid just after watching Superman II that one day there will be a film that will have in it, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman as well as other DC Comics superheroes but it will knocked out of the park by a Marvel film starring the Hulk, Spiderman, Thor, Iron Man and others I would had not believed you. Heck Black Panther did twice more business in the US box office than the Justice League film.Usually villains in superhero films want power just to destroy everything. Thanos the villain wants to bring chaos and destroy what seems half the population of the worlds in order to bring a new order of peace and prosperity. No more starving kids scavenging for food. It is a Nazi way of thinking, we get people in social media platforms who go on about how we need to control the population growth to save the planet. So reduce the population in Africa, in Asia in the Middle East. You know find a way to get rid of those black and brown people! Well Stan Lee who created a lot of the Marvel characters is Jewish and knew about the perils of this Nazi way of thinking.Thanos wants his infinity stones to get ultimate power. You might think he has never loved something or anyone but he need to make sacrifices himself. His quest for the stones sees him battling Thor at the start of the film. Along the way their are casualties which leaves you wondering what will happen to those individual Marvel films in the future.The Russo Brothers have certainly made a film where the various characters from the Marvel universe coming together feel natural and organic. Just look as to how well the Guardians of the Galaxy characters gel with Thor or Tony Stark.They also have made the film so well paced although the running time is a tad overlong. It starts with action scenes and the action scenes crop up in this film relentlessly but we also get humour and brief character moments but always you know this is a comic book adaptation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the best Movie MCU,"A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level. In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Best MCU film; a masterpiece,"Avengers: Infinity War is a film so powerful and good that instead of being crushed by the weight of its expectations, it lifted them up and launched them out into space. Packed with epic, intense action, fantastic character work, and a powerful ending, it doesn't get much better then this. It's especially remarkable when you remember just how much buildup there was to this film and how massive the expectations were, you would think it would be almost impossible to meet, but Infinity War does it so well it makes it look easy.The story is exhilarating, it moves at a brisk pace which really makes you feel the immense stakes and how urgent the situation is. Every single character is handled extremely well and are all in character. The film makes sure to pay attention to what spot they're in in their character journey since the last film each respective character was in and continues their development. It maintains continuity and brings every character together in a way that's organic and serves the story perfectly. Tony Stark finally gets to fight the thing he has been tormented by and preparing for years to fight, Steve Rogers and most of the other Avengers are fugitives of the law and thus are more rugged, Bruce Banner is still dealing with his conflict with the Hulk (continuing what was established Thor: Ragnarok), Thor is dealing with the grief of losing everything, manifesting in personal vengeance towards Thanos, and much more. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the characterization of Thanos, one of the best villains in cinema since Darth Vader from Star Wars (which was the intent of the Russos, specifically saying that the wanted to make ""the next Darth Vader""). He is a ruthless, insane and narcissistic monster, but he still has honorable traits, respects his enemies, he has a very flawed perspective of how to save the universe but believes it whole-heartedly, and even a fatherly love towards Gamora. He's terrifying but also humanized, and it just works perfectly.The computer generated effects, especially those that brought Thanos to life, are perfect, as is the soundtrack. While MCU scores are typically regarded as forgettable, Alan Silvestri's score for Infinity War is anything but. The performances are impeccable as well, there's not a single unsatisfying or uneven performance. Josh Brolin as Thanos, Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Benedict Bumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda and Zoe Salanda as Gamora in particular stick out to me and knock it out of the park.In conclusion, Infinity War is the best MCU film and one of the best films to have come out in the past 10 years, and I don't think you could ask for more. Infinity War (along with its sequel, Avengers: Endgame) isn't just a movie, it's an experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Better than expected but still has flaws,"Overall, I liked this movie. It was fun, awesome, and a great watch. I was worried that this would be another huge dissapointment for me like Civil War was, where the trailer was better than the movie. I have to say, they handled his movie pretty well. Still, there are huge pacing issues but it's a comic book movie with a lot of characters so i've got to give it a pass. But my biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't feel like an ""Avengers"" movie- they're all split up and such. The theme barely plays and when it does it doesn't feel quite right. The Russos don't really understand what the Avengers are, based on this movie. It doesn't feel quite as complete as the previous two. Well, this was a good movie, worth the hype, but I hope they improve for the next and final one. Part 2 is usually better, right?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disturbing experience.,"I am not a comics specialist and unlike most of the others I have no emotional connection to any of the hereos... so I might be biased.I have never expected much of a story line or intrigue from a movie solely based on the heroes presence, but being recommended as a revolutionary and number one of the series I hoped for at least a bit of cheap humor and great pictures.Yet, in the movie I've laughed twice, first time when Thor called raccoon a rabbit, and second time... when he did it again. The ending is surprising, especially for an American movie, but besides this the movie neither offers scenography comparable with Star Wars or Avatar nor any unique special effects.There is no consistency in action, power distribution or whatsoever. One minute the same character can die from a fist hit, the other he survives an explosion of the whole planet. Once he travels the space barefoot, the other he dies from being sucked from the ship. The colorful light goes back and forth but the evil character doesnt use any of his powers most of the time just to prolong the boring fights.Watching this movie is just distubring and frustrating.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Villain makes the movie work,"Infinity War is movie number 19 in the current installment of the MCU. Some say that the movies have lost steam. Or that they're burnt out on superhero movies. To those naysayers, Infinity War may not be enough to revitalize their interest. But to anyone who still loves Marvel movies, Infinity War is a welcome and satisfying addition to the collection.There was good reason to be concerned about this movie. The marketing pitch pegged it as the most ambitious crossover event in history, which sounds kind of cool but also comes with its share of challenges.Crafting a story that juggles this many characters seems impossible, and choosing the correct combinations of heroes to group together is tricky. Finding a villain worthy of taking on the entire universe worth of Avengers is perhaps the most daunting of all.I worried about each of these going in. After seeing the movie, I can comfortably say that Infinity War delivered on all fronts.Thanos (a commendable Josh Brolin), delivers in a huge way as the star baddie. He's the key to whole movie. It does not work if he doesn't deliver. Fortunately, he does.The plot revolves around Thanos and his pursuit of the six Infinity Stones, which he hopes to use to eliminate half the population of every planet in the universe. Most would call this genocide. He calls it mercy. He believes if life remains unchecked, populations will grow too large and civilizations will eventually suffer and starve.So, it's up to the Avengers to stop him. You get the idea.For as crazy as Thanos may sound, he comes across as a somewhat reasonable guy at times. His past even makes him empathetic. Also, and this is absolutely crucial, he's scary. Every time he appears on screen, the audience knows that anyone could die. Any Avenger could die. Thanos is that powerful and that ruthless.Though all characters did not receive as much screen time as they deserve, this was only the case because so many characters deserve and have had their own movies. Kudos to the Russo brothers for handling the situation as well as could possibly be expected.The character pairing choices were brilliant. Fortunately, Marvel benefits from the fact that the funniest Avenger, Thor, also happens to be the Avenger most likely to end up in space for a meeting with the hilarious Guardians.The group immediately strikes a comic chemistry, as Starlord struggles to maintain his confidence as his crew oohs and aahs over the hunky Thor. 
Spiderman and Ironman boast a similar dynamic. Peter calls Tony ""Mr. Stark"" and Tony calls Peter ""kid."" There's a certain father-son/mentor-protégé sort of never completely clear vibe that lends itself to comedic gold, especially when Spiderman proves himself to be as capable as anyone else, despite his age. Tom Holland is distinguishing himself as far and away the best Spiderman ever.Nearly all the good guys and gals have their chance to showcase their skills (except for a couple absences, which I won't name). Captain America, the Guardians, and Black Panther all receive well-deserved grand entrances. The filmmakers did such a great job using music to smooth the transitions in a few key scenes without overdoing it. You can probably guess which ones get their walk-up music.Looking back, this movie opens with a bang and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's fun, funny, thoughtful and fulfilling. I only have three complaints.1. I don't care about the romance between Vision and Scarlet Witch. They seem like fine people, but I just can't get there. Romance is not why I watch these movies. Also, her calling him ""Vizz"" is objectively hilarious, even though that wasn't the intention.
2. There's one scene with Thanos and Gamora that felt clunky and thin. This becomes problematic because it's pivotal to their relationship and the rest of the movie. You'll know what I mean when you see it.
3. The movie has a problem with stakes. Are there any? Again, you'll know what I mean when you see the movie.Despite my minor gripes, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It seems like most viewers did. Join the phenomenon and see Infinity War today. If you love superheroes, you will probably love this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Decade of A Masterpiece_Breathtaking and Heartbreaking,"Never in my life have I loved a movie so much I needed to see it again immediately after I watched it. My friend was still mourning the character deaths, so I took her home, bought another ticket and went straight back to that theater. This movie is marvelous. Not only am I a hardcore Marvel fan, but I am also a film student and a writer. I absolutely admire and give my applaud to Marvel, for having the patience, the courage, the directors, the producers, the cast, and the crew spending a decade turning 70 years worth of comics into this beloved franchise that brought those stories and characters to life.I'm going to do my best to keep this short and sweet, without spoilers. This movie should be getting nothing but appreciation and praise. This movie is for the fans, not trolls, not critics. The Russo brothers did exceptional, balancing each character perfectly to their own spotlight. Nothing felt over done or unnecessary, every moment was completely motivated and executed beautifully. The character pairings were well thought out, mended well, the character growth and interactions were fun, and I nearly lost it from excitement. Any scene with Thanos was amazing and stressful, his character arc was well developed and almost made me feel for his gentle side, but whenever he walked on screen I was scared for the heroes lives!! The actors, as always, were incredible, but their performances in Infinity War were outstanding, they all deserve Oscars. Despite the few heartwarming jokes and banter, the movie never shifted from it's serious tone, which I appreciate, as the actors held strong emotional moments that will undoubtedly leave you teary-eyed and heartbroken. This movie will leave you laughing, it will leave you shocked by the twists and turns, it will possibly leave you gasping horrified (like me) or screaming (like some fans), and the ending will leave you emotionally crippled by the cliffhanger, but you will be awestruck.The only thing that I wish was a little different was I wish the score was a little less dramatic and more softer and powerful to deliver that emotion further. I wish they got Hans Zimmer to score the Avengers, but I'm not removing a star for that, because all in all Avengers: Infinity War is a masterpiece, and it takes a lot for me to called a movie a masterpiece, even if its Marvel, but Infinity War pasted all expectations. Do not miss this experience. It is satisfying in all ways and never disappointed me.

Embarrassing me in front of the wizards!,"Avengers: Infinity War is a well-executed screenplay, especially considering the vast amount of content and characters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely had to deliver within the tight runtime of two and a half hours. Taking over the reins of The Avengers from Joss Whedon, the trusted team of Anthony and Joe Russo continues its success from Captain America: Civil War. What's fantastic about the third Avengers film is how they manage to build suspense and anticipation with each set of characters they introduce. The pacing works well, keeping the audience engaged throughout, and it features some of the best cinematography and visual effects I've seen.The movie begins with the Asgardians battling Thanos aboard a ship over the Tesseract, which contains the Space Stone. This picks up where Thor: Ragnarok left off, with the destruction of Asgard already a foregone conclusion. Thanos has already acquired the Power Stone-one of the six Infinity Stones-from the planet Xandar. As Thor and Hulk fight Thanos and his lieutenants, Thor is subdued, and Hulk is overpowered. A dying Heimdall manages to send Hulk back to Earth using the Bifrost. The story then swiftly moves to Bruce Banner crashing into Doctor Strange's lair, where he warns Strange about the impending threat of Thanos and urges him to seek help from the Avengers. However, reuniting the team is more difficult than expected, as Stark explains to Banner that he and Steve Rogers are no longer on speaking terms following Captain America: Civil War. Meanwhile, Strange guards the Time Stone at all times, keeping it safe at any cost. The story has significant depth, and this is only the beginning-a mere glimpse of the larger narrative. Without delving too much into spoilers, what makes this film so entertaining and epic is how all the characters finally come together within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The script incorporates some great comedic elements, especially in the interactions between Stark and Strange, who are alike in many ways yet very different. There's also emotional humor and weight in the relationship between Peter Parker and Stark. Doctor Strange is the opposite of Stark in many ways. Stark relies on science and evidence to draw conclusions, while Strange embraces the mystic arts-something Stark struggles to believe in. This tension adds an interesting dynamic, with Strange often putting Stark on edge. Meanwhile, the relationship between Parker and Stark has a father-son dynamic, with Stark feeling responsible for Parker's safety and vowing to protect him.With such a variety of different actors and actresses, this is the ultimate comic book package. It doesn't take itself too seriously and is the opposite side of the coin from The Dark Knight. That isn't to say Infinity War lacks dark moments, but it presents them in a more lighthearted way. The introduction of Thor to the Guardians of the Galaxy is handled well, with Star-Lord feeling somewhat inferior and inadequate next to Thor as they respond to the Asgardian ship's distress call. Another key part of the story is the relationship between Wanda and Vision, who are in hiding, much like Captain America and Natasha.Having watched this film a second time, and having seen all the Marvel films in chronological order leading up to it, it's clear that the story has been carefully built throughout the series, with a clear plan and structure leading to this moment. This is a credit to Marvel, and unfortunately, where the DC Universe fell short. My favorite scene is when Thanos acquires the Soul Stone, where the Red Skull explains that a sacrifice is required to possess it. Particularly notable are the character arcs of Thor and Gamora. Thor's loss at the beginning of the film motivates his desperate quest for redemption, while Gamora's relationship with Thanos brings unexpected emotional weight to her storyline, making her one of the film's standout characters. Gamora's relationship with Star-Lord adds to that emotional weight. Zoe Saldana has one of the biggest most impactful characters within this film. The emotional complexities between Wanda and Vision is also compelling storytelling. There is plenty of emotional impact as the film comes to its climax.To conclude, Avengers: Infinity War is a fantastic addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the comic book cinematic catalog in general.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My Favorite MCU Movie,"I adore this movie, and it is by far my favorite MCU movie. Each character gets at least one great moment or memorable line, they perfectly mesh all of the different tones established in the respective universes, and Thanos is an iconic villain that was truly given the respect he deserved. This movie has quite a bit of humor, but pretty much all of it worked very well to me. Normally when a marvel movie gets this long, it starts to get boring or it heavily drags during some points, but this movie is constantly moving towards the climax and really keeps you invested. I was so surprised by this, as I saw it with all of my high school buddies without many expectations of it. While Endgame will be remembered as the iconic end of the franchise, this will always be my favorite because of the attention given to each of its characters, and the excellent ending that subverts expectations and perfectly sets up our characters for the finale they needed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another typical Marvel movie,"Fairly bland plot considering that it is currently ranked as the 51th best film of all time on imdb. Not much character development but I guess that is what the sequals are for. The consequence of that is that the film really feels like another filler movie to cash out more on the Marvel universe. Hence the ending of the film of course.Avengers infinity war does some good like showing different sides of the antagonist, explaining his motives and the reasoning behind them (unlike that stupid villain in Justice League), and making him do challenging decisions. I also liked the dialouge between the superheroes, especially the Guardians of the galaxy crew and Thor. Their scenes were really funny and I like the fact that humor is a central part between these characters, it makes the movie stick out from other typical superhero action movies, and it shows that it doesn't take itself so seriosuly. Those were some original points that stood out to me and made me not rate it a 3/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Amazing!,"The deaths. I sent out a tweet right after I got out of the theatre saying that my one-word review of this film is, 'ambitious' and that's because of the outcome of many of this film's main characters. At the end of the film, we see Thanos complete his mission of collecting all of the Infinity Stones, with the sacrifice of his own daughter and Guardian of the Galaxy, Gamora.In my favorite scene of the film, Thor sinks his new ax deep into Thanos' chest, and Thanos says through a wicked grin, ""You should have went for the head,"" and he snaps his fingers, just like in the original source material and destroys half of all life in the universe. Moments later some of our favorite heroes start reducing to dust and every single person in my theatre was stunned.There was a moment when fan favorite, Black Panther started reducing to dust and a person in the theatre audibly yelled out, cursing at the screen. This sequence which had no music behind it was extremely eerie and shocking in a beautifully vindictive way.A lot of our favorite heroes were just straight up dying and the movie ends on that cliffhanger. I called it ambitious because we don't know if any of these characters like Spiderman, Black Panther, Scarlet Witch and many others are ever gonna come back. I mean they will be revived because Spiderman and Black Panther made like 2 billion dollars and are both scheduled for second movies, but right now they are dead. Our heroes lost and that's never happened before.Even though this is called 'Avengers: Infinity War', this is Thanos' movie at its core. Marvel has been building Thanos for ten years and in this movie, he cemented himself as the greatest villain in the MCU, which has had villain problems in previous films.

Quite possibly the most overrated movie of 2018... maybe the entire decade,"Before I bought the tickets for this, I was amazed, to say the least, by the high ratings at this site. Still being rather skeptic, the ride started, and it actually seemed promising in the beginning. As the movie proceeds, however, it felt for me like a bunch of characters fighting, in a typical ""good vs. evil"" manner, while the bad guy, who had so much more potential, seems to be utterly evil with some seemingly emotional moments of redemption mixed in. The atmosphere in the movie IS dark, much darker than the previous Marvel movies, actually. There was an ""apocalyptic"" feeling throughout the entire movie. However, I was still shocked by the public that showed many emotions during the screening. There was something I probably missed in the movie. I have the feeling that Marvel Studios simply used some ""plot holes"" inside this movie for the sake of commercialization and further production of the MCU movies. Regardless, I would recommend watching this because many people find this to be the best thing that ever happened to the MCU.DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another great MCU film,This was just as you expected. High action with some light hearted comedy thrown in. The plot had me guessing a couple times. You just had to roll with it. The avengers all seemed weak in this film but that was expected with who they were up against. One heckuva cliffhanger at the end.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Best MCU Film To Date,"This film is phenomenal. I have no other way of putting it, they do a amazing job especially with how big this film is. The Russo brothers do a crazy good job with managing this huge cast. Every character is given some sort of purpose and their time to shine and it makes for through the roof entertainment but also a well written movie.This film has a really big advantage over other MCU films, all of the characters except for one have been developed. It allows the movie to focus far more on the plot and making a quality story and less so on showing who these characters are. This movie is very fast paced, which creates what is the most entertaining MCU film.The one character that was developed was Thanos played by Josh Brolin. He is the best MCU villain because he was developed. Almost all of the MCU films have one issue and that is the villain. Most MCU villains are not given enough development to be considered a good villain. Thanos is the polar opposite. This film does an amazing job of explaining his character and explaining his motive. There are a few times where you actually ponder whether he is right and that shows how well written Thanos is.The action in this film is insanely well managed. You get to see each character have their action moment and makes for a really entertaining watch. The comedy was also very good and I feel they managed it a lot better than other MCU instalments. I find a lot of MCU projects use comedy at inappropriate times whereas this film did not.In terms of gripes there were a lot of plot holes, which is hard to fault them on because of how much they already have to deal with but plot holes are there and they need to be mentioned.Overall this film is amazing. The Russos do an insane job with managing this giant cast while providing the best MCU villain to date.9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians...

As Mediocre As Expected,"I wasn't going to bother with a review but then I read the first review by blparker that said everyone giving this a bad score were trolls who didn't see the film, then went on to praise it like it was Citizen Kane. I found that rather humorous. My suggestion is to see this in the theatre as the VFX are the only thing it has going for it and won't translate on the small screen. I had no idea this was a 2 hr and 40 min film until I bought the ticket and I seriously contemplated walking into another film because I just did not expect much from this film. When the film started it poorly leapt straight into a scene as if we were in the middle of the movie rather than the beginning. It didn't make a lot of sense other than a set up for on of the long-standing characters to die. Once we moved past this terrible scene it got a little better, which kept me in my seat 'cause the first 10 mins of the film made me want to leave the movie as I was afraid the rest of the film would be like this. It doesn't get much better but at the very least it manages to be entertaining.There is a plot, though, there is very little to it. If you know anything of the Infinity comic, which also was not that great, you know that a lot of characters die. The difference is they killed characters in the comic I cared about and the movies they don't even bother to have those characters, so, whatever. Secret Wars was a much better comic and tells how Spider-Man got his black suit, but it had actual story, so, I guess they didn't want to use a better comic. Infinity truly is one big dude fight. But not even that exciting of action. I thought the Black Panther action was better. I'd read that a bunch of guys don't like Rey from Star Wars because she's a Mary Sue, which I learned means a woman with ultimate, unstoppable powers. Funny, I've never heard a name for guys but they bothered to come up with one for women. Basically, every dude in this film is a Mary Sue. If Thor has the power to resist a star how is it he can't get out of a couple steel girders a wizard wraps around him? How is Captain America always so invincible? He was always kind of a lame character but now he's all-powerful in this universe. Why is Spider-Man suddenly Iron Man? What is the point of Vision, for someone so powerful he doesn't seem to do much other than whine.I did think Dr. Strange was cooler than his own movie in this film. Tony Stark, always likable. Thor was very enjoyable, and I loved his scenes with the Star Jammers. Peter Parker's humor was funny and I liked him better in this film than Homecoming. The best scenes for me were the Guardians of the Galaxy crew. Pretty much everything they do is good. The best comedic line was from the bald Black Panther woman, which, unfortunately they didn't show that much of her. In fact, this was a 2 hr 40 min movie with only 2-3 minutes of screen time for the few female characters they've bothered to add to the film Marvel Universe, who are mostly only in the films to make the guys not look gay. The Scarlett Witch seemed to be one of the most powerful characters yet her few scenes were only dedicated to talking about how much she loves Vision and fawning all over this boring robot guy who doesn't seem to have emotion. Yep, a real attractor for women. Black Widow has been lame from the start. A Shield Agent with no powers whom they've given laser guns to, on the team with a bunch of super powered dudes and a god. Lame. There's a long assortment of Marvel super power females they could have added to Avengers but they literally just added someone to look hot. It really annoyed me how underused all the female characters were in this film. Black Panther's sister was the star of the Black Panther film and she has no purpose in the Avenger film other than to cut out Vision's stone. She's basically an extra.I've never kept much up on Thanos 'cause he's a relatively boring character who wasn't very often used in the Marvel universe for the 10 years I read Marvel comics. I think he was more of a Silver Surfer or Rom villain...which, did anyone actually read those? I thought the idea that balance is used as bad and evil was a bad message. What is he now, an eco-terrorist? He didn't seem so much crazy as a Green Peace dude with too much power. Thanos chose people at random so he wasn't a racist, a bigot, or anything else, he was by the films portrayal an environmentalist. Humans thin out animals when they ravage the terrain. How is it different? I go to films to be entertained, not have these poorly plotted out existentialism by stoners moments. In the past 6 months, Infinity War, Jurassic World, and The Last Jedi all had these nihilist themes or moments where they are trying to express some weak, childish form of morality but it is actually anti-heoric, selfish, immoral, or just lame.I, in some way applaud the writers for making the film mildly entertaining despite the amount of characters they were working with. That is a challenge. But, overall there wasn't much story going on or actual emotion so I really didn't care when they killed off a good chunk of the heroes. All I could think was, ""Oh, his contract is up, so they're killing him off. They didn't use her anyway, so, of course she's dead. Oh, well, he's a new actor every 2 or 3 movies, so, no surprise."" Didn't care. The entire film was fairly unmemorable and my life could have continued just fine without seeing it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Ok, fellow fans. Here we are.","After 10 years of buildup and hype surrounding every movie that came out, We are finally here. The big showdown we've been waiting for since 2008. I, unfortunately, didn't get to see this in the theaters, but I got it the day it came out on Blu-Ray and watched it with some friends and fellow fans of the MCU. And.... Wow. In a good way. This knocked my socks off. This wasn't Joss Whedon like the first two (I might be wrong), but this was just as visually stunning and had the same effect. The end was a punch to the gut. A hard one. Anyway, the beginning was unlike any Marvel movie I'd ever seen. Thanos torturing Thor and killing Loki made lots of sense, since they had just seen Thanos's ship at the end of Thor: Ragnarok, and it was brutal to watch, and really made you hate Thanos right from the start.The middle was just as good, with some lighthearted moments like the Guardians' entrance (my personal favorite after Thor's to Wakanda) and some funny scenes with the Guardians (""Are you mocking me?"") and
the action scenes in New York with some banter involved with Spiderman. The part where Thor forges Stormbreaker was one of the most epic scenes in the whole MCU, and we finally got to see Groot do something other than play his game, which was needed.Thor's entrance to Wakanda, though... It's indescribable. I got chills then and I get chills just thinking of it now. Remember, the other Avengers (Cap, Black Widow, etc.) hadn't seen him in 2+ years, and he looked AWESOME (as always).Thanos, the villain, is my second favorite after Killmonger (Black Panther). He thought he was doing the right thing by trying to wipe out half the universe, and as much as we hated him, we sympathized with him. He was a great villain with really realistic motives, and the CGI, OH, MAN. Was it stunning. Every scene felt realistic, and I felt the power in every move and every blast that a character took. None of it felt fakeOverall!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Works better than it has any right to do,"I bought the hype a bit for this one, which is unlike me, but it did seem like an 'event' that this would be part of the end game for a series of films that have dominated the landscape for about a decade. Of course, it doesn't get to that point by doing much you don't know it will do, and as such there is plenty of action, special effects, witty dialogue, and big moments. So, in some ways it is the same as what these films have always done, but then again it deserves praise for not being what it could easily have been - a bloated failure of excess.Instead it is surprisingly light on its feet for a film that has so many characters in so many constant action sequences, that carries a lot of supposed darkness but yet has to do it with humor and entertainment value throughout. I know it is a mass produced product, but there is still plenty to admire in the construction of it. As a narrative it has a lot to offer, but the demands on it are too great to allow it to bring out what it could have been. The darkness of it is the best thing about it. Thanos is conflicted in a satisfying way, and the film is never better than when we get to see this - although that is not often enough. The other darkness is the loss of major characters, which is impacting in the moment, but is undercut by the knowledge that all or most of them will be recovered - not least hinted by the many character-specific sequels lined up in years to come. I still enjoyed the darkness these brought, but enjoyed it with the knowledge that it was probably all for show.The film runs long and probably has too much consistent action for any of it to really raise pulses, but it does the job for a blockbuster - with the characters, darkness, and humor all covering it pretty well. It is far from the brilliant film that some will tell you, and too much of it does feel superficial (which of course it is), but it works much better than it really has any right to do.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Cinematic Showdown of Epic Proportions: Avengers: Infinity War Brings the MCU to a Thrilling Crescendo,"Avengers: Infinity War is an ambitious, action-packed masterpiece that successfully brings together the vast Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) for a high-stakes showdown. Directed by the Russo brothers, the film merges nearly every major Marvel hero in a seamless, fast-paced narrative where the threat of Thanos looms large.Josh Brolin delivers a remarkable performance as Thanos, giving depth to a villain driven by complex motives, elevating him to one of the most memorable antagonists in superhero film history. The movie balances intense action with heartfelt character moments, making viewers feel invested in each hero's struggle. From Tony Stark's desperation to protect Earth to Thor's quest for redemption, every hero gets their moment to shine.The film's bold, unexpected ending is one of the most impactful in the MCU, leaving fans stunned and emotional.

A disappointment for a casual fan,"Every once in a while you walk out of the theatres after seeing the New Big Thing and disappointingly conclude: ""This wasn't made for me"". Which is fine. I don't follow the hype, I don't watch the trailers and don't bother keeping up much with continuity. I generally watch these movies and my reactions tend to fall somewhere in between ""technically competent but flawed"" (e.g. Doctor Strange) to the rarer ""pretty damn good"" (e.g. Black Panther). Because technical competency is never lacking - the writing is generally sharp, casting and acting as well.Infinity War is technically competent. From what I gather from the more avid watchers of these movies, continuity and fan-service is on top. It's really quite funny - I especially enjoy the Guardians team. But I don't think it's particularly fun, especially not after the first third. The pacing gets bogged down majorly in the second act and you can feel the plot structure bursting at the seems as it tries to force a dozen separate stories and half-hearted arcs into something resembling a traditional movie structure. And it still feels like an hour of character development was roughly cut. Somewhere in the middle of the movie two characters bizarrely meet after one has been missing and presumed dead - which is awkward - but the tension between them is never addressed after this point and I don't even think they share any more dialogue. Here is where the weaknesses in directing seem to become apparent to the point of harmfulness. The Russos directed the last two Captain America movies well enough (the last one being a better Avengers 2 than the actual Avengers 2) but Infinity War seems to be too big of a challenge. Maybe it was too big of a challenge for any director.A large amount of the focus on character-driven story-telling has fallen to Thanos, who until now has only appeared at the margins of the rest of the universe. And it kind of works. Many directors seem to struggle with relatable antagonists with clear and understandable motivations. That's what makes Killmonger so great. He's frightening because he just may be right. And the angle of antagonist-who-sees-himself-as-hero almost works in Infinity War. Except Thanos' motivations are so ridiculously - and I try to avoid using this word in general - stupid that I couldn't possibly take them seriously. Admittedly, a lot of people can and I'm not going to judge anyone for that. But Thor could have handed Thanos a book on basic political theory and obliterated his entire worldview.Half the audience was in loud glee and half was in loud anger when the credits rolled. And I have to say I was in the latter camp. But I'm not sure it's fair to get as angry as I initially was. Maybe I'll warm up to it on a second watching. For now, I feel cheated. If the movie was called ""Avengers: Infinity War - Part One"" I probably wouldn't have minded. Or if I kept up with the hype. Which brings me back to my original point. This movie wasn't made for me. I expected it to be something else. Most of the time I just wished the Black Panther universe had more to do with it. Or I just want another Black Panther movie. Infinity War has me exhausted on Marvel. It isn't bad or offensive or really any other strong adjective. It's just bland, poorly structured and disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

loves crish evans here omgg,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a bold and ambitious film that challenges the traditional structure of superhero movies by focusing heavily on its villain, Thanos. The film is a sprawling epic, bringing together nearly every major character introduced in the MCU up to that point. Despite the massive cast, directors Joe and Anthony Russo manage to give each character a moment to shine while maintaining a fast-paced, coherent narrative. Thanos, portrayed by Josh Brolin, is the film's centerpiece, and his quest to collect the Infinity Stones drives the story forward. Unlike many comic book villains, Thanos is given depth and complexity; his motivations, while twisted, are understandable, and his presence looms over the entire film. The story is filled with high-stakes action and emotional weight, as the heroes face overwhelming odds and devastating losses. The film's structure is unique in that it doesn't follow the typical superhero formula. Instead of ending on a victorious note, ""Infinity War"" concludes with a shocking and somber twist that leaves audiences in suspense. The visual effects are breathtaking, particularly the scenes on Titan and the battle in Wakanda. The film also excels in blending its serious moments with humor, ensuring that the tone never becomes too bleak.

Goes down (too) easy.,"High on battle scenes and low on actual substance, ""Infinity War"" is the culmination of ten years' hype. And that kind of buildup is embodied in the CGI; this is a visual feast (or marvel, if you will). I mean, this thing bursts with color.But it's also fairly empty. I mean, hey, that's a *lot* of characters to stuff into a movie, but it feels like one huge chessboard, whisking away certain faces to accommodate others. In that sense, this Marvel galaxy is fractured, and the movie feels choked with characters as a result.If I have a problem with this movie, it's this: the stakes are never real. Size notwithstanding, Thanos is especially weak here (given his buildup in the Guardians movies), and I didn't walk away thinking that (most) of the deaths are permanent. It's almost antiseptic in that regard; c'mon, they just fade away? Everyone's comparing this to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but that's only because it's a downer.

One decade of build up,"This is the movie! A decade of build up for this, and it was really good! The movie is just 2. Hours and 30. Minutes of pure action, people that were fans, were not fans or think they are fans watched this movie around the whole world, their are groups of characters that fight for the same thing and as the movie goes on, more and more characters group together until there is only pretty much 1 big group of heroes. This movie is unique because the heroes aren't the protagonist, it's kinda the amazing villain Thanos, he is emotionally driven and his story is great, he is kinda a hero, he thinks wiping out half the universe is necessary to safe the universe from problems caused by overpopulation, he knows it is crazy and solving a problem means trying not to hurt anyone but he believes he has to do it! He is constantly getting hammered by the heroes and you kinda feel bad for him, there is no villain. This is why he is a great villain, he is not trying to be a menace out to blow the world, he is trying to do his part and save it.Another thing I love is that anyone can watch it, anyone can enjoy it even do they don't care about marvel, the MCU works in a way that someone only has to watch some movies to understand that there is a connection with these stones, and someone going after all of them is a big deal! The movie is it's own think and is pure fun superhero action, it is great and truly has a infinite amount of fun.The movie is a must watch and is the big event in a way, it is kinda the first part and the second being Avengers Endgame, both movies are their one story at the same time as being a part of this now over a decade long franchise.

Crowded and a little overrated,"This was the movie we were expecting for a long long time and while Thanos is the best Marvel villain i got a feeling the movie was a little crowded with all the main characters. Sure, they do need to include everyone but on the other hand we never see them all together and the movies gives a vibe of being rushed around from one place to the other and you constantly need to be focused on what is going on. I love all the characters and actors are amazing performers and the story has got to be dark i do think it was a bit too dark since it does not have one positive moment and the Avengers team gets defeated on and on. Of course there is a sequel coming out but i do think a few positive moments would have been good. I loved all the performances and cgi is amazing so overall a positive experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Expectations were met.,"Infinity War is a astonishing film which serves as the culmination of everything that occurred in MCU since the first pictures. Would seem, the movie had to turn out obscure and overloaded, but screenwriters so skillfully bring one moment to another that the movie bewitches with the first until the last minute. ""War"" connects those who didn't know about existence of each other, divides the teams which developed in the past, transfers characters from one region of the Galaxy in another, accompanying everything with grandiose battles. At the same time the narration remains clear and fascinating. Of course, if you've watched the previous movies. It's not a movie for those who want to get acquainted with Captain America, Thor, Hulk and other famous characters.

Near-flawless action/space epic,"SPOILER: 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the third Avengers film and the 19th Marvel Cinematic Universe film overall, serving as a culmination of the last 10 years. Will not a full-stop (Avengers 4 comes out next year), it does a great job of bringing the much-teased infinity stones/Thanos storyline together. Lots of knowledge of the previous MCU films is assumed, especially the two most recent films which lead directly in to this film - 'Thor: Ragnarok' and 'Black Panther'. It might make some sense if you haven't seen the others, but probably not too much.The stakes are certainly high, with a number of deaths of key characters throughout (no spoilers) and the opening scene literally taking no prisoners. The vital part of this film is the villain, Thanos (Brolin) who - despite being large, ugly & purple - gets enough backstory and shows adequate ethos to almost empathise with his reasoning for wanting to destroy half the universe (via the infinity stones). While there's some deaths and plenty of tension/darkness in parts, there's still lots of laughs, mostly thanks to Thor (Hemsworth), Starlord (Pratt), Rocket (Cooper) and Drax (Bautista).The CGI is fantastic the entire film, with plenty of scenes in space and on new planets, which is always great to see - as is Iron Man (Downey Jr.)'s inevitable new suit. The way the team-ups are handled is done really well, with Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man (Holland), Black Panther (Boseman) and the Avengers all split up, so there's always different scenes moving things along at a good pace. The third act battle is not predictable and the ending is hugely shocking - certainly no cop-out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Arbitrary and capricious + plot holes,"There is a giant plot hole in the first 5 minutes. Apparently there was a boarding party and the Hulk character was hiding and sneaking up on the enemy. That is very out of character. Normally the Hulk attacks first, directly, and loudly. That part didn't make any sense. Then the Hulk lost in a simple fist fight, when that character has been through much greater ordeals. Then the Asgard transporter is activated when the machine was already destroyed! Such sudden and severe plot holes really made me p-----... made me angry and I vowed to rate 1 star. That was only the first 5 minutes. How they decide who wins against whom is so arbitrary and capricious, and never follows any sort of logic or consistency. I am willing to suspend disbelief, but the writing must follow its own rules! Characters can be smashed by giant boulders, their skin never tears like its made of diamond, yet they bleed from a fist. Pure nonsense. It never occurs to Dr. Strange to use a portal to get back home, when that is half of what he does. Lazy writing. The rest of the movie was entertaining though, with even more plot holes, so I settled on 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Detailed storytelling, well realised characters and a compelling villain.","I was there ten years ago when Iron Man graced our screens. I was too ignorant to see the movie in the cinema but I was there the second the film came out on DVD. One of my all time favourite cinematic memories was seeing The Avengers in 2012 with all of my friends, after Iron Man came out we saw every film leading up to the Avengers in the cinema and stuck around for each post credit scene. Here I am six years after The Avengers, Infinity War tickets go on sale and I buy two for the BFI IMAX in Waterloo for me and my girlfriend. I walked into this movie with nothing but high expectations and they were all met. This film benefits from the existence of the other 18 films in this illustrious franchise. It builds upon every single character thread and arc laid down in previous films. No theme is left untouched and no character is left without their traits and quirks. Time has left it's toll on some and has barely graced others. Iron Man's unwillingness to let go of the life he stepped into 10 years ago shows in his absolute eagerness to step into battle with his new nano-suit. Captain America's optimism has wavered but his ability to fight for what is right hasn't. The romance between Wanda and Vision doesn't feel random or forced because their connection has been present since Age of Ultron and especially Civil War.This film continues a theme long explored in the MCU, familial issues. First explored by Stark's complex relationship with his Father which culminated in 2016's Civil War this film widely explores the relationship between Gamora and Thanos. And what a relationship it is. Thanos is terrifying but the love and compassion he feels for Gamora makes him even more terrifying.This movie does what no other superhero film is doing right now, it uses it's original score (sorry Guardians) to the best of it's ability wherever possible.I would highly recommend seeing this film as it is amazing, it's characters well realised and is a creative masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Competent directing style creates a strong balancing act that pays off well,"I know I'm extremely late to the party, but I waited for a time to sync up and see it with a friend (we both have too many obligations in the education realm), plus I had to see Doctor Strange and Thor: Ragnarok beforehand.Now before I leave any impressions, know that my experience was dampened by students with a moronic goal of sabotage by deciding to blurt out anything about the film they knew that I wouldn't want to know. I mean... what can I do to them in retaliation? Fail them? Strike them down with the hammer of Thor? Nothing, they're untouchable and they know it. It's sad, and I thought I've taught them to be better than that. Unfortunately, that select few is out there and always will be. I've waited nearly thirty years of my life for a film of this impactful magnitude to come out in its respectful genre, and individuals half of my age decide to play the card of indecency upon me and essentially impede on the level of my viewing experience.All that being said... it was a very good film, even better than I liked it (the problem was the spoilers). In fact, if I were to list negatives for this film, it would really just be all in one lump-sum bullet point regarding the lack of grounded material: a lot of space related stuff, nanotechnology (and I really don't like the Iron Spider compared to regular ol' Spider-Man), whims of inexplicable magic sources, levels of seemingly unbeatable friends and foes where I don't understand the devastation of a punch or explosion onto the individual taking the blow, and the recurring MCU element of death not necessarily being a finality for characters' ends.Conversely, there were many things that I really appreciated about the film. The first thing I would like to mention was the balance of everything, starting with the balance of characters and their moments. I thought this was going to be a massive issue going into this film, where it would just be one endless action battle and people wouldn't be able to serve their parts correctly, or they would only serve aspects as a moment of convenience to further the plot. Instead, where everyone was at during any moment seemed very natural to the overall MCU progression of items, and interactions that were had (on top of some that have yet to occur, lying in wait for the fourth Avengers film) were nicely played out. Villain encounters even appeared late in the film, which is kind of nice so that the legend looms larger as the movie goes on instead of playing beats such as: ""We need three fights between hero and villain, so let's spread them out."" Even characters who are physically inferior weren't just suitably matched up with other characters of that nature, and instead they found a way to possibly hold their own or team up to make things equal enough so that the fights could be anywhere with anyone. None of this works just in script alone; this was done by the hands of great directing. The Russo Bros have found a way to serve this great kind of balance for two straight films, though in Civil War it really felt a little more like: ""Let's force the issue and get everyone on screen at once, even in a bit of a friendlier brawl."" Admittedly some characters miss the boat of even appearing in the film, but it was few and far between, and they are explained away where frankly it worked just fine.Another great form of balance was in the light versus dark emotional moments. I have been on Marvel for having too many lighthearted moments in their films, or really too much levity for the sake of entertaining the crowd on their first viewing of a film. They really pushed the envelope with Thor: Ragnarok, and honestly I was not appreciative of it. They needed to find a way to strike the right balance of when to say what and what surface level of comedy they need to inject during the characters given the moments, but most importantly every light moment needs to be balanced with a dark moment for emotions to hit the right heartstrings. Infinity War does exactly that. I wasn't eye-rolling when they injected humor, and only one or two comedic bits were out of place for the moment they were in. That is a fair price to pay for the overall structure. They had enough characters to find those moments with in the 160-minute running time, and for once they didn't have the villain(s) either be demoted to that same level of yuck-yucks nor did they subject them to another character's comedic relief as a way to actually victimize them.This is a great time to transition to this film's villain: Thanos. I have had my quips with MCU villains being rather underserved in scope compared to that of the larger picture at play, like where they may be more of a pawn so the rest of the chessboard could do its thing. Thanos, however, appears as the king of this universe's chessboard. He was the main character in this film, and probably had the most screen time. He was not just a villain seeking ultimate domination of everything for the sake of it, he has his own goals and purposes in an attempt to restore a harmonious balance (there is that world again) for all species. It was not only believable, but it was also sympathetic. He shows remorse for his (attempted) actions, he shows mercy to those who beg for it so long as they aid in furthering his cause, and he speaks with a level head in a way that if we haven't already had eighteen other MCU films liking our heroes so much that we would actually root for the bad guy here. Definitely the best served comic book villain in a decade, if not right alongside the Joker for 'overall' status. Granted, Heath Ledger has given us the performance of a lifetime, though that character is very one-dimensional (and really good at that dimension, no doubt). Thanos really surprised me that he was more than just a large purple alien wanting ""MOAR.""I want to give the directors credit for making an extremely long running time feel extremely short. I don't know if I'm sitting here saying that I'd like to watch a whole 'nother hour of the film, but they hit the right beats and paced it so evenly that they really made time fly by in a manner that other films really can't speak for in the same vein. For all the movies I own on Blu-ray, I sometimes stop short of watching something that runs this long because I tell myself: ""This is a long film man, you are going to be devoting a lot of time to this."" I don't think I'll be saying that about Infinity War. If I were to show this to a friend who hadn't seen it yet, I wouldn't be warning them about the duration of it nor would I fear they would be looking at their watch every fifteen minutes wondering when it would end. The more you get into the film, the more you lean forward on the edge of your seat. Yes, sometimes they do cut away from characters to get to others because they have to, but you never forget your place where others are at and you aren't dismayed at the next grouping's story line. It all worked so very, very well.I'll cap this off with one thing that wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be, and it was in the movie's action. There was nothing wrong with it, but outside of some last-act battles I wasn't ever really wowed by anything either. All visual effects were top-notch, though (ehem, Ragarok was not good here too). I do think I'm putting this on a relative scale though, because it's interesting that I say that looking back at the whole picture that I think the moments outside of the action were actually better than the action points themselves, not in terms of entertainment but just in overall value. That's a good thing too, so now you're not just sitting around waiting to be getting your money's worth again. This jumps back to how the film's length is not a concern. No action scene overstays its welcome either, or it has enough dynamic elements and cross-cutting that it fits properly (again, jumping back to Civil War, that airport scene was just way too contrived... this doesn't have that). Age of Ultron was much more of a popcorn flick for me that I really do enjoy, and The Avengers has all of its lasting appeal in the final third of the film when they all assemble together, so I think I can say this one is the most consistently put together.Overall, I would say that my experience was definitely a great one and it is likely hitting inside my Top 3 of all the MCU films (The Winter Soldier still wins). I'm not ready to officially rank it just yet and I still have a lot of questions about what I saw in this one, but again that's a good thing about this film's natural depth where I'll have to watch it more than once to understand and appreciate those items. I really think the thing that brings this movie down a notch was my experience because of spoilers beforehand, and I didn't want to believe many of them to be true but unfortunately many were. This is a movie that I even avoided watching trailers for. Any knowledge about an event I am already interested in does not help ramp up the hype by me learning more about it. Shame on them for doing that to my theatrical viewing, but thankfully this film did not only rely on its spoiler-bound moments to be as good as it was. It was very ambitious, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next because I really have no idea where they want to go from here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Good movie, but not that great to be on the list of IMDB 250","Greetings from Lithuania.""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) was a pretty fun and good movie overall. The ending kinda saved it for me to be a 7/10, ending was good and that is why i'm giving this movie 8/10. But i do not believe that it will end eventually the way it ended in this movie, common - there a more bucks needs to made from this universe. That said, i do not understand what is this movie making on the IMDB 250 list (currently at 30th position) - its definitely not that great. You can trow a rock at me if this movie is better then ""Terminator 2"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" - this only shows how many fans this movie and franchise has - not the quality of this product itself.Overall, ""Infinity War"" was a good 2 h 20 min escapism, but it suffers pacing issues here and there.

A long ways from the perfect scores people are giving this movie.,"The only reason I'm giving this movie a 6 and not a 3 is because of its daring script, which I might add, is WAY too heavy for children under 9. I feel sorry for parents who felt obligated to take their kids to this, because it is challenging and depressing, even for adults. There's also a fair amount of in-your-face murder, and allusions to genocide. There's so little happiness in this movie, I give the producers some points for getting it through the studio.I won't go into long machinations about the plot and characters. All of the characters are there, as far as I can tell, and it does get crowded. It's impossible to tell who has what powers at some points, since several seem omnipotent, with all manner of energy weapons. The problem with energy weapons as a plot vehicle, is that why do they even bother with learning combat? Why is an energy hammer more powerful than an energy spear? Why send packs of feral dog monsters if they can just be slaughtered? Can every single superhero breathe in space? Even Spiderman? He is aware that gravity is much reduced to swing on his webbing, right? Why does noone's hair or makeup get mussed after brutal combat, except on occasion, certain heros do get injured, stabbed, have their skin broken etc. There's absolutely no rhyme or reason to any of this, and it gets old.A few characters have mind-controlling powers as well, and that gets really hard to track. Some have novelty powers that seem as directed by the special effects department as anywhere else. The battles are relentless, and frequently devoid of all manner of scientific logic. If you can't stand watching modern video games, you don't want to see this movie, because it behaves much like one.The villain Thanos is definitely sinister, in voice and deed more than in looks, since he is a 3D construct, and I found it harder to take him seriously than the other live actors in the film. I still have no idea what Scarlet Johansson does, short of look good. She can fly around and kick things. THat's pretty useless to the other heros and villains throwing around energy bolts and space/time warping spells and weapons. For some reason, Thor has some of the most fearsome power, when he finally pulls it together in a method that is reminiscent of getting a lawn mower started, another thing which made absolutely zero sense.At times, the movie definitely feels made up as you go along, although there was a clearly defined plot that was crafted as a devilish and depressing cliffhanger, so that's the most redeeming feature. There is a good parable about sacrificing what is most important to us for ultimate power, and it is well delivered, so that's the main thing holding up this otherwise hollow picture.Big props to Zoe Saldana, for grounding and exploring the character Gamora, and bringing the best acting to a picture that doesn't leave much time for any of its big stars to do much but show up, make unfunny quips and fight. The writers were smart to give her as much dialogue as she had. Without the dynamic between her and Thanos, this picture would be nothing.I am curious to see how this predicament is addressed in the next film, since the evil fell across this movie and also Ant Man and the Wasp, but I fear that the payoff will be one drawn-out slugfest and energy weapon fest, and that, like Revenge of the Jedi, it cannot be as good as the depressing Infinity War/Empire Strikes Back tragedy flick template. This was no Empire Strikes Back however. Let's be real on that one.Let me add I'm being generous, because I'm an adult who can hack some of these comic strip films, especially the better ones like Wonder Woman. However, if you find the cliches rife in these movies intolerable, definitely stay away from this movie, because it is knee deep in many of the problems of this genre. And Tony Stark should be chasing Scarlett, NOT Pepper Pots.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel scores again,"Epic superhero team-up from Marvel Studios and directors Anthony & Joe Russo. When an alien named Thanos (motion capture and voice performance from Josh Brolin) begins to collect all six of the Infinity Stones, incredibly powerful artifacts that grant their possessor unimaginable abilities, it's up to the galaxy's greatest heroes to try and stop him. Original Avengers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Captain America (Chris Evans) join forces with newcomers Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and even the Guardians of the Galaxy, among others, but will their combined might be enough to stop Thanos' apocalyptic plan?The culmination of plotlines 10 years in the making, this is one of the biggest gambles in movie history, and it seems to have paid off. The directors and screenwriters somehow manage to juggle this many characters and keep the balance just about right, with memorable moments doled out to all of them. The plot itself is very basic (""Stop Thanos""), and much time is spent on well-executed action scenes and eye-candy science fiction set-pieces. The dialogue is very humorous, and the various character combinations are amusing. There are usually three or four story directions going on at once, with the action switching from location to location frequently, but never in such a way as to become a distraction or disorienting. The biggest question mark of the film was how well Thanos would turn out, a villain that's been teased for the last 6 years in these movies. I was dubious about Brolin's casting, as while I like him in many things, he never struck me as intergalactic demi-god alien appropriate. I'm happy to say that he works out fine, and while the effects work done on him is very good, his voice sells the character, arguably one of the best developed out of any of the Marvel movies thus far.I won't go into spoiler territory, but I will mention that the ending may befuddle or even anger some viewers. As a former comic book reader, I wasn't upset by it, and even expected it (even before the internet spoiled things for me).

I think it was too risky wanting to put together so many superheroes in one movie. We didn't even get to see Captain America or Black Widow for more than 15-20 minutes, in a 2h30m long movie. I was also hoping for a more epic final battle, like in the first Avengers movie. This one was too short and messy. Maybe we'll get to see a better one in the next film.

"I've seen it once, I don't need to see it again.","You know when you go on a rollercoaster ride with one of your parents? And, bless them for coming along, but they always complain afterwards that they feel sick, their back hurts and that they're just glad it's finally over? That's the reaction I had to this one folks.
With so many name characters having to have a slow pan, tilt up to face reveal shot before doing anything all the way through this film I was getting deja vu about one third of the way through the film, only to find the rest of it had to be so fast paced in order to keep all of those plates spinning at once, that your eyes and brain never get a chance to rest. For most of the movie all that's really happening at any one point is ""Remember these two guys? Let's have them meet for the first time. And now we'll cut to a fight between them and another band of generic villains"".
That doesn't make for a bad movie, but that can summarise what happens in this film roughly 4 or 5 different times, and unfortunately the break-neck pacing idea seems to have caught on because after seeing this movie I've noticed almost every other new film I've watched since try to do the same race through their story beats that more often than not leaves me tired.
I don't know, I've never been a huge fan of the Marvel Movie Machine, it's definitely had a handful of great films amongst it's wide variety of mostly pretty good ones, but this definitely falls into that second category - worth seeing if you're into these movies, but I'm definitely not going to sit through the whole thing again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Glad I saw it with MoviePass,"I'm not a follower of the Avengers movies, and I only went to see this one because I had a MoviePass. Yes, I know the comic book lore of the Avengers team and Thanos and the Soul Gems, it's just that the movie falls under its own weight of too many superheroes with too many subplots. Each character's presence is diluted because of the need to give fair screen time to each. Spider-Man, Bruce Banner, Black Widow, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, each Guardian of the Galaxy. And I don't know if it was just me, but the actors kinda seemed to phone it in for the most part. Of course, this isn't Tolstoy, it's a bunch of people with mutant or augmented superpowers traveling through space-time to stop an intergalactic warlord from retrieving gems that will give him the ability to rebalance the universe. There's a lot of contemporary humor in the movie, namely the millennial snark found in modern sitcoms. I don't get the hype, but I do appreciate that some people will like this. That's the beauty of having individual tastes: someone's pudding is someone else's broccoli.

I don't understand all the praise,"I'm not a huge fan of the superhero genre, but I'm able to appreciate these movies and have a good time when I watch them, however I can't say the same for Infinity War.Overall it was just a huge mess. A basic cliché formula which consisted entirely of several over-the-top action sequences with snarky one-liners from the ""characters"" every now and then. The plot barely made any sense, in fact most of the time I barely knew what was going on and the villain's motives were unoriginal and clichéThere was apparently supposed to be a lot of emotional weight to this film but it just wasn't there for me. The balance between all the humor and high stakes was just completely off so I didn't know which scenes to take seriously or not.I think the weirdest part of this movie for me was that the Avengers felt oddly out of place for most of it. The Guardians Of The Galaxy are featured far more prominently so the rest of the characters just feel like random background soldiers who show up every few minutes to kick some ass.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Oscars need a new category for CGI actors,"For some reason, the Oscar voters will never vote for a CGI actor because ""it's computer generated'"". That's BS. The character is brought to life by a real actor, and if the acting is flat, so is the character, regardless of how good the CGI is.
Josh Brolin deserved at least a nomination, if not the statue itself. This movie was about Thanos, and Brolin brought the character to life, showing that he was a man, but had a vision that would not be denied. The CGI was just adequate to keep up; it was the actor that made the character real. I was almost rooting for Thanos by the end. Almost. Chris Hemsworth and ZoeSaldena also both pulled out magnificent performances, but this was Thanos's movie.

10/10 Awesome epic adventure from start to finish..!,"10/10 and this is why..! I've watched this film three times now so I can get a true picture of it and honestly I enjoyed it more, the more I watched it. To juggle a huge cast this size and make it work is an accomplishment, and boy is this an accomplishment.Each character shines in their own way and the comedy is placed well, so not to take away the depth, the pain, the suffering and severity off this story arc. The SFX is some of the best ever seen in my opinion, yes there are some slight flaws here and there, but not enough to take your mind of the story on screen. Thanos looks amazing and for the true comic fans like myself Kevin Feige, the Russo brothers and the team at Marvel Studios have excelled in bringing the dark Titan from page to screen.Josh Brolin is totally worthy of playing this nemesis and Brolin adds heart, pain, power and a sadness to this character, as always the Marvel team hits a home run with the casting. Every little detail is put into Thanos. For a purple giant he looks realistic, from an eyebrow movement or a cheek twitch to a full on capable gladiator in battle stance, he looks like a living, breathing being.Where does this film stand against the rest of the MCU, well it's right up there in the top three. Some people might not like or even fully understand the ending, but the possibilities it sets up for the future of the MCU only leaves me with questions and excitement! This film has made some choices that surprised me as a comic collector and fan of 33 years, but I honestly thank them for that, the Russo brothers not only promised, but also delivered the film we've been awaiting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Difficult on rating since one did enjoy the film but at the same time, it felt somewhat predictable and unengaging.The film boasts many characters from each of their respective films and jam packs them into one. It is interesting to see everyone else involved in the interactions in which we haven't seen, such as the cast of the Guardians films messing with Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man.

Fun. But its the same old story!,"The sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), 'Avengers: Infinity War', which assembles almost ALL of its Superheroes in one single film, is the biggest Marvel Blockbuster to date. Although an event for us cinema-lovers & the biggest film of 2018, 'Infinity War', despite being truly fun, is the same old story. There is not much difference between Avengers 1, 2 or Infinity War. Its the done to death Good versus Bad story.'Avengers: Infinity War' Synopsis: The Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.'Avengers: Infinity War', which has taken the biggest box-office weekend globally in history, becoming a milestone at the ticket windows, is truly an event. I, myself watched the film yesterday in an almost packed house, here in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The audience, including me, found ourselves at times clapping & whistling for the superheroes, who at every point, try their best to defeat the menacing Thanos. It was an experience, of course!But, here's the thing. There is a difference between being excited & enjoying, and there is a difference on what the story is all about. While the stakes are higher here for its multiple heroes against one villain, the baddie here too, like Ultron or Loki, is out for destruction of the world. Or maybe half of it. And that's where 'Infinity War' fails to rise above its mediocrity. I am not expecting a Masterpiece here, but at the end, I feel as I'm watching the same film again & again. And while I WILL NOT give away ANY SPOILERS, all I can say that 'Infinity War' isn't even brave enough to take giant strides in its storytelling. Its the same film, with more action, more heroes & more havoc.That being said, this isn't a bad film from any angle. 'Infinity War' is a fun watch. The action-sequences are fantastic, the graphics are simply terrific & the humor & banter between its heroes, raises many richly earned laughs. I wasn't bored here, despite its predictable narrative structure. Its an entertainer, for sure!Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's Screenplay is a good mix of fun & maddening action, but plays it safe overall, despite raising the stakes. Anthony and Joe Russo's Direction is extravagant. Cinematography is superb, while the Editing could've been a bit tighter. The film is a bit too long at a 149-minutes! Art & Costume Design are perfect. Alan Silvestri's Score is excellent, as always. And the Production Values, are top-notch!Performance-Wise: Josh Brolin as Thanos & Zoe Saldana as Gamora, shine the brightest. Brolin gives the villain a character beyond the bad, while Saldana adds heart & depth to her part. Of the heroes, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, is very entertaining & his comic-timing is spot-on, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, continues to raise laughs & portrays his part heroically, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, is good as usual, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Strange, is painfully one-note, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, is efficient & Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, is extremely likable. Special Mentions for Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer & Peter Dinklage as Eitri, who stand out in their parts.On the whole, 'Avengers: Infinity War' offers a bang for your buck. But its the same old story, once again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers a flutter,"Marvels studios Avengers: Infinity War certainly lives up to the hype it generates.
Now take a slow peek beneath the 'hype' and what do you find?
You will see a repeat of what previous MCU chain movies offered:
Slick action and stunning visuals.
The producers know this mix works very well at the box office and so it comes to no surprise they apply this same formula again here.Supposedly the culmination of previous MCU movies, Avengers: Infinity War is where superheroes gather to prevent the main villain Thanos from acquiring a set of supernatural stones in order to become the most powerful being in the entire universe and beyond.With a disjointed plot, mediocre story line and poor character development for the main villain, Avengers: Infinity War falls below expectation as a standalone movie.
The story line totally fails in building up the viewer's eagerness for their superheroes to give Thanos a good thrashing.
(The exception maybe fanboy's for Bruce Banner)
The supers are made to look as if they are a bumbling bunch, caring more for their kin than saving the entire universe.
 On the opposing side, Thanos is a grey brooding being waiting a chance to tell his (or it's) dull life story....yawn.
Thano's screen presence doesn't invoke anything out of the viewer's emotions. No fear, anger or even sympathy; Nothing!Towards the end of the movie I thought it would have been just super if Dr. Strange opened up a portal from the 'other' alternate superhero universe for the man of steel to come and beat Thanos out of his boring stone hunting life.As of previous MCU movies, nutty one liners are a prerequisite and here in one glaring instance the scriptwriters stooped low for this.Is Avengers: Infinity war a great movie?
Opinions differ on opposite ends and with respect to that, let me say that Avengers: Infinity war is not great and not even good a movie.Parents (If family values are high on your list) with young kids wanting to see this, be aware that Avengers: Infinity War has a dark underlying theme.2 stars, one for Tom Holland and the other for Tom Vaughan-Lawlor.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Superhero odyssey,"A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level.
In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second.
It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop.
'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cash grab! They are stretching out this story into two parts.,"The movie had some good character moments but aside from Thanos' story arc, which was interesting, the movie was a convoluted mess. And not even all of the action kept me from yawning. Dr. Strange had some great action scenes but for the most part the choreography in this film was nonexistent and sloppy. And If people thought the humor in the Last Jedi was out of place then you will really be disappointed here. Unlike Thor Ragnorok, the humor in Infinity War was for the most part; not funny and it came up at wrong moments in the film, which removed the seriousness in certain situations.Even the acting seemed lazy, especially the performances of Ruffalo and Evans. These guys are running out of steam and put no energy into the roles this time. Even Robert Downey and Tom Holland lacked the chemistry they have often displayed in previous films. Perhaps its not their fault but the due to the fact that they had so little screen time. This film might as well be a Guardians of the Galaxy film, but they called it an Avengers film because they have more prestige. The film should have been called Infinity War and that's that.To sum it up, this film is a 2.5 hour long first act of a three-act film.

What did we expect?,"The hype for Avengers Infinity War was truly real. The expectations were to the roof with this one, but I'm afraid we all did a huge mistake on what to expect. Can a 150 minute movie deliver on the level of these expectations and hype? Well it can't, but this movie does it's best.This film is completely different than any other MCU film, and any other film in general, and you will find that out when you see it for yourself. You must be happy to see your favourite character even for 5 minutes in this movie, that's one of the necessary cons of the mix, and we shouldn't expected more in the first place.The movie lacks basic plot development. That'sFORTUNATELY not a very bad thing in the end of the day. 
In general, the movie delivers what a 150 minute movie with 20+ main cast can deliver. The consequences were unexpected, and shocking, and the Russo brother did their best. I'm sure if you go to see he movie with low expectations you will enjoy it a hell more.

An epic blockbuster that lives up to the hype!,"Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is an epic blockbuster that scratches that superhero itch you've felt since its trailer. With a cast as big as Thanos and action that blows you back into your seat, it's hard not to re-queue when the film is over. 
Unlike the destruction caused by Loki in the first film and Ultron in the second, with this film, Thanos brings a whole new definition of threat. The heroes' greatest battle begins here and the special effects, acting, emotion and intertwining story arcs make for an exiting Marvel experience. 
The humour element was well balanced, unlike the changing trend with some of the latest Marvel instalments, and the chemistry between characters seemed authentic. I do admit, however, that some scenes seemed disjointed and proved to block the flow of the narrative - a minor nit-picking issue. The pacing of the film flowed well and at no point, in the 2.5 hours, did I feel bored.

Incomprehensible Unless You're a Fan,"A movie should stand on its own two feet as an entertainment experience. You shouldn't have to watch 18 other movies first in order to enjoy a film. Unfortunately, to enjoy Avengers: Infinity War, you really have to have seen all the other MCU films or this film doesn't really make any sense. Hell, they rarely even introduce characters by name, let alone give you any clue as to who these people are. It really takes shalllowness to a whole new level of yawn-inducing ennui.It's not like I haven't seen any other Marvel superhero movies; I've seen several. When I was a kid, I read the comic books. And I still had no clue who most of the characters in this movie were! And I certainly didn't give two hoots whether they lived or died.The film is a spectacular, eye-popping kaleidoscope of sumptuous costumes, special effects, and MONEY spent lavishly on just about everything. The salaries for the all-star cast alone must have sucked up a huge portion of the film's budget. But who cares? If you weren't already invested in the characters, you aren't going to become invested in this sea of nameless wisecrackers spewing rather clever (but pointless) dialogue endlessly.I couldn't make it to the end, I walked out about halfway through. I hear the end is the best part but I couldn't summon enough interest to care. They lost me with the meaningless major death early in the picture. Snore! I don't go to a film to see favorite characters bite the dust! Especially since they'll just have to resurrect people so they can make their various contracted sequels in their own franchises. This film is an expensive waste of time unless you're a rabid fan.It's all about the story, man! Without a good story and some time spent up front getting you invested in the main characters, a movie is nothing. Black Panther was terrific because it had a terrific script but this film sucked rocks because its script was a shallow, mediocre snooze despite the witty repartee. Don't bother unless you're a big fan of the MCU.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers...Assemble?,"""Avengers"": Infinity War"" is an epic unlike any other. It's a reminder of how far the MCU has come in 10 years and this movie capitalises on its bloated, but beloved cast to draw you in. Every character gets their own moment to shine a little, the dizzying, vibrant comic book action is satisfying and defies conventions. While admittedly, this darker chapter in the Marvel movie-verse is oddly paced and suffers from the occasional tonal inconsistency, all issues can easily be forgiven as almost each scene is a sizeable dosage of fan service. Josh Brolin as Thanos deserves all the attention he gets, as he is a villain with a tragic story to tell. For really the first time, the consequences are felt and resonate long after the credits roll. non-stop comic book action and surprising emotional depth. While a little uneven at times, its beloved cast, outstanding villain and sheer scope never underwhelm and the end product is something truly epic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Marvel has set the bar super high with this movie!,"I've enjoyed a large chunk of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Not all of them worked for me, but I gotta say Avengers: Infinity War has set the bar really high for Superhero movies. Without spoiling anything (and believe me, this is a movie that works best without spoilers!), all I can say is there is a lot of darker and edgier stuff that will surprise you, as well as the Comedy you expect from a Marvel movie. However, perhaps most surprising was the main villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) having alot of character development in it. He's a bit more complex than your standard Superhero villain, but also very menacing and quite sympathetic too.I worried about the movie having such a long running time and having to 
focus on a lot of the characters, but to Marvel's credit, they pulled it off extremely well and the 2 and a half hours running time went pretty quick. The action is what you'd expect from an Avengers movie, it was never boring to me and I found it pretty funny myself. No issues with the CGI and everyone acted decently in it.The amount of discussions I had with friends and families after coming out of seeing it was insane, as well as the other audiences. Depending on how invested you were into the Marvel characters in previous movies will affect how you feel about it, but I think as a movie that ties and groups a lot of the characters together in one big Blockbuster, Infinity War has exceeded what I can hope for. It had action, emotion, comedy, and is pretty close to a perfect package you could expect from one of these movies. I can't wait to re-watch it and hopefully part 2 will live up to expectations.9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

As a standalone movie was a disappointment,"As a likely minority in the over-rated super-hero extravaganza, Infinity War as a standalone movie was a disappointment. It pandered to the audience with simple script devices where the superheroes were made to look pretty stupid, uncertainly un-Jason Bourne like in mentality and behavior. The evil ones were able to convenient arrive just in time to continue the storyline that could have easily ended multiple number of times at any number of points if these multitude of conglomerate, almost innumerable superheroes could actually learn to work together and obtain the oneness that comes of Buddhist, Eastern cultural wisdom of the importance of society over the individual. The backstory of Thanos and his daughter was too brief and insufficient to provide a more complex and bonded emotional connection is one problem. And another problem is simply too many superheroes that almost makes the movie more about heroes becoming the norm instead of super. It's almost now about many people who appear to be super but the movie is populated with so many of them that really it seems that they are normal people with extraordinary differences that the audience has seen so often that they almost appear normal now, nothing really special anymore, something the audience just comes to expect. Overall, the movie substantively is pretty superficial and the plot while challenging includes too many cliques and uneven tone from a chaotic fusion of trying to be so cute and funny, to serious and emotional riveting so much so that it becomes neither.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"The cumulation of a universe, 10 years in the making","Avengers Infinity war was great for me as a fan of both the comics and the MCU ever since its inception. However, i can absolutely see the flip side of this, being a celebration for the past 10 years of the MCU it manages to embody the theme, tone, emotional stakes and attachment established in the past 10 years. Thus, for an audience who has barely seen any of the MCU films they might find it difficult, confusing and even just a storyline mess with no emotional stakes or attachment to the characters that I as a fan embody.Infinity war embodies all that comes before it and because of that it was able to deliver action, spectacle and a complete combustion of stories that it wouldn't be able to without this rich background and journey that has culminated to this moment.Despite all this, infinity war does still manage to weave in character arcs and development, characters like iron man, Scarlet witch, Star lord. All got meaningful character building arcs. While many other characters were unfortunately rather lost in the mix. But, these are just minor complaints considering how good of a job the Russos have already done in balancing stories, characters and handling brilliant action scenes. Considering the astronomical task of crafting the film there has to be characters that are more in the background and playing second fiddle, and I think that is perfectly acceptable.But arguably the films greatest victory is in Thanos, this is very much his story. Not only did we get a pure world conquering, villainous villain but we got to see so many sides to him. We saw brief moments of tenderness, but still see the menacing all conquering 'mad titan' that he is.more importantly, he had a motive that isn't of selfish origins. Thanos actually has a point and that creates an ability for audiences to understand where Thanos is coming from. This is something that marvel has had a huge issue with in the past but with Thanos and even the recent Killmonger perhaps marvel has finally found a way to fix its notorious 'villain problem'.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

How can this be so good?,"Quite honestly this shouldn't work. Marvel has been approaching its breaking point for a while now. By conventional wisdom there are too many characters, too many storylines, too many warring threats and points of interest. We could even kind of see it in The Age of Ultron. Too many plot points, too vast a scale, too far-reaching a scope.But somehow Marvel broke through. This is an amazing movie. It is everything that was promised and more. A third installment that actually manages to raise the stakes, to deliver something that feels bigger, grander, more epic than anything we've seen before. And keeping in mind that this is Marvel, and that we have seen some truly astonishing things already, that is saying something.So what exactly did they do to pull this off? Well, for one, they absolutely nailed the villain. Thanos (Josh Brolin) had already been teased multiple times in previous films, but he had always been a big question mark for us. Would he truly be that threatening? Would he actually have the menace, the charisma and the ambition to stand as the biggest threat the Avengers had ever faced? I'm glad to report that he does exactly that, and more. Thanos might very well be the best villain Marvel has ever produced. That is not as high a bar as it perhaps should be, but it's still plenty assuring.The usual tricks are also in full display and they work marvelously. Beautiful CGI, good character moments, lush backgrounds, fun character interactions and a real sense of adventure. Granted, the storyline is one of the grimmest yet seen in Marvel, but that merely makes it all seem worth more.Now, to be fair, this is only the first part. The Infinity War will continue in the next Avengers film. But this is one of those rare Part Ones that manages leave you begging for more. That ending... We will be talking about that ending for decades to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Avengers: Infinity War,"Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we've learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn't a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement.With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it's impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what's going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters.The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here.So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn't completely polish things up as well as they could've.Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Avengers: Infinity War is an excellent culmulation of all the previous movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"If you've read my reviews on this site over the years, you must've known that I love superheros and especially Marvel ones.

I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure!

To Infinity,"This review of Avengers: Infinity War is spoiler free***** (5/5)IT'S ALREADY CLEAR that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has installed a lot of pressure on themselves, with social media it's hard enough to create an ongoing trend, but as soon as the trailer for Marvel's 19th and biggest film Avengers: Infinity War launched it became the largest trailer ever on the web with more than 200 million views in just 24 hours. That was a monster record in itself as no other trailer has ever done that, addition to that the pre-sale tickets were selling like hot cakes. The pressure was perhaps too much at this point and there was quite a bit of speculation whether the film would live up to the almost infinite (sorry) hype, well, the time is here as brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo have created an unmissable Marvel film that delivers a dark storyline featuring shock to shock.Firstly, Infinity War isn't just the culmination of the last few years of Marvel installments, it is the culmination of the last 18 Marvel in ten years, starting from the first Iron Man to now and take our word for it, it's worth every second of the ride. This one opens without the traditional Marvel fanfare overshadowing the logo, instead it's almost deafening, we open not long after the impact of Thor: Ragnarok with the destruction of Asgard and suddenly Thanos (Josh Brolin) a giant purple gilactic warlord puts the survivors to the ultimate test to try and possess all the six Infinity Stones which will put him in control of the entire universe. But it's from minute one that Thanos is not a villain that can be beaten with just the swing of a hammer (Thor should know that), the Avengers are put to the ultimate test.Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is challenged strength to strength. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is tested through his limits. Captain America (Chris Evans) will find that this is no easy war to win. The story written by Captain America: Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is dark, darker than all the previous Marvel films before, here nobody is left without a fight, and in terms of scope this has the biggest ever battle scene (but we'll get to that). And at the helm is Marvel's darkest, deadliest and strongest villain Thanos and it's Josh Brolin who's up for the role once again as he said at the end of Age of Ultron ""I'll do it myself"" and he delivers in spades delivering shock to shock, many dark turns and lots and lots of bodies at his feet. And it's clear that the Russo's have brought the impossible to life, and it won't leave without deeply cutting into your very skin.How dark is the story? Well that really depends on how much light is at the end of the 149 minute long tunnel, but in terms of how many lives are at stake probably not much. But just like every other Marvel villain Thanos comes with a past, and Thanos' past isn't anything to be triffled with, a past that's filled with war, turmoil and death but anybody who knows his history should know how dark he really is, and despite the many family friendly filters there are through the never-ending saga, he is the darkest one ever. Yet, thanks to Brolin's fantastic performance he's also the most compelling, yes you heard that right he's even more compelling than Loki. But unlike the Asgardian God of Mischief the giant purple warlord isn't simply misunderstood, neigh, he's just a menace. However prepared you may be to watch Thanos putting the universe through ultimate destruction, you aren't ready for the damage he might leave behind, and put it this way, there's a lot of deep scars here, so prepare for the damage.Yet, the film isn't always dark, there is some lightness here. It's also very, very funny. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is momentarily left speechless. The Guardians are up to to their usual high stakes camaradarie, Star Lord (Chris Pratt) isn't afraid to show his light self, Drax (Dave Bautista) once again shares his comedic duo act with Rocket (Bradley Cooper). It's almost as if McFeely and Markus watched both Guardians of the Galaxy films and jotted down all the jokes. But honestly who would blame them?Happier still with a long running time, a compelling villain, an all star cast, some very funny jokes and several storylines to follow Avengers: Infinity War stays massively intact thanks to the Russo's exquisite directing style who handle the project beautifully, from handling the massive cast without feeling any fatigue (sorry Joss Whedon), through the expensive yet stunning CGI battles, to the mammoth sized final battle scenes. If you thought the battle of Sakovia in Avengers: Age of Ultron or the battle at Berlin's Leipzig airport in Captain America: Civil War was big then this is a mammoth battle. Indeed Infinity War is worth the decade long wait and who knows maybe the currently untitled Avengers 4 may be bigger than this. However big it is, we certainly can't wait.VERDICT: Quick on it's wits and quick on it's whims, the 19th MCU film delivers all of them on an intergalactic scale, you may not be prepared for Thanos, but then neither are our heroes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

So much to pack into 1 film - should Infinity Wars have been a trilogy?,"First of all when I rate a film, I use this system for rating - 5 is a pass, 6-7 merit, 8+ distinction. I NEVER give a 10./10 because it's IMPOSSIBLE to make a perfect film. Thus my 8/10 would be 8.5 (distinction) if I could give half a star. Thus this film is VERY GOOD, but has a few issues.Because of the nature of the film, there are a LOT of characters, so inevitably some characters (2 in particular) is glossed over. Even Stan Lee's cameo was as brief as it could be (but considering his health that is understandable. This is the ULTIMATE crossover movie - virtually all marvel movie is represented in some way.To say this film is action packed is an understatement - if anything there is TOO much action - I could make a decent case this is 2 films rolled into 1 - hence the title of the review! Having said that, all action scenes were well done, and the issues re CGI I had against Black Panther weren't present here.As was shown in trailers, Thanos is on a quest to gather all the infinity stones to complete his plans for the universe. As such, Vision is a key target. We begin however in the cosmos with the Ragnarok survivors in a spot of bother. Loki shows his best & worst, and my appreciation for what Tom Hiddleston has done with this character is never higher than here. From here keeps flashing between earth & the cosmic realm - bringing into play the guardians.From here, it is standard MCU fair - if you've enjoyed any of the other movies, you will love this one. The big difference is Thanos - played fantastically by Cable - sorry Josh Brolin (nod to deadpoll ;-) ). and BOY has he done a fantastic job. All the claims that killmonger was the best villain in the MCU - are made to look VERY silly after watching Thanos. His plan is beyond diabolical, but the way he is played, it is quite possible to sympathise with him. Without saying WHAT he is trying to do, his motivations are to be benevolent! Whilst if he succeeded would be about as horrific as is possible, he doesn't do it to be evil destructive. In HIS mind, he is trying to prevent an even worse catastrophe! Yes the film plays it from Thanos's POV, and Thanos is taking a macro view of the universe! What is so great, is how Thanos is portrayed with a level of sympathy. It's as if Thanos doesn't WANT to do this, but he sees it a the only way to ultimately save the various species!I can see why people may not like this, there's things in here that I wouldn't have done. But for me, there is NO QUESTION this is an excellent film - but unlike many of the recent MCU films, no way could you consider this a romp! It's a complete tonal change from Ragnarok. And that is what I love about the whole MCU. They aren't afraid to change a working formula.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I've DELIBERATELY not discussed much, as this film needs to be seen - if nothing else Josh Brolin's performance. This DESERVES to make way much more money than Black Panther. When politics change, Black Panther will not date very will - Infinity War WILL in my view.the trailers fairly represent the movie. You like them, you WILL love this. Oh and Peter Dinklage shows why he is such a giant talent!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Thanos is the most powerful villain we've seen to date and the avengers, who are torn apart (following Civil War) are not prepared for this. And then insanity ensues accompanied with real stakes and potential dire consequences. It's a great story filled with twists and surprises. 
I enjoyed it a lot and I think so will everyone as I predict this will beat the opening weekend record (set by force awakens) and cross the $250 million line.A review will be uploaded to my YouTube channel (OddinaryProductions) very soon and I will answer any questions you have regarding the movie. Thank you for your time :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Big fan but big disappointment,"To cut to the chase without spoilers. This movie is a drama and i advice everyone who want to see this movie to do it, but not now. You HAVE to wait for the next part of the movie and before that appears go and watch them both. I´m a very big fan of superheroes and went and saw every movie fom Marvel and DC but this movie only disappoints. I have the expectation to walk out of the theater and be glad with a good taste in my mouth but after seeng this movie i only went out angry with a very bad feeling in my belly. That´s not the point. I realy don´t understand why they did it in such a manner when they could have done it 100 times better.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Bold, brazen and ballsy stuff that isn't afraid to go dark; incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense and satisfyingly unconventional.","'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)' is bold, brazen, ballsy stuff that's dark, daring and manages to deftly dodge all of the deep chasms that come with having the sheer amount of characters it has, all with rich histories and personalities as different from one another as their respective films are from this. It's remarkable how well it keeps each of these in focus while also keeping them true to who we know them to be, amalgamating their presences perfectly with this new tone so that nothing is lost yet nothing stands out. Admittedly, many of even the key players don't have much to do but all of them are well drawn and exist within the world in a tangible space, fulfilling their roles in the best way they possibly can. It feels as though this is the best version of a film with over twenty core characters that could have been accomplished. Besides, it's actually Thanos that's the 'star' and that is an unconventional and unexpected move. It's also one that pays off as he is easily the best, most intimidating and most understandable villian in Marvel's history. You empathise with him, on the most human of levels at times, and can even understand his point of view, just not his methods, whilst fearing his might as it lives up to all the hype it's been given. There's a real sense of forward-momentum and a proper pacy tension propelling the picture, leading to a series of confrontations that may be almost entirely digital but feel fully palpable thanks to excellent CGI and phenomenal writing. The script sets the stakes pretty much perfectly, weaving the interpersonal character motivations with the overall universal threat, and it paints a picture of a layered, all encompassing situation in which all our players play a part. It all comes to an unexpected and deliciously downbeat close, too. This is only dampened slightly, in execution and perception, because of the flick's 'Part I' nature - as well as the announcement of a few post-'Part II' MCU titles - which is actually the source of most of the film's minor issues. Without the context of the next film, there are some elements that don't quite seem 'real', but this could just be that they haven't sunk in yet because we don't know if they will be backtracked by the sequel or if they will be solidified by it. Still, as it is, this entry in the series is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected flick the MCU has ever produced, one that stands on its own as a ballsy blockbuster unafraid to divide its audience. The tone is almost perfect, incredibly dark but with a dash of levity where it's called for (this is how you do 'serious', DC), and the pacing is great, too, even if it feels a tad long at times due to the unusual structure. It's just a breathlessly entertaining, incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense, hopelessly jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat roller-coaster that does all of its characters, and its legacy, justice. Not to mention Alan Silvestri's phenomenal score. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I think the movie is very enjoyable and very funny at sometimes but it has problems and its not perfect.I really dont like what they did with the Captain America. He was there just to show off with his beard. And I like that the Thor is most powerful but I dont like that he didnt use powers untill he got stormbreaker. Star-Lord is in my top 10 heroes and they just ruined him in this movie. Movie has some plot holes that im not gonna mention. And all deaths after the snap felt forced. Fanboys are saying it is best superhero movie ever.

Review,"A deleated character 'Robin silos' (the cold bumb hellchild with no real extra capacity) was intended to be played by shane colby. Colby had grown up in the 1950's. Left in an abandoned house as an infint, and not allowed at the Grand Canyon anymore, Colby teaches himself how to be a wizerd at 14 years of age by a river everyday. %. And that's why he was going to play the role that eneded up going to Dr. Strange. He pretty much hated Costco though, and thats why his character (again, 'the cold bumb hellchild') was not used in Infinity War. Just so happends a costco was used as Thanos home base in the film. The whole avengers team drives up to costco in a van and Colby starts to shake. He says to director bill strip: ""i cant go into a costco because ill start feeling silenced and used like an 1800s women. They all had to head back to the studio (taylor swift included). She also got cut, as she insisted on singing a song in the film 3 times about a couple people who tryed to pick up a dime on the floor at the same time and nevere saw one another again for 88 lifespans. At any rate the finalized acting staff confronted thanos the next morning at costco. Thanos nonchalantly asking ""where's Colby today?"" to iron man (no one knowing that Colby was the uncle and boyfriend of Thanos). ""He's out of the film!"" Said ironman.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Approaches characters from a broad perspective rather than superficially,"I think this is the coolest of the Avengers movies. It has a fast pace from start to finish and this action adds power to the movie. The development of the characters is reflected well. Not giving enough screen time to each character can be considered a somewhat negative effect. Some seem more. Making a movie with so many characters must be a difficult task, but it seems to have been overcome. In my opinion, it can be said to be one of the best superhero movies. One of the advantages of the film, and perhaps the most important one, is that it approaches the characters from a broad perspective rather than superficially.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Absolutely Sensational.,"SENSATIONAL, FUNNY, HEARTBREAKING, AWESOME! ILOVED this movie!!!Now that's out the bag, let me get down to the grit.After 10 years and 18 movies, finally, the War is here! As a spectacle summer popcorn movie this has no equal, as a technical achievement, there is no better, as a moving relationship drama with real depth and threat, The only other time I have experienced anything close was the LOTR trilogy... its that good!Yes, its safe to assume that I am a Marvel fan-boy and may be just a tad biased in my opinions, however, I always try to go into MCU movies with an open mind, never expecting what happens on screen to rival the many stories I have consumed over the decades in the books. This does, in every possible way.Less politically relevant than Black Panther but with ten times more heart, as funny as Ragnarok but with a million times the threat this is the culmination of thousands of hours of hard work and devotion from a studio who not only know what they are doing but also clearly love what they do too, and it shows In every beautifully framed shot, every character interaction and every emotional death scene, right up to the cliffhanger to rival that of the first Matrix.The biggest surprise to me was Thanos. A genuine force of nature. The biggest bad in the MCU. The Mad Titan himself.... a loving father with a complicated back story and impossible decisions to make whilst carrying the fate of the universe on his vast shoulders! This is no doubt, 100% HIS movie. Brolin nails it, with the assistance of the best mo-cap in cinema history, he is able to convey a tortured, moving performance that resonates with the audience who can not help but almost agree with his logic, you almost want him to win!The rest of the ensemble cast are great as usual, the dynamics between the team-ups are superbly handled, especially the scenes with the Guardians, who, thanks to Drax, inject most of the humour. The Tony Stark/Peter Parker relationship also expands on the groundwork laid in Civil War and continued in Homecoming, to great effect. Tony, more than ever truly cares for Pete and as such feels a greater sense of responsibility than ever. With great power, right? Furthermore, the Wanda/Vision, Quill/Gamora, Rocket/Groot, relationships are all dealt with incredibly well, with heartfelt emotion and genuine love for each other. Trust me, there will be lumps in throats! on the flip side is Thor and Cap, who are both dealing with loss, Thor dealing with the destruction of Asgard and Steve with the state of the fractured Avengers, they are very much the 'solo' heroes, both with nothing to lose, both at their most dangerous. Dr Strange also plays a huge part in the narrative of the film, however, alongside Hulk, Black Widow, War Machine, Falcon, Winter Soldier and Black Panther, they are very much the window dressing to fill the gaps between the main event.The pacing of the movie is spot on, it really never felt like 2 and a half hour film and had Avengers 4 started right after I could have probably sat (on the edge of my seat) through that too!If I had to find a negative it would probably be Hulk shaped, but that's really clutching at straws, this is an outstanding achievement and a milestone in cinema. Go see it. Go see it again, you will not be disappointed. I'm off to catch viewing number 3.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fun blockbuster with not much more to it,"Avengers Infinity War is probably one of the most anticipated movies of all time. With that being said it's no surprise that this film has so much weight riding on its shoulders. It seems that the biggest question most have is, Is it good? And the answer is yes, it's a pretty good film but it's not the best.First off with the good stuff. The characters are done very well, and most are given a time to shine. The Russo Brothers also do a very good job with the action, like Snyder levels of awesomeness. And it's ending is one of the best in the MCU.Now with some of the bad stuff. The sad thing is that for everything the movie does right there's something done wrong. For example, there's no substance to the film, there's nothing more to it than action. It's feels like a Micheal Bay movie at points. And the sub villains are extremely underused, there's so much promise to them but the movie hardly ever gives them a chance to shine.Is it the movie to end all movies, no. But in the end it's not a deep character study like The Dark knight nor is it as good. It's not as funny as past films and sometimes the continuity of the characters is sometimes confusing. But it's a fun blockbuster with not much more to it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Thanos War,It is a well balanced movie. Best Marvel movie in the whole franchise. It has a cohesive plot and flow. Thanos War is an apt title as this movie focuses on the villain more then the 20 or so superheroes enlisted to fight him. You get to see the world from thanos's eyes. A different perspective which is what makes it different and better. If you waited for an epic Thanos movie you have got it.Thanos gets fully fleshed out and his motives and desires become clear. It shows what he is prepared to lose in order to gain his goals. He is the only decent villain to come from marvel and rightfully so as the stakes are never higher. There is plenty of action and it isn't just mindless fighting.There are only some flaws but you forget them cause the movie is good.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as good and not as bad as many write,"This movie is actually better than I expected but not in the top 100 movies of all time nor in the top 10 of this year.
Don't expect much or any character development in this movie. 
95% of all the characters were already introduced in previous Marvel movies.
You would have had to have seen at least ten others marvel movies to get any joy out of this movie .So this one goes straight to the action .The super heroes are in groups and they fight separate fights and the movie seems scattered . The obvious plot does not make up for it, the characters do not develop further , it often feels more like a good computer game then a movie. 
So cannot give it more than a 7 * .It is not as bad as you might expect from such a movie and the plot does get a bit more interesting, however simplistic it is... 
Super heros are no longer invincible , unfortunately many of them are still far from human . We cannot really identify with them or estimate if any of their actions actually make any sense - we are a spectators, like spectators of a video game we have never seen before..
 For example how much punishment can a super hero or super villain take before he dies, we have no idea and there is no gauge. Sometimes they just get up again other times not..The movie does have some interesting sub plots and parts to it , yes even the villains have a human side. Nevertheless the main villains motive for wanting to destroy half the universe is unsatisfactory, at best .The good part is that it is not too predictable, the movie has good CGI and well actually good actors in most of the roles.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
2-1/2 hrs of mindless chaos,"I really liked the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Likewise Iron Man & The Avengers. But these never-ending franchise add-ons are pretty boring unless you're 12 or a CGI junkie. There's very little evidence of a story behind all of the mind-boggling action, over acted drama, and special effects.

Quick Infinity War review,"Avengers: Infinity War is by far Marvel's most ambitious film ever. And it mostly pays off, after 10 years of buildup. With incredible effects, masterful sound design, great characters complimented by a fantastic cast, and some of the best action in marvel films. However it's uneven tone, some unfocused characters, and probably some of the worst comic relief in a Marvel film hold it back from being a great film. Nonetheless, the end result is a blast from start to finish, that should satisfy fans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome Movie,"Some of the reviews writen here blow my mind on how ignorant people can be when they are watching a movie about a comic book.Hey, guess what, the unoriginal script is based on a series of comics from the 90's, there's nothing really new here, except for the unfortunate lack of key Characters (mainly Silver Surfer and Adam Warlock) wich are too deep to be presented on this movie (case of Adam) or belong to other studior (case of Silver Surfer, the Fantastic Four, X-men), and the writers need to make a few changes, but that's all.I guess no one is dumb enough to think that everyone that died in the movie, will remain dead. Marvel doesn't think we are that stupid as well, cause guardians of the galaxy 3 is confirmed to 2020.I'm sorry to say, but this kind of review, saying the script is unoriginal e full of obvious deaths and turn arounds, is very, very stupid.It's like watching a biography, and complain about it, because you knew what was going to hapen, even before watching the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Here, there and everywhere","Not a major fan of Avengers, but this is the best of the lot but there are many flaws with Infinity War, one of them is the Thanos powers are not clearly consistant. The battles happen in a here there and everywhere fashion. It sometimes feel like different movies all put together and sometimes hard to follow whos doing what and for what purpose.The battles scenes are great with exceptionally visuals and cgi but the purpose to defeat one undefeated villian is jumbled up. Infinity Wars is clearly an overated movie but deserves credit especially in the visuals and a simple plot which the movie intends to make it complex.I didnt feel the superheroes powers like we did in their stand alone movies, its like a buffet.The worst performance was The Hulk, he had absolutely no business in being there if he was not willing each time to show his powers.I expected more from Infinity Wars since the big hype and thought they could have done more fighting as united Avengers to defeat one main villain. I know this might be done deliberately so that we can spend another 2,5 hours again for the next installment.Nevertheless its still an entertaining movie that I liked but not love or drool over it like some fans, has its ups and down with top of the range visual effects.Some say that it is so sad in the end, honestly I did not feel anything for them at the end, the ending is just bad, and it might turn out diffently in the next installment.Between Black Panther and Infinity War, I would prefer Black Panther as it was more focused on the characters and story which is a better made film overall.To have a rating of 8.6 on imdb is undeserving as these are mostly fanboys superior ratings.To give where credit is due is only in the visuals and cgi and maybe in the difficulty in making such a huge movie with a huge cast that is why I give a 7 out of 10M",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Best of Marvel Studios,"Wow, Marvel knocked it out of the park with this one. 
This is a totally different movie from anything Marvel has ever done before. First, I'll start out with the tone. This movie is dark. Marvel is sometimes criticized for being to light and happy, and I thought this was the opposite of that. Infinity War gives you a sense of hopelessness, sadness, and anger. It honestly felt like my soul was crushed, and everytime I think about the movie the feeling stays the same. Just because the movie made me feel these things, it was still great. I think that is one of the reasons you know a movie is good is that it gets you to feel these emotions about fictional characters. If you're scared about it being too dark, don't worry, there is some balanced humor throughout the movie, which for the most part I was fine with.I thought everyone's screen time was balanced pretty well if they were a main character (Tony, Dr. Strange, Thor, etc), but if your favorite character is minor (Bucky, Okoye, Shuri, etc) don't be expecting a whole lot of screentime. However, I do wish Steve got more time. The Russo Brothers said Thanos and Thor would have a lot of screen time, and I agree with them on that. The movie shows Thanos in an interesting light which really makes you think about what he's doing. I loved Thanos as a villain. What he is doing is horrible, but the amount of emotion he shows really makes you feel for him.Everyone's acting is incredible. A special shout out to Tom Holland and Elizabeth Olsen because they did an EXCELLENT job of portraying their characters feelings, which indeed made me cry. The cinematography is amazing as well. Later when I post a spoiler review I'll talk about some of my favorite shots, but for right now I'll just say when I saw one of the planets, the way it was portrayed was beautiful.I love movie soundtracks. I listen to them sometimes on my free time, which makes me sound like a huge dork, which I am. My favorite soundtrack is Civil War, and Infinity War is up there too. The music is awesome when characters are introduced, and it also is downright depressing at times.My favorite part right now is the ending. I am going to see the movie again to think about it more, but right now I do have one scene in my head that is my personal favorite. I'm sure if you've seen the movie you probably can guess it. The way the characters relationship was showed and how scared him/her was, it just broke my heart.As if the movie couldn't get anymore depressing, the credits were dark and desolate. The music was solemn. But as always, STAY TO THE VERY END. Maybe that'll lift your spirits a little :)Thank you to everyone at @MarvelStudious and @TheRussoBrothers . Why do you have to make me wait a year!!! I don't know how I'm going to make it. I'm going to try to see the movie again this weekend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
the final battle in this movie was great and very enjoyable and it is only topped by its sequel which offered a truly EPIC battle of APOCALYPTIC proportions,I have always felt Marvel VILLAINS that hit the big screen were laughable.

"Epicness of Transformers, but with story and characters fully intact! Masterpiece!","It's like Transformers, but with a story intact! All the Transformers movies were epic to me, but as the sequels came, the stories got more and more lost. Not Avengers: Infinity War. As an ex-comic collector (over 15 years), I was quite well acquainted with Thanos. My biggest worry was how they were going to pull off a weird looking hulk of an alien like him and not make him look like a doofus. Pulled off they did. Thanos was convincing and menacing, but most importantly he felt ""real"". Of course, no one can fault the fantastic, solid cast in the Avengers - Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, etc. (though I missed Hawkeye) were all rock-solid and it's amazing how their characters shined through despite the very very full cast of the Marvel Universe. The action was epic - this is where it reminds me of Transformers - where the CGI was fantastic, blended well, etc. The difference? Infinity War had a rock-solid story that tied in all the characters really well, and it had a whole raft of emotions - funny, sad, poignant, shocking, surprising, mindblowing moments all came through the movie. It is one truly epic movie that deserves to be on the big screen. I love it, and can't wait for the next part. Highly, highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Herculean feat of Screenwriting and Directing,"I'm not a big ""fan"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Just wanted to get that out of the way right here and now before people begin to question my allegiance or my bias of where I stand before I start this review.As I have told many people, I do not blindly follow this series of films wherever they may go. I enjoy Marvel when they make GOOD films, just as I would any other studio, director, writer, etc.In some cases, I find the MCU films to feel almost ""cookie-cutter"" when they are at their worst. The acting is fine, the action is fine, cinematography is typically 'safe' and doesn't break new ground as often as a series of this magnitude really should. No real risks are taken. I think of 'safe' when I think of many of their films, which isn't BAD, per-say, but I wish these films would be more risky in how they handle their material.Try something new...Trying something daring...Try something DIFFERENT...Well. My wishes were granted. In spades.'Avengers: Infinity War' is not a perfect film. In fact, it's not even the best film in the MCU. However, it was absolutely EVERYTHING it was billing itself to be. It IS new. It IS daring. It IS different.But let's un-pack that before I lose myself here. Because there's certainly A LOT to talk about...in NO SPOILER terms ;)The tone of this film, without giving anything major away, is by far the bleakest of any of these films have dared to go. This storyline and these characters that they have been teasing for 10 years are now paying-off massively, as we are now seeing real consequence in this world that has been established. Your favorite characters are here, yes, but they ARE at-risk against a threat that isn't treated lightly. There isn't any awful Yo Mama jokes like in TLJ to dilute the drama and tone.This is DARK, and the Russo Brothers do not let you off of that ride for you or the childrens' comfort level, which is precisely what I think this part of the story needed. The many comparisons I have seen to 'Empire Strikes Back' are not invalid, as its tone, manner, and even themes are extremely similar in more ways than one.I can tell the Russo Brothers, fresh off of 'Winter Soldier' and 'Civil War', were allowed to make a film that resembles their film, and not a studio mandate. They make decisions that I KNOW will be extremely unpopular with a lot of people, but unlike a certain franchise tentpole, this film does it without self-destructing the reason we come for these films, which is intrinsically the characters and this massive, sprawling story.Let's move on to that topic, The Characters. By far the strongest bone in this film's body is the characters and character interaction, as most Marvel films seem to excel at. After 10 years, we see all of these characters we've grown to love come-together and interact, and my goodness is it everything we have been waiting for. The dialogue here is sharp when it needs to be witty, is slow when we reach the emotional valleys, it can even reach heartwarming and heartbreaking at some points depending on what connection you have forged with these characters over the last few years.A character I find particularly captivating in this film, however, is the antagonist itself. Thanos, believe it or not, is an extremely interesting character once we see him and learn what he's all about and capable of. This isn't another case of ""big bad Marvel bad guy man"". He is genuinely a character I find fascinating, which shows Marvel took notes as far as I'm concerned. If anyone's fear was that they would get him wrong after 6 years of building him up, consider those fears squashed. This is a Marvel VILLAIN, and I mean that in the best way possible.To combine both prior points, hats off to screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for managing to juggle all of these characters and such a massive story and manage to make it COHERENT. Under many other writers' watches, this likely would have been A MESS, but the way the story progressed and characters were incorporated was, for the most part, expertly done. Every character gets a moment of their own, the ones we truly care for get integral arcs over the film's massive run-time, and in the end we hardly feel that certain characters were left out of the proceedings. I wondered how they would manage all of these characters, and they managed to walk the tightrope without falling.The score is also a welcome and noticeable addition, as the talents of composer Alan Silvestri ('Back to the Future', 'The Avengers', 'Predator') were brought back for this film. There are plenty of excellent pieces of music in the film, along with the Avengers theme itself (The only noticeable orchestral pieces these films really has ever had), and it is welcome to have excellent music in these films again after the disaster Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman presented to us in 'Age of Ultron'. The music only adds to the feel of the film, which is what good movie music should rightfully do.Now, all of this considered, this film is NOT perfect. In fact, a couple glaring flaws made themselves apparent throughout the film, though they were moreso ""Tiny cracks"" than ""Gaping holes"", so to speak.For starters, the action cinematography is actually shockingly bad in the early half of the film. At some points, I could barely tell what was even supposed to be happening. The fights in the early part of the film suffer from SCS, or should I say ""Shaky Cam Syndrome"", as we are over-stimulated and shown too much CG in these portions to process what we're supposed to be looking at. That said, the action cinematography does improve as the film moves along, so this isn't a problem that knocks-out the foundations of the film. However, the action early on is NOTICEABLY bad, which certainly hurts.Editing at times was also rather choppy, as odd choices are made in some portions of the film that made me scratch my head. I can't name anything in particular, though most of my issues with the editing stemmed from odd transitions and segues that almost looked like ""abandoned transitions"", where an attempt was seemingly made to stitch two scenes together...and then proceeded to be hacked-and-slashed to trim 2 seconds off the run-time, for some odd reason.And that's perhaps my only real issue with this film; the flow of the film. So much of it feels as if it's begging to be smoother, but instead there are sequences where it simply feels too long or too short in places. At some points, we will be on a plot thread, cut-away from it, and will not return to said thread until 20-25 minutes later. I genuinely feel that this sort of thing could have been fixed with a better editor, or simply a smoother-written story, though considering how already miraculous it is that this film managed to be coherent with how much it had to juggle, perhaps the odder pacing was only a by-product of trying to assemble all of this together.But in the end, is this massive assemblage of Marvel films and characters a success? Is this the film that is worth all the hype of 10 years and an entire film franchise has been leading up to?Yes.'Infinity War' is a tremendously fun time at the cinemas. It is quite literally an 'Epic', sprawling across so many characters, universes, worlds, tones, etc. This film feels like an event, which it may very well be, and I can safely say the Russo Brothers and writers Markus and McFeely as well pulled off a miracle and made such a Herculean task of a film into something I think is a great summer blockbuster and a tremendous first part of what is sure to be a grand finale for this universe we've seen grow over a decade.I may not be a huge Marvel fan, but this is certainly a GOOD film. In fact, I'd dare say a GREAT one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The pinnacle of Marvel,"This is a 10/10 purely because Thanos is so compelling to watch as a villian.

50/50,"An uneven and ambiguous film that has both undeniable advantages and obvious disadvantages inherent in all Marvel crossovers. The advantages of the film include the colorful villain Thanos with finally clearly prescribed motivation, a lot of locations and special effects, the drama of individual scenes and the meeting of almost all the characters from the Marvel cinematic universe. Cons: a long, sometimes sagging plot with a bunch of logical holes, a very uneven distribution of characters, with well-defined individual characters (Thor) and completely lost in the film (Doctor Strange, Bucky), weak interaction between the characters, humor at the level of Petrosian's sketches and inarticulate musical arrangement. Overall, out of 19 Marvel films, he is somewhere in the middle. You can watch in IMAX, but don't expect too much from the prologue to Avengers 4.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

X-Force + Avengers + Magneto = Good!,"SPOILERS: Justified expectation of the fan MARVEL
I decided to make my review of the third part of the Avengers. Immediately I can say that I'm doing reviews for the first time.So, I like watching movies MARVEL, and I was happy to wait for this part, like everyone else, because it was the fate of the car-kicking MARVEL. But in a year there will be ""Avengers 4"", but the third part did what other films MARVEL could not. And this is the death of the main characters to the clicks of Thanos. I was very surprised. I can tell only the pros and cons of this film:Pluses:* Thank you for long-wating DEATH Loki! ...Unexpected twists and turns, like the mysterious location of the last Infinity stone - the Soul stone, well-designed special effects and graphics, a huge number of MARVEL heroes and of course Thanos. The Rousseau brothers made a real villain of Thanos with normal motivation. This bastard is ready for anything for the sake of stones and will not stop at nothing. We can hate it somewhere in moments, understand it and empathize with it. I believe that Josh Brolin perfectly got used to this character. The main female characters are as always ideal and good, an excellent soundtrack, action scenes and good humor in some moments.Minuses:Unjust ending, stupid actions of the main characters, more that some characters forgot their abilities, or at the right time they did not use them at the first opportunity. Also, I did not like the fact that Falcon's eyes were not shown with the Ant-Man. Although we were told that they would appear in this film. Too much pathos and prolonged dialogue.Conclusion:Despite the shoals of the film, he may like everyone, even those who begin to get acquainted with the films about superheroes. But I strongly recommend that you first look at all 18 movies of the movie-market MARVEL before watching the third Avengers. And also it's a pity that the competitors of DC can not withdraw their kinomiks, which will surpass the War of Infinity. Although the DC comes out Aquaman and Shazam, but still they can not surpass this masterpiece. Still very happy for the fact that this film Joss Weedon did not shoot, but he could turn into an unfriendly comedy.* 11 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An awesome action movie that makes little sense,"The CGI is great, the acting is good, the action is wonderful, Thanos is really scary, every hero (almost) is here. And yet things make little sense. There are again confusion between forces that have many orders of magnitude between them, there is little strategic or, indeed, tactical logic in this ""war"". I enjoyed the film and I am sure it's going to blow so many people away, but it was so damn pointless.Anyway, the idea is that the movie is just the first of a two parter so my recommendation is to wait until both movies have been released and watch them back to back. I know it's hard, with all the references flying around you and friends wanting to discuss how Star Lord destroyed the universe (oops!), but I think you will enjoy the ending a lot more knowing you will be watching the rest in a few minutes and not next year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Gripping Epic of Superhero Proportions,"Avengers: Infinity War is a gripping and epic superhero film that brings together the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe in a battle against their most formidable foe yet, Thanos. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the film features an all-star cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and many more.The film is a masterful blend of action, drama, and humor.

Rating: A-,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)My most anticipated movie of 2018 was released a few months ago but at the time I was super busy, so I only had the opportunity to write a mini-review. Now, with Ant-Man and the Wasp coming out this week, I am writing full reviews of the 2015 Ant-Man as well as this monumental film, which features a lot of our favorite superheroes. I didn't watch a single clip or trailer for Infinity War, but my expectations were as high as ever. I went into the theater expecting to (finally) get a movie to rival with The Dark Knight for the best superhero film of all-time ...Unfortunately, I didn't get it. I will get my two issues out of the way now so I can focus on the positives because this movie has a lot of them. Being this a spoiler-free review, I can't get in-depth about its ending, so I'll do it like this. While its concept is incredibly daring and its execution seamless, the emotional impact is significantly reduced by my knowledge of the MCU's future. Everyone knows which films are being developed for Phase 4, myself included, so I can't just ignore what I know. In the same way that I consider every single movie leading up to Infinity War, I also consider the future releases, especially since this is a two-part film with an overarching story.My other problem is its balance of characters and storylines. First of all, I cannot imagine the colossal task of having to put together so many characters like the Russo brothers did. This is probably the one issue I was expecting this movie to have because I think it is impossible to perfectly balance this many groups of characters, where protagonists of their own sagas are left to secondary roles. While I do think that they mixed the characters beautifully, sometimes it felt that the film was just going from scene to scene without a real flow.There are a lot of heroes who have to be introduced and teamed up with other ones. Even with 156 minutes of runtime, it feels that they needed more time. The first half of the movie is a bit convoluted since basically, the transitions from scene to scene become repetitive and action-heavy, with no time to breathe. Sometimes it works (the opening scene is jaw-dropping), sometimes it doesn't. These are my only issues with an otherwise outstanding movie, I enjoyed every second of it!Like I said above, the Russo brothers brilliantly combined characters with one another having in mind the tone of each individual saga. Every actor and actress bring their A-game, everyone's script is excellently well-written. If I had to choose, my standouts are Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Zoe Saldana as Gamora and, saving the best for last, Josh Brolin as Thanos. Oh my God, Thanos ...Undoubtedly, the star of the film. I never expected that Thanos would have as much screentime as he did, especially when it comes to his backstory. This is the best Marvel villain yet! Even though he is a total maniac, I understand where he is coming from and his motivations are actually plausible. His story is so well-told that I almost wish that he succeeds in his mission ... How crazy is that?!When someone says ""CGI villain"", everyone instantly associates that to a horrible and depthless character. Well, Thanos is the exception to the rule because not only the CGI is mind-blowing, his characterization is amazing. Every single second that he is on-screen, I can feel it. His menacing and powerful presence is indescribable in words, you have to see it to believe it. I repeat: best Marvel villain to date!The action is one of the best in the MCU. The fact that this was the first movie in the history of cinema to ever be entirely shot with IMAX cameras definitely elevates every single set piece. Every sequence feels astonishingly epic and the Russo brothers are part of a very small group of directors who can seamlessly handle shaky-cam. Even in the first half, there are so many entertaining action scenes, cleverly filmed and with fantastic visual effects.Nevertheless, the big spectacle is saved for the third act where everything feels like I am watching those last epic battles in The Lord of the Rings franchise. Winter Soldier and Civil War might have better choreography and longer takes of action, but when it comes to the enormous and boundless sequences, Infinity War brings it home with bone-chilling charges on armies and exciting epicness levels. Also, the score is sensational and it definitely helps to raise a few goosebumps both in the emotional and action moments.It is hard to rank it inside the MCU and even harder to do it inside the superhero genre. I do not have the ability or knowledge to do it know. However, it is a ground-breaking and unique film, for sure. There is no other movie with such high stakes as this. Don't get me wrong, even though this film is dark and tragic, the Marvel humor is as funny as ever. In such an action-heavy flick, having the sometimes exaggerated Marvel comedy is a breath of relief and if there is a movie that needs it, is this one.Congrats to the Russo brothers! I never imagined the day where I could experience a film with so many superheroes, let alone such a magnificent one. Avengers: Infinity War is a ground-breaking movie in the genre, it has some of the most epic superhero action I have ever witnessed and one of the best villains of the genre's history, Thanos. This had everything to be an A+ but some issues with its ending and with the overall balance of characters and their storylines bring it down a bit. Still, it is undoubtedly one of the best superhero films ever and I can't wait to watch again!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

THE Movie... must see,"Wow. I can't even. This movie is a masterpiece. It's an unbelievable culmination of the amazing 10 years that has been the MCU. It's an epic, entertaining spectacle with tons of great one-liners and epic action sequences, but at its core it's a very emotionally driven film that is gut wrenching to watch unfold.First off, huge props to the Russo brothers for directing this thing. I can't even imagine the sheer size and task of directing this movie. Yet they pull it off to near perfection. It's a masterfully directed film. So many A-listers and characters and yet they merge all of the storylines together and find ways to get each character they're moments.Now the movie may be titled as an avengers movie but this movie is essentially about the villain, Thanos. Yet Thanos is not an ordinary villain. He is an intriguing and intelligent character with a true motive. Josh Brolin gives the standout performance of the movie (which given the level of acting talent in this film is very impressive) His performance was great. I felt legitimate fear whenever thanos was on screen.This movie was everything I wanted and more. It delivered to all the hype. And it set up a possibly even better and more epic sequel. This movie was so good it made me forget I was watching a movie and the intrigue and emotion I felt was real and genuine.

It is no exaggeration to say that Infinity War delivers on every level despite having the unenviable task of telling a HUGE story and somehow balancing this story that takes place on two planets with more super heroes then there have been in any super hero movie before or since.This is a task that would be difficult for even the most seasoned of film makers. Fortunately they brought on the writers from Captain America The First Avenger, Winter Soldier and Civil War. Of course the one thing that made this whole thing work was the Russo brothers. At the end of the day those two guys and all the talent involved pulled everything together and delivered something truly special.Infinity War finds Thanos and his Black Order: Ebony Maw, Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian searching for the Infinity Stones. Along the way, the Guardians meet up with Thor, Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Spider-man in an effort to stop the mad Titan.Coming back from his self imposed exile is the man himself, Captain America who realizes that even though the Avengers are scattered, him, Black Widow, Falcon, Bruce Banner, War Machine, Black Panther and the armies of Wakanda are the only ones who can possibly stand in the way of Thanos carrying out his plan to destroy half the life in the universe.Infinity War is a staggering sci-fi, action-packed, highly emotional piece of cinema that will bring out the tears in even the staunchest of movie critics. The finale of this movie is... something to behold. You know this movie worked when it leaves you thinking ""My God... NOW WHAT?!"".Avengers Infinity War has everything I wished the first two Avengers films could have been, and it's obviously necessary viewing for anybody who wants to see Endgame. Obviously though, a LOT of MCU movies are mandatory viewing for going into Endgame anyway.Filmmakers will be hard pressed to make something more compelling for many generations to come.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"'Infinite War' is not just a film, it is a cinematic event. More than an adventure or action film, like most of its predecessors, the film has a much greater sense of urgency!","A decade after the debut of 'Iron Man', Marvel finally reaches its peak, concluding three phases that brought the great heroes of Casa das Ideias to the screen, who knew how to make the necessary adaptations while maintaining the essence of the original material of the comics. In this decade of huge successes, the audience became intimate with Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Ant-Man, Thor, Black Panther, the Guardians of the Galaxy, in short, the whole range of characters that today make part of everyone's life. And there are characters to come before the end of phase 3 in 'Ultimatum'. The cinema knew how to popularize and expand exponentially all these characters already so familiar to fans of comics. With each new phase, new characters and universes are added to this formula, consequently leaving everything bigger, better and grander.With the contracts about to expire and having to increasingly pay stratospheric salaries to their stars, it is natural that this phase closure is the end of the cycle for some, while other characters will continue to emerge for years to come. To command this last film, which will be divided into two parts, the Russo brothers were called, who directed highly praised films by Captain America, The Winter Soldier and Civil War, which is also an Avengers for having brought together several Super heroes. For the script, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were called again, who had the complex mission of bringing together earthly and cosmic characters in an organic and convincing way, placing the heroes in the face of a devastating threat. In Avengers, Infinity War, Thanos (Josh Brolin) finally arrives on Earth, willing to collect the Infinity Stones. To face it, the Avengers need to join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy, while dealing with disagreements among some of their members.One of the points that we observe here is how the connection between the different films of the Marvel universe is made with extreme mastery. All loose ends are tied and we can see the consequences of the events of previous films, since the split of the heroes in 'Civil War' (after the events we noticed that Tony Stark and Steven Rogers had broken off since then), Bucky Barnes' exile (Sebastian Stan) in Wakanda and how the heroes have followed separate paths since then. Captain America (Chris Evans), the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) went to one side as fugitives, the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) started a relationship, the Hulk had stayed the recent years in another galaxy, as seen in 'Thor, Ragnarok', the Guardians of the Galaxy continued their space adventures, now with Mantis (Pom Klementieff - featured in 'Guardians 2') integrated once and for all with Peter Quill ( Chris Pratt) having, finally, relating with Gamora (Zoe Saldana). We see Spider-Man (Tom Holland) continuing his student life with his newfound powers joining in the cosmic battle with the group, officially becoming an Avenger. We also see characters from the Black Panther universe, presented a few months before to the public, with Wakanda being the stage of an extensive and important sequence.'Infinite War', like the infinite itself, has no beginning and no end, starting in the midst of the action directly connected with Thor, Ragnarok in which we have an exact notion of the size of the threat faced. If in small appearances in previous films, Thanos failed to show everything he was capable of, here he arrives showing what he came for. In ten minutes of film, the Titan beats Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) mercilessly and without mercy, decimates Asgardians and ends Loki (Tom Hiddlestone) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) without making the slightest effort. This is the point at which, we buy the seriousness of the situation and the grandeur and seriousness of the villain.From there, as never before, the universe is fully explored as we follow the villain in search of the Jewels of Infinity across the galaxy. Thor's encounter with the Guardians of the Galaxy and the split of the group in two, with Thor, Rocket and the teenager Groot going to Nidavellir, where Eitri, the dwarf (Peter Dinklage) would manage to make a new hammer for Thor, with which he he could defeat Thanos and the others by going to Knowhere, where The Collector (Benício Del Toro) keeps the Jewel of Reality. Having already had the Jewel of Power, obtained when Thanos wiped out Xandar, he would become even stronger. Meanwhile, the other heroes stay on Earth to face Thanos' allies, who desperately try to obtain the Jewels of Time (which is protected by Doctor Strange) and Mind (which is part of the Vision).This beginning of the conclusion of phase 3 of the Marvel universe expands the action to several places on Earth (New York - where Thanos' followers go after the Jewel that is with Doctor Strange, Scotland and Wakanda - to obtain the Jewel of the Mind). In addition, in space we travel to Gamora's home planet wiped out by Thanos, to Knowhere - where The Collector, Titan lives - Thanos' planet, Vormir - where the Soul Jewel was, where only Gamora knew her whereabouts, Nidavellir - dwarf planet forging the most deadly weapons in the galaxy.In 'Infinite War', we have the feeling that there is really a powerful and practically unbeatable threat that puts humanity and the entire galaxy at risk, to the point of being wiped out in a snap. The film carries an air of despair and hopelessness. What we see on the screen are characters fighting side by side and trying to improvise in the face of a threat far greater than the sum of their powers. The battle still carries the airs of altruism and strength of the previous films, but this time, we have moved far from that feeling that everything is under control and will be resolved in some heroic and inventive way. The writers rightly chose to leave the villainous titan Thanos at the center of the story. The film carried by the antagonist's unexpected charisma, which has contextualized motivations, and fits perfectly into the presented universe - he is cruel, merciful, has a sense of humor and is kind. Here, his relationship with his ""adopted daughters"" can finally be properly explored. In this respect, many applause for Josh Brolin's performance combined with the incredible visual effects that created the figure of the Crazy TitanWith an established enemy, the directors' competence shown in 'Civil War' in reconciling so many heroes on the scene, is repeated here, on a much larger scale. With so many heroes on the scene, it was possible to notice even more the relationship between them. Thor's dynamic with the Guardians of the Galaxy is excellent, especially with Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper). We even have some scenes of the God of Thunder with his half brother Loki, who once again reinforces the love-hate relationship between the brothers. We also have the hilarious relationship between Spider-Man and Iron Man, again repeating the partnership in some hilarious scenes. The duo still has great chemistry with Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). Captain America's team also had a fearless resistance with the Royal Guard, the Frontier Tribe, the Dora Milaje and the Winter Soldier, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Whether across the galaxy or on Earth, the groups formed to defend humanity from Thanos' imposing threat. The whole cast is great and the excitement of each one to be part of these experiences is notorious.Contrary to what we saw in the past, by the way, you can say that Infinite War is the darkest film in the Marvel shared universe. This is not only due to the aforementioned sense of hopelessness, the result of the notion that, at that time, the heroes really are dealing with a threat far greater than the strength of their powers, but also because of the decrease in the tone of jokes and comic reliefs. . Not only the public, but the heroes themselves know that what they face now is far greater than any enemy they have faced before.There are no words to describe the magnificent visual effects, which are further magnified on the big screen of the cinema. The action scenes on practically all planets and scenarios bring out the best to be explored in each situation. The joining of so many worlds, in so many contexts and how everything is so integrated was certainly an arduous task, but performed to perfection. The varied photography of Trent Opaloch combined with the production designer of Charles Wood and the soundtrack of Alan Silvestri places the viewer in the most diverse environments and brings all the dramatic and spectacular load to the viewer.It is the feeling of integration of the entire Marvel universe materializing in a way that it is impossible not to please the public. Infinite War is not just a film, it is a cinematic event, one of those films that are practically unanimous and that manage to go down in history, due to the quality, repercussions and records achieved successively. More than an adventure or action film, like most of its predecessors, the film has a much greater sense of urgency. The Russo brothers made a megalomaniac work, with unforgettable scenes of action (with special emphasis on the action scenes that take place in Titan and Wakanda) and with dilemmas of friendship and family that are fully supported. This is the long-awaited show since 'The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King (2003)', something so spectacular and well built at the same time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Epochal beginning of the end of the story about the Greatest heroes of the Earth!,"It is very difficult to objectively evaluate such a movie, since it was created by fans and for fans. This is a grand crossover that unites all the heroes of all the films, however, realizing that there is not enough screen time for everyone, Anthony and Joe Russo make the perfect move by exposing the main villain, the main character. Yes, 'Infinity War' is Thanos ' solo album.Let's start our analysis of the film with the villain, the main plus of the film, the mad titan. Thanos is a great character, he is very well written, and in the course of the film you involuntarily get into his ideas and thoughts. And all because he has a clearly formed goal and plan. The idea of the directors works 100%, turning the mad titan into a cult villain not only in the Marvel cinematic universe, but also in cinema as a whole.Side villains are the children of Thanos, who serve as assistants. They don't particularly cling to anything, but they don't reject it either.It is difficult to single out the main characters of the film. But if you count by screen time, then these are Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Anyway, there are most of them in the frame and all the other characters act as side characters. The trio goes through personal growth and at the end of the film they are not the same as they were before, this is also a plus.The side characters are essentially assistants to the main trio and it is very difficult to reveal everyone, there are solo albums and future projects for this. I would like to mention Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), this character also goes through personal growth.The visual of the film is amazing and surprising - different planets, places in the universe, the artists coped with this task 100%!The graphics are at an excellent level, only in some places it sank.We have reached the action scenes. The whole movie is one big action scene, the fights don't stop for a second, and the way Thanos uses the glove's capabilities is amazing!The soundtrack of the movie is memorable and you will definitely want to add a couple of tracks to your playlist after watching it. Alan Silvestri coped with his task.There is not much humor in the film, but it takes you by surprise and you just explode with laughter sometimes.One of the best Marvel films and will definitely enter the top 50 films in history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overrated garbage,"From around 50 movies of 2018 this is the movie that made me agry watching. Probably because Ive seen Seven Samurai, Lord of the Rings, Mad Max etc and I cant agree that the level of action movies should fall in this level. From start to finish cgi was the only good aspect of this movies. Those who like it are probably teens. There was a critic who said this movie puts the Hollywood in danger and he is right.

Coming to the main antagonist, Thanos (Josh Brolin) nailed it with his chilling dialogues and energetic performance. The climax was jaw-dropping.

TOP MARVEL MOVIE!!,"For a while, I thought no Marvel movie would get a 10/10 from me. But after reviewing this movie, I'm glad to say I was wrong. This movie really is an achievement in the comic book movie genre. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this film, and I thought, unlike a lot of other Marvel projects, that the humor was well done. Civil War was number 1, but I feel good saying it's second place to this great movie.I really appreciated how the directors and studio had the guts to actually have the villain win. Thanos is such a complex, compelling villain and while we should hate him, we understand what he's doing and why he's doing it. Therefore, it makes for an interesting scenario in which we wouldn't mind if the villain actually comes out victorious.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end, and I'm grateful for this one considering a lot of the MCU is very mediocre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Wonder how many movies like this Marvel can create? Maybe never,"This is the result of 10 years. And it's incredibly effective. When you create a good enough villain, the superheroes around him only need to appear for a few seconds. But everyone knows these heroes well, they all have their own movies that have been released before. So can I consider this a solo movie about Thanos lol.To create a villain like Thanos, perhaps Marvel's producers also need luck. He is too perfect, from appearance to personality and purpose of life. He makes all other superheroes worthy of mere supporting characters. Because his ideals have convinced viewers. And superheroes can only fight him through tolerance and peace-loving hearts. And no one can use reason to defeat Thanos.I'm pretty reserved and concerned that Marvel will create another villain, another super movie that brings together many superheroes and creates a movie of great quality like this one. Because that's very, very difficult. This is probably the best Marvel movie of all.My emotions were filled by this movie. Although there are scenes that are not suitable for children, like the scene where Iron Man is beaten by Thanos, and the scene where Loki is strangled to death, this is what I like, because movies are for all ages.Of course if I had a friend around 10 years old I wouldn't recommend this movie.

An Absolutely Beautiful Cinematic Achievement,"I am HYPED for the Russo Brothers' return! This movie isn't just a beautiful entry of the MCU, it goes to show the amazing cinematic achievement that the MCU has made. There's no doubt that there is a lot of plot lines. Usually, a movie that has this many plot lines would be messy. They just had amazing build up to it, that I was already connected to the characters. So, each plot line was great! It's when they start merging them into one. It goes from all of these plot lines and sub plots, to just two. One with the Guardians, Iron Man, Strange, and Spider-Man. And everyone at Wakanda.Thanos is definitely one of my all-time favorite villains. He just had such a presence on screen. Josh Brolin was amazing in the role. From the opening of the film to the end.

Like too many marvel crossovers...,This movie is a lot of fun and it has great moments. It is a delight to see the crossover of Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers meet to battle the veiled villain of the last decade in the Marvel Universe. But IMO: Thanos is not the greatest villain in the Marvel Universe. His motivation is not that awesome - and in a way - by making the universe hang in the balance the film raised the stakes so high it was difficult to really care or believe. There is no real drama at the end because like any comic book...the character's will return. However - the fights are great fun. So - like any great crossover...it was big and loud but not as good as a single edition adventure.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I'm Too Old for These Movies,"I've watched so many Marvel movies. They are all pretty much the same. Here we have two and a half hours, featuring every conceivable superhero. Unfortunately, I should have bought a guidebook, so I could keep track of who's who and who doesn't like who, or whatever. I know the modern audience demand continuous fighting. There is so much attack and response that it all blends together. I know that Thanos is the bad guy and he needs those stones because he is a religious fanatic who wants to wipe out half the universe. He wants balance. But a good movie should still bring in those who didn't spend their childhoods reading comic books. I am not stupid, but at times I had no idea what was going on other than it was going to bring an end to Josh Brolin. But! Is the next movie a sequel or will they act like it never happened. I know that Strange can jump around in multiple times and universes. I was disappointed with how it all ended, cheated out of a satisfactory resolution.

#Movie Review,"Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is one of the most ambitious movies made by Marvel so far. As time passes, the number of movies increases. Likewise, the number of heroes is also increasing, thus it gets significantly more difficult to create a plot involving everyone without it becoming a mess. The Russo brothers surprisingly manage to pull this off with a coherent, well-structured plot. I enjoyed the beginning-ending relation and the fact that everything that's happening on the screen has a meaning that you'll later understand as the story unfolds.As much as I enjoyed Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the movie isn't perfect. Even though the Russo brothers have done a fantastic job, there'll always be repercussions when it comes to a story involving plenty of characters. The focus gets quite blurry since the movie has to jump back and forth to give everybody a chance to shine.Nevertheless, this movie was a BLAST!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

More entertaining than Black Panther but far from great.,"My concerns about the balance and cohesion between the cast and the settings prior to seeing the movie were real. Infinity War is four distinct movies stitched together. The different groups do not interact, let alone coordinate with each other, and the conflict should not be called a war but a series of amazing stories.Each scene change requires the audience to not only readjust their mood and expectation, but also the level of engagement. The films jumps back and forth between melodramas, epic fighting and irrelevant humors which feel awkward and disjoint. While viewers should not expect physical realism or common sense in a comic-book movie, some is still required to convince us to suspend our disbelieve.The best part of Infinity War is the mighty Thanos himself, who bears the brunt of narrative depth and character development. He seems to be such a nice guy, who tried his damnest to not hurt our fragile heroes, and a diligent achiever that I wish I could buy him a beer and watch the sunset together. The semi-destruction of the universe is a hard day's work after all. Mission accomplished.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

His journey to collect the infinity stones is given great depth and purpose, making it a Thanos film as much as it is an Avengers' movie. Thanos' presence is felt throughout the entire film, and he truly serves as the driving force of the story.In addition to Thanos, the film's scope is truly awe-inspiring. The sheer number of characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe that the movie brings together is nothing short of remarkable.

10 years in the making,"Avengers Infinity War is probably one of the most anticipated films of all time but does it live up to the hype? Yes it totally does live up to the hype and exceeds all expectations. In no way is Infinity war a perfect film as much as I wanted it to be but it is extremely ambitious and one of the best the MCU has to offer.Avengers Infinity war finally gives us what we've waiting for so long, one massive event which brings all our favorite characters together fighting against the big bad Thanos. Thanos is finally here and he truly is spectacular but more on him later.Let's begin with the fact that this film is super ambitious. To fit dozens of characters and several plot-lines into one cohesive two and a half hour film is no easy task but the Russo's have done it. The film feels grand andEpic. The film could've suffered from pacing issues what with all the characters and several things happening in different locations but it never feels rushed or slow but just right. The visual effects are spot on especially when it comes to creating elaborate fight sequences and realistic looking characters like Thanos and his children who are all computer generated.Almost all the characters that we know and love are in this film and its quite awesome to see them interact. Watching characters that have never met each other before finally meet and fight together was like a dream come true. The banter between the heroes is well written and the chemistry between the characters is just perfect. The movie explored Doctor strange's powers a lot more which was fantastic but failed to do the same with Scarlett Witch as she does the same stuff she's been doing ever since Age of Ultron. Several characters get their jaw dropping goosebumps inducing moments that made the audience go crazy. Characters that stood out in this film for me would be Doctor Strange, Thor, Iron man and of course Thanos.Before I get into Thanos I would like to address one of the gripes I had and that is the children of Thanos, Korvus Glaive, Proxima midnight, Cull obsidian and Ebony Maw. These four looked great but there was nothing much under the surface. They were just mini bosses the heroes had to fight before Thanos. But for the most part I can forgive that because of Thanos is the best MCU villain ever. Thanos is great at beating the crap out of everyone but he was also a villain I could empathize with. He had compelling motivations and a lot of character depth. What's great about Thanos is that he isn't just a large strong guy but a character you can care about. Josh Brolin is perfect as Thanos and I can't think of anyone who could have done it better.The fight sequences are well balanced with each character getting their time to shine. Creating a long and elaborate fight scene with multiple characters takes a lot of planning and hard work but the Russo's have done it well before and they did it even better this time. The comedy is present and for the most part is handled properly but sometimes they do manage to ruin serious moments with jokes that don't always work.Avengers Infinity War is a near masterpiece that has it all. From spectacle to shocking twists and revelations and a perfect villain. I highly recommend Avengers Infinity war and I'm gonna go with a 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Another win for the saga,"Avengers: Infinity War is a monumental cinematic achievement that defies expectations and sets a new standard for superhero storytelling. Directed by the Russo brothers, this Marvel masterpiece is a grand, intergalactic opera that seamlessly weaves together a vast ensemble of characters and narratives into a tapestry of epic proportions.At its core, the film is a testament to the meticulous world-building and character development that the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has undergone over the years. The Russo brothers skillfully navigate the intricate web of storylines, giving each hero their moment while maintaining a cohesive and engaging narrative. The result is a symphony of action, emotion, and stakes that have never been higher.The villain, Thanos, portrayed with gravitas by Josh Brolin, stands out as one of the most compelling antagonists in cinematic history. His quest to obtain the all-powerful Infinity Stones is not just a plot device but a character-driven journey that adds depth to the overarching narrative. Thanos is more than a conventional villain; he's a force of nature, a tragic figure with a twisted sense of purpose that challenges the very essence of heroism.The film's visual spectacle is awe-inspiring. From the bustling streets of Wakanda to the distant reaches of outer space, the cinematography by Trent Opaloch captures the grandiosity and scale of the Marvel universe. The action sequences are breathtaking, with each hero bringing their unique powers to the forefront in a dazzling display of choreography and special effects.Infinity War is not just about spectacle; it's about emotional resonance. The film doesn't shy away from exploring themes of sacrifice, loss, and the weight of responsibility. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, defying the notion that superhero films are devoid of genuine human drama.Alan Silvestri's score enhances the emotional beats of the film, punctuating key moments with a musicality that elevates the storytelling. The soundtrack becomes a character in itself, guiding the audience through the highs and lows of the narrative.The film's ending is a bold narrative choice that subverts traditional expectations. It leaves audiences in shock, eagerly anticipating the next installment while pondering the consequences of the Avengers' greatest challenge. Infinity War is not just a film; it's an event that has left an indelible mark on popular culture, setting the stage for a cinematic experience that transcends the boundaries of the superhero genre.In summary, this is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly blends action, emotion, and character development on an unprecedented scale. It's a testament to the storytelling prowess of the MCU and a thrilling ride that leaves audiences on the edge of their seats, eagerly anticipating the epic conclusion in Avengers: Endgame.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Thanos FTW!,"Who doesn't love an EPIC villain?! With huge production values this was an awesome display of VFX and an epic saga of galactic proportions.

In ""reality"" they would've been banished to oblivion long before he acquired his final gems, though I suppose he needed a few of the superheroes in his quest for the gems.

Utterly Amazing.,"So here it is, Avengers: Infinity War. After 10 years of waiting, or 6 if you count from his first appearance in Avengers Assemble, Thanos has finally arrived. All I can say is that the wait was worth it.Firstly, the story lines are extremely well balanced. I could not imagine the difficulty of the task attempting to fit enough screen time for the likes of Thor, Star Lord and Iron Man into a singular film, however, the Russo brothers have managed to do so. They also managed to combine the 'right' characters in order to play off of one another. The snidey in love with themselves combination of Dr Strange and Tony Stark, to the humor and whit of Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy. They all blended and worked so well together.Secondly the CGI is quite possibly the best I have ever witnessed. Josh Brolins portrayal of Thanos shines through in so many way, not just his dark and gritty vocal work, but also the ability to show every single facial movement. Outstanding work from the graphics department for that one,Thirdly, the tone set from the beginning of the film. It immediately shows the power and devastation Thanos is capable of, and the audience never feel a sense of safety for any of the heroes again.Finally, and least surprising, is the action sequences. These action scenes have you on the edge of your seat from the get go. The heroes working with one another to try and take down Thanos and his 'lackeys' is some of the most compelling sequences I have ever witnessed. All of this action followed by a breathtaking soundtrack from Alan Silvestri.The only negative thing I can say about the movie is that it is going to cost me a lot of money going to re-watch it time and time again.Well done the Russo Brothers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"When a ""fun"" experience can overshadow all other shortcomings","So this is the big one. Ten years in the making, 18 movies in a franchise leading to this. Despite the sky high expectations stemming from the popularity of its preceding films, AVENGERS INFINITY WAR delivers the wide appeal, casual friendly entertainment one has come to expect from the Marvel Cinematic Universe brand. Only that this time, Marvel studios takes it a notch higher.AVENGERS INFINITY WAR is bigger from the get go. The scope is expanded from earth to the entire universe as the alien warlord Thanos' personally expedites his quest to retrieve the powerful infinity gems for his own ends. Gems which are closely tied to the fates of this world's greatest heroes. Through perfectly logical (within the context of the story) means and reasons, the actions of Thanos and his servants end up bringing together heroes from across all the past MCU movies.How does the movie juggle so many characters at once? Well it does so very well. All the characters get a decent amount of time in the spotlight. Half the fun is seeing these characters that you grew to love in their respective movies come together and interact on screen; characters who merely years ago would have no reason to be interacting. Who would have imagined StarLord, whose adventures are at the far end of the cosmos, would be talking face to face with the earth based Iron Man? The cast is perfect in every way with decent chemistry even among those interacting for the very first time on screen.The one thing i really appreciated was the more serious tone, carried on from Black Panther earlier in 2018. A pet peeve of mine has been this obsession with throwing in random quips and comedic moments into the middle of a hectic battle, a tense dialogue or a tension filled face off. This has plagued more than half of MCU movies and all it serves is to trivialise the stakes and destroy any attempt to take the movie seriously. Thankfully, the stakes here are more dire than anything ever seen in the MCU. INFINITY WAR does have witty banter, but this is kept separate from the drama; a very welcome change.I can safely say that the movie entertains. Its energetic script and fast pace makes the long run time zoom by. There are multiple sub plots but nothing too complex if you are paying attention. The awesome action sequences are finger bitingly intense and the highlight of the entire movie. All this is set to some of composer Alan Silvestri's best musical work yet. SI can also safely say that this movie is not perfect. As amazing as the action was, some of the fights are just overly choreographed, more like a dance than a fight. Personally, I would have preferred something more raw in the fights.The story too comes across as a little shallow, especially compared to CAPTAIN AMERICA CIVIL WAR and BLACK PANTHER which managed to weave in some relevant sociopolitical commentary that generate discussion. INFINITY WAR touches on themes of self sacrifice, and a Machiavellian take on population control, but it never brings those themes front and centre.Instead what is front and centre is the laughs, the action, the tears, and other simple emotional appeals. The fact that all the characters enter and leave this movie ""as they are"" rather than undergo development through the course of the narrative makes it feel like a season finale to a saturday morning cartoon. Whatever development comes about suddenly in the closing moments rather than organically as the story plays out.On a whole, I would describe AVENGERS INFINITY WAR as this big reunion party. It sells itself on the experience rather than the story. The experience of a loyal fanbase being rewarded after 10 years of loyalty. The experience of that roller coaster ride through flash CGI graphics all ""woohoo"" and ""yea!"" and being able to enjoy it in the company of like minded individuals. It is a party more than a movie. Who cares about overly convenient events that drive the plot, who cares about unremarkable cinematography and overly hectic action sequences. Who cares about deeper themes, symbolism and narrative depth. It makes me feel awesome. Exactly like a good party.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Perfectly balanced,"Thanos(Brolin, giving us a layered villain, the best in recent years) has...*finally*... started to gather the Infinity Gems. If he gets all six he can wipe out half of the universe with a snap of his fingers. Will our heroes be able to stop him and his ""Children""?The hype for this was unreal. Many say that it couldn't live up to it. And I realise that a lot don't, and won't(as it premieres around the world), think it did. For my money(and they'll keep getting them as long as they keep making them this good), it delivered, and then some. Obviously, with so many major characters, they cannot possibly all get a lot of screentime. You could criticise their decision to include so many. Honestly, you're free to think so, but this is not a movie for you. Which is fine. I don't doubt that you love flicks that aren't for me. This is a cinematic version of an event comic, not decreased in scope as most of the adaptations of those stories are, something I've been waiting for for 20 years to be done right. So rather than complain about something that couldn't be helped, let's look at whether it's satisfying. Personally, I absolutely think so. I've loved most of these since I first saw these versions of them, and I felt that they were all featured to the right extent. Every single one of them makes an impact, most get arcs, not a single one feels like they're just in the background(as is the case with every single X-Men film).This wastes no time starting the plot, moves quickly, and introduces us to all the groups quite early on, and yet never feels overpowering. I realised the following is an old example, however, recently rewatching Revenge of the Sith, the difference is incredible. Both were built up to for years(at least 6 in both cases), and where that one is massively overcrowded, and quite tiring and tedious, this one isn't, even a little. I know. I can hardly believe it myself. It delivers on emotion, interaction between individuals, growth, in addition to action scenes(which, ultimately, is the bread and butter of a Summer blockbuster). Does it, outside of the bad guy's depiction, including personality and motivation, reach a level of depth akin to the solo adventures? No. It would be unrealistic to expect it to. It's not going for that. Finally, there has been a lot of reasonable concern, for how they would handle the supposed killing off of fan favorites. I'm not giving away whether or not they do, or if it's only for bit parts. What I will say is that everyone who kicks the bucket in this, on either side of the conflict, gets to be memorable and important before they do. They were very smart and how they handled that. Like everything else in this.I recommend this to anyone who finds it to be appealing. Do note that the ending is very much a setup for the next one, and doesn't feel conclusive. It used to be called part 1 for a reason. And yes, that will disappoint many - and they're not wrong.

Lots of characters - all colorful and interesting.

The plot had holes that were just as big.Sure, some of those might be resolved in the next movie, and the heroes will probably win in the end, but the ending was an anti-climax, made worse because of the needlessly sappy and drawn out failures of all the different Avengers.At the end of the movie, no one left the cinema. The audience sat there stunned, waiting for some glimmer of hope. It never came. There was defeat. There was death. There wasn't the satisfying victory to help ease the long set up and the forced attempts at humor. Even the post-credit teaser was depressing.I won't write this movie off completely given there's more to come, but disappointing to have to wait until the next movie for some catharsis.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Masterpiece in Entertainment,"Avengers: Infinity War is unlike anything you've ever seen before. It is 10 years in the making, with 20 instalments leading up to it, all designed to introduce our lineup of 30 odd characters and hint at fragments of Infinity War plot throughout. When I left the cinema I couldn't quite believe the Russo brothers had actually managed to pull it off. On the face of it, the film should be a total mess, with too many characters and too many storylines unfolding in unison. But they absolutely smash it, creating a masterpiece which the likes of have never been seen before and most likely will never be seen again.Thanos is the ultimate villain and about the best I've seen - not just in the superhero genre. His motives and actions throw your moral compass into disarray, creating a dynamic viewing experience. What's more, I can't think of any other film in the MCU where we don't genuinely believe from the outset that our heroes will survive and prevail to save the day, but with Infinity War these certainties cannot be so assured - the stakes are so much higher. The opening scene sets the tone, and from here on in there is no guarantee who will be left standing when the final credits role.The story throws together characters from across the franchise in the most unexpected fashion - Thor teaming up with his good friends Rabbit and Tree; Tony Stark and Peter Quill fighting Thanos side by side. So much enjoyment stems from these unlikely groupings, and watching all these characters who we know and love, interacting and bouncing off each other, is just the definition of entertainment.In the end Infinity War has you laughing and crying, often in the same scene, with a finale so shocking and unanticipated that it doesn't lose its impact no matter how many times you watch it over. Overall it is the best Marvel has to offer, and I don't think it will ever be topped. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This film needs no introduction.,"There is no doubt it has been created to set records,but will it be able to surpass the top box offices that is indeed a mystery which the future holds. There is no doubt that Thanos is a big-bady of all and he deserves the most screen time. The film doesn't only contain only fights or humour but emotions too. I remember the first time when i went to watch the iron man back in 2008 when i was just 7 years old and then came the Avengers in 2012....from that moment on i have been waiting for this movie. When the time finally came i was excited as every MARVEL fan would be. From the starting of the film to the end a sort of suspense was created which ties the viewer to the screen. There is no denying the fact that the Russo Brothers have done a MARVELous job on this one. Every plot was rightly set.When it comes to my favourite scene in the movie....it is the WHOLE MOVIE...thought Thor's arrival was pretty dam lit and the fight on TITAN and New York broke the records. After seeing the film it was for sure that it required a lot of time and effort. This was surely a movie worth to wait for a decade.To be honest DC movies could never set a plot like this. They just need directors like Russo Brothers and a good scriptwriter. RDJ , scarlett johansson, chris evans, hemsworth and pratt, Benedict Cumberbatch , Tom Holland, Mark Ruffalo, Pom Klementieff, Karen Gillian,Sebastian Stan,Don Cheadle Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana,Bradley Cooper,Chadwick Boseman,Danai,Winston Duke,Lititia Wright,Vin Diesel,Paul Bettany,Tom Hiddleston,Idris Elba, Bendecit Wong,Elizabeth Olsen and of course THE Josh Brolin has proven that they are the best stars.Thanks to Kevin Feige and MARVEL for entertaining us from the past wonderful decade.Love from a fan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

MCU's Magnum Opus,"10 years in the making and 18 films building up to the moment that would define the Infinity Saga's legacy for decades to come. I distinctly remember the lead up to this film, a crucial moment in blockbuster filmmaking. It's an accumulation of a decade's worth of comic book storytelling through film, a genre that has become divisive in recent years to say the least, but you get what you come for here, and that's what matters.For anyone that grew up on comic books, you are certainly familiar with how large-scale crossover events always came to be, and having that feeling replicated on the big screen is something any fan will always cherish. There was a lot that this film had to accomplish, too many to list in fact, but perhaps the most vital was crafting a villain as memorable as Thanos the Mad Titan. If Thanos fails, then the whole film does as well. Yet, thanks to one of the strongest comic book film scripts and a timeless performance by Josh Brolin, as well as some of the most incredible computer-generated character design, Thanos is cemented as one of, if not the, quintessential comic book movie villains of all time. Almost every line of his has become part of the cultural zeitgeist, this generations The Empire Strikes Back (1980).Endlessly rewatchable and satisfying, filled with lots of incredible character moments and interactions, my favourite being those between Stark and Strange. The entirety of the action sequence on Titan is breathtaking, one that I always come back to. Filled with impressive choreography and a fulfilling use of each character's abilities, as well as serving as a key moment in the entire saga, it's definitely my personal highlight.There are some issues that I've always had. One being how Bruce Banner/Hulk is handled, he is definitely a character that you feel the directors/writers did not know what to do with due to the amount of characters. Tony's suit is really ugly, it's baffling that a suit crafted in 2018 looks worse than the ones in 2008, and it's due to the over reliance on CGI.Overall, this is where the MCU peaked for me. I do enjoy other remaining entries such as Endgame, No Way Home, and GOTG Vol.3. But if I'm being honest, Disney/Marvel have done irreparable damage to the MCU brand with their Phase 4 entries and how everything else is being handled. Much like their comic counterparts, after every peak there becomes an abundance of characters and storylines, a confusion of direction and a misguided desire to replicate an event previously planned for almost a decade in a matter of a few years.At least we'll always have the Infinity Saga to look back on.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best. Superhero. Movie.,"Infinity War... where to start with this one.Opening night was something spectacular for me when it came to this film. I went in with the same anticipation I had for most Marvel movies- which is to say excited but not expecting anything more than good. I am so glad that what we got rose above that threshold to be something I will never forget.From the very start the film grips you by putting the focus almost entirely on Thanos as it's central figure and killing off characters that were just saved only a movie ago in Thor: Ragnarok. This cold open was enough for me to be sold on Thanos as a character and the film enhances him more and more as it goes on.I have to give huge props to Marvel for letting the Russos, Stephen McFeely and Christopher Marcus be more impactful with this movie and it was well worth the hype. The action scenes carry the movie and are all well thought out, engaging, and creative to the big screen. Not one scene is wasted and the forward momentum keeps you enticed.Alan Silvestri- what a comeback for his time with the MCU. He had previously only scored Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers before being dropped in favor of other composers for the next few projects. Him being back on for Infinity War gives the movie a score that enhances it's operatic weight to heights I did not expect. I knew his score would be great but so many moments are made by the music alone. The triumphant Avengers theme playing at the beginning as I had hoped since Age of Ultron was satisfying and the ending, that ending, was film score perfection. One of the best end credit suites to most recent blockbusters.Another thing that was striking was the Russo's approach to color in this movie as most Marvel movies all share the same 2010 gritty bland-gray look and take away from some of the fun costumes. This time around they nailed the look, allowing for scenes to pop with their greenscreened backgrounds by having the sets lit identically to how they wanted them to look on film.One of the biggest achievements of this movie was Thanos himself and all the VFX work that made him believable. That's extremely commendable but has done so too many times and I would rather praise the great VFX and artwork in general. The sound design and CGI blend to create a cosmic comicbook world that looks like something straight out of a conceptual artbook. There are tiny details in every VFX shot that sell these characters' interactions and action beats. Iron Man's nano armor was a stand out and the great colors of Nidavellir contrast the rest of the film to sell the third act.The ending is what made this movie as big as it is- the heroes lose, what's not to love about that? It felt like The Empire Strikes Back for this franchise and a true epic finale to every story we had been presented so far. Getting to see these characters beat down was satisfying and had some of the most poignant scenes in the end. The infamous porch scene is a standout and is incredibly memorable- and daunting. No one was prepared for this and it made this movie all the more special.There is so much more to say about Marvel's greatest achievement (in my opinion) but I think most of it has already been said. This is my favorite superhero movie of all time and I don't see any other topping it any time soon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Yep, I enjoyed that","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a bit of an animal, packed with action, good storyline, a good smattering of humour and really good special effects. The film is packed with many hero characters, that sometimes makes the viewer struggle to work out how they all fit into the script. You have to have watched the previous Marvel movies, in sequence, to recall each characters role and ""powers"". This is a long movie, but it is an action rollercoaster. I have to say that the ending is in true Marvel movies tradition; it is like wadding through extra thick treacle, it is that slow and drawn out. But, it is clever in that it keeps the view hooked and on the edge. It seems like this is it, game over, but we shall see. As I said, this is a really good movie, perhaps the best from Marvel Movies in my opinion, I really enjoyed it. The special effects are just superb, the storyline is full of twists and turns, and all the different actors brought together works in perfect motion. Well worth watching, you will enjoy it I am sure.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Good,"Whilst I really did quite enjoy this on a big screen, the more I watch it subsequently makes me realise that is all just way to cluttered. With the exception of poor cutie ""Pietro"" who got squished in ""Age of Ultron"" (2015), the world and its Marvellian wife gets in on this act. That, for me, was part of the problem with this film. It's a series of episodic escapades featuring different branches of the family - From ""Loki"" through ""Guardians of The Galaxy"" (was it just me, or did Chris Pratt took a little out of shape, here?); ""Spiderman""; ""Black Panther""; ""Dr. Strange"" and finally, our ""Tony Stark"" led original Avengers. That compendium style of mini-adventures sees each trying to thwart the evil ""Thanos"" (Josh Brolin) who is in search of six infinity stones that will make him all powerful. What ensues are are a series of end-to-end combat scenes with astonishing pyrotechnics and visual effects. The story I found less engaging. There is precious little humour - even the normally charismatic Pratt has little to work with, and the usually reliable Chris Hermsworth's ""Thor' character just features all to sparingly for me. It's a sort of cinematic jigsaw puzzle that has an ending that just screams ""more to come"" at you, and after a whopping great 2½ hours I really could have been doing with something with fewer characters and less constituent moving parts. All of that said, though, it's still a great piece of cinema entertainment but has definitely faded with time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Self-parody, but not funny nor original","The modern Marvel cinematic universe's excuse for ""comedy"" is a bunch of one-liner wisecracks that take on one of two forms: 1) camaraderie in the form of friendly jabs between characters, whether extant or to build up new friendships, or 2) to actually make fun of the movie itself. Functionally, the wisecracks are tacked on to make the movies take on a ""lighter"" feel to contrast the darker themes they sometimes tackle. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this approach, except that executionally the lines just aren't that funny, too frequent, tryhard, and awkward, sometimes even going as far as to ruin a potentially epic moment by cheapening it beforehand or afterwards. Not to mention that this formula for ""comedy"" is carbon copied across almost all modern Marvel movies, so it gets tiresome quickly. Just because the filmmakers themselves point out how bad or cheesy a scene is does not somehow make it better. A self-parody without the humor therefore becomes a farce of a film.Another problem modern Marvel movies face is that they rely on the viewer to have seen each and every movie that has ever come out in the entire franchise, else risk great confusion. This makes each movie not stand alone on its own merits, but only in relation to the other 40 or 50 behind them. Television would perhaps be an objectively better format for these kinds of long-winded many-charactered chapters, but the ticket sales keep coming in, so why fix what ain't broken? It is a challenge to even critique this film as it stands on its own, without also critiquing ""modern Marvel movies"" as a whole. Indeed nothing felt different or unique about this particular installment in the series, more of the same formula.The biggest problem in this movie was simply its sheer number of characters, and once again most other modern Marvel movies share this problem too. The scope was so large that nothing seemed to have progressed whatsoever until the last 30 minutes of runtime. The first 2 hours took on too broad a scope as it slogged forward into a big confusing jumbled mess constantly hopping from character to character, almost rendering it pointless to even bother. Certainly it must have been challenging to incorporate every single character the franchise has ever seen, but was there really a pressing need to do so in the first place?Robert Downey, Jr. had a surprisingly down-trodden role this time around, rather than his typical comic relief sharp-witted self. He can act in any capacity so there was nothing bad about the acting, but it also didn't leave much of an impression, nor stand out in any way. He was just kind of there. In fact, every character in the entire movie besides Thanos felt like they were ""just there"". No character really had a chance to shine or be themselves, instead melding into ""one united Avengers"" character. Perhaps this was intentional, as all needed to unite against Thanos to stop him, but it just went too far: every character's individuality was severely compromised, and the only truly indelible impression left on the viewer's psyche after watching this movie was Thanos, Thanos, Thanos.The ending at least picked up a little bit and finally had a focus, even a bit of a shock. But it doesn't feel fully believable, as we all know deep down it's not permanent. After all, this is a fantastical universe with many excuses to undo it.Lack of individuality permeated throughout: as a movie, in the action & choreography, in the directing style, the composition, cinematography, even the characters.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Impressive,"I just looked at it yesterday. There are a lot of impressions, some of them unexpected, but mostly positive. The first thing I would like to note is a really cool antihero, who is, in general, the main character of the picture. Second, the Avengers act in groups, not together. Even the picture from the screensaver on the poster is not a screenshot - one of the heroes was not in that location. Third, this is an unconventional, let's say, ending. And so, in principle, it's still the same cheerful Marvel, with a bunch of superheroes, battle scenes, jokes and jokes. By the way, I would like to say separately about the Black Panther. Everyone was scolding the Russian dubbing, but in the original his voice is just as dull, plus all the Wakandans speak with a terrible African accent - it all sounds terrible, it's good that a little. In theory, Infinity War should bypass the State of emergency in fees and become the highest-grossing film in history.

There is no integral narrative structure. The action breaks up into several parts. Firstly, it is the wandering of small groups of characters, whose interaction is filled with humor (both successful and not so much). Secondly, it is an almost incessant action, which in this context is a plus. However, the problem is that these parts do not fit together well enough.Watching what is happening, the thought involuntarily comes that this is a simple fan fiction written by a fan of the Marvel universe on the topic of what would have happened if the story had gone differently. There is no well-thought-out plot, because of the abundance of heroes, almost no one gets to pay due attention, and to top it all off, the question arises: why does such an unsightly hero inherit the title of Captain America?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

big,"Greetings again from the darkness. We are at the 10 year mark of the new Marvel cinematic universe that began with the revolutionary IRON MAN (2008). This 19th movie in the franchise is actually Part 1 of 2 films that will (supposedly) be the lasting legacy of The Avengers. The second ""half"", much of which was filmed simultaneously with this one, is set for 2019. Co-directing brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were responsible for the two most recent Captain America movies (and also one of my all-time least favorites: YOU, ME AND DUPREE), and have now taken on the biggest budget, biggest cast, and longest run time yet of any Marvel movie. In fact, it's so big, it could only be named 'Infinity'.Being that the fan base for this movie is highly sensitive to anything resembling a hint, much less a spoiler, this review will tread very lightly, and instead function as an overview with very general observations. There are a few key points, most of which are quite obvious from either the trailers or the previous movies in the series. First thing to realize is that this is a Thanos movie. He's the first big (I told you everything was big), bad, nearly omnipotent villain. It should be noted that Thanos sees himself as misunderstood, which leads to the second key point: melodrama abounds - moreso than any previous comic book movie. It seems to be reminding us that Superheroes are people too (but are they really?). The third point is that if every character with a speaking part simply said ""I am Spartacus"", it would still likely be the longest ever comic book movie. There are at least 28 characters with ""key"" roles - and that's not counting the end credit stinger, or the missing characters we thought we would see, or the one that gets a logo tease as a coming attraction for part 2.Co-writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus had their hands full in working to come up with a coherent story, while allowing so many familiar characters to have at least one moment in the spotlight, if not a few. The fact that AVENGERS: CIVIL WAR divided the group actually allows for multiple segments to play out concurrently. Though we never doubt these fragmented cliques and isolated individuals will fight to save the galaxy, that doesn't necessarily mean they get the band back together. In fact, it's the Guardians of the Galaxy who are a much more cohesive group than our beloved Avengers. But fear not ... there is plenty of fighting and action to go around.Thanos claims he is saving many interplanetary civilizations and restoring balance with his plan to eliminate half of all living beings. While there might be some scientific evidence to back up his plan, it doesn't sit well with the good guys. More focus is given to his cravings for ultimate control and power provided by tracking down all six Infinity Stones (Tesseract/Space, Mind, Time, Power, Reality, and Soul) to complete his Infinity Gauntlet. Many of these stones are in quite inconvenient locations and require some ingenuity and brute force from Thanos.Perhaps the travel agent had the biggest challenge as portions of the film take place in New York City, Knowhere, and Wakanda (good luck finding a brochure on those last two). We also get a budding romance from Vision and Scarlet Witch, as well as annoying quasi-romantic banter between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. And while we are on the ""TMZ"" portion of the review, it should be noted that both Black Widow and Captain America (introducing himself as Steve Rogers) both have new hair styles - though only one of them sports a beard.In the realm of comic book movies, this would be considered an epic. It has stunning action sequences, remarkable special effects and some terrific comedy mixed in. Of course, you'll have to accept the melodramatic emotions and fear that we haven't been previously subjected, and know that the final finality doesn't arrive for another year. It's very long (more than 2 ½ hours) but it seems to go pretty quickly. The filmmakers have mostly succeeded in the monumental task of remaining true to the history in order to keep comic book fans satisfied, while also creating something that most should be entertained by. Despite lacking the upbeat, feel-good ending we've grown accustomed to, there is a welcome Stan Lee cameo, a post credit stinger (after about 10 minutes of rolling credits). And to top it off, we get ""Rubberband Man"" from The Spinners. Now that's big!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Kitsch,"The movie is a great example of kitsch. A definition from web:
""Kitsch is art that's garish, nostalgic, and very low-brow. Some people who love the aesthetics of souvenir culture think kitsch is really cool, while others think it's in very poor taste.Kitsch is a German word that's been adopted into English, meaning ""worthless, trashy art,"" or the quality of that art. A ceramic figurine of a puppy with sad eyes is pretty kitsch, as is a velvet Elvis painting. Of course some people think that kitsch is really beautiful and fill their homes with stuff that other people consider trashy souvenirs.

The best at everything: but do previous MCU & avoid spoilers,"--- No spoilers or even plot-outline here. If at all possible, try to avoid such things before watching this for the first time. ---A super-rare 10/10...only the 12th film to bag this rating (from over a thousand movies rated).An Epic achievement, nonstop thrill-a-minute rollercoaster ride for 150 minutes where even the quiet passages excite the senses. Not a single weak moment. Plot, cast, antagonist, dialogue, pace, music, action, camera, editing, FX, 3D, humour, drama, thrills...it all worked beautifully. It is the best at all these things from all the MCU movies so far (ok, Guardians beats it on humour but the few moments of levity in IW are welcome & powerful).The only caveat for its ranking among the very greatest movies is that to get the most out of it you really need to watch the previous 18 movies of the MCU. That build-up, all those character developments and pre-knowledge of lore is crucial.And I should know, as I first watched Infinity War last year without any of this, without any Marvel knowledge at all. Enjoyed it, well-made. But without that connection it was an 8/10 max. Not breaking my Top 100. It was thereafter checking out Guardians of the Galaxy (specifically Gamora's character and her connection to the saga) that made me ponder how a rewatch of Infinity War might be if I did all the MCU in order. It was also a recent purchase of the Meta Quest 3, and how 3D-movies look in that FOV-filling isolated screen, that persuaded me to do it. And yes, they look very impressive that way.Now done. Those first 18 movies are good-to-great (except Hulk, haha), and on to Infinity War. It's absolutely incredible! Utterly gripped, mesmerised...despite having seen it before. But now I'm armed with all that build-up. Deserves its place up there with the very best cinema has offered us these last 100 years. And the greatest action sci-fi/fantasy flick since Empire Strikes Back.It's a hard sell to persuade film fans who aren't into superhero movies to watch 18 of them just so that they can optimally experience the greatest of them.But honestly now that I've done it I have to disagree with Scorsese: MCU, specifically The Infinity Saga, is absolutely cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Sometimes more is less,"Unpopular opinion: the Avengers movies have been suffering from the law of diminishing returns. The solo movies still work brilliantly, but the giant ensembles started collapsing under the weight of characters and plot lines right around when Ultron showed up. This one faired slightly better for a few reasons. First, the giant cast divided and conquered, allowing for A, B, C, D, and E plots - and each story worked pretty well. Second, they have introduced so many new (and funny) characters to the MCU that this edition was infused with some fresh energy and laughter. Buuuut...there were still too many characters. A movie like this cannot reach the heights of Homecoming, Ragnorok, or Black Panther. Less is more. So this film inevitably succumbed to being more about setting up future franchises than about the characters themselves. It was fun and intense, but I'm looking forward to when the stories get smaller and more focused again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Average Movie War,Movie is just the average one. Not very exciting or enthusiastic other than spiddy character. Lot of useless scenes to get the viewers engaged. One time watch movie if you have watched all the Marvel movies.Not to spoil I'll keep it short movie is overratted. One time watch and forget movie. You could save your precious time not watching it though.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It's Not the Best. Accept That,"Honestly this movie is equivalent to Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows Part 1. (An awful movie in the series)
Yes (as all other reviewers who given it an 8 or higher have argued) this movie has had a lot of build up and it is meant to be the ""final"" act; however that doesn't excuse it's inability to create an interesting plot.
Similar to HPDH1, this movie focuses too much on setting up for part 2 that is seems like this was more of a money grab.
It is a movie worth seeing but perhaps not in theaters.
I suggest, have more self control than me and wait until the second part comes out so you can immediately gain some closure that the first part fails to achieve.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too much going on! Ambiguous end!,SPOILER: The ending was unclear. The death scenes were disappointing to the point of unbelievable.

"Chris Evans was born on June 13th, 1981","The namesake movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), arrived in 2018. Being the 19th entry in the Infinity War saga of the MCU, It is mostly a transitional film, which helps set-up the events that happen in Antman and the Wasp (2018), Captain Marvel (2019) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). It is a pivotal film for the MCU, because the Infinity War had to happen, in order to get to the Endgame. Coming off the success of their first MCU attempts, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America: Civil War (2016), the Russo brothers direct this film like it was ancient mythology. By utilizing the great stories from the comic books, they are able to give the audience a spectacular representation of an epic comic book adventure. They give to the characters in the film a super positive vibe, that tells the audience these are heroes. They are heroes to remember. Yes, it's still a fantasy, science fiction, comic book story but the Russo's give these Marvel characters the meat needed to bring them as close to reality as today's current cinema can.The current roster of the Avengers has broken up. After the events of Civil War broke up Tony Stark (Robert Downey JR.) and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), the team is splintered in half. Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are off grid and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany), have run off to work on their romance. If you saw the events in Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Banner (Mark Ruffalo), are together on an Asgard space ark. The main evil bad guy, who has been part of the backstory of the whole Infinity Saga, Thanos (Josh Brolin), is searching for the six Infinity stones and has caught up with the Asgardians, knowing that Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), has one of them.What makes this film so huge is the fact that, the Russo's had to jack up the energy they started in the Marvel ensemble film Captain America: Civil War (2016), with an even bigger ensemble cast of superheroes for this film. Everyone knew it was coming, from all the hype that was generated for the film initially. It would combine the Avengers with the Guardians of the Galaxy, along with Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Throw in all of their super-friends, that came from all of their respective movies and you have an event of epic, block-buster entertainment. Thanos is coming and he can't be stopped. It's up to the Earth's mightiest heroes to stop him. Witness this universe shattering display of MCU might. It is not a disappointment and audiences from all varieties can enjoy this film.8.9 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Russo's make their draw and leave us perfectly in awe...,"Much more engaging and far superior to its predecessor Avenger films...Infinity War is the movie we were all waiting for . 10 years build-up and it came down upon us, with sheer epic scale and gut-punching resolutions.
It may over-entice its somewhat bloated array of storylines with somewhat unbalanced character dynamics along the way. But this is not meant to be an ordinary film. It's a Super Smash Brothers Brawl type feature and a blockbuster like no other.
Reaching places visually and emotionally that this MCU franchise finally needed to take. Carried by a fabulous performance by Josh Brolin as Thanos, he makes this movie his own, as the Avengers are just there to do their best. But is their best enough. Such an epic experience. It's an event more than a film, and be sure to ready your expectations. Because the Russo's send us off with pure cinematic, shakespearean-esk illuminations. Setting up for maybe an even better Avengers sequel. But let's just hope they don't get too predictable on us.

My Personal Favourite Marvel Film,"This movie did wonders for the MCU, it created hype for the somewhat disappointing Avengers Endgame, it left audiences at the edge of their seat during every fight as the tug of war between Thanos and the Avengers was always so violent and unpredictable that truely anyone could have won at the end of this film. Although not perfect, and suffers from multiple forced events and ever changing power levels of some characters, the 3rd Avengers film was a rightful success to the first two.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Once in a lifetime experience,"Its perfect. It gives you everything you want, it gives all the heroes perfect amounts of screentime, it has a perfect villain with motives you can understand and even support, the fights are one of the bests in the entire MCU, even despite watching it like 15+ times, I still have chills when all the heroes appear, on all the fights, when thanos gets another stone and specially on the ending. Watching this movie is literally one of the best experiences you could ever have.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Cinematic Marvel of Epic Proportions,"Avengers: Infinity War is a gripping rollercoaster ride that seamlessly weaves together a myriad of beloved Marvel characters and storylines into an epic, action-packed spectacle.

The visual effects are stunning, with jaw-dropping set pieces and breathtaking CGI that keep you on the edge of your seat.

"Up there, shoulder to shoulder with Captain America-Civil War","Arguably, the best MCU movie ever made, and yes, I watched Endgame. Many people say Infinity War is the action and Endgame is the brain and I agree totally with that, but in Endgame there are many things that can be questioned, the decisions, things that did not make sense, things that can't be explained, some rushed choices and many more. But Infinity War is perfect, it is balanced, it is well written, it is action-packed and the most important thing, it never gets boring, not for a single second. There is always something happening, something big and exciting, heart pounding and stressful. There is happiness and there is grief, there is team work and there is power. Incredible re-introduction of all the characters that we've seen throughout the MCU journey with some of the most amazing visuals and CGI effects ever seen in the movie theaters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Homerun for the MCU,"What do you get when you bring together over 20 of the most talented actors of all time to team up in an effort to save the planet from extinction? Infinity War.... I was blown away by the emotion I felt throughout this movie and I just didn't want it to end. I'm a huge fan of the MCU and before seeing Infinity Wars I watched all of the other Marvel movies in sequence to prepare myself for this masterpiece... let's just say that I was not disappointed by any means. Josh Brolin did an awesome job playing Thanos. I will most likely see this film 3 or 4 more times in theaters before owning it on DVD and Digital. Don't even pay attention to Anyone who rated this movie low (1 thru 5), these people don't have an understanding or the MCU and therefore cannot fully grasp all that this movie masterpiece really offered.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not the best.","I liked the movie, but I have some problems with it.-There were too many jokes. That doesn't mean I didn't like them, or that they ruined the mood, but half of them were unnecessary...they could easily use that time for story and characters.-Too many characters. The problem isn't exactly what I said, but mostly ""the focus"" of the characters, some characters were there just to be there...they were ok (not bad), but I would rather see more important characters.In my opinion the best characters in the movie were Thanos, his servents, Iron man, Doctor Strange. A little bit less, but also Thor, Star Lord and Gamora. But for all of them I wish they had more screen time, to be even better.Wanda and Vision were also pretty important, but personally I didn't really like them that much, I mean they were ok. Vision was also kinda disappointing in terms of power (remember, he was very important and powerful in Age of Ultron).I also wish that they would spend more time on the stones, their story, powers and things like that.There are also some other things I want to say (positive, or some nitpicks), but it's really not that important and I don't want to go too much into details. Oh, effects were very good, better than in movies before, so that's why I mentioned it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
