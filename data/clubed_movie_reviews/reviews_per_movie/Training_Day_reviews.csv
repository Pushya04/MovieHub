Still relevant nearly two decades later,"Jake(Hawke, innocent yet with some edge) has been on the force for over a year and a half now. He wants to make detective, and that means joining Narcotics. For his titular training day he must impress Alonzo(Washington, simultaneously threatening and charming). He will soon find that this is a cop who crosses the line frequently. Exactly how far is he willing to go?The acting by both leads is amazing. Honestly, for everyone in this. Denzel steals the show, but Ethan still really makes a mark. This is immensely gritty, with many honest looks at what happens in the bad neighborhoods of LA, as told by a screenwriter and director who actually lived there. The authenticity is a huge part of why this is so compelling. With a few exceptions, you really feel like this could happen(there are things that are not very credible. Others have already detailed them, I don't really have anything to add), and it really provokes a discussion of police brutality. Despite an episodic nature, every scene has a distinct purpose in the overall narrative, although for a number of them, you won't realise what it is until later.This contains a lot of strong language, some brutal violence, and a little nudity. I recommend it to everyone who can stomach the contents. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
What Movie Were You Guys Watching?!!,"I know I'm late as hell and I hate to break the overall 'vibe' about this movie but this movie was great when I saw it in the theater and gets better every time I watch it over again. And this is mainly because of the performances by Denzel and Ethan. I don't know what you guys expected but the movie CLEARLY suggests that Denzel is a crooked, burnt-out, streetwise cop and Ethan is a 'wet-behind-the-ears' clueless rookie. So knowing that, WHAT DID YOU GUYS EXPECT, Malcolm X, Remember The Titans, The Hurricane?? If you were, then maybe you all need to be checked out. The reason why this movie was so great is because it wasn't the typical Denzel 'role model' movie. We KNOW that he can play those roles well so it's a testament to his acting ability that he can portray the other side of the spectrum. And my hat goes off to Ethan because he bounces off Denzel flawlessly.I hate to break the news to you guys but cops like Alonzo ARE OUT THERE and need to be acknowledged. Acting like the problem doesn't exist does not solve it. You don't have to go that deep to know that Alonzo was once a good cop who just got fed up w/ 'police procedures.' If you acknowledge that Jake's shallow-mindedness at the beginning of the film only allows him to look at the perks of making detective and how the progress of the day transforms him, you can really appreciate Ethan's portrayal of him. Let's face it, a bad day at the office when you're a narcotics detective differs greatly from that of an office executive and the different stresses can warrant different results.Even the street rhetoric was authentic. Maybe you guys need to get out of the 'burbs more. You guys didn't actually expect eloquent dialogue with little or no profanity, did you? The only part of this movie I struggle with is Dr. Dre's terrible overacting and that isn't nearly enough to take away from the overall result.Next time you guys bash a movie, make sure to try to be objective and rate what you see and not what you're used to seeing!!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The power of Denzel,LAPD narcotics detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) takes rookie detective Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) on his training day. Alonzo is a harsh spoken street-wise cop pushing the envelop in South Central L.A. Mostly he goes right over the edge.This is all Denzel all the time. It's his relentless power. There's no logic or plot worthy of following. That's not the point of this movie. The audience is Ethan Hawke as he tries at first to submit to the Denzel hurricane. Then we're trying gather our feet in the storm. Finally we have to make a decision about his character. This is a tour-de-force performance from Denzel and nothing less.,8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stunning performance by Denzel Washington...,"""Training Day"" was a very good movie. I like movies that shove it in your face and make you deal with it...movies like, ""Black Hawk Down""...no clichés, no touching moments, just brutal, bitter realism. ""Training Day"" was such a movie. However, the one thing that made this film really shine was the performance by Mr. Washington. To me, a good actor is someone who just IS a character...if it isn't obvious that they are acting than they are doing a good job. That was the case with Washingon. He just was Alonzo. Every pantomime, every word, every glance was performed masterfully. Did Mr. Washington deserve his Oscar? Absolutely. 200%. Some people say, ""not Oscar material"" and I must wonder, what film...what performance were they watching?",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
More plot holes than bullet holes,"I'm not really sure what the point of this movie was, other than to look cool and to give Denzel a badass persona with which to chew the scenery. The characters make reference to the ""chess game"" going on between them, but it's really a game of kick the can.  They only manage to keep it moving forward one hour, at which point it just could becomes a big checkers endgame, full of black-leather gold-chain-danglin' fury, signifying nothing. This movie pistol whips you with countless racial stereotypes, and F's you up with an anticlimactic, silly ending that would be satisfying only after a hit of PCP-laced dope.

A corrupt man in a corrupt world,"Ethan Hawke has a ""Training Day"" - from hell - and learns that his trainer (Denzel Washington) is way out there in this 2001 film directed by Antoine Fuqua. Featured in the film are Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin, Eva Mendes, and Snoop Dogg.Hawke is a young family man, Jake, who is teamed up with a decorated narcotics detective, Alonzo, to see if Jake has what it takes to work the street and go undercover. Alonzo is a very unsettling guy - joking one minute, mean the next - and Jake doesn't know quite how to take him. He just knows the job means a lot to him.Gradually it dawns on him that a) Alonzo is more corrupt than any of the perpetrators he says he's after; and b) he's setting Jake up so that he's part of some dirty work and therefore won't be able to talk.Really top-notch, edgy performance from Denzel Washington, who is always full of surprises, here playing an unpredictable character. This was his Oscar winning role, and it was deserved, though there's no question that he deserved it in the past too. The film is full of action, violence, and really raw characters - one certainly gets a sense of the mean streets from watching this film. Ethan Hawke acts just as a man who doesn't know what's going on would - unsure, embarrassed, nervous, scared, but very determined and quick-thinking, as he realizes what he's gotten himself into.Shocking, violent, bloody, and fast - that about sums it up. Some excellent performances along the way, too, from everyone involved.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent film that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat and blow you away,"If you ask me, TRAINING DAY is an excellent film that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat and blow you away. Harris (Denzel Washington) kind of gave me the creeps. You'll understand why once you've seen this movie. In my opinion, the performances were top grade, the direction was superior, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the cast was perfectly chosen. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too. Before I wrap this up, I must warn you that this movie is very violent if you're going to see it, so viewer discretion is strongly advised. Now, in conclusion, if you're a fan of Denzel Washington or Ethan Hawke, I highly recommend this movie. It's sure to keep you guessing from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
didn't buy it,"as my personal opinion, i have to say dr.dre and snoop dogg were much more convincing as l.a. street men as denzel will ever be. all the time i could see denzel's black suite and red tie. shrug. what do i know about l.a. street life, but that's just the way i felt. meanwhile, ethan hawke, sigh, has never been my favorite actors, performs a whining mouse-like role as the partner, maybe it's supposed to be that way, didn't like it anyway.anyhow, the strong points of this movie are good action sequences, nice street feeling and an ok plot. there are all kinds of good side characters in this film, some who are shamefully underused. actually, the lead pair is the only one that i didn't really like. the higher-then-average rating i gave came really from the general feeling in the movie, thanks to the side roles.the last 20 minutes of the film is bucket stuff though, i've seen a similar ending a thousand times already. the director could have thought of something more original.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Training Day A Solid Action Crime Thriller,"Training Day is a solid action crime thriller with exceptional performances by Ethan Hawke and especially Denzel Washington. Director Antoine Fuqua has done an admirable job of making this movie about a rookie cop who gets into a lot more than he bargained for while on a day with a senior rogue detective to prove he's got what it takes to be a narc. Denzel Washington is fantastic as twisted but charismatic Detective Alonzo Harris who takes a big departure from his good guy roles to play the villain in this one. Washington has show over and over again that he's a talented actor. Well he continues to prove just that in Traning Day and then some. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as rookie cop Jake Hoyt who finds himself in one increasingly dangerous situation after another. Hawke holds his own against Washington on screen and he may not have the flashier role but he goes a very good job as the hero in this film. The rest of the supporting cast including Scott Glenn, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and a brief appearance by Tom Berenger are solid in their roles but none of them are given much to do and are merely given extended cameos. They still prove to be effective none the less in their brief screen time. The music seemed to sync very well with what was happening on the screen and the tone of the film. The brutal action violence is well executed but the showdown between Washington and Hawke near the end did get a bit unrealistic. It was still intense though and the two actors really got to show their off their acting chops in this movie. The vulgar language did get a bit much at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in this one. Despite some flaws Training Day is an entertaining action crime thriller with great performances from Hawke and especially Washington who make this movie definitely worth the time to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Aweful, just aweful.","The only credit I can give this film, is that it has provided a new standard by which to grade other Oscar garnering films, an astonishingly low one. A bland, tiresome reincarnation of a 1980's high-concept ethics-based cop drama that did not live up to its predecessors. Denzel Washinton's performance was uninspired to say the least, and seemed to be nothing more than a medley of other successful actor's adaptations of similar roles. The plot was predictable to the point of absurdity, and the direction can only be described as sub-par. Why this film was ever celebrated for its veracity is entirely beyond me. If you are a fan of good films, rent something else.",,Anonymous,Crime
Nothing special,This movie is nothing more than another action movie. It has some nice action scenes and that's about it. Denzel Washington's role is overrated.

Denzel's Acadamy Award Winning Moment,"In his Acadamy Award Winning Performance,as best Actor.The movie, as the title suggests, follows a single day in the life of rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Hawk) as he is subject to a single day of evaluation by a senior, decorated police narcotics officer Alonzo Harris (Washington) to see if he has what it takes to be a 'narc'. Almost immediately Hoyt is placed on the back foot, constantly caught off guard by Alonzo's nature, his ability to switch between a cold, no-nonsense street-wise player, a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader, and occasionally jovial companion. From their first encounters though, where Hoyt tells Harris he will do ""anything you want me to do"", the situations Hoyt is taken into become more and more morally ambiguous, from the simple use of excessive force to outright illegal activity, forcing Hoyt to decide which side Harris is truly on, whether to trust him, or whether Hoyt is the unwitting centerpiece of a huge and complex web of lies and set-ups in order for Harris to for fill his own sinister motives..This is the movie that won Denzel the Oscar that year for Best Actor!!

Performance of a Lifetime from Denzel!,"Wow! What a superb film, Denzel Washington at his superb best. Denzel plays a terrific part as Alonzo Harris, a cop with a dark personality.From the moment you set eyes on him you can relies that Alonzo is a feisty character, who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.Ethan Hawke provides excellent backup but Denzel steals the show. I don't want to give an plot lines away but there are only three movies in cinema history I have given 10/10, and this one was so close to being number four.I sincerely hope to see Denzel put in another performance like this one.Plot is excellent as it leads you into false sense of securities and even shouting at the TV set.I loved every breathtaking moment of this film and I am sure you will too.Quite extraordinary.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
King Kong ain't got sh*t on this movie !!!,"One thing I will say about this film is that it has some of the best one liners ever put on film. I would say that you would have to watch this film for the one liners that Alonzo (Played by Denzel Washington) spills.The film as itself is a lot of fun but it still has some flaws. Overall praise has to go to Denzel Washington, who is loving every minute of his performance as the villain. He does all the villain clichés, smiling, laughing and ranting, things you just love to see villains do. However, they don't just make him bad, the brilliant writing also makes him a complex character, giving a twisted morale compass. You actually question his sanity because, despite all the evil things he does, he actually thinks he is doing the right thing, its performances like this that remind me why Denzel Washington is my favorite actor and can do almost no wrong.The film also does well at setting atmosphere, you really get a sense of these places in fact I even read that they had filmed in areas such as Compton. The appearances by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were awesome and well place and I loved the Latino gangsters that Hoyte has to face at the end of the film, one of them played by Cliff Cirtus who I believe can play any ethnic group.However, I do have one issue with the film and that is its secondary character, Hoyte, played by Ethan Hawke. Don't get me wrong, I will take nothing away from Hawke's performance but they made the character of Hoyte so bland and predictable, the goody goody, always does right and I know thats what they were going for but they could have made him more interesting, maybe he is tempted by Alonzo and almost turns to the dark side or at the end of the film, something to make him more complex, particularly after all he has gone through.Overall, if you like cop/crime thrillers then you will definitely enjoy this, if you want something with a lot of depth this may not be for you but hey, watch and make your own conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Alonzo Harris: To protect the sheep you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10","The most intense ride along ever. Antoine Fuqua directed a wild cop drama like you have never seen before. Dealing with systematic corruption in the police force, crime investigation, drug dealing, bribery, and ethics. Training Day is a visceral sprint into law enforcement. Training Day forces you right into the position of a rookie cop asking yourself what would you honestly do in the same situation. It is brilliant due to David Ayer's clever and complex script alongside Fuqua's innovative and gritty direction. Training Day is timeless thanks to its commentary on police corruption and our contemporary police brutality problem. I think everyone needs to see Training Day. Denzel Washington is the real star as he comes across as the most real and selfish cop ever put on screen. His violence, anger, and ingenuity are met with his display of likability, experience, and results. Washington portrays a man of deeply held convictions that poses as a good cop to fool all those around him. Washington earned that Oscar for real. You will absolutely despise his character by the end. Notably, Ethan Hawke is the everyman rookie cop that we are meant to empathize with from the very first scene. We are along for the ride right by Hawke's side and he plays it wonderfully. From the naive well wisher that does not understand the streets to the honest cop that does the right thing, Hawke pulls off a very relatable performance in Training Day. He plays off of Washington's outgoing psychopath very convincingly down to the last. I like Hawke in Training Day quite a bit. I must mention there are so many neat cameo and supporting roles scattered throughout Training Day. From Scott Glenn, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Eva Mendes, and Terry Crews. Training Day's cast is wild. Everyone is realistic and feels a part of this horrid world of crime and corruption. In all, Antoine Fuqua did a phenomenal job directing Training Day. It has aged well with the same intensity as when it first released in theaters. Training Day is still shocking and visceral down to the last moment. This is a brutal ride along for the books, but well worth the watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Nothing Special, Just ""Typical"" Denzel.","To tell you the truth,now that i am commenting on this movie i do have a ""guilty feeling"", giving this movie a score of : 1 out of 10.So i changed it to : 4 Out Of 10!But really after watching it : i couldn't really do anything else!The hole show was Denzel Washington and to this day now i really can't understand why the plot was so predictably Poor!It's easy to predict a ""Denzel Washington-Movie"" when you see it. Because the role is always the same : ""A man ho has to run from his family to protect his wife and child and also has to deal with the mafia. or like in this movie he deals with Drug-mafia's and for once he's the Bad Guy!.""This one wasn't special although i must admit i have a ""Soft-Spot"" for the ""Beautiful, Foxy and Sexy Femme Fatale"" Eva Mendes.This movie just didn't do it for me.Denzel Washington is an actor but is he a great actor?He has won an Oscar, but let me ask you this : Is everyone ho wins an Oscar ""Worthy"" of winning the Prize?Is John Ruiz truly a Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the world?Is Lennox Lewis one of the all-time great Heavyweight Boxing champions?The answer on the Denzel Washington question will always be a split decision, in my eyes.The best movie i saw of him was : ""The Hurricane"".That was truly a brilliant performance, but ""Training Day"" is not.And i think that movie will always make the grade in my book.The ""annoying"" thing about this movie is that the ""predictability"" is pretty ""obvious and boring"".When i mean ""Predictability"" i mean : Guns, Drugs, Mafia, shootout and This and that.And even if Denzel played the ""Bad Guy"".There wasn't anything ""Special"" about that role.Russell Crowe's ""Beautiful Mind"" but especially Will Smith's Ali are much better ""Performance's"".Some people on ""this Board"" seem to think this movie is ""real day to day life."" or think that this Denzel's best performance.Well i don't think so!Hurricane was his best, Malcolm X i wasn't impressed with and Out Of Time was Good to watch but Sanaa Lathan and again Eva Mendes made it even more Tasty!And all that talk about this movie being real ""day to day"" life?How ""Out of touch"" can you be?At the end of the day everyone is in titled to his opinion.So my conclusion : This movie isn't one of ""Denzel's"" better performance's. Eva Mendes will always be ""Beautiful"" on the screen, she is a ""Very Underrated"" Talent.Ethan Hawke seemingly is very popular for his ""role"", witch was pretty good.And there are a lot of ""unnecessary"" ""Rappers"" invited like Dr. Dre and Snoop ""Doggy"" Dogg.And that doesn't much help the credibility of the ""real life case"" of this movie, that is put forward by some people on this board.And although the movie is rated ""High"" by many in my eyes the movie was nothing special than a ""Mediocre, Nothing Special Predictable"" Performance.For the people ho enjoy these kind of ""Action, Drug Mafia and Denzel type movies"" I'd recommend it.But for people ho are looking for ""more"" depth and a better or a more ""Real Life"" performance, i say : This is not the movie for You!My Score : 4.2""Groeten"" from Gerrit",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Washington is sensational,"Denzel Washington is sensational in this, the plot might not quite match his performance but 'Training Day' is still a great watch. It's a riveting 122 minutes, I'm just not in love with how the premise is played out.Washington's character, Alonzo, never really changes throughout, despite a supposed problem of his. I kept waiting for a reason to change the opinion that the first act puts to you regarding him but it never came, there's never a point I cared for him and I assume I was supposed to... at least to some degree? Also, his issue is thrown at you in one scene and isn't really mentioned again until the end. I get the character, just not his arc.Ethan Hawke is very good, too, in this, even if I kept hearing Tom Cruise when he spoke... You also have a load of now familiar faces involved, including Eva Mendes, Raymond Cruz, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Terry Crews. Quite an interesting cast list, that.Loved all of this, except the (still good) plot execution. Maybe that's just me though. From what I've seen, Washington's best performance so far.

"Gritty, thoughtful police drama with an outstanding performance by Denzel Washington","This unflinchingly realistic police drama takes viewers into the dangerous world of drug dealing that runs rampant in the streets of South Central Los Angeles and where is a subject on nearly every street of the area. Along the side, this film also gives viewers an inside look at the corruption of law enforcement and police brutality that remains a major issue in the United States today. The film places Ethan Hawk in the role of Jake Hoyt, a rookie cop who ventures on a 24- hour 'ride along' with veteran narcotics detective Alonzo Harris (played by Denzel Washington). Cruising through the dirty, crime-ridden streets of Los Angeles, Harris pulls Hoyt in the grueling of crime and drug-busting. However, when Alonzo's lines between right and wrong become blurred and his bold decisions put Hoyt's life at risk, Hoyt soon find himself in a dangerous game of survival. This film is directed by Antoine Faqua and written by David Ayer who would later go on write and direct many other cop dramas.Not many films portray the harrowing reality of the law enforcement as realistically as this one does, and this film does not shy away from the dark side of police corruption as we watch the characters venture through the sordid streets of the South Los Angeles suburbs and experience the violence and gang activity that consumes these neighborhood. Thanks to Denzel Washington who breaks his usual good- guy typecasting to portray a narcotics cop who suffers significant ethical dilemmas and brings his first-time partner in jeopardy. The intensity of his character drives the plot in a long run, to the crescendo in the last half hour of the film At one point during the training, his character busts two teenagers for possession in marijuana with phencycldine, upon taking it he smokes it and then offers it to Ethan Hawke's character who in response smokes it. This scene immediately leaves you questioning on who his character is and leaves you with thoughts that this character could be up to no good. Denzel Washington gives an outstanding performance as Detective Alonzo Harris. Throughout the film, Washington is just drowned out in his role with such powerful effort. It is quite astonishing to see him play in a villainous role so well after watching him play in good-guy roles in his other works. Ethan Hawke does a magnificent job here too. He is shown to be very committed in what is arguably the best role of his career, and his talent shines bright here.Training Day is a highly entertaining movie and a textbook addition to the police drama genre.

"Watch it for Washington's performance; some well made, unpredictable scenes and let it just draw you in.","What we have with Training Day is a big mixture of: gangster, crime, cop/buddy and something close to resembling a ghetto drama all in one. Needless to say that all these aspects of the film work together in a reasonably effective way which, in the end, leaves you feeling satisfied. There are individual strokes of greatness but these are limited to things like Denzil Washington's performance who reminded me of a Wesley Snipes character out of something like 'New Jack City' (1991). There is also the element of unpredictability for the best part as relative rookie Jake (Hawke) gets put through some pretty harsh paces for the first forty minutes or so.I came away from Training Day liking it overall but there were some distinct things that had me thinking to myself 'Yeah, I see exactly what they're trying to do here.' And this is relatable to the 'buddy/cop' sequence. Jake and Alonzo (Washington) are the absolute binary opposites of one another: you couldn't get two more different characters. One is a 'desk' cop who books illegally parked cars and probably takes the odd trip to the doughnut shop one too many times (although his build doesn't suggest this) whereas Alonzo is one of those cops you see in films and if you were ever going to become a law enforcer, you'd want to live their lifestyle: guns, girls and plenty of softly earned drug money. Although this is nothing new, it was refreshing to see it done in an unpredictable manner and of course, Washington's performance sees it out.Secondly, the way in which each character acts  Jake seems sharper and wants to do everything by the book whereas Alonzo's methods include something more reminiscent of: instead of arresting two rapists, just threaten in an extreme manner to shoot their genitalia off if they catch them doing it again and let them go. Jake even talks and dresses differently and of course, Ethan Hawke is a white Caucasian American  Washington is coloured so these two characters make for great entertainment in an easily explosive situation when you've got two people so different in looks and lifestyles.Thanks to some good film-making, certain situations of tension and spontaneity happen and are carried out well. These situations are also very awkward and since we're supposed to map onto the character of Jake more so than Alonzo, we do sort of feel what he's feeling  again, this is thanks to Washington's amazing performance; especially when he either forces Jake to take a smoke of some drugs or when someone is unexpectedly shot and Jake is panting heavily or even when they drive though a bad neighbourhood and Alonzo states: 'Don't you ever come here without me' as black ghetto gangsters eye up the vehicle. Although this manipulates our opinions on Jake as a bit of a wimp and further makes us think Alonzo is sort of invincible, the payoff for thinking these things is great  the filmmakers make us think of one thing so much that all the odds seemed stacked against us later on.What was also clever is the way in which the film can change so dramatically  although not entirely realistic all the time, one situation or setting can very quickly change in an instant. This could include when Jake is in big trouble with some Mexican gangsters but gets out of jail thanks to a previous deed that he did. Although this was a bit of a fluke, it would still be possible in the tightly knitted world of crime that particular city possesses. Although these changes are unpredictable and entertaining, lines must be drawn somewhere especially in which the finale is played out: where several characters seem to switch sides to team up with a guy who they've known of for about twelve hours, which was a little unbelievable.In the long run, Training Day is a very entertaining film that doesn't cover too much ground in terms of innovation or anything deeper than that but it is a clever example of how to suck an audience in and play with them later on.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A good film about a rookie cop who spends his first day as a Los Angeles police officer with a rogue inspector who is not what he seems to be.,"For eager young detective Jake Hoyt: Ethan Hawke today is his first day in the field under the tutelage of Washinton's jaundiced narc, Alonzo Harris. Shades of 'Buddy Movie' immediately evapore when Harris compels his partner to sample the illegal substances they have just seized from some unlucky daytrippers. That's just for starters because Harris has twisted and sinister plans. He only thing more dangerous than the line being crossed, is the cop who will cross it !.This nail-biting thriller packs noisy action, shoot outs, violence, and continuous intrigue. Prestigious writer David Ayer has crafted quite a career for himself as the go-to guy when comes to movie that explores the dark side of a law enforcement, including as follows: Training day (2001), Dark Blue (2002), Harsh times (2005), Street kings (2008), End of Watch (2012) , and Sabotage (2014) at which he either writes, directs or doing both duties, This cop corruption tale is worth watching for the ferocious acting of the Oscarized Denzel Washington. He is veteran undercover narc Alonzo, who's been the big dog on the L. A. streets for so long. He's become morally bankrupt and works on the might makes right theory of justice. Alonzo isn't exactly undercover, rather he operates in plain sight, playing both sides of the law against each other to his own ends. Opposing him is rookie Jake Hoyt who first wants to be a part of of Alonzo's team and then learns just what it will cost him. Suffering remorseless verbal and physical humiliation, Hawke doesn't get much time for goateescratching , which is just as well, given the storyline is more propulsive than credible. Washington and Hawke are well accompanied by a good support cast with plenty of veterans and new comers, such as: Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin, Raymond J. Barry, Cliff Curtis, Snoop Dogg, Macy Gray, Eva Mendes, Nick Chinlund, Peter Greene, Terry Crews, Jaime Gomez, Samantha Esteban, Raymond Cruz, among others. While the film was praised for its acting performances, action sequences, and dark tone, the script was criticized for some clichés . Filmmaker Fuqua keeps it sleazy and slick and stokes up the race some, but this only accelerates the film's deafening rush toward the and ever over.It contains an atmospheric and thrilling musical score by Mark mancina. As well as as evocative cinematography by cameraman Mario Fiore. Director Fuqua shot on location so you can definitely feel the grit. Director Antoine Fuqua who frequently deals familiar conflicts set in N. Y , and here in L. A. keeps the film slick and stokes up the race some , but this only accelerates the flick's deafening rush toward the top and ever over. Fuqua handles the explosive action and the psychological undercurrents with equal assurance . In 'Training Day' , Fuqua displays his usual trademarks that are very common in his films, such as: The main characters secretly hide their past; most of his films contain politically driven elements and themes; hard characters, hard conflict scene, and hard film setting; neutral dark tone; his pictures often feature a shot that is or turns upside-down. Antoine Fuqua has made a lot of succesful movies , such as : The Magnificent Seven , Olympus Has Fallen, The Equalizer , Equalizer 2 , Southpaw , King Arthur , Training Day , Shooter , Tears of the Sun , Bait , among others. Rating : 7/10 . The yarn will appeal to Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke fans. Well worth watching .",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
It's my favourite movie,"I remember being lent this on DVD during the summer holidays by a mate soon after it was out. I must have watched it every day/second day for about a month! I loved it so much I could never get enough. Denzel and Ethan are a perfect match for this movie; I can't imagine anyone else playing their rolls. Can you? You will either love this movie or find it just a way to 'pass a night'. If you connect with it then you'll never forget it. I know I haven't and I haven't watched it since 2002 because I can remember every part in detail! Training Day is one of those movies which breaks new ground in terms of how a movie can come across to people. It was filmed in such locations such as Imperial Courts neighborhood which, until now, hasn't been filmed. The talk is the talk... you get a real sense of what it's like for these guys as narcotic officers and for what it's like for these guys as the 'bad guys' themselves. At the end of they day they're ""Just people and they always were"" (Ethan Hawk in a making of Traning day interview).The movie isn't the fastest paced one around - there are some slow moments but they are played out meaningfully due to some great acting talent which gels the scenes together well. The more you watch it, the more subtle lines and actions you will pick up which make this movie authentic.Overall, to each his own. I have found this to be one of my favorite movies due to great acting, great directing, great casting (Hawk, Washington, Scott Glen etc) and an interesting storyline.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Repulsive and stupid,"I was eager to see this film, having missed its theatrical release.  I wanted to see Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance. Unfortunately, it was a waste of 2 hours.Ugly scenes pile up one after the other in this film, one more repulsive than the other.  The film makes a weak gesture at introducing an interesting moral dilemma: is it possible to fight the evil of drug-dealing while holding onto one's own sense of morality?  But ultimately, it has nothing complex or thoughtful to say about that dilemma.  The best performance in the film is actually Ethan Hawke's, a character torn by conflicting impulses. Hawke does a fine job of conveying that inner turmoil. Washington's performance is mostly just showing off, but then his character is largely a cartoon character.  The Oscar is a make-up for other better performances that have gone unrewarded.And isn't it enlightening that all of the film's people of color are despicable drug dealer or corrupt cops while the film's conscience is the white cop?I was generous; I rated the movie a 3.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great acting by Washington and Hawke Excellent Thriller - Action Film!,"This movie impressed me by its great quality in all ways, the story, thrilling with great police detective action and the most remarkable aspect of the movie was the acting performances of Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke; they put his soul on the characters making this movie a total delight for those who like action films with intelligent scripts and also like for high quality films.About the Movie: Ethan Hawke plays Jake Hoyt, a rookie police officer with a good curriculum that is assigned to a one day trial day in order to qualify for a narcotics division in Los Angeles. Hawke meets then detective Alonzo Haris (Denzel Washington) who was assigned as trainer and evaluator for this rookie. Hoyt wants fiercely to get this assignment, but finds very orthodoxes and quaint ways to ""protet and to serve"" of Alonzo. In this day Hoyt will meet a true challenge and will face the total opposite way to proceed from the one he learned in the academy; he will also face some of the more dangerous neighborhoods and streets of Los Angeles.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"First day on a new job, can be stressful...","Denzel is a real chameleon. This is a sinister and likable personality...all because of him. Enter Ethan Hawke's character, officer Jake Hoyt. With the allure of a new job, a transfer to the division that he has been working hard to reach. He is at the top of his game.The Call, from the department head, Alonzo Harris, congratulating him on his promotion, sort of. Denzel Washington, takes on a character, like none other that he has had so far. Sounds like a big business wall street type scenario aye? Not even close, down of skid-row street maybe. This is a story set in Los Angeles, that even when it's daylight, this is the darkest 'beat' in the whole department's city.From the moment that the meet was set at the coffee shop, something is just, slightly skewed. There seems an absence of real concern for Jake's situation and a lot more mechanical rogue cop, trainer 'Doggin' going on here. Alonso wants to catch him up on what's going on, of course, see what he is made of, but Alonzo is dangerous, because he doesn't care, anymore. His soul has departed, and it's simply a matter of time before, he is too. As they departed from the coffee shop, by way of a black Monte Carlo. The director, Antoine Fuqua wanted to show a more real and brutal side of the crime busting business. The place where lines are so blurred...if they even exist anymore. Denzel Washington, should be applauded for the part that he became ' wholly ' involved in. Scary in some ways, it appeared as if there was no acting, just this over the edge ' Narc ' who you just gotta watch like a hawk!Ethan, was the ' newbie ' but a very likable, ""Just wanting to do the right thing"" type of guy. Some what confused at times about the way in which Harris attended to his profession. Curious about why he would do what he would do. Alonzo, always explaining away the point to a nervous rookie, who in the back of his mind just knew, that there is something here, that won't let him rest until he does the right thing. It almost costs him his life, in the end, Hoyt is a master in his career field...a true Wolf, amongst the dogs. It seemed as though, Hoyt had an awakening. He had to go down into that alley-way because his 'gut' wouldn't let it alone. And in the end, this is what saved his very existence, now that is reasoning with razor sharpness. Plus he needed to get home to that hot wife of his....Recommended, but not for those with weaker film story constitutions. (*****)",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great movie!,"Training Day is a good movie and I think it is a good movie for all of the right reasons.The plot is very interesting.It follows two LAPD narcotics detectives named Jake Hoyt and Alonzo Harris over a twenty four-hour in the gang neighborhoods of North West and South Central Los Angeles and they ride around the block, do some cop work and this leads into a very good and intense ending.The acting is amazing in this film.Ethan Hawke plays Jake Hoyt and he did incredible in all of his scenes, including that fight he had with Denzel Washington at the end of the film and I am surprised that he did not win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his part. He deserved that Oscar and I will forever be mad that he did not get it.The real credit is given to the man himself, Denzel Washington, who I reviewed as The Equalizer in the 2014 film based on the television series of the same name.Denzel Washington plays the villain Alonzo Harris really amazing and his performance was just top-notch and very amazing and not only he played that part amazingly, he did a great job with the dialogue written for him at the end when all of the gang members turn against him after letting Ethan Hawke's character got home and the scene where he was shot by Russian gang members just had me wanting to cry the first time I saw this film.He won the Oscar for Best Actor and he was spectacular in the role and it is a departure from his usual roles that he played and he would play Frank Lucas in the 2007 film American Gangster and he did a really amazing job.The rest of the cast, nothing more to say about them, but they all do great, especially Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg in the screen time that they have.The music by Mark Mancina is just amazing and I listen to the musical score and soundtrack for this film on my phone and it sounds really good in the film and I could have not been more happier.Overall, I love Training Day. It is a fine example of what police dramas should be and this film does not get enough credit.8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Non Stop thrill ride,Training Day is great film with two great performances. Denzel Washington delivers a great performance. As crooked cop that is constantly irritating the viewer. He does a great job in his role. Ethan Hawke also does a great job as the new guy. Building up his rage waiting for him to snap. This film never gives you a break it is non stop.

Gritty and Real,"What I liked about this movie was how real it felt. Denzel excels as usual as a bad guy but meanwhile engages you to the point that you almost want to see him succeed. Ethan Hawke plays the younger cop amazingly and you honestly want to see him succeed. Does this type of police corruption happen everyday in Los Angeles or in any city in America? Probably on a level that we don't know and this movie enforces that trope great. Throw in great cameo by Tom Berringer and other actors that you recognize, and it's an engaging watch that I can help but sit down, grab my popcorn and see everytime it's on.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
I'm sorry but I didnt really like this movie.,"It was a good concept and it looked pretty promising, but it kind of just bugged me as it went along. Its probably more of my problem then it is the films but it never really caught my interest. I kept expecting the 2 characters to run into a big plot, but that never happened. It was more of an assortment of things, which I wasnt prepared for. And (I dont care if he won an Oscar for it) I really hated Denzel Washington's character. And not in the good way that they wanted me to (i.e. Tom Berenger's Sgt. Barnes in Platoon) but more just in an annoying ""Oh my god, why wont you die already!?!"" way (i.e. That spoon kid from Mimic). It just seemed like he was TRYING to win an Oscar for it. I never really believed him as the character (that was problem with Denzel in John Q too. But I did happen to like that movie a lot better then this one.)It did have some good movies. Some of the situations they got in were very cool and I did like Ethan Hawke's character and some of the other supporting cast. So it wasnt a total loss. But still I didnt like it much.

If I could only use one word to describe this movie: BADASS,"Training Day is a brutal, violent film. But it is a film that doesn't hold anything back and forces the viewer to take it as it is. There are no clichés, nothing feels sappy, and it is a hard experience for the viewer at times to see the reality of the streets of L.A. and its corruption depicted in this movie.Powered by an amazing performance from Denzel Washington, the man's performance was 100% Oscar-worthy. It is one of those few performances that it doesn't feel like the man's acting, it just seems natural and you think that he IS the character. Ethan Hawke is not bad at all in the film, he's actually pretty good but he lives in the shadow of Denzel's performance in this movie.A lot of people complain about the ending, for some reason.

"Don't mind the critics, this movie is good stuff!","Before watching the movie I had read some good and some bad credits about this movie. Some said it was overrated, that it wasn't realistic at all... Others said that it was the best movie they had ever seen. I saw the movie for the first time three years after it appeared in the theaters. Perhaps that is why I wasn't as influenced by the hype which was created around the movie as some other people may have been. Overall I liked the movie, though I wasn't very impressed with the first 20 to 30 minutes.What is the story about? The young police officer, Jake Hoyt, who has a perfect family, wants to get a better job within the LAPD. He doesn't want to write parking tickets for the rest of his life, but wants to become a detective in the Narcotica Brigade. To get this job, he will get some help and advice from a detective which is already chasing the bad guys for many years, but who isn't afraid to cross the line from time to time. Hoyt will have to make some big decisions, will he stay the good cop or will he cross the line as well?This movie may be a little predictable from time to time, but overall there are enough twists and unexpected plots to keep you focused and interested. The action is well portrayed, without exaggerating and Denzel Washington is really fabulous. I guess many people were a little bit disappointed because he played another part than what they expected from him. I liked him and I would advice everyone to watch the movie.

Much ado about not much.,"First, I'll state I'm a big fan of Denzel Washington. I really enjoy his movies. That's why this is a bit of a disappointment. I'm very surprised that this got him the Oscar. He's had so many better roles and movies.The movie wanted to be realistic, but the story is unbelievable. There's no way a savvy Alonzo, with so much at risk, would have involved a total wildcard like Jake.Even if you go along the plot, none of the characters are that gripping. I didn't care about anyone in the movie, except for a couple of kids.I'd say 4 out of 10 stars.",,Anonymous,Crime
"""King Kong ain't got s*** on me!""","SYNOPSIS:
Jake (Ethan Hawks) spends his first day with Alonzo (Denzel Washington) as a narcotics officer finding out that it might not be as clean of a job that he was hoping for.REVIEW:
This film is completely driven by Denzel. Not to say Ethan Hawke or any of the other cast aren't great, but the life Denzel gives to Alonzo is on another planet. The charisma and aura he builds around his character makes him take control of every scene that he's in. Then you have Ethan Hawke who does really well as his straight partner. Someone who Alonzo can manipulate in the beginning because of being the newby, but not incompetent where he doesn't quickly catch on to what's really happening. David Ayer is really good at creating your average day characters and creating a solid, realistic script with them. He did the same in ""End of Watch"" and in ""Fury."" I would say that Alonzo it the outlier, but I believe that Denzel is what made that character who he is. Then you have Antoine Fuqua (Director) creating these very tense scenes between characters, like the kitchen scene with Jake and Smiley (Cliff Curtis). Scenes like this really bring the film above and beyond.If you're looking for a crime drama that has fantastic acting and some very tense moments, this is the one. 9.1/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

It's just so unrealistic,"POSITIVES:1) Ethan Hawke is the heart and soul of the film; he deserves a share of the praise that is thrown all over Denzel for this film
2) There are definitely some moments of prolonged tension
3) Denzel's erratic character does a good job of keeping you on edge; although it was a bit too reminiscent of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas for me
4) It is rare for a film in this genre to feature so much character moments and dialogue rather than just being mindless action; the film should be commended for thatNEGATIVES:1) The film is so unrealistic and the two leads are so outlandish that at no point do they actually feel like cops; they're more like mob enforcers
2) It completely took me out of the film that Still D.R.E. plays in the film and then Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg actually appear
3) It rubs me up the wrong way that the Oscars deemed Denzel to be the lead actor and Hawke to be the supporting actor
4) It is definitely too long and there are multiple scenes that could be taken out and wouldn't change the story one bit
5) I know you could argue that this is deliberate, but I just hated Denzel's character so much and I found his actions absurd at times",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Good acting, repellent premise for a film","At the time of penning this review, 774 others already existed so very likely I ain't about to say nuttin' new! Suffice it to say that Director Fuqua does not waste any time hitting the usual over the top note and to that end he relies on a flamboyant and excessive performance from Denzel Washington, who nevertheless won an Oscar for it.The more restrained Ethan Hawke seems a tad old to be looking so innocent and bushy tailed as he goes on his first day as a trainee in an LAPD narco detail. The obvious question after the first five few minutes is: why does LAPD bother to have a narco detail if the main drug busters double up as main drug runners and seize such large sums for themselves?Of course there are corrupt officers in any police force in any country, but,
given the tools, checks and balances available to police in the USA, it is really difficult accept that premise, not to mention that Denzel's bent cop character is repellent throughout.Hawke balances things somewhat with his basic decency but you can see he will not last in such corrupt and vicious surroundings. Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, and Harris Yulin have meaningless small parts that only needlessly extend an overlong flick.Strong script up until the final fight between the leads, at which point it truly derails into dementia.Film's main saving grace: Eva Mendes in the nude, bush and all.

Never to age.,"The morning sun peaks it's fiery head and with it two men in a diametrically opposite state of mind and situation awaken. Each have a different plan for the day. Jake's is doing good and contributing to the betterment of society and Alonzo's is pulling himself out of the muck he put himself in at any cost. But none of their plans go as they intended thus the reason for this movie's erratic thrill.Training day is a well conceived, incredibly performed, eloquently written, beautifully directed, captivating and mind bending art. Things start out seemingly innocent and slowly keep devolving into hotter and fierier hell revealing the conceited, manipulative, crooked, sadistic, uncaring and arrogant monstrosity of Alonzo. Poor and naive Jake unaware of the scheme his future to be boss plotted against him gets baited into delving deeper and deeper into the slimy and foul acts of Alonzo and when things seem ineludible, his benign act saves him from certain death.Training day is awesome as a second watch cause you'll see the foreshadowing of it all ( Jake paying his death money hit right in the guts for me ) and appreciate the smarts that went into building the intricate plot and characters.Denzel's charismatic and menacing performance, Ethan's confusion and eventual degradation into disappointment, depravity and rage and Eva's helpless look impressed me as all totally morphed into these incredibly complex and authentic characters. Denzel especially was unlike anything I've ever seen. He became Alonzo and pushed his character to a point that's irredeemably evil and hella scary.Every scene was well directed and pretty to the eyes and the colorful lines ( esp Alonzo's ) are to never stale and be forgotten. A sensational thriller with a karma driven theme that has been aging like a fine wine since the day of it's release.

Not so much,"This movie was hyped up so much cuz Denzel was playing a ""bad"" guy now. My problem isnt with that. My issue is with the Oscars for giving him the award for this particular movie. He was great, no doubt, but he's done better movies with more compelling stories. It's like it was a handout for playing something more true to his ""race"". I thought the film was gritty enough and showed that cops can be turned from seeing what they see all the time. The film was good at presenting that side instead of the justice for side. Ethan Hawke kinda took a backseat to Denzel's power in this film. It was necessary however so Hawke could determine for himself if he wanted that life badly enough. It made me wonder how many cops are like that and if there really is any justice left when within the police lie people like Alonzo. Not too bad a film, but you have to have a penchant for films about bad cops, and I don't. Even with Denzel in it.",,Anonymous,Crime

Jake shows up and sits in the booth across from the boss, Alonzo Harris (Washington), a legendary narcotics officer that Jake has heard more than a few stories about. At first, Jake tries to ask about the job, procedures, etc,, but Harris quickly fills Jake in on how he conducts his Narcotics team. They don't operate out of a police precinct. They operate out of Harris car (which he refers to as his office).Jake quickly realizes that he's not at the police academy anymore.As the day gets going, Harris takes Jake on a whirlwind ride through LA's roughest neighborhoods, shaking down crooks, addicts, even innocent bystanders.Jake is able to stop an attempted rape in broad daylight (which he receives very little help in from Harris). The more time that passes, the more Jake suspects his new boss may be the worst element on the streets that he swore to protect.Washington gives the performance of a lifetime in this movie.

Denzel Washington at the very top of his game,"Every great actor has a defining performance. A performance that they will always be remembered for. De Niero's was Raging Bull , Pacino's was Scarface and Tom Hank's was Forest Gump. I believe Denzel Washington will always be remembered for his role as Detective Alonzo Harris in Training Day. This was the first time we had really seen Washington play a bad guy and you have to say , he took to it like a duck to water.Training Day is one of my favourite movies of all time. Movies don't get much grittier than this one. Director Antoine Fuqua pulls no punches when telling the story of a rookie cop's first day as detective. Ordinarily we would be raving about the brilliant performance of Ethan Hawke as Jake Hoyt but such is the personality and expertise of Denzel Washington , Hawke is overshadowed. The scene in the kitchen when he is left alone with the card playing gang members is a memorable one.This movie is 10 years old now and rarely has there been a film since to compare.

Denzel's Definitely Different,"A departure from being the normal good guy made this Denzel Washington movie a bit different.....and unpopular with a lot of his fans. I found it a very intense story of two Los Angeles cops: one being a veteran corrupt one ""Alonzo"" (Washington) and the other a rookie, honest one ""Jake"" (Ethan Hawke). This is a bit sordid at times, with over 100 f-words, but was almost mesmerizing at times and hard to put down once the film started. At least that was the case on the first viewing. On the second, I didn't find the whole thing that appealing.I don't know if this is a realistic look at the crime areas of Los Angeles, but if it is, wow: pretty frightening. Washington's viewpoints, however twisted with this particular character, made some sense in parts, sad to say. Overall, not a pleasant film but certainly an interesting one.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Why did I sleep over that gem.,"Believe it or not, yesterday, I saw that movie for the first time and I had no clue about the story. Somehow I confused it with that bank robbery movie with Denzel, Inside Man, so, I absolutely had no clue. And in my opinion, this is the best way to watch any movie. That movie made me ROFL, being shocked. Annoyed, ANGRY. I had all kinds of reactions due to the story that is absolutely unpredictable. Due to mind-blowing scenes and these great roles played by all actors. Denzel plays a selfish psychopath in the best possible way. A real prick.

A Look Inside the Los Angeles Police Department?,"""Training Day"", to me, seemed a bit far-fetched, at least at the beginning. I couldn't see an officer behaving the way Alonzo (Denzel Washington) does. But he's sort of undercover, so I get it. And luckily, the film takes steps to correct his extreme behavior as it goes on, explaining things more clearly.Denzel Washington is widely considered to be at his peak here, and won an Oscar for his performance. Sadly, I think Ethan Hawke gets overlooked. He put in a great performance himself, and is generally not given the credit he deserves. Maybe he's not as high-profile as Denzel, but the man has been in the business as long time and this film really showcased his skills.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Awful or Excellent?,"I am not sure how to rate this movie, 1 of 10 awful, or 10 of 10 excellent.If you like being frighten and appalled while watching a movie, and enjoy walking away feeling disgusted and dirty, wanting to burn your close and take a shower, and derive joy from having bad dreams at night, than THIS is the movie for you!Training Day depicts the worse aspects of humanity, betrayal, treachery, greed, murder; and shows an unsuspecting trainee cop pitted against this onslaught while he searches to do the right thing; and photographs it all in a horrifying way.  This is NOT a feel good movie.  This is not a movie for the faint of heart, nor children, nor anyone under thirty who may well be scandalized. This movie is disgusting, vile and is a piece of trash.On the other hand, Training Day is movie making at its Very Best!  Denzel Washington is remarkably good with his performance of Detective Alonzo Harris; and Ethan Hawke, the trainee, seems to come out of no where to match Denzel's performance scene to scene with the excellence attributed only to the premium big name heavy weight actors in Hollywood today. And that's not easy to do!  Denzel Washington is as good an actor as there ever was, and better then most. Hawke's performance is superlative.Astonishing performances were also rendered by Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin, Raymond J. Barry, Cliff Curtis, Macy Gray, Scott Glenn , Nick Chinlund, Jaime Gomez, and on and on.  How did they all get so good?!This movie is an excellent film due in large part to Denzel Washington who makes everyone around him perform better at their work.  Director Antoine Fuqua, and actress Macy Gray openly admitted this on the DVD's special feature segment.The intensity of Training Day paralyzes the viewer and doesn't let go until the end.  This movie is a ride into hell.So, how does one rate this film, Awful or Excellent?",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Good Deed goes Unpunished,"In this Modern Film Noir classic, Denzel Washington is Detective Alonzo Harris, who runs an elite narcotics task force. Ethan Hawkes is Jake Hoyt, newly ""recruited"" to it and even eager to join.Hoyt immediately sees that Harris is not your run of the mill detective, he appears to have a unique style of ""detecting"" - Which involves all kinds of bullying and fear tactics- And he does not limit this to suspects, he uses them on Hoyt as well.In reality Harris has a specific agenda. Hoyt goes along with it but each activity of their day raises the red flag level higher and higher.Harris actually rules over a small section of hell, a gang-ridden neighborhood called ""The Jungles"" where his son and girlfriend Sara (Eva Mendes) live. Harris expressly instructs Hoyt never to enter ""The Jungles"" by himself. Harris appears to be the ""benevolent protector"" of this neighborhood and we get that impression as well. Remember, this is all appearances- This whole film depends on our ""First Impressions"" and how they are wrong.We get to meet many of Harris' ""friends"" and acquaintances, who are either ""retired"" drug pushers who have served their time (Scott Glenn as ""Roger"") or Judges and DA's (Harris Yulin and Tom Berenger and Doug Rosselli and Stan Gursky respectively). In fact, the two categories of people are interconnected in some way through Harris. And Harris plays them like finely tuned instruments.And now Harris has chosen Jake Hoyt. The only question we can ask as the body count rises is ""Why""?Alonzo likes Hoyt because he has a good eye for what is happening around him, this is proved when Hoyt sees a rape happening in the corner of his eye, jumps out of the car and takes on the two gang-bangers who are piling on a hapless girl. In the process she loses her wallet and Jake picks it up: File for future use.This film puts a new slant on the words ""Patsy"" and ""Double/Triple/Quadruple Cross"".Washington plays this as if he's the guy, just like he does any other role, Hawkes follows suit with the ""Innocent Look"" that hides the fact that he's seen more than he lets on. Look for the likes of Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg, and veteran character actors Nick Chinlund and Raymond Cruz- Several real gang-bangers from the LA neighborhood called ""The Jungles"" were used as well.Antoine Fuqua mimics Tony Scott's style of directing with a great score by Mark Mancina peppered with some decent Rap tracks and other interesting music.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Perfect Vehicle To Match Denzel's Intensity,"Since it's 2001 release, ""Training Day"" has come to be known as one of the most intense films ever made. Director Antoine Fuqua and writer David Ayer craft a tale that pulls absolutely no punches in its portrayal of life on LA's ""mean streets"". There are few lead actors that would be up to the task of matching such intensity, but fortunately this film employs one of them.For a very basic overview, ""Training Day"" sees young cop Jake (Ethan Hawke) looking to start a career path in the narcotics division. On his first day, he is paired with veteran detective Alonzo (Denzel Washington), who gives him a physical--and psychological--tour of LA's drug trade and the queasy or downright dirty methods often undertaken--even as wearers of the badge--to get the job done.In terms of overall plot, the whole ""gritty cop ethics"" theme is one that will vary from person to person. If such moralizing is ""your thing"", ""Training Day"" will probably be one of your all-time favorites. It truly is fearless in its portrayal of the seedier side of police work, often to the point of outright discomfort.But even if hard-boiled ""cop stuff"" isn't your cup of tea, Washington's performance gives the film such a high floor. This seems like a role that Denzel was born to play, allowing him to glower, crack wise, and monologue (usually emphatically!) in equal parts. There is not a moment he's on screen when your eyes won't be drawn to his presence. You'll get no complaints from me on his Oscar take-home.Perhaps overlooked in the wake of Denzel's masterpiece is Hawke's own solid acting job here. Denzel's schtick only works if another character can be made an audience proxy, and Hawke does that admirably. Viewers may marvel at Alonzo's swagger, but they'll identify with Jake's sense of conscience and morality.Overall, I consider ""Training Day"" to be a solid film featuring an extraordinary acting performance. The hard cop stuff isn't my personal favorite genre, but even then I'd never go lower than 7/10 simply for the atmosphere of tension that Fuqua, Washington, and Hawke create from beginning to end.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Outstanding Denzel, relentless violence; is there a point to this ?","Training Day is a very provocative film. I disliked the how the director and writers, like so often in Hollywood for the past 50 years, use violence to force our attention, continuously up the ante, and create a cartoon-like lead character from flesh and blood. But I liked a lot the film's energy and especially the tremendous acting on display from Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke as they react to this hothouse world of violence and street smarts. Denzel shows why and how he is at the top of the acting game in America - no one is better. And Ethan Hawke was brilliant in a role demanding a 12-hour change from naïveté, confusion, nuance, defiance, vulnerability, acceptance, defiance again and finally strength and resolve. The violence and the commentary on inner city life and the police is depressing and scary, but it is very thought-provoking.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
It's not what you know. It's what you can PROVE.,"Denzel Washington completely commands your attention in the role of crooked narcotics detective Alonzo. He's a cheerful, cunning rogue, and a man with his own agenda. He shows rookie detective Jake (Ethan Hawke) an extremely eventful day, as the younger man is eager to advance in rank. What Alonzo proves is that he's really no better than the lowlife criminals whom he regularly rousts. In fact, some people might say he's WORSE.""Training Day"" aims to be an uncompromising look (from screenwriter David Ayer) at life on the meaner streets of L. A. Directed with gusto by Antoine Fuqua, it tells a mean, entertaining story in which the nasty violence is an inevitable part of the package. While ultimately it starts getting pretty conventional - with the well-meaning Jake DETERMINED to see Alonzo brought to justice - and reliant on coincidences, I felt it still made for solid viewing. At the very least, it wasn't boring.Oscar winner Washington completely dominates the proceedings; his is the kind of antagonist whom you can't help but like to some degree. He has that kind of charisma. Yet, of course, he can be totally intimidating when he needs to be. Oscar nominee Hawke does a fine job of mostly reacting to this highly unlikely would-be mentor. Jake certainly does get the kind of education he never could have expected. The stars are extremely well supported by a cast including music notables Snoop Dogg, Macy Gray, and Dr. Dre, as well as Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin, Raymond J. Barry, Cliff Curtis, Eva Mendes, Nick Chinlund, and Raymond Cruz. Appearing uncredited are Peter Greene, Terry Crews, and Ayer himself as one of the Russian hitmen.It certainly helps that Ayer and Fuqua really know the territory. Other than the magnetic performance at the core of the story, it's really their authentic approach that makes this work as well as it does.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good Performances,"An honest rookie cop, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), on his first day in the narcotics division, is assigned to be trained with a street-smart veteran, Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington).

They visit gang-infested neighborhoods, chase drug-dealers and conduct house-raids. But as the day progresses, Harris's methods become increasingly questionable and Hoyt starts suspecting his mentor's true intentions.The stories of corrupt cops and naive, good-looking, rookie cops gaining an experience of their lifetime (""character arc"" in movie parlance) have been told many times by Hollywood.

Pass the Popcorn review,"Denzel Washington won an Oscar for best actor in 2002 for the movie Training Day. Considering the other nominees and Washington's performance, I wouldn't say he deserved it – he wasn't bad, but didn't make an impression either. He based his character on Rafael Perez, a former police officer involved in the LAPD Rampart scandal who covered up robberies and murders.Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) has always wanted to be a police officer so he could rid the society of drugs and dealers. On his first day on the job, however, a much more experienced policeman, detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), takes him around town in his car and shows him that being a police officer is nothing like he imagined.I didn't like this movie, even though it's very good. I found the story to be original, even though it follows the classic good cop vs. bad cop scheme and you can see it from the start: detective Alonzo is irritating, violent, full of himself but he's also experienced; Jake Hoyt, on the other hand, is a family man, an idealist and, maybe one could even say, a fool – but we like him, feel for him and wish his vision of society was the true one. Hawke and Washington both deliver good performances, which makes this movie good since it mostly focuses on their interactions and overall relationship that develops in one day.Training Day is very violent, therefore it would be difficult for me to watch it multiple times. Another problem with the movie is that it becomes boring from time to time – there are some parts you simply must sit through to get to the good parts. On the other hand, some of the twists were truly intelligent and unexpected. The cinematography and the soundtrack are good too. But the ending seems abrupt, and certain characters should have been more developed, or at least given more screen time – especially those Alonzo calls ""the three wise men"". All in all, Training Day is a good movie, and you're guaranteed to like it if you fancy violence and action.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Training Day,"Ethan Hawke is on great form here as the rookie ""Jake"" assigned to the street-wise ""Alonzo"" (Denzel Washington) so he can learn the ropes on the highly dangerous streets of Los Angeles. Unsure as to whether not he is the one being tested, he finds himself being placed in a series of increasingly dubious scenarios by his new partner - each one testing how far he will go; how far he might ""bend"" the rules - just how ruthless can he be? What is soon clear is that ""Alonzo"" has few, if any, boundaries - and we are fairly rapidly immersed in a tale of police corruption and brutality. Will ""Jake"" join that lucrative club, or will he remain steadfast? I am not sure I remember Washington in such an ambiguous role before, and he plays it really well. The dynamic between the two men goes full circle from that of one dependant and slightly awe-inspired to one that puts lives, quite literally, on the line. Antoine Fuqua uses a combination of tautly played-out scenarios, spiky dialogue and plenty of attitude to deliver this solid and superior crime thriller. Well worth seeing on a big screen if you can find it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

And don't be caught out by the casting of Denzel Washington as Detective Alonzo Harris, Jake's mentor-cum-nemesis - this is is not the Washington whom we first met in 1987 in ""Cry, Freedom"" who has since played a whole series of good guy roles. In this movie, he is one real m****r f****r. And, if you don't like this sort of language, don't watch the film because it is replete with four- and six-letter expletives as well as street language that is sometimes hard to follow .Writer David Ayer and director Antoine Fuqua have provided a violent and bloody narrative that grips from start to finish. Both Washington and Hawke are rarely off the screen and Washington in particular gives a capital performance. In fact, both actors attracted Oscar nominations with Washington deservedly winning for Best Actor for his bravura turn.

"Fantastic premise, but too much 'bad-Denzel' for the film's own good ...","Boy, was Denzel Washington good at being bad ! You almost have the feeling that he had fun portraying Detective Alonzo Harris, the corrupt cop and mentor, during the titular ""Training Day"" of Jake Hoyt, the rookie played no less convincingly by Ethan Hawke. Both actors would be nominated for the Oscar, but only Washington took it home. This is how persuasively villainous he was. The recognition also came from the American Film Institute that put him #50 of the Top American villains, the last spot but to his defense, he was the most recent entry. Anyway, « Training Day » has been remembered ever since as the « Bad Guy Denzel Movie ».Washington had fun and it sure shows, he gives a figure that is not that unfamiliar for cop-movies buffs a larger-than-life vibe, he's on the screen for less than twenty seconds that you know you're onto a great creation, a narc cop dressed like a Black Panther or Black Muslim militant, a gangsta goatee and a black beanie, a smile that would make any small-time thug freeze from fear. How come an actor with such a friendly face can get so intimidating, sure part of the merit comes from Washington's performance, but it also owes to Ethan Hawke who, as Jake Hoyt, is the perfect counterpart to Washington's alpha male confidence. And their first exchanges in the restaurant shows with a few words that these men are separated by experience, equaling in such a dirty racket, to an eternity.Hoyt lives in a modest apartment with his wife and a 9-month daughter, his dream is to climb the social ladder, which in the Police, means he must pass the 'danger' square. The training day is Hoyt's opportunity to make his bones, his career depends on it. That perfectly sets up his character, he's a man determined to succeed and be a good police officer. Part of his learning will consist on discovering that both goals can cancel out one another, yet the film would've been too cynical had it been the culmination of the 'coming-of-age' learning. It's not a movie about the disciple outranking the mentor, but the disciple learning a few ropes from the mentor and still be able to stick to his values. And that's what, in my humble opinion, emerges from the first exchanges, Harris is a static character, Hoyt evolves, and part of the interest relies on Jake's evolution. And that works most of the time.The problem with « Training Day » is that it gets so wrapped up on that premise of Washington being the villain that it is almost used like a gimmick, and Hoyt's evolution is only limited by the scope of that training day, we never get to know what changed exactly in his view and how that will affect his future. The film takes a conventional turn to a personal face-off between the good and the bad guy, which in the final act, is a bit of a let down compared to the whole 'close to reality' card it played right at the beginning. ""Training Day"" tries to be many things at the same time, for its own good. Let's get it straight, it never ceases to be entertaining, and this is a good movie, but it could have been so much grander had it chosen not to focus much on Alonzo Harris. In my opinion, he should've been the supporting role, which, technically, he was, as he literally 'supported' the most interesting character's arc.God, that whole first hour of « Training Day » is a terrific slice of post-September-11 era, these times I couldn't imagine I'd be nostalgic of. Even the casting of Snoop Dogg as one of the informers gives the film a little edge by encapsulating the post-Millennium day where urban violence, rap and money contributed heavily to Pop Culture imagery, where the sight of death wasn't a taboo anymore. In a way, Alonzo Harris is an efficient villain because he's emblematic of his time, being a Cop with a 'C' like in cynical, corrupt and charismatic. Yet, it's with Hoyt that I related, as a Millennium kid who wanted to believe there's a part of goodness to take from society, wishing he wouldn't fall in that trap Harris kept luring him into. I also identified with the relationship between the rookie and his new boss, something I've had enough experience to appreciate the realistic way it was conveyed in the film.You know these first days at work, where you're being taken by your coach or top manager everywhere and you feel so useless between all these people who know each other. Indeed, that's why the first day is always the worst : each impression you give is the first, and in Hoyt's business, a bad impression is something he can't afford. You're also the most recent newcomer, the one who knows the least people, this is how marginal you are. The wisest thing is to shut up, to listen, to learn. Hoyt has no other choices than listening to Harris, and Harris is no stupid, he takes advantage from it and cunningly toys with Hoyt's eagerness to prove his value, and isn't that the biggest trap you can fall in. And as the day progresses, you can feel the distance widening between Hoyt and Harris, and I hoped the movie could focus on Hoyt because Harris didn't need more screen time to make an impact, it worked from the start.""Training Day"" tried so many things it got convoluted in complicated plot devices and other contrivances, some of them unfortunately, were too blatant to be even taken seriously. While it started as one hell of a character study mixed with police procedural à la ""French Connection"", it ended like ""Scarface"". I don't mind a good over-the-top performance but the film could've been remembered for more than being that movie with a bad guy Denzel.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Training day ranks up there with The French Connection', Dirty Harry' and L.A. Confidential'.

"Review of ""Training Day""","""Training Day"" is the story of Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), an LAPD rookie who is looking to join a top-notch narcotics squad led by Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris gives Hoyt one simple task; accompany him on a one-day ride-along where he must prove himself worthy of enlistment. Now from this point on the movie maintains a steady level of immense entertainment. The most noteworthy aspect of this movie is Denzel Washington's awesome, and Academy-Award Winning portrayal of Alonzo Harris; the rugged cop that has seemingly blurred the line between what is right and what isn't. His performance is as charismatic and imposing, as it is chilling and antagonizing. Every line that Washington delivered was either intensely funny or incredibly demented (but still funny). Which brings me to the script; ""The Fast And The Furious"" writer, David Ayer, delivers deeply provocative dialogue, as well as a compelling narrative that delves into some very insightful themes. The main theme of the movie, however, seems to be a blend of the ""Crime doesn't pay"" and ""Power corrupts"". So, in a sense, this story not only provides an incredibly accurate depiction of Inner-city LA, and exceedingly tense performances from its actors, but it may also serve as a cautionary tale - a cautionary tale that would not have been told sans the tremendous direction from Antoine Fuqua. Fuqua really did an impeccable job at delivering methodical, and aesthetic visuals. Fuqua also used his personal connections to access parts of LA that most people has never seen, in a sense, giving these parts of LA a voice. All in all, I found ""Training Day"" to be a steadily enjoyable film with great performances across the board, a wonderful story and script, and a solid direction. Remarkable.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Hardcore entertainment and blatant stupidity...that's Hollywood.,"In ""Training Day"", a bloated Hollywood action/drama,  Hawke rides along with street narc Washington on his first day of on the job training as an undercover narcotics officer. The film tries to represent the tug of war between right and wrong in law enforcement on the mean streets of L.A. In spite of solid production value, the flick fails miserably to deliver a compelling story as it wears on and finally wears out with numbing excesses.

A (mostly) realistic portrayal of how some cops can be,"Forget any bad reviews you've read, this movie is incredible. Most bad reviews I've read talk about how unrealistic it is and how a cop, especially a black cop, wouldn't be as crooked as Alonzo (Denzel Washington) is in the film, but that's where they are wrong. There are cops like Alonzo who really do the things he does and this movie does a great job at showing that.Aside from that, the movie is great. The story is a little weak at points, having the characters do unnecessary things just to reach a valid runtime, but even the unnecessary bits are still enjoyable.

Denzel's brilliant acting on display,"In his Academy Award Winning Performance,as best Actor.The movie, as the title suggests, follows a single day in the life of rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Hawk) as he is subject to a single day of evaluation by a senior, decorated police narcotics officer Alonzo Harris (Washington) to see if he has what it takes to be a 'narc'. Almost immediately Hoyt is placed on the back foot, constantly caught off guard by Alonzo's nature, his ability to switch between a cold, no- nonsense street-wise player, a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader, and occasionally jovial companion. From their first encounters though, where Hoyt tells Harris he will do ""anything you want me to do"", the situations Hoyt is taken into become more and more morally ambiguous, from the simple use of excessive force to outright illegal activity, forcing Hoyt to decide which side Harris is truly on, whether to trust him, or whether Hoyt is the unwitting centerpiece of a huge and complex web of lies and set- ups in order for Harris to for fill his own sinister motives. This is a must watch! The one thing that made this film really shine was the performance by Mr. Washington. To me, a good actor is someone who just IS a character...if it isn't obvious that they are acting than they are doing a good job. That was the case with Washington. He just was Alonzo. Every pantomime, every word, every glance was performed masterfully. Did Mr. Washington deserve his Oscar? Absolutely. 200%.

Denzels best piece of work,"One of Denzel's best cinematic efforts, IMO. His portrayal of the character was downright scary.

The post-September 11 world.,"Some people say that the country became more violent after Kennedy got assassinated; following that argument, one might say that we got even more violent still after September 11. Certainly, Kennedy's assassination destroyed the image of a squeaky-clean, wholesome America, and September 11 changed the way that we felt that we could do everything.Whether or not we became more violent after 9/11, ""Training Day"" offers some insight into that. Released right after September 11 (it's release even got delayed because of the latter), the movie stars Denzel Washington as corrupt cop Alonzo Harris, teaming up with rookie Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). As this is a movie about the gritty world of crime, I shouldn't have to identify that it's pretty violent. By the time that the movie had gotten released, movies had been showing violence for over thirty years. But if in fact we did become more violent, then the movie might have been a look at the future. Movies about corrupt cops are nothing new, but they did an OK job with this one.As for other aspects, Denzel Washington won an Oscar for his role, making him the first African-American to win Best Actor (Sidney Poitier is actually Bahamian). Some may ask whether or not it he would have won had 9/11 not happened, but not me. I say that he deserved the Oscar.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great authentic movie,"Although the subject matter in Training Day may be unfavorable to acknowledge, the movie is still significant because of the quality of work throughout this film. One of the most authentic depictions of the streets in recent memory. The gangsters in this movie act like they came right off the corner. I think it is important that people realize that this movie is not at all far fetched when you consider the Rampart scandal and the story of ""corrupt cop"", Rafael Perez and the ""boy scout"" detective that eventually blew the whistle on this corrupted department. Rap fans would be interested to know that this same Rafael Perez and one of his colleagues David Mack have been linked to Death Row CEO Suge Knight and many loosely suspect they had some hand in the rocky events that eventually led to Tupac and Biggie's deaths. Great performances by Denzel and Ethan. To me this movie is hard to look at for some people because the injustice it shows never affected them and in a sense they either feel guilty for it in a way or they just despise the whole environment but whether you chose to accept it or not you can't hide from this movie because the subject matter is relevant and the movie's quality is exceptional.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

It's simple - carry a gun if you want, but it will not help you. There is a rule saying - ""It does not matter what you know, It matters what you can prove"".This gangster-policeman relationship kind of movie is brought to us by the director Antoine Fuqua, who also after 13 years would bring to life ""The Equalizer"".

"Keeps us interested, but the ending is silly","Washington is phenomenal as corrupt cop Alonzo Harris. For the first half of the film, he keeps us wondering if he's a bad guy or a good guy, in spite of his unorthodox methods. He's actually seems like both. Sometimes he's charming; other times, he's outright despicable. It take a skillful actor to pull off a role like this.Ethan Hawke, as Jake Hoyt, Harris' white rookie partner on his first day as a narcotics cop, is convincing as he wrestles with his concepts of right and wrong--enforcing the law or stooping to the level of the criminals he's dealing with. Alonzo puts him through his paces, big time.The second half of the film goes into dissipation. As Alonzo's actions become increasingly over the top and corrupt, Hoyt, finds himself descending into is own kind of vigilantism. In the ending of the film, his decision to ""do the right thing"" is not only misguided, but it causes Alonzo's demise. Ironic.All through the film, I kept wondering how these two cowboys got away with all this stuff without any other cops or their superior officers knowing about it. Pretty hard to swallow. There's one brief scene with Alonzo having lunch with some high ranking police officials who are clearly indifferent to the law, but it's not enough to answer the question of why the two cops are completely unsupervised.The film is fast moving and captivating and will keep you watching, but the final scenes descend into a typical violent Hollywood shootout that rivals Bonnie and Clyde. This movie could have had a better ending. It just ""drops dead,"" if you'll pardon the expression. And it doesn't answer the moral question that it raised in the first place. If the middle had been cut shorter, there could have been a better resolution at the end. What became of Hoyt? What about the investigation of the shootout? We get nothing but death and final credits.Still, it's worth a watch for two good performances, excellent camera work, and the questions it raises about police ethics (or lack of them).",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A very well written plot, tense and suspenseful, unpredictable at times even for film afficionados, and much enjoyable. Beautifully photographed, it should be teached in film schools. The first image, the rising Sun is unforgettable. The scene in the latino quartier is also remarkable. Noel Guglielmo and his camarades are so authentic.

I am reminded of Sylvester Stallone in Copland which was a much better film in this overworked genre. Denzel's performance unfortunately did not add much.By contrast, Will Smith was robbed because his performance as Ali was great and different. Sean Penn was no Dustin Hoffman but did better than Denzel.

A must see film,"Once in awhile, a film comes along and totally catches you off guard. Training day,is one of those films.

His character,Alonzo,a highly decorated officer of the l.a.p.d.,is charming,street wise,cunning,and dangerous. Now, some actors would have made this guy just a bad ass cop.Heartless.However Denzel gave him a just the right amount of humanity(there's a scene with his son,that briefly gives you a glimpse of that aspect.)where there might be a heart deep within the beast.

So What Was His Second Day on the Job Like?,"Denzel Washington earned his Best Actor Oscar in 'Training Day' portraying a veteran LAPD narcotics officer who has become every bit as hard, amoral and corrupt as the mean city streets he patrols. We've seen plenty of 'bad apple' cops in movies before, but rarely one as chillingly complex as Alonzo Harris, a man who long ago abandoned any of the crime-fighting idealism that led him to the job in the first place. Harris has learned that to deal with bad people one has to become bad oneself, and he has no compunction against going outside the law if that is the only way to get what he wants. For while he may piously declare that he is only beating the lowlifes at their own game - employing their tools, using their methods - the truth is that Harris has simply sold his soul to the same self-centered greed that motivates the criminals he is supposedly after.Writer David Ayer provides Harris with the perfect foil for him to go up against in the form of Jake Hoyt, a rookie cop who has been assigned to be the veteran's partner. Feeling that he is finally going to be able to fulfill his lifelong dream of helping to make the world a better place, Jake is in for a very rude awakening once he comes up against the hardboiled cynicism of this more-than-he-bargained-for partner. Filled with the understandable jitters and self-doubt that come with the first day on the job, Jake quickly comes to see that there is something not quite right with Harris, who spends much of the day breaking laws, flauting procedures and even threatening Jake's life if he doesn't go along with the many nefarious plans and schemes he has up his sleeves. Of course, Harris attempts to seduce Jake over to his way of thinking by arguing that such 'unconventional' actions are required to circumvent a legal system that hamstrings officers with its bureaucratic rules and obsession with civil rights violations. Or is this just a convenient excuse for Harris to justify his lawbreaking? The film is, in many ways, more interesting as a study of Jake's character than of Harris', as we wonder if Jake will come to accept Harris' seasoned viewpoint or somehow see through it and remain true to his ideals.'Training Day' is filled with scenes of great dramatic intensity, often times based on some legitimate moral dilemma that Jake finds himself confronting. The mercurial nature of Harris' behavior keeps us as bewildered and off guard as it does Jake, for like him, we really don't know what exactly Harris wants or where he is coming from. Such moral ambiguity is a sign of powerful storytelling and Ayer deserves a great deal of credit for bringing some depth to an overworked genre. However, at times the film feels a bit forced and strains credibility just when we most need to believe in its truthfulness. This is particularly the case in a scene in which Jake is about to be blown away in a bathtub and receives a last minute reprieve in the form of a coincidence too preposterous to be even slightly believable. Moreover, some of Harris' actions - though valid for the point that the film is trying to make perhaps - seem highly unlikely in the real world. The overall effect of them is to throw the audience out of the movie just when we are most eager to go where we feel it is taking us. However, these are minor quibbles about a film that works so well for so much of the time.As this is the film that won Washington his Academy Award, we must not fail to mention the superb performances delivered by both him and Ethan Hawke as Jake. Washington, generally relegated to 'good guy' roles, proves himself a deft villain in this case, displaying the many intricate coils of his seething, cobra-like character. In many ways, though, Hawke does the more impressive job, partly because he has been given the less flamboyant role of passive observer. Washington gets to hit all the dramatic heights, yet, it is through Jake's eyes that the audience gets to observe this lethal individual and Hawke provides the understated richness that brings this everyman character to life. As Jake gets more and more intricately ensnared and embroiled in Harris' immoral actions, we can't help but identify with the ethical plight being thrust on this man who just wants to do what he knows – or thinks he knows – is right. These two fine actors provide the explosive, symbiotic partnership that brings the screenplay to vivid life.Director Antoine Fuqua makes each moment count dramatically, whether it be a tense confrontation between Harris and Jake over an issue of great moral consequence or a subtle moment of quiet reflection as Jake contemplates his next move.Despite the fact that the film seems to strain a bit at the edges (one wonders what Jake's SECOND day on the job will be like), 'Training Day' provides more food for thought than your average cop buddy movie – and much, much finer acting.",,Anonymous,Crime

A gripping yet shallow thriller,"I enjoyed Training Day on a few levels, first off, Denzel Washington is superb as Alonzo and the tough, gritty action sequences make this a very realistic and violent thriller, however apart from Washington's change from the good guy he usually portrays to a corrupt and vicious narcotics officer, I felt the film had no real clear story.There is a story somewhere, a rookie cop on the force to fight the bad guys only to get a wake up call that it's not like that is an interesting idea for a crime film but the movie gets lost in its constant attempts at carrying many different moral themes. In the end this is a good versus evil action movie disguised by a career best performance from Washington and being marketed as a fast paced crime thriller, and if it had presented itself as what it really was I would have like it more.Verdict: The cast do a great job, but it could have been a far greater film had it been directed by, say Spike Lee or Quinten Tarantino.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The very first scene in which Denzel Washington's Alonzo appears, grabbed my attention and made me stand back and say ""Okay, I think I'm going to like this performance"". However, not only was I absolutely blown away by Mr. Washington's potrayl of a cooked cop, but I found the movie to be extremely enjoyable. Ethan Hawke was a perfect contrast to Washington, and the director and writer did a great job of capturing the feel of such a neighborhood.It's still hard for me to say that Russell Crowe did not deserve to win, however after seeing this movie and knowing what a great actor Mr. Washington is, I can honestly say that I have no complaint with his victory.

Denzel actually gave a better performance in 2004's ""Man on Fire,"" but of course that's just my opinion.""Training Day"" follows the path of ""Bad Lieutenant"" studying police corruption, but it is really using this as an analogy for the corruption of humanity itself - Jake (Ethan Hawke) is a good straight, honest cop who is slowly but surely twisted by his bad influence (Washington), the sadistic corrupt cop.This is not a great movie but it is a good one, with solid performances.

This is easily, hands down, my favorite Denzel Washington movie!The plot is quite simple: Ethan Hawke plays a cop on his first day, who gets lessons from Denzel Washington, a professional cop veteran. Together, they stop criminals, but it may turn out that the biggest criminal of the day may be with them the whole time.The acting in this movie is great. Denzel won Best Actor for his performance-and it's well earned! If someone else won in his place-that would have been a crime against humanity! Well, maybe not, but it would still be cruel!Ethan Hawke was great too, and I have not seen much of his work. I will be keeping an eye on his work now! In fact, everyone was great in this movie!If you read my reviews, you know I am against movies with a ton of language(see my review of The Wolf of Wall Street for an example.)While the IMDB trivia page says that the F word is said 211 times, and that can't be too far off, I found the movie to be more concentrated on it's awesome story than dropping in the next curse word in, unlike the other movie I mentioned! Still, if coarse language overused bothers you, wait for this to air on TV.I have read reviews saying that the end was kind of predictable, and it personally shocked me at first, then it didn't so much. If you don't overthink the entire movie, the ending is still impressive. Personally, I found the ending to have the best twist ending ever in a movie-and yes, I've seen The Sixth Sense!Some also argue that this movie couldn't have ended in one day. I would have to disagree. If this day starts somewhere from 7 am- 9 am, I could totally buy that this event ends before midnight! Plus, it's a movie for heaven's sake!As I watched this movie, I kept thinking of Quentin Tarantino, not just because of how brutal the violence can get at times, and not just because of the coarse language, but simply how the movie is structured.For example, the opening scene in the diner could have been an alternative opening to Pulp Fiction. This scene also has some Tarantino-like humor. I actually had to check the case to make sure QT had no involvement in this movie! This is the Tarantino movie that he didn't make!If this is not enough to make you want to see this movie, I don't know what else could! If more movies were as well-constructed as this, I would have a lot more absolute favorite movies!Training Day is the bomb, and there are few movies that I could recommend more!

Surprisingly good Cop flick,"In all honesty, I have to admit that I went in to see Training Day at the Toronto Film Festival with somewhat less than stellar expectations. When I walked out I was impressed with what turned out to be a well written, well directed and incredibly well acted L.A. cop thriller. The story focuses on Ethan Hawke's character, a lowly cop being promoted to a narc who goes out on a day of training with an unconventional undercover veteran played by Denzel Washington. I won't say too much more about the plot but I must say that both actors play their roles very well; Hawke is very subdued while Washington is completely over the top. The movie moves at a satisfyingly quick pace and keeps you hooked right until the very end.

Excellent,"This is one of the best movies I ever saw. It was a long time since I saw a such a good movie. First when I heard about this movie I thought that is another 'gangsta movie' with a boring story, a gang war or something like that, in the first 15 or 20 minutes I was a bit disappointed but after this I've realized that is a great movie.I thought at this movie o hole day after I saw it,is so close to reality, it is like a reality show or a flagrant made by police with a hidden camera, i never thought a movie like this is possible,makes us think at the life we livin', at the society as it is, naked, without any clothes on it. The movie has a few errors, but at a movie with such a story does not matter a few issues, practically the story and the mode the movie is made ""repairs"" the issues keeping you close to screen that you can't see them. Denzel Washington plays awesome, I haven't seen somebody playing so good in this kind if role since Al Pacino in Scarface, I'm sure that if a person that doesn't know Denzel Washington as an actor, watches how he plays, that person will probably tel you that is a men taken from the streets, not an actor. Ethan Hawke plays great to, he was probably deserving an Oscar at the time but perhaps it was just bad luck.It's an excellent movie with a great story that is waiting for entering Top 250, if you wanna see an exceptional movie you should watch this, I can't find my words to describe it so I probably have to end my comment here.",,Anonymous,Crime
I was expecting much more,"I recently rented the DVD of this film after Denzel's Oscar win and hearing much positive buzz and when I finally sat down to watch it, I found myself at first enthralled, and later horribly dissappointed.Training Day started off as a promising look at what sort of justice is necessary for a narcotics cop to be effective with Ethan Hawke serving as a young and idealistic cop and Denzel Washington as a jaded cop who seems willing to perform questionable acts in the pursuit of justice.  And then we just get a straight up black vs. white (racially and idealogically) battle of good cop against hopelessly corrupt cop who has to be taken down.  I was expecting to have my views of justice challenged only to have them confirmed in an annoyingly simple manner.Sure, the film was skillfully crafted.  The performances were great (though I still think Tom Wilkinson was robbed considering his great performance in ""In the Bedroom"" and the fact that Denzel seems to be having a ball hamming it up in this part having done MUCH better work in earlier films), the direction energetic and the overall production was very solid and effectively gritty.  I just can't get over how the film degenerated into standard clichés.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Great acting, pretty good story","""Training Day"" is a film which features great acting by the two leads, and a story that's very good, until it slips a bit at the end. Denzel Washington plays a corrupt, veteran narcotics cop who's training Ethan Hawke, a young cop hoping for a spot on the unit. Both of the leads, especially Washington, are great. Washington's portrayal of Alonzo Harris will, I think, end up being one of the best, if not THE best, performance of the year. Definitely Oscar-quality material. And Ethan Hawke more than holds his own. Washington has been getting more praise, probably deservedly so, but Hawke does a great job playing Jake Hoyt, totally the opposite of Alonzo, thus making Denzel's performance stand out even more. Aside from those two, there really aren't any big parts, just lots of little ones. Most of those are good as well. Surprisingly, Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg do nice jobs in their brief appearances.Antoine Fuqua does a good job directing, which is a bit of a surprise, considering that his previous work isn't really worth mentioning. I didn't know he had it in him. His directing isn't quite as good as the acting, but he does keep things moving nicely and does a good job of building up tension as the film goes on.The script, written by David Ayer, is the only complaint I have. ""Training Day"" starts off with a great deal of promise, but then loses it a bit at the end. At the beginning, Alonzo doesn't come across as a horrible person. He makes some interesting statements that could make you think, and he has decent reasons for what he does. He doesn't always follow the laws, but he can make you understand why he breaks them. But by the end, he's a completely corrupt, totally evil villain. And then the film is no longer about these choices that he makes, but about Hawke trying to stop a madman. Don't get me wrong, the ending is still exciting and fun to watch, but I was a bit disappointed to see the film abandon the moral complexities that it hinted at earlier. But, with the acting, it's still a very thrilling film, even at the end. Washington and Hawke could have been fishing, and I still would have been on the edge of my seat. So despite my minor issues with the story, the quality of the performances is more than enough for me to recommend ""Training Day.""Rating: 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Dark. Brutal. Potent.,"Training Day is a bold and amazing experience. This film goes beyond painting the picture of a bad day as an undercover cop; it draws you into a world that is both frightening and intriguing. Denzel is perfectly cast. He does not just make this role better, he makes it possible. The fact that most of us can not conceive of disliking Denzel Washington is precisely what makes Alonzo Harris ( his character ) compelling. The evil of this crooked ""wolf"" is so plausibly wrapped in charm and humanity, that the decision to dislike him is painful. Denzel causes us to empathize with Hoyt's ( Ethan Hawke's ) gut wrenching dilemma - the audience is forced into the same, brutal indecision. Hawke skillfully plays his part, and is totally believable. I could identify with his character in every hesitation, and each surrender. All in all, a brilliant film. Not for the faint of heart, but not to be missed.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Both Good and Bad,"This film is kind of like the two officers that are the main characters, good and bad. There are scenes that are really good and creative. In particular, the ""card game"" scene towards the end, very  intense. However, there are way too many MTV Music Video scenes as well. No characters other than the main two have any depth whatsoever. You see talented actors like Scott Glenn trying to bring something extra to their scenes, but there is nothing written for them. Moreover, some scenes are just plain silly and you want to groan. Acting tends to be the over the top. However, in my opinion, it is the work of Ethan Hawke that really saves this film over all. Hawke portrays a character that I think most people can relate to, he does what we would probably do if in his situation. Overall, I would give this movie a B-, because it showed potential, but had too many mistakes.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

It really adds to the tension and realism of it all.Wonderful movie...anyone who likes action without too much special effects will love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Overlong and uneven, but very well-acted and often engaging","At times, ""Training Day"" seems like a photographed play.  Most of the scenes during the first and second acts take place within the confines of a patrol car, with Denzel and Hawke having their foul-mouthed interactions.  To be honest, I felt some of those scenes could've been trimmed or cut and didn't seem necessary.  The overuse of dialogue scenes dragged down the pace a little.  So you can say, the film could've used more time in the editing room.The performances are stellar.  Denzel is one of my favorite actors, and it was nice to watch him play a character much different from the upperclassmen he usually plays.  This time around, he's an uninhibited, foul-mouthed, sadistic, no-nonsense narcotics cop.  Like always, I was impressed by Denzel, but I was even more impressed by his co-star Ethan Hawke. Technically, the film focuses on him, but since Denzel is a much bigger star--he has to get first billing.  Sorry, Ethan.  Hawke, though a fine actor, usually gets the role of the pretty-boy love interest.  This is a much, much different role for him.  He plays a quiet, well-intentioned married man who gets called in for training (as a narc) by Denzel.  The two guys couldn't be any more different, like all buddy cop movies.  But unlike most buddy cop movies, this is much darker.  There's humor here and there, but dark humor.  None of that Riggs-Murtaugh chemistry we got used to in the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies.  I have to admire Antoine Fuqua for not making the usual casting choices.  Another example of his original casting is Scott Glenn's role as a burned-out dealer, who Denzel befriends.  Of course, since Fuqua has a history directing music videos, we have supporting roles with such artists as Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray.  Not the greatest actors, but they didn't have enough screen time to ruin the film.The climax is adverse to the film's harsh, realistic tone.  We're basically given the Hollywood treatment.  We have the usual dueling between the antagonist and protagonist, in which they beat each other to a bloody pulp. One of them gets away, the other returns--as a bloody mess--and they fight again.  I don't want to give away the ending, though there's no big surprises, but if an alleged tough guy is in the middle of a ghetto, gangbangers and dealers surrounding and outnumbering him, and starts telling them off--it don't matter if you're a policeman or not; those guys would blow you away in the drop of a hat.  That's when Denzel makes his ""King Kong ain't got s**t on me!"" speech, in which you're sitting in the theater trying to stop yourself from laughing.  And you know damn well those gangbangers and dealers would've laughed at him too--before he's brutally killed.  It's noticeable that the writer of this film tried to be realistic by injecting tons of street slang into the script, but some of the slang sounded more laughable (unintentionally) and preposterous than realistic.  Believe me, I live in an environment where I hear more street slang than I need to hear. I know the difference between real and fake slang.""Training Day"" is an overlong film that gets boring at times, but I found it mostly engaging.  The performances alone are worth watching.

"Amazing performances, great action, good film, but it should have been better.","There are a few actors in Hollywood that create a huge stir of interest and gossip anytime they come out with a new film. Tom Hanks is probably the biggest of these actors, but this group also includes tremendously talented actors like Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, and of course, Denzel Washington. All of this almost automatic hype is not, however, entirely accurate at all times, and Training Day is a prime example of this. Now before you click on my name above so you can send me some hate mail, I should just point out that I am not pretending that Training Day is a bad movie, I am just saying that there are a lot of things in it that should have been done differently or not at all.Denzel Washington plays the part of the scary Detective Alonzo Harris, and Ethan Hawke plays Officer Jake Hoyt, a new white officer on the force who is to learn the ways of being a tough cop from Harris. The most powerful part of the film is, of course, Denzel's performance as the hardened narcotics officer in Los Angeles, and the interaction that he has with the inexperienced Hoyt, who really only wants to get a nice promotion so he can provide a better life for his wife and kid. Harris has a way of doing his job that really makes it interesting, he's not just a guy running around arresting guys who sell drugs or are doing drugs, he plays his job almost like a chess game.One of the more surprising examples of this is the way that he forces Hoyt to smoke PCP laced marijuana as one of his first lessons, explaining to the incredulous Hoyt that if he were to turn down a similar gift out on the streets, he's be dead. No further explanation is given, and none is needed. Harris knows that he has to be intimidating on the streets or he'll get killed, and he knows that he has to be as familiar as humanly possible with the very thing that he's trying to stop. These people are his people, but he's on the other side of the law.There is an interesting way that the movie explores the possibility that many of that civil laws that police officers must follow only hinder the true delivery of justice and their efforts to stop crime, because Harris is an officer that pursues the bad guys in any way necessary, whether legally or not, and he looks much deeper into the situations than just getting the guys in cuffs in the back of his car. The scene where they see the two guys trying to rape a woman on the streets comes to mind. Hoyt is ready to throw these guys in the car, take them downtown, and throw them in jail, case closed. They witnessed the crime, it was that easy. Instead, Harris beats them both stupid and lets them go right in front of the astonished eyes of Hoyt, inspiring the famous line, `Let the animals weed themselves out.' God willing.The real problem that I have with this movie is that, for one thing, it is entirely too violent in places where it doesn't need to be. One of the things that I hate to hear the most in a review of an action movie is that it's too violent, just because it sounds so much like something my grandmother would say, but take, for example, the scene where Harris and Hoyt are fighting each other hand to hand. This scene is excruciatingly violent, but the only problem that I have with it is that it should have been maybe a third of the length that it was. MAYBE. I am a serious fan of good bloody, violent movies, I even enjoy Steven Seagal films and Van Damme films, but even in the most hardcore action films and for the most die hard action fan, there comes a point where you think, `Okay, I GET it.' Training Day either does not believe that this point exists, or doesn't know where it is.Besides that, I know that this is an aberrant role for Denzel Washington, who does not very often play villains, but even as the character that he played in Training Day, there are certain things that you simply can't do to an actor like him, and gunning him down Godfather-style by a whole row of machine guns is one of them. No matter how bad the guy is that he's portraying, you just can't do things like that to him, the man's LOVED! I am not usually one to complaing about issues of violence like this, but there is a place in the movies for excessive violence, and it is in Van Damme films and Seagal films, not in movies like this. Training Day had entirely too many real world connections to be dumbed down be excesses like that, and if these things had been reduced to a more realistic level at least slightly, the quality of the film would have increased enormously. Just a little change could have done a lot of good.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Must have been a bad year for Best Actor for DW to get Best Actor by giving a ""Jack Nicholsonesque"" over the top performance as a crooked narco cop who trains his new partner, Ethan Hawke, on his first day on the job. Ethan Hawke is a serious cop (and he plays the role well).

High energy filled with sharp dialogue,"In Training Day, we get a high energy movie with sharp dialogue, along with a superb performance by Denzel Washington as a rough and tough street cop. It is training day for a rookie cop played by Ethan Hawke, yet, instead of offices, coffee and paperwork, he is given a day with Washington and we the audience are along for the ride.  From the moment both characters meet, we immediately understand who is running the show.  Hawke portrays an innocent, honest, almost naive cop stern in the ways of ethics and laws.  Washington, on the other hand, believes in the law of the streets.  While both arguements for solving crime have been portrayed in a lot of other movies, along with the almost tired partnership of a Black and White cop and their differences, this movie actually works.  Hawke is quite honest and at times naive, but not naive to the point of unbelieveability.  Washington is fiery in his ways of cleaning up the city and his knowledge of 'real policing'. So we come to very much enjoy his presence on the screen because it's as if Washington himself relishes the part of being the bad and disliked character. A role that is refreshingly new for Washington, but you wouldn't know it watching him play it so well. There is a constant back-and-forth sharing of views on how crime should be dealt with by Washington and Hawke.It is amusing to watch Hawke rationalize his views only to be quickly outwitted by Washington's sometimes outrageous antics.  Naturally Hawke must give in slightly because after all, he is the one being trained but also because Hawke sees this opportunity to move higher up in rankings and eventually become detective.Training day is a test for Hawke, but by the end of the movie, it truly is a test on everyone.  A test of judgement, morals, ideals, values.  In other words, an overall test of who we really are as individuals.  And so by the end of training, we and Hawke both find out just that, who we really are.Grade: B",,Anonymous,Crime

Inner City Western,"""Training Day"" is really a Western transferred to an inner city setting. It's to Westerns like ""High Noon"" and ""The Unforgiven"" that ""Escape from New York"" was to the sci fi genre. With a touch of ""Chinatown"" and even ""On the Waterfront"" and ""Maltese Falcon"" thrown in for a complicated plot of double crosses and conflicting loyalties that I didn't completely follow but was made mostly credible by the recent LAPD Ramparts revelations.Denzel Washington is riveting, and more completely sunk into the character than he even was in ""Hurricane"" and ""Malcolm X."" But then actors always thrive playing a villain more than the hero, or even a hero with mixed motives.Ethan Hawke rises to the bait effectively, though the script mostly only lets him be reactive; for him, this is an action role.The Latino and hip hop music choices are quite good, and the rap stars of course enjoy continuing their fictional gangstah personas on screen to add to their CD-selling props.(originally written 11/3/2001)",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Instant classic crime drama,"""Training Day"" from 2001, directed by Antoine Fuqua, stands as a gripping and always engaging magnum opus in the genre, thanks to its superb storytelling and wonderful performances.

Ethan Hawke, as the idealistic rookie cop Jake Hoyt, provides a powerful counterbalance, delivering an intense performance that showcases his character's moral struggle and gradual disillusionment. The film's taut narrative is accentuated by its raw and unflinching depiction of Los Angeles' seedy underbelly, with Fuqua's direction ensuring every scene pulses with tension and urgency. The script, filled with sharp, memorable dialogue, pushes the boundaries of the genre, creating a mesmerizing commentary on power, corruption, and the choices we all make in life. With its thrilling action sequences, richly drawn characters, twists and turns, and a story that keeps ramping up the suspense, this became an instant classic, and it's not hard to see why. An amazing effort by all involved and holds up to this day as one of the best crime drama movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"IMDb Description is always ""Spoiler""","What the hell..!!! I don't know why IMDb always put description which spoils everything. They should put something which just gives background of the movie not the suspense...All though the movie is very good... I always like this kind of mafia movies...Apart form Denzel Washington's acting (as he is always good) Ethan Hawke was phenomenal.I did not get one thing... At the end there will be a line saying that the officer Det. Alonzo Harris survived by his wife and 4 children... but how is that possible, he is the one who got killed???",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Superb crime drama. Incendiary work from Washington,"""To protect the sheep, you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf."" This questionable sentiment is how rogue LAPD detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) justifies a heavy laundry list of dirty deeds, scary volatility, sociopathic backstabbing and a complete disregard for the badge that he wears on a chain like dog tags. And indeed, inner city Los Angeles can seem like a war zone, but its like he's in fact more part of the problem than the dark angel of justice he sees in himself. Antoine Fuqua's combustible crime drama Training Day rightly won Washington an Oscar for his unsettling runaway train of a performance, and he owns it down to the last maniacal mannerism and manipulative tactic. The film takes place over one smoggy L.A. day (hence the title) that feels like an eternity for its two leads, as well as all the colorful and often terrifying people they meet along the yellow brick road that's paved with used needles and shell casings. Harris is tasked with showing rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) the ropes in his neighborhood, in the hopes that he'll pass the test and achieve Narc status. Jake is prepared for a run of the mill crash course, but as soon as he's treated to a verbal beatdown from Harris in the diner they meet at, he has a feeling it ain't gonna be anywhere close to a normal day. This is just another day for Harris though, as he drags Hoyt by the scruff through drug busts, gang warfare, the worst neighborhood in town and pulls him deeper into his very dangerous world. Fuqua has a knack for getting the atmosphere of his settings just pitch perfect, and the feverish nightmare of the inner city comes alive, seemingly possessing the characters themselves until the atrocities just seem like a way of life. The trouble really starts when they run across Harris's old drug lord buddy Roger (a wicked Scott Glenn in a role originally intended for Mickey Rourke), who proves a valuable asset later, though not in the way you might think. Harris introduces Jake to his equally crooked and scary team, including Peter Greene, Nick Chinlund and Dr. Dre who struggles in the acting department, especially in a room full of such heavy hitters. Jake is aghast at the horrors he sees and cannot believe the streets are like this. Harris devilishly assures him that this is the job, mutilating the symbol of his badge even more by justifying such behaviour as necessary. Tension reaches unbearable heights during a visit to a Latino gang household run by Cliff Curtis, Raymond Cruz and the eternally scary Noel Gugliemi. This is the heart of darkness fpr the film, a story beat from which there is seemingly no escape, until it becomes clear that Jake has somehow evolved a step up the food chain as far as LA goes, and is now ready to put down the dog who taught him, a dog who has long been rabid. People complain that the final act degenerates into a routine action sequence. Couldn't disagree more. With a setup so primed with explosive conflict, it can't end up anywhere else but an all out man to man scrap, which when followed by no flat out action sequences earlier in the film, hits hard. Their inevitable confrontation is a powerhouse, especially from Washington, who finally loses his composure and yowls like a trapped coyote, his actions caught up to him. In a role originally intended for Tom Sizemore (who would have rocked it in his own way) I'm glad Denzel got a crack at it, for he's absolute dynamite. Watch for Harris Yulin, Raymond J. Barry and Tom Berenger as the three senior LAPD dick heads, Eva Mendes as Alonzo's girlfriend, Macy Gray as a screeching banshee of a ghetto whore and Snoop Dogg as your friendly neighborhood wheelchair bound crack dealer. Fuqua keeps attention rooted on the dynamic between Washington and Hawke, who is excellent in as role that could have easily been swallowed up by Washington's monster of of a performance. Hawke holds his own, and the film is really about how two very different guys view a difficult area of town, how it changes them both, and ultimately how their moral compasses end up on a collision course. One of the best crime framas out there, and quickly becoming timeless.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Undermined by its hype,"Its the rookies first day with the specialist street crime squad. He is spending his training day (no complexity in the title) following the leader about on his ""average"" daily duties. Ethan Hawk plays the new guy who is all dreams and ideals, Denzel Washington plays the hardened street cop who is all realism and street vibes. If he were retiring in a week the cliché would be complete.We learn very early on that the only way to police the street is to become the street. Essentially by being less of a cop, and more like a teacher to the hoods and gangsters. While you may take them out for selling drugs to kids, stealing from the rich to feed you family is ok. Why break up a rape in progress when all you are going to get is a lot of paper work at the end of the day? Slowly Washington removes hawks' ideals, breaking him down to be one of the team. This starts with hawk being tricked into smoking a PCP laced joint, which inevitably leads him on a downwards spiral as things get more and more surreal throughout the day.The story is nothing particularly new. There is the buddy element, the cop turned crook element and the will he/won't he element of doing the right thing. The script has already dictated who should come out on top by navigating your sympathies in the direction of Hawk's plight. Hawk himself carries himself very well in what is essentially a stock role picked from the Hollywood book of stock roles. And if you turned to the next page you would see Denzel Washington's character. Washington was very good in the role, but it was certainly no Oscar performance. This is an average film with above average performances.Wait until the video comes out in Blockbusters.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Star Shines in Training Day,"In his Oscar-winning performance, Denzel Washington inhabits the role of the street-tough narcotics cop to such an extent that you forget that, prior to this movie, Mr. Washington had begun to be stereo-typed as the perpetual good guy. No one ever denied that Mr. Washington could act, but by casting against type (as is often the case) people finally noticed the depth and breadth of his acting skills.Of course, in order to truly shine, an actor needs other elements to be in place as well. And Mr. Washington has them all here. His co-star, Ethan Hawke, does an excellent job of providing the innocent counterbalance so that Mr. Washington looks even tougher by comparison. The action sequences are well shot and grittily realistic. The plot twists, while not truly shocking, are unique enough to keep the movie's tension at a high level throughout.To see my other reviews, please visit: https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Unbelievable!,"This isn't a film about the moral amiguities of a modern plain clothes cop, or the blurring of the line between right and wrong.  Denzel's character marches over the line with such incredible abandon that from early on in the film all sense of realism is lost.  Ethan Hawke does a pretty good job of playing the rookie dazed by the events of his Training Day, but even he can't rescue this script.  I'm surprised that Denzel got an oscar for this because his portrayal is so over the top, although I can't say he doesn't deserve it for his overall body of work.  This film does ask some serious questions, but in such a loaded way that the answer is never really in any doubt.  The ending is just laughable, but at least its the ending.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Training Day,"A lot can happy in a day, ask Ethan Hawke character Jake Hoyt and he'll agree. Hoyt is a rookie looking for some invaluable experience from a top man in the police force. Unfortunaely, This cop, name Alonso, isn't so clean cut. Washington doesn't play the typical good guy this time round. As the film progress, his character becomes complex and watching Hoyt tailor to the situation is a interesting affair.It one of the films that has a easy story to follow, one of those that with the wrong cast or directer, could easily become a train wreck. Thankfully, training day is superbly executed. The film rolls to the finish line in what seems very little time, the cinematography gives the film a different look than others in the same genre. Acting as you expect is sublime and the conclusion is highly satisfying.Brimmed with a glut of memorable quotes and scenes, Training day is a film that doesn't disappoint",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
My Review,"I really wanted to like film more than I eventually did.The film starts off in great fashion with Alfonso's (Washington) character being outlined immediately as an ultra cool narcotics cop with a street reputation and the mean streak required to survive in that type of work, you could not help but warm to his character's style and grace.Hawke plays an understated role as a rookie narc cop undergoing a trial day on the job to see if he can hack it on the mean streets.The plot lets the film down for me. About half way into the film the point seems to get lost somewhere and I was left feeling as if a massive opportunity to make a good film into a great one had passed.Washington is excellent none the less bringing humility, profanity and plenty of guts to his performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Seen Better,"Training Day was a plotless cop movie that is made worse by the fact that it won an Academy Award. Denzel Washington is an over the top, rogue cop that doesn't do anything rewarding of an award. He kills, steals and murders yadda yadda yadda. Seen it a million times in a hundred other movies. And the performance isn't that great. I give Ethan Hawke some credit, for at least his character is believable and he does a decent job of moving the plot along. What little plot there is. Basically, it doesn't make that much sense. Bad cop versus good cop. From there, its up to the viewer to fill in the gaping holes. Overall, there are a bunch of other movies that do it better, one being L.A. Confidential. Go rent that rather than this tired, rough movie totally undeserving of any such awards.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke both cast against type in this excellent cop movie,"It's easy to look at Training Day as just another action/crime movie with the bad cop corrupting the rookie and dragging him into his world. With Denzel Washington turning in his best performance as the villain and Ethan Hawke as the idealistic, likable and heroic good guy, this is anything but a routine movie. Both actors are excellent in their roles, and Antoine Fuqua does an excellent job bringing a gritty no holds barred crime movie to the screen.LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is an idealistic, honest, good hearted rookie who has one day to prove himself that he has what it takes in the Narcotics Division. Jake Hoyt is very eager to make a good impression and earn his place as well as seeing this role as a stepping stone to making Detective. Detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington in his Academy Award winning role as Best Actor) is a 13 year highly decorated veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and has a feared and respected reputation amongst all police officers, friends, criminals, and enemies alike. Alonzo is assigned to showing Jake the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles as well as taking Jake under his wing as a mentor. However, Alonzo Harris is a corrupt police officer to the point where the line is blurred between cop and criminal, right and wrong, good and bad, and what is legal and illegal. Alonzo Harris is not above physically intimidating and assaulting suspects, as well as stealing, robbing, assaulting, planting evidence, and setting up a murder to look like a justified shooting. Though Alonzo Harris justifies this as all in the good of taking bad guys off the street or in his words which he lives by on the streets of Los Angeles, ""To protect the sheep you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf."" Alonzo Harris is also extremely arrogant and selfish who will do anything for money as well as caring very little for anyone else but himself.Once Jake Hoyt witnesses Alonzo Harris' unconventional methods of enforcing the law through his own brand of street justice in which he makes up his own rules, Jake finds that it may be too late to save himself and his career. Alonzo threatens Jake by making him smoke drugs at gunpoint otherwise face being thrown out of Narcotics Division. Jake also witness many immoral acts committed by Alonzo to the point where he questions his own conscience and whether Alonzo is a police officer wanting to enforce street justice or just a criminal wanting to commit acts beneficial to himself.Denzel Washington is well known for portraying a variety of good guys on the screen in movies such as Glory, Philadelphia and The Hurricane. Cast against type in Training Day, he does an excellent job portraying the villainous, down and dirty Alonzo Harris. There was a lot of controversy when Denzel Washington won the 2001 Best Actor Academy Award for his role when Russell Crowe was strongly tipped for his role in A Beautiful Mind. Regardless, Denzel Washington thoroughly deserved to win for his role. This is definitely Denzel Washington's best role in his entire career.Ethan Hawke was previously known for his roles in Dead Poets Society, Alive, Reality Bites, and The Newton Boys. Ethan Hawke, who also deserved to be nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award, comes of age in his role as the idealistic and honest rookie Jake Hoyt who is very eager to make a good impression but finds himself in over his head in an unfamiliar world. Although Jake Hoyt makes several mistakes which end up almost costing him his career as well as his life, he proves himself to be a capable police officer when he saves a teenage girl from being sexually assaulted by two homeless men, which later saves his life. To date, this is Ethan Hawke's best role.Other actors which appear in Training Day include Scott Glenn (The Silence of the Lambs) as a local drug dealer Roger, Tom Berenger (Platoon) as District Attorney Stan Gursky, Harris Yulin (Scarface) as Detective Doug Roselli, rapper Snoop Dogg as wheelchair bound drug dealer named Blue, New Zealand actor Cliff Curtis (Three Kings) as a thug named Smiley, pop star Macy Gray as the wife of a drug dealer, Eva Mendes in an early role as Alonzo's mistress Sara, and as part of Alonzo's corrupt crew of police officers rapper Dr. Dre as Paul (who comes across as a thug than a police officer), and Nick Chinlund (Con Air) as Tim.Training Day certainly left a long lasting impression of me when I first saw this movie back in 2002 which will never be forgotten. In what could have been a routine action movie, becomes an intense, gritty and compelling cop drama. Excellent job all round, Denzel Washington earns his well deserved critical acclaim as the bad guy Alonzo Harris, and Jake Hoyt also deserves acclaim for his role as Jake Hoyt. It's also great to see Antoine Fuqua go on to direct greater movies such as Tears of the Sun, Shooter and The Equalizer. Screenwriter David Ayer has also carved out his own career following this movie and has also made his mark as a director with Street Kings, End of Watch, and Fury.Training Day is an excellent movie which is definitely highly recommended.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of Denzel's best,"Training Day is a testament to how one faultless performance can elevate the whole film to incredible new heights. It's a sturdy thriller offering an engaging look at the way the rules of policing can be manipulated for personal gain that wastes no time getting to all the good stuff with solid performances from everyone and then Denzel Washington gives one of his career high performances which is why this film is so damn good.Ethan Hawke does a great job as the audience surrogate who is exposed to this corrupt world for the first time and struggling to survive the day. It's technically a supporting performance but from the moment Denzel Washington appears he just takes control of the film thanks to his undeniable screen presence. He plays a master manipulator effortlessly, getting all the best lines and commands the screen with ease.Antoine Fuqua's skilled direction results in a film that's exceptionally well made in a seamless fashion and the premise means it's always moving forward. Even the action heavy finale which feels a little weird is still executed really well. Writer David Ayer is in his natural element as he infuses this unorthodox police procedural with plenty of grit and it seriously escalates in the second half to an almost unbearably tense degree.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Powerful Study of Corruption,"Denzel Washington delivers a powerhouse performance in a film which is much more than it may appear on its surface. In fact, Training Day offers an incisive analysis and anatomy of corruption, not just among police officers, but more generally. While watching this for the first time (twenty-three years late!), I was saying to myself that if Denzel did not win an Oscar, then he was robbed. Fortunately, in a rare show of excellent judgment, the Academy actually gave this amazing feat of acting the award it deserved.This creation is so well produced and so thoughtful that I would recommend it to people who usually steer clear of action flicks. Training Day is far more complex and intelligent than what we see in most of the more recent examples of the genre (Bourne films are another rare exception from the typical mediocrity...).Bravo Denzel! Ethan Hawke, who plays the new inductee into the Corruption Club, also did a great job, and wow what a devastating ending!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
High Ranking Performances... Cop-Out Plot!,"LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt (Hawke) wants to make a difference on the streets, so he attempts to join the tough, harsh world of the plain-clothes Narcotics Department.  To succeed in this, he has to endure a training day on the job and convince the Narc's chief street officer, Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington), that he has what it takes.  A difficult enough job for anyone, but Detective Harris has one or two skeletons in his closet, and today they've all decided they're claustrophobic!Firstly.  The acting of the two leads is top-notch.  Washington might have won the Oscar for the showier part but Hawke matches him all the way in what is actually a more demanding journey.  90% of the movie concentrates on these two almost completely in isolation and they deliver through-out; a couple of moving, confrontational scenes at the heart of the film being exceptionally executed.Secondly.  The film does not have the courage of it's convictions. Initially it is almost plotless - and all the better for it.  Harris takes his rookie on a roller-coaster of 'street justice' and, despite the latter's consternation, the pivotal moments are so well handled and the dialogue of argument in the mouth of Harris so persuasive that his apparent immorality is never as clear-cut as it should be.  Had the entire film followed this path, we could well have been left with an intriguing debate on 21st Century urban justice and a refreshing reflection on the idea of 'right' and 'wrong'.  The film, of course, does nothing of the sort.  It's made in Hollywood after all!  No, almost exactly half-way through, we are introduced to a no-brainer plot involving the Russian mafia (oh dear!) and Harris stops breaking the rules because he firmly believes this is the only way to maintain street law, and starts breaking them because he is suddenly a very bad man!  Unbelievable plot twists follow hard by and we are taken into a different, disappointing, cliched nonsense of a film in which (among several lame developments) the residents of a lethal neighbourhood ghetto suddenly develop a collective, moral consciousness.  The very ending is awful beyond words and if it's a nod to Penn's Bonnie and Clyde it's an offensively crude one!It is to the two leads' credit than that, as crassly predictable as the film becomes, it remains very watchable because of their inspired playing.

So knowing that, WHAT DID YOU GUYS EXPECT, Malcolm X, Remember The Titans, The Hurricane?? If you were, then maybe you all need to be checked out. The reason why this movie was so great is because it wasn't the typical Denzel 'role model' movie.

Denzel knows how to act,"I'm on a bit of a Denzel Washington phase at the minute and I have to say this is absolutely one of his better films and arguably his best performance (just seen he won an Oscar for this, yep I agree). Ethan Hawke was also fantastic in this, don't want it being all about Denzel here.Regardless of great acting performances, is the film any good? To be blunt. Yes. It's got really good action scenes, the plot is engaging and you're on the edge of your seat and the showcasing of corruption in the police is a really good portrayal.There is a few things I would have liked to have changed. For example, I felt as though the side characters were a bit pointless in the grand scheme of things. Eva Mendes character and the ""3 Wise Men"" spring to mind in a sense that they could have been utilised so much more and they were just left to burn really. I thought as well they really bigged up this whole Alonzo being in trouble with the Russians, but it didn't really amount to much.However, I felt the plot was still incredibly engaging and the complexity of the characters is what really carries this movie and I have to say I was glued from start to finish. From the get go you're thrown into the mix and there's no bland moments. It really keeps you interested and curious to know what's going to happen next and that for me is what makes a good movie.If you haven't seen I would highly recommend and this is a very strong 8/10 from me today!!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A pretty standard cop thriller is livened up by a good (if not Oscar-worthy) performance from Washington,"After making his application to join a special unit within the LAPD, Officer Jake Hoyt is assigned to his new boss, Alonzo Harris for a training day on the job. Harris immediately shows Hoyt a way of work that is foreign to him  making him smoke drugs and drink at the very start of his shift. From this point onwards, Hoyt is taken on an eye opening training day that forces him to depart from his professional ethics and try to understand how things are done on the street. But is Harris really working for justice his own way or is he working for himself  and how far will Hoyt sink before he cannot justify it anymore?When this film came out I wanted to see it as a thriller; after the Oscar for Washington I wanted to see it for another reason and eventually got round to seeing it on video. The plot starts on familiar territory and pretty much continues along the same road for the whole film  it is never really more than an average cop thriller but it still manages to be quite enjoyable. The film sticks to the 'ends justify the means' plot device for the first half but then pull back to reveal a wider plot that is more of a standard thriller. In the first half this is all stuff we have seen before and it sort of works but not as well as things like The Shield etc  Alonzo is too out there to manage to make me be for him and against him; unlike the Shield where you are constantly being challenged by Mackey. The second half is more dramatic and, although a bit forced, is necessary to bring the film round to a dramatic conclusion.The Oscar for Denzel was not deserved in my opinion. Having now seen his performance I will acknowledge that he is a big part of this film working but he is not Oscar worthy here. Actually his performance is just par for the course for this type of film  yes he is a bit of a powerhouse and his tough delivery really makes the film move but it is hardly worthy of being called the best performance of the year even if it is really effective within the context of the film. Hawke is pretty good but obviously plays second fiddle to Washington's scene stealing performance; he is wide eyed as required and he serves well as our entry into Alonzo's world. The support cast features quite a few well known faces but mostly they are underused and play slightly worn ethnic clichés full of tattoos and 'mo-fo' dialogue  Macy Gray, Dre and Snoop represent the rap community while Mendes shows ass and Glenn, Yulin, Barry and Greene add recognisable faces if nothing else.Overall this is an enjoyable but standard cop thriller that has gotten better reviews than it perhaps deserves. Although he doesn't not deserve his Oscar for this, Washington's performance still drives the film and is fun nonetheless and certainly livens up what is, for all it's stars and it's publicity, is still a standard cop thriller with bells on.",,Anonymous,Crime

Great urban thriller,"Ethan Hawke plays Hoyt, a rookie cop on his first 24-hour training day with the L.A.P.D. narcotics division. Denzel Washington plays veteran Alonzo Harris whose methods seem questionable, to say the least. Harris argues that one has to become a wolf to take down a wolf. Will Hoyt make it through the day alive, let alone uncorrupted?""Training Day"" had a lukewarm reception at the box office the first weekend of its release in 2001, but the profits steadily increased for the next six weeks as word-of-mouth spread. The greatness of ""Training Day"" is not simply due to the intriguing story and excellent writing, but also the superb casting. Hawke is perfect as the naive, but ambitious rookie and Washington is nothing short of stunning as Alonzo Harris, ranking with the best performances in cinematic history, like Jon Voight's Manny in ""Runaway Train"" or Robert Duvall's Col. Kilgore in ""Apocalypse Now.""As the training day continues Alonzo's methodology becomes increasingly dubious and you can just imagine Hoyt responding, ""I... don't... see... any... method... at... all... Sir."" How can anyone withstand the temptations he faces and not give in (and I don't mean the drugs)? Needless to say, the film scores high marks on the moral conundrum front.There's one obviously contrived element but that's par for the course with movies and it could've been worse. Of course, the action and thrills are amped-up, but the tone is thankfully realistic.BOTTOM LINE: ""Training Day"" is an excellent urban thriller with a captivating performance by Washington. It's fittingly ugly, raw and brutal, so stay away if you don't think you can stomach it.The film runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in L.A.

Captivating Performance Veritable Ambience,"Antoine Fuqua's later work isn't very note worthy, but that doesn't diminish the job he did here. He certainly knew the world he was depicting and filled in any gaps with the actual environment. But perhaps more real than any real gangster is Denzel Washington as Alonzo Harris.Alonzo Harris is more than a 'Dirty' Harry Callahan or Popeye Doyle sort of cop who toes the boundries with his rough, rule breaking approach as he tracks down the 'bad guys'. Harris is one of the bad guys only he has a badge to give him an edge over the street hoods. His justification for his conduct is that criminals work outside of the law and to get to them the police should too. But Alonzo is no different than any of the villains rookie officer Jake meets over the day, and as the film suggests he's possibly worse.The brutality and genuineness Denzel Washington brings to the role is exceptional and the quality of his performance raises the entire film a couple notches. As Hitchcock said ""The better the villain, the better the picture"" and Alonzo Harris is a great villain. Who packs so much authenticity you could almost think he's a real thug off of the street if you didn't know better.The veracity of this picture extends beyond Washington's performance which is what separates it from so many films. The Los Angeles crime world of this film stands above and away from almost any other peer. In it's own right it even surpasses the more stylish depiction of Michael Mann's films and portrays something far more raw and vicious. The movie puts you on some of the worst streets in the city in a way that transcends watching and is more of an experience nearly on par with way Apocalypse Now did for Vietnam.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"I wondered what it had to say, and then...","I saw previews for Training Day and foolishly deduced that it was a film with a message, something about street justice versus legal justice.  That's not the only reason I'd see this kind of movie; it was just my preception. I didn't get what I expected but I did stay through the whole thing.Denzel plays a psychopathic police officer (impersonator in my opinion) ""training"" Ethan on his first day as a rookie narc on his way to becoming a detective.  Along the way Denzel spouts philosophical mumbo jumbo about street justice and about how he's the real cops and not the guys helping old ladies with their groceries, that sounds real good on previews -hey they got my seven dollars fair and square, right?  Unfortunately on the way to possibly becoming something appealing intellectually, it back pedals and turns into an over-the-top action-suspense yarn.In the end I was not satisfied, though I may have been had my expectations not been contrary to the true intentions of the movie.  looking back, the best parts of the movie were probably the ones I enjoyed the least- the silly ones.  Were I watching in a different state of mind this movie might have grown on me.  But don't go out of your way to see it.  There's always cable.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a Performance!,"What an amazing performance! Having Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke here is like having two gold in one place. Since the beginning of the 2 characters that they played, I was immediately attracted and fell in love with the character. These 2 characters seem to have separate personalities or I can call it the relationship between bad cop and good cop, but somehow the chemistry that is given is very unified and seems inseparable.The story is actually quite simple, but the complexity of what each character experiences makes it very interesting. The story is told quite slowly, but each scene has an important meaning in the story. The character development is very good, especially the hoyt character (Ethan Hawke), from scene to scene, the character grows even though it only takes one day's setting. Also, I like the last 45 minutes, these 2 characters seem like they have separate views and opinions and the atmosphere becomes more tense. The plot is very excelent, not complicated to understand but still complex in the story. Overall, this is a good police / crime movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"With great performances, films portraits the police corruption and the complex situation experienced by those who are thrown into the violence","Starting from a promising premise, director Antoine Fuqua manages to create an instigating narrative and, aided by editing by Conrad Buff, intersperses between traveling shots, many close-ups, slow motion and agitated motion to maintain a dynamic pace that gives us the constant sensation of that something important will happen at any moment, keeping the tension going without allowing the viewer to relax. In addition, the director is skilled in creating a realistic environment that is coherent with the universe in which the narrative takes place, something reinforced, for example, by the soundtrack by Mark Mancina, which oscillates between rap, Latin music and heavier chords., throwing the viewer into that reality in a competent way. Likewise, Michele Michel's costumes indicate from the beginning the duality of Alonzo, who appears wearing the typical black of villains even though he was initially sold as the experienced and admired tutor who would guide Jake.Still on the technical side, Mauro Fiore's photography follows the natural evolution of the day with the sun rising over the horizon at the beginning, filling a good part of the second act and disappearing at the end, which gradually makes the film more suffocating and prepares us for the act Final. It is also worth mentioning how the play of light and shadow partially covers Alonzo's face when he asks Jake to execute a drug dealer, visually demonstrating his criminal facet, which at that point was already evident. Tense, this scene is crucial to understanding the workings of that underworld and the dialogue that follows is equally important to understanding Alonzo's questionable moral code.Addressing various social problems in the United States, ""Training Day"" fails due to the caricatured way it portrays the communities and Latinos that cross Jake's path, for example, when he is abandoned by Alonzo to be murdered, in a scene, incidentally, that it is conducted in a very realistic way by Fuqua, but in which unfortunately the solution to the conflict sounds quite artificial due to the simplistic way in which the girl is convinced by her uncle to tell the truth about the attempted rape. Likewise, when the enraged Jake goes in search of Alonzo in the ""Jungle"", the community that had been portrayed as one of the most dangerous places in the city previously, impresses negatively as even with the two fighting, breaking various objects and shooting everywhere, locals take forever to get out of their houses. To make matters worse, their behavior in the face of confrontation does not sound convincing, confirming how the third act is by far the weakest segment of the film.Fortunately, the realism of several other scenes make up for these slips, such as when Alonzo uses a false warrant to search a house and is forced to flee from there under gunfire from local residents or when Jake rushes out to save the girl from being raped. And fights alone against his aggressors. It is also worth mentioning the various dialogues between the two police officers that oppose very different views of the world and that provoke good reflections.However, it is even in performances that ""Training Day"" guarantees its success. Demonstrating Jake's discomfort from the beginning at his home and in the first conversation with Alonzo in a cafe, Ethan Hawke manages the difficult task of facing Denzel Washington's exceptional performance head on without ever sounding inferior for being living a rookie and, what is even better, amplify her impact by deftly exposing the reflections of the veteran's attitudes on her character. With his minimalist expressions, Hawke humanizes the character, conveying his fears and doubts accurately and, on top of that, doing very well in moments that require more expressiveness, such as when he appears high after consuming drugs stolen by his partner. Incidentally, the way Hawke convinces us that Jake will be able to withstand the trials he is subjected to is crucial to the success of the narrative.Menacing, cool and already very comfortable in that universe, Washington's Alonzo is the typical corrupt policeman who already knows all the paths he can take and, more than that, imagines that he even knows how to deal with young idealists like Jake, betting in the harshness of his behavior and in the shock as a way of convincing the young man to accept his controversial methods, since, in his view, this is the only way to defeat organized crime - and his impressive numbers reinforce his view, since, however questionable whatever, these methods have led him to arrest many powerful criminals over the years. On the other hand, he doesn't seem to care about everyday events that can't boost his career, which leads him to patiently light a cigarette and smoke while Jake grapples with two criminals on a street defending a young woman who was about to be raped. What is most impressive, however, is how Alonzo actually believes in what he says and in the way he acts, as is clear in the conversation in which he explains the concept of wolves and sheep to Jake or when, ironically, he asks the young man to collect illegally collected evidence of drug dealer Blue, played by the iconic Snoop Dogg. For him, the ends justified the means and that was the only way to survive in that environment. Washington's energy in the role is contagious, conquering the viewer even in the face of various reproachful attitudes - and his smile when Jake uses one of his catchphrases against him is touching, showing how much he believed in his own methods.Insinuating police corruption right off the bat when Jake tells his wife she should see the houses they have, referring to Police Division Chiefs, ""Training Day"" doesn't hesitate to question the risks intrinsic to the power granted to these officers. Professionals in the United States, something made clear in the aforementioned scene of the murder of a drug dealer, meticulously planned by Alonzo. ""Just because we have badges is different?"", asks Jake after the crime. The conversation that follows inside the car exposes the opposing views of the characters, with Jake upset by what he saw while Alonzo demonstrates understanding for his reaction and strategically praises his partner, in an attempt to raise the boy's self-esteem to gain his empathy and attract him to that world.Unfortunately, David Ayer's screenplay compromises the film by grossly failing in the third and final act of the story, when it seems to give up on giving realism to its protagonists and decides to turn them into uninspired caricatures of 'hero' and 'bad guy'. From this moment on, Training Day abandons the ambition of its subject and strives to be just another crime thriller. On the other hand, Antoine Fuqua's direction never loses dynamism, plunging the viewer into an incredible state of tension (as in the sequence in which Hoyt plays poker with three thugs). In addition, the filmmaker does not avoid the graphic aspect of violence and shocks the audience by not diverting his camera in the strongest moments (there is a confrontation that takes place in a bathtub that reminded me of Scarface, by Brian De Palma).Anyway, the questions raised in ""Training Day"" are very valid and still current, being applicable not only in the United States, but in other countries like Brazil. How should a police officer act to survive in an environment where he is under constant threat and where criminals will not hesitate for a second before taking his life? On the other hand, how far can this same policeman go? It is certainly not acceptable to steal suspects and use these stolen objects in negotiations with informants, to act as a judge and not just to condemn suspects but to murder them for one's own interests or consume the same drugs that one seeks to remove from the streets - and it is relevant to reflect on this in a society who often confuses the search for security with a thirst for revenge. At the same time that it is necessary to offer protection to citizens and to the police themselves, it is also necessary to reflect on the risks involved.This is the best discussion that Fuqua's film can foster and that's why the third act disappoints by turning Alonzo into a one-dimensional monster and taking him away from the viewer. In a violent society like ours, it is more and more natural that we have the impulse to support attitudes like those of Detective Alonzo, since we want to recover a little of our former tranquility at any cost (and, thus, many may argue: ""he is corrupt, but at least he's doing something about crime""). Sadly, the only way Training Day can show the error of this stance is to turn Washington's character into a monster.Even with these slips, ""Training Day"" works well as a portrait of police corruption and the complex situation experienced by those who are thrown into the war on drug trafficking, whether police officers or ordinary citizens. Built in two brilliant performances, it works as good entertainment without failing to provoke reflection, although a better worked third act could increase its thematic and narrative complexity.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Another Cop Flick....,"Okay, so after Denzel Washington won the Oscar for Best Actor for this flick, I thought it would be worth my while to watch it and see if it was deserved. In my humble opinion, I believe that the Oscar was awarded to the WRONG man that night.The story revolved around Alonzo (Washington), head of the narc unit of LAPD, who take on a rookie, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) who wants to be part of the unit. This day in the life of movie takes them to neighbourhoods of LA and Hoyt, who has great respect for the narcs and Alonzo finds himself in the middle of a corrupt system he doesn't want to believe.The performances are alright. Hawke is pretty good as the naive, new cop. Washington is believable as the expert, rough around the edges with a quick wit. But I don't think it's an Oscar winning performance. I do believe Russell Crowes performance in ""A Beautiful Mind"" was much stronger and deserving. No, I'm not biased because I'm an Aussie, but I think politics and personal feelings got in the way of the voting. I mean, ""Training Day"" was at the cinemas here for what, two weeks? Didn't even make the top ten here. When Washington won the Oscar, they brought it back to the cinemas.

Washington Makes It Worthwhile,"A brutal and disturbing film that attempts to connect you with the underbelly of the streets of downtown Los Angeles, while examining that fragile, thin line between those who enforce the law and those who break it, `Training Day,' directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a cautionary morality tale that decidedly points out that what you do and who you are is a matter of free will and personal choice.  Beyond the action, it's a study of human nature that explores the necessity of having a moral code by which to live, especially when confronted with that age-old seductress Evil, who can lure even the best of the best across that line from which there is no return. The most disconcerting aspect of the film, however, is in it's portrayal of those in high places who with facility betray those they are sworn to serve and protect, with their flagrant abuse of their position and power, and moreover, seemingly always manage to hold the high ground of advantage over those against whom their misdeeds are perpetrated.  Indeed, the burden of proof must always fall to the good guy, and more often than not it is those endowed with a more positive, benevolent nature-- the ones who want to do the right thing-- that find justice elusive and become victims themselves, if only because of their refusal to compromise their own principles.  And that is really what is at the heart of Fuqua's film, which very probably will take many viewers to a place they would rather not be.  But, as Steve McQueen said in `Bullitt,' when asked by his girlfriend how he can stand doing a job that keeps him so close to the gutter, `That's where half of it is--'  And in today's world, unfortunately, it may well be that the percentage is even higher; which somewhat elevates the significance of this film.Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), a nineteen month veteran of the L.A.P.D., is about to begin his first day on a new assignment, having landed a spot in the Narcotics Division, where he will be a member of a small squad under the direction of Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington)-- if he measures up to Alonzo's stringent expectations.  It's a job he wants, because he sees it as an opportunity to really do some good in the community; it's a place from which he can help rid the streets of drug dealers and other felons.  But he quickly discovers that-- as most worthwhile things are in life-- it's just not that easy.  As Alonzo is quick to point out, `If you want to protect the sheep from the wolf, you have to become a wolf.  It's the wolf that catches the wolf--'  Jake also learns that on this day he's going to have to make a lot of decisions, and make them quickly, without the luxury of time to consider all of the possible ramifications.  And one of them is put to him directly by Alonzo, who tells him he's going to have to decide what he wants to be, a sheep-- or a wolf.  It's something he's going to have to know by the end of the day; and Jake doesn't know it going in, but this day, his `Training Day,' is going to be a day that will change his life forever.Fuqua's film is presented honestly and in such a way that it successfully puts the viewer on the streets of L.A., and Jake and Alonzo are credible characters; but the motivation behind Alonzo's ruthlessness is fairly anemic and under-developed.  The weakness of the film, in fact, lies in the screenplay (by David Ayer), which though it captures a certain sense of `street-wise' reality, is otherwise rather formulaic and doesn't really have the depth it needs to make it emotionally involving.  And one of the biggest flaws, especially in light of the fact that this story is presented in `realistic' terms, is that a key element of the plot hinges on a coincidence that Vegas odds-makers would love to put some big money on.  Fuqua visits much of the same territory as Dennis Hopper's 1988 film, `Colors,' though the final message is quite different, inasmuch as the focus of this film is on the `bad cop' angle.  As stated previously, there is some significance to this one, but it takes some work and imagination on the part of the viewer to discern.As Alonzo, Denzel Washington gives an excellent performance-- and, quite frankly, this film would be less than average without him-- but whether or not it is deserving of an Oscar is open to speculation.  Washington is one of the finest actors in the business, without question, and he's taken on some challenging roles (in which he's been very successful) that make this part pale by comparison.  Alonzo Harris is more along the lines of Mel Gibson's Riggs in `Lethal Weapon,' or Eastwood's Harry in `Dirty Harry,' the difference being that Alonzo is the bad guy.  It's a credit to Washington's ability that he was able to make this such a strong character, however, and his Alonzo is certainly believable and real.  And, in retrospect, perhaps it is an Oscar-worthy performance; it had to be to overcome the weakness of the script and what he was given to work with.  And, again, without Denzel Washington, this film plays for two weeks in the theater and is quickly forgotten when it hits the video store shelf.Hawke gives a strong performance, as well, but that he received an Oscar nomination for it is the stuff of which debates are born.  Like Washington, however, Hawke does do a good job of bringing his character to life, and it is one of the strengths of the film.The supporting cast includes Tom Berenger (Stan), Harris Yulin (Doug) and Scott Glenn (Roger).  In the final analysis, `Training Day' is elevated by the performances of it's stars; without them, this one has no legs.  6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

His Oscar-winning performance is the highlight of the film, balancing charm and menace in a way that keeps you glued to every scene.

The cinematography captures the harshness of the streets of Los Angeles, adding to the film's immersive experience.However, while the film starts strong, the third act leans a bit too much into over-the-top action and melodrama, slightly undermining the realism it initially establishes.

Hard Boiled and extremely well acted cop drama,"Antoine Fuqua's Training Day is a film that gets a big boost in the acting department from Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, but it's script is also acute and sharp as a knife when it comes to showing corrupt cops in Los Angeles.Hawke plays Jake Loit, a rookie cop with 19 months training who's gonna get some real training (narc training) on a day in L.A. from a unconventional detective (Washington).  You know a cop movie will be quite different when in the first 30 minutes a cop is smoking dope (laced with PCP), though it isn't quite simple how it got to that anyway.  As is much of the movie, which never takes the easy way out of scenes (outside of a unreal ending) and stays in it's region quite well.  Sometimes it seems like we've seen this before, but Washington is so convincing as a villain type, which he usually avoids, that the film is overall quite entertaining and worthwhile.

Never mind Washingtonwhat about Hawke,"We all know that Denzel can cut it and performed his role here with unmistakable mastery. However personally I thought the Oscar should go to Ethan Hawke; one of my favourite actors and often under rated. He's one of those actors who is so good in his supporting roles that he often gets overlooked. From the first time I saw him in Dead poets, I've been following his career and in Training day I thought Hawke gave the performance of his life. This is a fantastic gritty suspenseful story that is so refreshing in the face of all the bubble gum thrillers out there that just want numbers at the box office. This movie proves that you can have both realism and popularity in the same reel. Whatever minor flaws this movie had was more than made up for by the palpable screen chemistry between these praiseworthy actors who took the viewer on a roller coaster ride with the sticky plot, thorough script and various unexpected twists and turns. An adrenaline fuelled edge of the seat trip; riveting from beginning to end10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A character driven,"Training Day sees Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke at full supremacy, both so brilliantly in command of there roles that they compensate for this action thriller's decorous screenplay and lack of ideas. If this film is about corruption, greed, narcotics and violence, by the end it becomes a one on one show between Washington and Hawke's character. What we care for, what entertains us through out the film is not its conventional themes expressed without conviction, but the squabbles between the two morally distinct characters as they visit the most corrupt places with the most corrupt people on the streets.Ethan Hawke plays Jack Hoyt (in a performance equally as brilliant as Denzel's), a man whose dream is to belong to the elite Narc squad. For him, it is an opportunity to fight true crime, the one that matters, to save the world of drugs. But before he can even dream of belonging to the Narc squad, he's got to pass a test and this film is precisely about that Training Day where Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) will be his instructor, a day in which Hoyt will see that nothing in the city of Los Angeles is as it seems, and we realise the unsettling boundaries of corruption.Alonzo Harris, in an inspired and over the top performance by Denzel, is a charismatic individual convinced by his own methods. He believes that giving out street justice is what justice is all about, that the enemy is in the streets, outside the law and he has got to be hunted like a wolf hunting another wolf. Alonzo is clearly corrupt and does not go by the law, he is a liar and may be worse than the criminals themselves since he has power and they don't. The contrast between Hoyt, a man who goes by the law but has little experience in enforcing it and a man who doesn't go by the law but has a lot of experience in enforcing it is the movie's key appeal.The film does a good job of reflecting Hoyt's initial and later feeling about Alonzo's actions on us. Firstly we feel that this guy may actually just be a cop trying to fight crime in his own way but there comes a point when we grow to dislike him.The final moments of the film are the weakest point of the film. You see, what happens at Alozno seems collected out of a container since the only clue we are given for the possibility is shown a little past half way in the film. It feels like the director didn't know how to end the film and found a far fetched way during shooting. Having said that, I like the way the director handles the very last scene: it doesn't force any unnecessary action but ends as it should. This is a film worth watching only to see the character conflict.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Alonzo and Hoyt - both wolfs and sheep,"Something I think Actors try so hard to do is to change the state of mind of their characters. Alonzo and Hoyt both encounter situations where they have to be scared as well as suck up to people.

Their characters change so well it makes me feel great knowing they actually bothered to earn the awards they got. I think all wannabe actors should watch the uncomfortable scenes where Hoyt tries his best to match Alonzo's style and swagger in the car. Alonzo too, plays on Hoyt's fear and nervousness so well.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is a very well put together film in every way that is an absolute must see,"Training Day (2001) is a movie I watched for the first time in a long time on Netflix. The storyline for this picture involves a young man assigned to a special units narcotics team in Los Angeles.

This movie is directed by Antoine Fuqua (Brooklyn's Finest) and stars Denzel Washington (Malcolm X), Ethan Hawke (Before Sunrise), Scott Glenn (Backdraft), Tom Berenger (Inception), Cliff Curtis (10,000 BC) and Eva Mendes (Fast & Furious). The cast is absolutely awesome in this from top to bottom. Yes, Washington gives an all time great performance, but every side and supporting character is delivered magnificently as well. This is a top 3 all time Washington performance for me. The storyline and writing for this is excellent. I really loved the scenarios in this which were unique and well intertwined.

Better than I remembered,I remember seeing this back in the day and although I thought it was OK it's only upon review did I realize Training Day is a very fine movie. It's unusual to see Denzel Washington playing a bad guy and he does it very well and has great support from Ethan Hawke. On the face of it this is the story of a rookie narcotic cop's first day on the job riding shotgun for an old hand who doesn't play by the rules. However as the day progresses we learn the old hand is in big trouble and is desperately trying to frame the rookie to take the fall instead of himself. It's well written for the most part and certainly well performed however the plot hinges on a random event towards the beginning of the day which the corrupt old cop has no control over but that changes events dramatically later on. I'm not a fan of plots relying on coincidence but it only detracts a little and otherwise the plot is solid. So if it's been a while then give Training Day another watch and if you've never seen it before it's one of the best movies on Netflix at the moment.,7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Heart of Darkness on the streets of LA,I like the movie. I live in LA and saw up close neighborhoods I wouldn't venture into with a panzered Humbvie. But I learned that gangs have a code of honor. The story of a rookie cop Jake (Ethan Hawke) getting his street IQ bumped up a few notches by veteran Narc Alonzo (Denzyl Washington). But is Alonzo the truth the way and the light or a seductive demon? There's enough seduction and mystery to keep us interested. There is a boatload of really good acting between the two leads as they drive around the streets of LA fulfilling Alonzos agenda. Unfortunately the movie has two really week moments for which I suspect director Antoine Fuqua is still taking heat. Both moments are heroic unbelievable revivals of Jake. I suggest Antoine should have made an alternate ending without such a heroic revival and stuck that on the DVD for the viewers who were taken out of their theatre seats and put on the streets of LA. 4 stars.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Clash of Characters,"What looks like a classic cop/gangster scenario at first glance is much more fascinating when boiled down to the interactions of two very distinct character types. The hardened, loud-mouth, streetwise detective (Denzel Washington) against the quiet, nice-guy rookie, who seemingly has a lot to learn (Ethan Hawke).I'm sure most, if not all, know the type of person that easily and consciously draws attention to themselves. Sometimes they are seen as obnoxious and loud, sometimes as lively and entertaining, but they are always at center stage. And weaker characters, be it due to personality traits, social standing or whatever other reason, are often swept away in the wake of such persons. The prolonged exposure to such a character and the struggle to overcome him is what elevates this movie beyond the standard fare of the genre. The other driving point is the old-fashioned standing up for what is right even against the odds, and while those two unfold nicely, the logical integrity of the actual story may become questionable at times.The gritty portrayal of police work and the urban scenery strive to offer a good amount of realism and are indeed successful if one is able to look past the classic police thriller at the surface (and the display of questionable morals that could be too readily decried as wildly unrealistic). The acting and the technical aspects of the movie, as well as the good pacing, help to enable a good amount of immersion.Overall Training Day is a solid movie whose merits lie beyond an entertaining storyline. It is definitely worth a watch, at the very least to relish Denzel's performance.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A film to study for all filmmakers,"""Training Day"" is a gripping and intense crime thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, the film follows a veteran LAPD detective, Alonzo Harris (Washington), as he takes his new partner, Jake Hoyt (Hawke), on a dangerous and corrupt ride-along through the streets of Los Angeles.From the very beginning, the film sets a tense and ominous tone as Alonzo introduces Jake to his unconventional methods of policing, which involve breaking the law to enforce it. Washington's performance as the morally ambiguous and manipulative Alonzo is nothing short of outstanding, and he fully embodies the character's charisma, charm, and ruthlessness.Hawke also delivers a compelling performance as the idealistic and naive Jake, who struggles to reconcile his own sense of right and wrong with Alonzo's questionable tactics. The chemistry between the two actors is palpable, and their interactions are both riveting and unpredictable.The film's plot is complex and full of twists and turns, as Alonzo's true motives and allegiances become increasingly murky. The cinematography and editing are also top-notch, with a gritty and visceral feel that immerses the viewer in the dangerous and volatile world of the LAPD.Overall, ""Training Day"" is a must-see for fans of crime thrillers and intense character studies. It is a raw and uncompromising look at the corrupt underbelly of law enforcement, and a showcase for the tremendous talent of its lead actors and director.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is not exactly common for older 90s and 00s movies since many of them start to age badly and drop their rating.

Average,"Training Day starts off great, but by the end, it's ultimately just a very average film. The last act in particular drags down the film even more. Washington commands the screen and blurts out his dialogue in the best possible way, but as good as he is he cannot elevate what is simply a weak script. This material doesn't deserve him. Hawke is also pretty good, but here's the thing. No, I don't really smile at knowing he got a nomination for the Oscar because he was in no way a supporting actor. I'm sure everyone in the Academy knew this, but because Washington is so good and in fear of vote splitting, they carelessly voted for Hawke in supporting actor, robbing a true supporting actor that year a slot. I'm sure they knew it, but once again it shows just how political the Academy can be. This film is ultimately only worth a look for the two leads, but even then I can't recommend it much.",,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel goes killing - an Ethan Hawke is there too,"Let's be honest here, the star of the show is undoubtedly Denzel Washington, swaggering around LA at his imperious acting best. Given free rein (both to act and to police), Alonzo (Washington) is a swearing, day-drinking narcotics officer playing close to the edge of lawfulness, often opting to bend the rules in order to impose just punishments. His new protege, the stereotypically naive and one-dimensional Jake (Ethan Hawke) is necessary for the plot, but arguably offers little in acting.Taking place over Jake's first day under Alonzo's watch, Training Day tackles a cop's conflict with doing what is right. Alonzo spends most of his time brandishing weapons or using suspect techniques to gain information, whereas Jake is the puritan rookie, playing exclusively by the book. The deeper Jake follows Alonzo, the more he understands how Alonzo has lost his focus, his morals, and his entitlement to wear the badge.Training Day is fun, there is no question. Watching this gun-toting narco detective sleaze around LA is amusing, whilst also hitting hard when Denzel delivers his lines to a tee. Hawke does his best, but is forgettable really; a conduit for the story, his character is often grating and irritating, but does what is required.Training Day is not a new idea - we've seen rogue cops and LA gangs before - but it does nail the core principle: something that is fun to watch, without entering incredulity. A leading man like Denzel (giving one of his best performances) does this film only good, and is definitely one to watch if you aren't looking for a serious cinematic commitment. - HLO",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

His interpretation of a very evil man is flawless.He practically pops with theatrical sizzle.Ethan Hawke is just as good as naive rookie, Jake Hoyt.

All hail Denzel Washington,"""Training Day"" which stars Denzel Washington in an Oscar-winning performance and Ethan Hawke in an Oscar-nominated performance, is one hell of a movie. Denzel stars as L.A. narcotics officer Alonzo Harris, who is probably the most brutal cop working in the city.  Ethan is his young trainee, Jake Hoyt, who wants to become a narc so he can move himself and his wife into a better home.  Throughout the day, we see Denzel battle crime with such hostility, that Jake cannot help but think that what Alonzo is doing is wrong.  At this point this is where the battle starts...Alonzo Harris is not evil in the usual sense of the word, but he is simply a person who has become corrupted by his own means of justice.  The story of ""Training Day"" is that he has developed a sort of God-like persona and uses this image to put fear into the hearts of those who are against him. Despite all of this, there are higher forces who oppose his power.  This inevitably leads to his downfall.  Alonzo is a tyrant plain and simple.  He has people who do his bidding for him, but not for long now that Hoyt is on the streets.  Hoyt will lead the battle to oust Alonzo out of power.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Loud, Over-the-Top Movie That Tries Too Hard for Street Cred","(Spoiler Alert in below review)""Training Day"" desperately tries to achieve ""street cred"" and just winds up overshooting its target.This movie would have been much more effective (and realistic) if it'd gone for a more low-key approach. The problem with today's Hollywood is that the first rule of movie-making is always MORE, MORE, MORE.But the subtle, low-key approach has its advantages. It would have given this movie the street credibility that it so desperately tries to achieve.Yes, there are rogue, out-of-control cops in America in real-life. It'd be nice if we could get a half-way realistic film about this problem.But instead, we get this loud, over-the-top, ham-fisted movie that won't have any more real-world impact than the latest superhero/comic book movie.A more subtle, low-key movie could maybe have shed a little light on the rogue cop phenomenon (and perhaps even let us relate to the rogue cops on some level and understand what drives them to act the way they do). In fact, it appears that this movie makes at least a half- hearted effort to achieve just that. But it fails.Maybe some people in the audience related to why the Denzel character acted the way he did. But I thought he was just a one- dimensional jerk who was abusing the badge.A lot of his dialogue was presented as being a lot more profound than it really was. Actually, a lot of it (along with his actions) didn't make a lot of sense (spoiler alert) starting with the premise of bringing a new guy along on a day of outrageous antics that would have shocked the most jaded, crooked veteran rogue cop.This movie not only fails as a work of art, it is an insult to real- life police officers.",,Anonymous,Crime

This Has Got To Be Denzel's Year,"Denzel Washington has given us a different look at his acting capabilities.The majority of his films give us a decent man,who stands for right,and goes the distance in proving this.This time Denzel shows he can make us believe he is as rotten,cruel,and selfish as they come.And I believe in his character as Alonzo Harris,as crooked a policeman most anyone would ever care to know.He portrays this wicked officer to the hilt.A cop who cares very little about the well being of his kid and the mother of his child,or needless to say his sworn oath to preserve and protect as a civil servant of the police force.Before this movie,if anyone would have told me I would someday be watching one of his films where I would feel his death was justified,I would have thought they were crazy.This can only speak for the outstanding performance he has delivered in this motion picture.So much of what we see of him this time only proves he is indeed a great actor.A great actor,who has been slighted a time or two at the Oscars.Others might not agree with me,but I feel he was overlooked for his fine performance in ""The Crimson Tide"".Denzel should have at least been a nominee that year,in my opinion.If he doesn't receive best actor for this one this time,I feel like Julia Roberts,but I'll take it a bit further.The academy should discontinue giving out yearly awards,especially when excellent actors like Denzel are far too often loosing out to others who gave lesser performances.I believe if he looses this time,not just myself but a great deal of movie fans will be taken back to the 80's when Steven Spielberg's ""The Color Purple"" walked away empty handed,after capturing 11 nominations that year,and received not even one.Truly unjust.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

It is a sharp film and his character steals the show and the drugs lol.Its a very well made drama that titilates the senses whilst being cool to look at, a bit like Jack Nicholson.The pacing of the film is really first class, it allows room for character development but keeps things always moving so things never feel slow.The urban style that the movie sits in feels really legitimate adding to the credibility of the show.If you are looking for a buddy cop film then this ain't it!

Denzel Makes History,"Continuing my plan to watch every movie in Denzel Washington's filmography, I just watched Training Day for the first time and it was in the cinema.This review is a few days old, I wanted to wait until I had watched Remember The Titans, before I posted it.Only his second time playing a bad guy (the first being 1986's Power) Denzel seems to be having a lot of fun, here. I always felt Ethan Hawke has always been a tad under rated, and he is great here. Scott Glenn is great in his supporting role. The gorgeous Eva Mendes has a small role Terry Crews (though I don't remember him speaking a line), Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg also feature in the movie.As good as the performances are, you do need to seriously suspend belief. I'm not saying all of these events in one day are impossible; but wow. There were times when I was distracted by the need to trace back through the plot and try to piece together how events could possibly have turned out this way. As I left the cinema with my 17 year old son, we talked about the logic and plausibility of what we had watched. We both agreed it was better to go along for the ride, rather than think about it.That's not to say we both didn't really enjoy it. I'm glad I watched it on the big screen and it will probably be in my top 10 Denzel movies come the end of his filmography.In what was considered an upset Denzel won the Best Actor Oscar for Training Day. It was considered an upsetas Russell Crowe had won all the major precursor awards (Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, Critics Choice and BAFTA) for A Beautiful Mind.With his Best Actor Oscar win for this film, Denzel Washington became the first black actor to win two acting Academy Awards.When I was researching this movie, I found out Originally this film was supposed to be released in November 2001, with most of the original posters stating this. However, after the attacks on 9/11 Training Day was pushed forward to October 5, 2001 which was the original release date for Arnold Schwarzenegger's Collateral Damage, which was pulled off the release schedule and was released in February 2002.Training Day grossed $76 million at the domestic box office and was the 29th highest grossing movie of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
At times it is gritty and realistic,"(2001) Training Day
CRIME DRAMA/ ACTIONActor Denzil Washington won an Oscar for his role as a corrupt narcotics officer, Alonzo with the attempts to pin everything bad happened to other people, especially to his supposedly trained rookie partner Jake, played by Ethan Hawke, and it's not long before he catches on what his partner is up to!Gripping, very involving with realistic believable twists and turns leading to great finale. Also memorable are the use of actual street gangs in the film, some on their first acting movie debut playing their roles quite well! Somewhat made in the same direction as the British film, ""The Long Good Friday"" starring Bob Hoskins and Helen Miren where the surprise revelation is at or near the end of the movie! My only downside is that the plot can be more effective had it been tightened. The first of five collaborations Denzil Washington starred with director Antoine Fuqua.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brutal violence isn't easy to stomach any more.,"Perhaps the timing just wasn't right.  Somehow, watching Training Day two days after the horrors of September 11th made my heart and stomach that much more sensitive to violence.  But Denzel Washington IS as good as ever. Ethan Hawke is strong in the boy-scout role.  The script is cleverly manipulative and the direction is great.  I even thought Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg hit the right note.  It just felt like a finely executed streak of violence.  Accurate?  Maybe.  But not exactly the kind of film I was in the mood for.  Too many bullets in the chest, not enough redemption.  I'm not always a softy, but after September 11th I'm looking for more.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

We rarely see him play a bad guy in a movie and he did a great job. Easily one of if not the best movies Denzel Washington has ever been in. Again, depending on who you ask. I mean I'm not judging.

a well-made thriller,"From director Antoine Fuqua comes this gripping, pulse-pounding police thriller about crime and corruption. Hawke is an idealistic rookie narcotics officer who's just been assigned to a new unit; Washington is his twisted, maniacal senior officer out to give him an up close and personal look at the gritty L.A. streets. The young officer's morale is put to the test as he's given an in-depth look at both sides of the law, and forced to make a choice as he's plunged into the cruel world of police brutality. Washington is intensely believable and charismatically over-the-top as a seasoned veteran who doesn't play by the rules, and Hawke stands tall as his inexperienced but steadfast subordinate. Mostly good writing and direction falter at the climax—and require a certain suspension of disbelief—but overall the movie packs a powerful punch. ***",,Anonymous,Crime
Good Performances.,"Training Day was an exciting movie with a great performance by Denzel Washington.  The movie was in fact filled with good performances.  It was nicely photographed and paced well.  The ending was somewhat of a sell out and not too plausible.  Guns, as in most Hollywood productions, were the center piece of the movie.  No wonder we live in violent times.  We worship them in movies such as this.  I rate the movie highly for its fast pace and good acting but discount that rating because of the gun worship and faulty ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Outstanding corrupt cop drama,"The ending was a bit of overkill. That could be said. And the mano-a-mano fight après the ending was a bit drawn out. That too could be said. But the rest of the film was more than excellent.""Training Day"" is the best of the bad cop dramas that I have seen, and I've seen a few. Both Denzel Washington as the psychopathic bad cop, Alonzo, and Ethan Hawke as the idealistic rookie, Jake, were full out. Denzel Washington won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance, and Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The direction by Antoine Fuqua was superb. The LA street scenes and milieu were as real and vivid as my old buddy Taco Bender. (And trust me, Taco Bender was very real.) The extras in the crowd scenes should get some kind of prize for macho scary. I've been there, and I still have a few nightmares. There are some streets in LA you don't want to walk down unless you are a homey, or a brother, and some other streets you don't want to walk down, period.Unlike some cop dramas and shoot 'em up thrillers, this one was carefully planned, so that the scene in the barrio at the card table, the rook all alone set up for the kill, came across as real because what had happened before was just about the only thing in the world that could have saved him. The LA atmosphere was like a rush, as stunningly authentic in a different way as, say, that in Chinatown (1974) or LA Confidential (1997), but more contemporary.I wonder how many guys starting in say the sixties or maybe a little before have experienced the kind of initiation that Jake experiences in terms of being fed some dope never before tasted and then ""led"" on the ""trip"" by someone wanting to exploit them. Most of the time, for most guys it was an initiation into something other worldly, scary, but something that was only psychological and would be gone the next day. For Jake it was a matter of, first, his livelihood as an idealistic cop, and second a matter of groking to a paranoid view of the world in which the good guys are the bad guys and everything is hopelessly corrupt and there is no good, only evil—and you just found out. And third, a matter of life and death with either acid and grass running all around your brain or maybe PCP and speed, and some suddenly obviously evil person (as Washington so well depicted) giving you the kind of ""guidance"" you can't refuse. And then finally it is beyond life and death and only a matter of primeval justice and a revenge you must perform.Look for Snoop Dogg in a wheelchair and Dr. Dre as one of Alonzo's posse cops.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

darn good movie,"this is simply a very good movie! Ethan Hawke was great and Denzel Washington - just outstanding and so inspiring as the villain.This is a story about who you are, what do you want to be, and what price you are prepared to pay to get there (as a side note - remember the ad in the NY sub - 'how bad do you want to be good' :)A story of corrupt cops, duty, the line between good and bad. It is interesting to see the people Jake(Ethan Hawke) meets during his first 'training' day in this new team. Interesting to see how people, who we initially take for 'bad' guys care more about honor and duty than persons who's 'job' it is to protect these valuesEva Mendes also has a small role too, that for me is hilarious, but i guess this was just a step forward for her towards 'star'-status later in her career9/10 for story, acting and productionpeace",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Intense character-driven drama,"I have never watched this film before now yet I still feel confident that it holds up all of its original power and impact that it did in 2001. (Finally I hear the famous ""King Kong ain't go s*** on me!"" Line! Did not disappoint.)Denzel, Denzel. What a powerhouse. What an absolute powerhouse. This character doesn't work as well portrayed any other way by any other actor. He is continuously oscillating between charming, vindictive, calming, cunning, wise, and extremely morally questionable. He does all of this with poise and ease. The audience, riding along with a blank-slate Jake (Ethan Hawke), doesn't know what to believe. Alonzo is a a master manipulator. A complicated man who holds authority and has been influenced by his experiences. Why shouldn't we trust him? Even as things escalate, we're hoping for redemption. For it all to make sense and be justified in the end.While sometimes slow and at other time uncomfortable, ""Training Day"" does what a lot of movies don't do anymore; immerse you and make you think. At times as artful as a play, and other times so intense you have to look away, this movie did make me yearn for this type of script that is no longer quite so present in the mainstream.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
More training needed...,"I found this film a let-down from the beginning. I find it strange that Denzel Washington should have won an oscar for what is basically a one-dimensional character anyone could have played in their sleep. I found him very annoying throughout the movie, (which is partly the idea, I am aware) but when a character becomes so tiresome that you're tempted to switch off, you know that the filmmakers are in trouble. As for Hawk, he is given woefully little material to work with but in fact ends up giving a more impressive performance than Washington - I think he presented his own spiral into the seedy underworld or corrupt cops and his subsequent disillusionment very well (even if the goatee was a mistake...) On the plus side, I would say that the film's final act is genuinely gripping despite frequent lapses into mindless ""beat-em-up"" mode. It is, however, hopelessly macho in almost all respects and inexplicable cameos by Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray reveal that this is a film about surface not substance. I can't see much in it to raise it above any other simple action ""good cop, bad cop"" fare.",,Anonymous,Crime
Decent film!,"I hate to break the news to you guys but cops like Alonzo ARE OUT THERE and need to be acknowledged. Acting like the problem doesn't exist does not solve it. You don't have to go that deep to know that Alonzo was once a good cop who just got fed up w/ 'police procedures.' If you acknowledge that Jake's shallow-mindedness at the beginning of the film only allows him to look at the perks of making detective and how the progress of the day transforms him, you can really appreciate Ethan's portrayal of him. Let's face it, a bad day at the office when you're a narcotics detective differs greatly from that of an office executive and the different stresses can warrant different results.Even the street rhetoric was authentic. Maybe you guys need to get out of the 'burbs more. You guys didn't actually expect eloquent dialogue with little or no profanity, did you? The only part of this movie I struggle with is Dr. Dre's terrible overacting and that isn't nearly enough to take away from the overall result.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

There are a couple plot holes and you have to watch and listen carefully to understand everything that' going on, but it's well written with a couple of clever twists in between. The ending is a little formulaic, but that is saved by a powerhouse, Oscar winning performance by Denzel, and an equally intense Hawke. This is the best film on Fuqua's line of action drama's.

He learns from veteran detective Alonzo and enters the underworld of Los Angeles. However, Alonzo's methods defy Jake's common sense. Jake is conflicted by Alonzo, who openly uses the gray areas of the law and does nothing to achieve his goals.The highlight of the film is the overwhelming presence of Alonzo, played by Denzel Washington. Ruthless and charismatic, Alonzo keeps the audience engaged and the moral compass shaken. Each of his words asks not only Jake, but the audience as well.I was particularly struck by Alonzo's words to Jake: ""To fight a wolf, you have to be a wolf."" They made me think about justice, evil, and the choices we make to survive.While watching the movie, I was left to ponder many times. What is justice? What is evil?

Rogue cop,"What a performance from Denzell Washington, who largely deserved his Academy Awards in such an evil character, evil for whom audiences can feel empathy though. Rogue cop as the lead has already been made with Richard Quine's PUSHOVER, Howard Koch's SHIELD FOR MUDER, Don Murray in DEADLY HERO, more or less naughty, more or less villain. More than borderline cops for sure, not in the Olivier Marchal pure style, but not that far. But the screenplayer is David Ayer's, who seems to be used to such schemes in his own films as a director: END OF WATCH, HARSH TIMES, SABOTAGE. So after all, this is a David Ayer's trademark, thru Antoine Fuqua's excellent direction. And Washington magnifies the whole work. A milestone in the crime film history, as HEAT, SCARFACE or THE GODFATHER was, but from the cop force point of view. As DEPARTED was, another true authentic gem.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Training Day Makes The Grade,"Training Day is a very well-done film.  I watched a screening copy of it at my apartment in Hollywood then had to walk down the sidewalk for some errands... that's when I realized the hard-hitting nature and true to life perfection of this picture in its portrayal of the LA streets.I laugh at the handful of negative comments questioning the quality of writing and/or directing.  Just on the surface (for all those non-film school kids out there), there is a scene where Alonzo and Jake are sitting in a Stan's (?) house when Stan remembers Jake being a great safety in high school.  Everyone who knows football knows that a safety is the lack resort to stopping a quarterback who gets loose.  Later Alonzo makes a comment comparing himself to a quarterback.  Nice writing.  Then there is the scene where Alonzo meets with the heads of the police who are portrayed like Mafia Dons.  It is lit very much like the Godfather with the single (low) light source and a yellow, almost Sepia, filter.  Beautiful directing.Acting?  Coach Boone to Alonzo.  I think that about sums it up.  He does an amazing job and puts you on edge, not only with the lines, but his intensity in his eyes.  That's something that cannot be directed or written.  Ethan Hawke, very subtle but very effective.  Again, his delivery makes the lines jump off the page and turn them into anguish and fear that words just don't capture.As far as just the overall presentation, no, it does not drag.  It's supposed to be scary/real, not over the top unbelievable like Warner Brothers has a bad habit of doing.

"Pointless theme-ride through the LA gutter, despite good acting and production values.","Police and thieves are such a staple of TV that you have to be looking at making something special to make one stand out as a feature film.Here the producers try and make things bigger, bolder and more extreme but, sadly, this only makes the production more hysterical and far-fetched. No cop in the history of the force is quite as down-and-dirty as the one played here by Denzil Washington. Indeed he is probably as out-there as any cop in the history of cinema cops!Excess and success have often been mistaken for one another in the Oscar world and here Denzil took the main prize with this good, but hardly great, performance. The guy can grin and talk in double time (this guy knows about speech rhythm and stress - which is rare for an American actor), but this must have been a poor year. Nathan Hawke is actually just as good as the rookie that may - or may not - be corrupted.Here we are in ""blacktown after-dark"" (for those that have seen Kentucky Fried Movie!) and you can be sure that the minute they step out of the car there will be gunshots, a chase and a death. Yes it is quite lively and the street hoods do look the real deal, but so what, they probably are the real deal!I feel for Hawke, the cop he is playing is a moron so he can only react not act. Hope he gets his own star gig soon - he looks ready.There are plenty of other movies that leave a horrible aftertaste - Boyz in the Hood, Menace 2 Society, Taxi Driver, to name but three - but there films have some social comment to make. This doesn't. This says: It is all rotten, it is all without hope. Bad places have bad cops so they are part of the problem not part of the solution. There is no redeeming qualities here.

gritty stuff but oscar caliber?,"Actors seem to enjoy playing ""bad"" people and Denzel is so bad here, he becomes a caricature: a slick mix of all those power hungry LA cops you hear about too much in the news. His performance is riveting, he's a scumbag yes, but who would want to watch this more than once?  Ethan Hawke's role was the tougher of the 2 leads, I felt, because he had to play a person who is all too rare in Hollywood these days: someone with a strong moral center. We feel all his pain and disgust and finally his anger, and we root for him, even with the cliched script. Hawke deserved his supporting nomination since he truly went thru an emotional gamut from beginning to end. Denzel pretty much stayed the same: remaining a scurvy villain in every scene, even if, one is apt to say, his job created his behavior as much as his own greed did. Feeling powerless to change society, he in turn becomes just as warped and destroyed as the people he's trying to put away. Too bad the screenplay takes the issue of powerlessness and turns it into an action picture. This could have been real compelling with a more careful writer. Instead we get Denzel as evil cartoon and an Oscar to show much Hollywood loves evil cartoons. Harvey Kietel excelled with more complexity in the Bad Lieutenant some years before in the 90's, with complicated religious overtones thrown into the mix to make a riveting but overlooked  film experience that was hardly given a chance at the box office.

I loved it because I hated it,"Let me try and explain my feelings about this film. First of all, Denzel Washington was excellent in this. He deserved the award for best actor, and rightly so, for his work in this film. I hated him in this movie because I hated his character. Which should tell you how good a job he did in the movie. When you hate someone's character in a movie, so much, that generally means we're talking Academy Award. However, I don't think I was meant to hate the movie, too.A new rookie on his first day of Narcatics, meets with his unit leader at ten a.m. Already nervous, about making the team, he has no idea just how nervous he'll be by the end of the day. After only spending two hours with his leader, Hawke starts to become aware of what kind of cop he's dealing with, but only by the end of the film, do we really see what we the audience are given to deal with as well.Ethan Hawke was great in this too, and in some ways I think that he's a better actor than Washington. But, to be fair, Denzel is the star of this movie, and you can't take your eyes off of him, because of his performance in it.Again, it's hard for me to even understand how I felt about the film. I liked it and I thought it was well-written, but it just seemed like such a dark film, and I almost wanted to turn it off sometimes, because it was so frustrating. But, I liked it well enough to give it a seven. So, there we are.

We of course, like Hawke's character Jake, a rookie eager to please, are initially taken in by this, but it is not long before doubts about Alonzo's true nature and agenda start to kick in.There are many disturbing things about this film, not least of which is the fact that no-one has come forward to say that it ain't really like that on the streets of LA  in fact they endorsed its accuracy by giving Washington an Oscar for his portrayal.However, Washington's performance is electric and worthy of its Academy Award. Alonzo is charismatic, persuasive, powerful, dangerous and downright scary. Ethan Hawke compliments this with a portrayal that runs the gamut from initial naivety and respect, through wary tolerance, to disbelief, terror and finally rage, in a performance necessarily powerful enough to counter Washington. The two are equally compelling to watch and provide edge of the seat entertainment in a gripping, raw and violent tale of lies, betrayal, corruption and abuse of power (sorry to use the old maxims there, but here they actually apply).Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A brilliant cop thriller! Good story, exciting and excellently acted.","I like cop thrillers in general and especially films that are set in LA and show the diversity of this city, especially the dangerous gang neighborhoods.I don't think there is much to say about the plot.A working day in the life of two policemen, a good cop and a very bad cop.Exciting to the end, lots of action and a really good performance by Denzel Washington makes the film quite outstanding.This movie impressed me in every way, the story is thrilling, with great police detective action and the most remarkable aspect of the movie was the acting performance of Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke; they breathed their souls into the characters, making this movie a total pleasure for those who like action movies with intelligent scripts and also suitable for movies of high quality.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Oscars? Really....,Now lets be serious here...how many of these films are there? As I heard people talking about this film in such a great way I decided to mosie on down to Virgin and buy it. Sat down with a vision of a fair and insightful representation of corruption and places like the jungle. What did I get? A jumped up half bad action half ridiculous philosophical gibberish. Don't get me wrong Washington played his part well but he was up against Russel Crowe from a (Beautiful Mind) and in my opinion the real winner in Will Smith (Ali). Anyway lets just say the film was a let down in a big way. Ethan Hawke was a hell of a lot better in this than some of his others but overall a disappointment don't go out of your way to watch it.,3.0,Anonymous,Crime

Training Day,"In my thoughts, 'Training Day' had a great visual, such as eye capturing cinematography, street productions and costume desighing. I felt like there were some unnecessary close ups on the fantastic portraits. On the other hand, the balanced cinematography was suitable for each scene.To Add, the title had apprpopiate music for the street theme film, for example electronic and rap smash hits. The soundtrack was played when needed.In addition, the storyline explored youth gang coulture and corruption in communities but it could of dug into a massive picture on the criminal subject matter. The black humour made my face burst into laughter because the dialogue and body language. David Ayer did a brilliant job with the screenplay.I am triggered to giving Antoine Fuqua's directed picture a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Trite ending mars a film with an interesting theme,"Films about police corruption are commonplace, but it's interesting to watch a film where the police become corrupted as a result of fighting an unwinnable war on the streets (a war that is unwinnable as seen in 'Traffic'), resorting to crooked methods/heavy handed tactics in their war against drugs.I enjoyed the interplay between Alonzo (Washington) and Hoyt (Hawke), their obvious clash of ideals/brutal cynicism and the early scenes are probably the strongest in the film. Hoyt's druggy trip almost reflects the murky, blurred world that he now finds himself inhabiting.The film has two main plotlines (police corruption, & the Russian mafia seeking vengeance) which eventually come together but I feel this is where the film  loses its hold on reality and descends into farce and implausibilty. If only the film perhaps had concentrated on the theme of police corruption, the possible consequences etc. The scenes & dialogue where Alonzo & Hoyt argue their feelings (wolves & sheep) are excellent. On the one hand, we can sympathise somewhat with Alonzo - the ugly war against drugs is stacked in favour of the criminals - yet most of us would probably identify with Hoyt's opinion. It's a morally grey area which should have been examined more.Because the film sadly descends into a simplistic confrontation between good & evil. It is very easy to criticise but I'd preferred a story that made Alonzo examine himself & question what he has become. Instead he becomes a pantomine villain - boo, hiss, he's behind you!The performances were good esp in the beginning where the actors were given the opportunity 'to act' rather than wrestle with each other. Washington is charismatic - I loved his opening gambit where,impatient with Hoyt's talking as he reads his paper, he orders him to 'entertain' him. Some critics have accused Washington of 'hamming' in this role, but I thought he was good as the police officer corrupted by his sense of power. His role, away from his usual type cast, is reminiscent of Richard Gere's impressive turn as a corrupt policeman in 'Internal Affairs' - a film which is much more psychological and the better for it.An interesting premise, but the final twenty minutes disappoint and let's the whole film down.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Elements of the truth,"Although it's probably a bit over the top, you can't help thinking that the stroyline here probably has elements of the truth. Jake (Hawke) is a rookie on the narcotics division and is paired with one of the top officers Alonzo (Washington).Alonzo doesn't conform to the norm however to get results and Jake is pushed into doing things that he is very uncomfortable with. The more he does the harder it is to turn back and he becomes embroiled in Alonzo's schemes. A very good movie with fine performances from both the leads. Washington won an oscar for this and whilst it's arguable whether that was deserved he certainly puts in a fine turn. It's to Hawke's credit that he is not totally overshadowed. 8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Growing Pains,"What Denzel Washington does in this movie is similar with whatSean Connery did in the Hunt for Red October, or Al Pacino did inthe Scent of a Woman; he simply outnumbered other casts.From the beginning, like Ethan Hawke, we look at him with a fullawe, such charisma and control and logical reasons towards allthe violence and crimes he does. And sitting on the third seat withthese two characters later proven to be a joyride between realismand idealism flick, similar like what Gene Hackman and WillemDafoe fighting in Mississippi Burning.The mean streets of Los Angeles are well presented, we simplylook at the violence and somehow, with Denzel Washingtoncharm, suddenly we're wondering what kind of life Ethan Hawkelive in, which puts him in such idealism... he's a pure heroschoolboy plunged into a pond of hell which he supposed to knowall the time.Apart from that, the sympathy and charms which supposed to bedrawn into our growing pains towards Denzel character remainsthere. That's the beauty of it, we are so deep with this characterand we can see his madness and his end with some understanding and acceptance.Indeed this is one of Denzel Washington's excellent-steadyperformance. His stare, his goove, his move, indeed casting himin this movie is the best thing the producer have done. And for Ethan Hawke, okay, he's there the way he's suppose to be,the usual boyish purity and idealism. I just hope he can delivermore developing characters as he have done in Alive.As for the storyline, the basic frame is nice, and blend nicely ineveryday's violence, but the pure luck of the rookie somehow blewit up... followed with somehow-a forceful ending.Training Day starts with a realistic starts, but later ends withidealistic standard scripts... but still it's an incredible movie towatch.Highly recommended for evening movie.",,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel Does Kingsley,"I write this in the post-Oscars afterglow of Denzel Washington's victory. Pity the movie wasn't more worthy of honours on its' own.

Why do I always favour the bad guy in good & bad cop flicks?,"I rated this film 7 out of 10. I enjoyed watching it, but it isn't so great as to stick out above the rest of the films in the genre. Personally I often favour the bad guy in good vs evil flicks, and this one's no difference. Alonzo (Denzel Washington)is a real badass slick-talking-smooth-walking copper. He's got ""bad cop"" written all over him and his wrong car and clothes I liked it. And of course his counterpart Jake Hoyt(Ethan Hawk) is the obligatory goody-two-shoes rookie on his first (and only, as far Alonzo is concerned) Training Day on the job as a narc. [SOME (a wee bit) SPOILING AHEAD, SO WANNA-WATCH-AS-A-VIRGIN TYPES STOP HERE] Believe you me, Alonzo really proves to be a bad number, and of course he tries to drag Hoyt along and prevent a way back to good coppers land. And of course this will not stick in the end. I would like a film on this subject where the bad cop is less obvious and the good cop is a badass himself too. I hate the goody 2 shoes types like Hoyt, it's so, emm well, obvious and thus boring. Enough complaints, it's a good flick, lots of badass action, junkies dealers pimps and ho's, and some no go neighborhood shots! Enough pace to keep you at the edge of your seat for the 2 hours it lasts, a great killing scene and mis-en-scene and a satisfactory getting-rid-of-the-bad-character scene.

Truly scary stuff with the thrilling situations Hawke finds himself in including a very traumatic bathtub scene.

"Intense, powerful, implausible","This film starts with an excellent premise and then sprints straight out into left field, makes a right turn at incredible and lands somewhere between absurd and ridiculous.  Actually, I enjoyed the film, but this day of mayhem and corruption is so far from believable that it diminishes the film's value.One of the most important factors in a good cop film is realism.  It requires not just realistic guns, explosions and car chases, but realistic and authentic characters and a plausible story.  In this film, almost all the characters are way over the top.  Rookie director Antoine Fuqua brings great intensity to each frame from his music video experience, and most scenes have an imposing power that grabs the viewer and chokes off his air supply.  However, Fuqua's failing in this film is that of excess.  There are no moments of calm to create contrast.  The film is all storm.  It is well done, but exhausting.Denzel Washington is a great actor.  I say this without hesitation. However, this is nowhere near his best performance.  He was far better in both `Hurricane' and `Malcom X'.  He was robbed in 1993 when the best actor award went to Al Pacino for `Scent of a Woman' instead of going to him for his performance in `Malcolm X'.  In `Training Day', Washington tries far too hard to be bad.  He overacts in spots and he is so intent on being forceful that he neglects character nuances, normally his greatest strength as an actor.  So, while I consider this to be a strong performance by any other standard, comparing Denzel to Denzel, this performance is just slightly above average.  This year, Russell Crowe got robbed.  However, Crowe won it last year despite the fact that both Ed Harris and Geoffrey Rush gave better performances.  What goes around comes around, I suppose.Ethan Hawke was also nominated for his supporting role as Jake, and it was a nomination that was well deserved.  This is the strongest performance I can remember from Hawke.  His is the most credible and nuanced performance in the film, despite being in Washington's shadow.  He is helped, of course, by the fact that the character is the only one that is anything like a real person in the entire film.This is a vigorous film that never lets up.  The action and the psychological tension are first rate.  It is just too overblown to be real. And to be great, cop stories need to be real.  I rated it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Takes you for a neat ride... and then keeps going when it should have stopped.,"*** o/o **** ""Training Day"" is a Drama/Thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua (Bait, The Replacement Killers) and stars Oscar winner Denzel Washington (Remember the Titans, The Hurricane, Glory) and Ethan Hawke (Michael Almereyda's Hamlet, Snow Falling on Cedars, Great Expectations) It is released by Warner Bros. at a running time of 120 min.  It is rated R for brutal violence, persuasive language, drug content, and brief nudity.The basic story is as follows: Jake Hoyt (Hawke) is a husband and father who has been a cop for 18 months.  He is training to be a narcotics officer.  On his training day he is assigned to Alonzo Harris who will show him the ropes.  Alonzo at some times is bitter but at other times is fun.  But Jake is surprised when he finds out how Alonzo is corrupt and conniving.  And soon Jake is intertwined in Alonzo's plan to deliver a large sum of money after a mistake made with the Russian Mafia.First of all this movie is performance based... the script doesn't give it any oomph and neither is the direction anything special.  It is simply wonderful performances by Washington and Hawke (though Hawke will most likely be overlooked by Washington).  The movie is paced very well at the beginning with Hawke waking up and meeting Denzel... then we get the intensity point as they go from bust to bust.  There are surprisingly impressive cameos by Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray that also push the movie along.  Scott Glenn also gives a worthwhile performance as Roger, Alozo's ""supposed"" friend.  1 hr. 40 mins. in I was thinking, whoa that was one of the best endings I have ever seen!  And then the movie continued.This is the movies fatal flaw... it should have quit when it was ahead... hell, I might have given it an extra half of a star if it had ended then but it all boiled up to a rooftop jumping and then loud ending.Academy Potential: I am deeming this much too violent for the Academy to choose Denzel for a Best Actor nomination.  It's just to much of an action flick to be considered... it would be like nominating Stallone for ""Cliffhanger"".While the film has a horrible flaw... it's still enjoyable to watch the stars in brilliant performances.  So the movie isn't completely wasted, just less than expected.",,Anonymous,Crime
Welcome to the Jungle,"Training Day is a thrilling, high-octane dive into the gritty world of Los Angeles law enforcement, where corruption and crime aren't just a part of the job - they are the job. Denzel Washington delivers a performance for the ages as the morally ambiguous Detective Alonzo Harris, a cop whose code of ethics seems to have been written by the devil himself. Ethan Hawke, the rookie thrown into the deep end, navigates the urban jungle with wide-eyed confusion that makes you wonder if anyone told him this was going to be that kind of training day.The film pulses with tension, as every street corner and shady alley reveals the darker underbelly of the city. The dialogue is sharp, the atmosphere thick with danger, and the gangster energy is so strong you can almost hear the sound of gunshots and sirens echoing through the streets.

So after finally watching the movie i am writing this review. The best part about training day is that it grips you from the very first scene. It doesn't give time for you to sink in and get absorbed in the semi dark appeal of it (which at least i felt). It engages from the first scene and confuses you at various moments leaving you mystified as to what exactly will the next scene be (something i assume that every movie buff loves - unpredictability). Denzel Washington like always delivers an incredible performance. But its Ethan Hawke who stands up and delivers a performance equally good as his co-star. The story is well written and aptly portrayed. My favorite moment in the movie is the conversation of the two leads after having interrogated a woman in her house,7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Highly enjoyable let down only by being a tad predictable,"I'll start by saying I really enjoyed ""Training Day"". It was certainly one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in this first month-and-a-bit of the cinema year. I'm going to recommend it, with a little bit of caution, and here's why:Firstly big respect to Denzel Washington. Usually he's playing the underdog and we're rooting for him. He's constantly getting the nice guy role and so it's extremely refreshing to see him play the corrupt cop here. His character - Alonzo Harris - isn't necessarily evil, he's just deciding to do a delicate balance of crime and punishment. He takes freely from the scum he prosecutes and has no qualms about doing so. In playing this character Washington is allowed to show far more versatility than his works normally allow. He works well with his attitude to new rookie cop Jake Hoyt (played admirably by Ethan Hawke). Hawke wants to do well on his first day, his ""training day"" but can't stomach Harris' morale scruples. There is a great line of tension between the two that develops more as the movie progresses.It is the plot, if anything, that lets the movie sag a little. For the most part it's predictable and Ayer, at one very tense moment, uses a poorly scripted coincide to back himself out of a sudden ending. The actual end to the movie is also foreseen and, for that, is somewhat disappointing. It might have been nicer to go a different route but I guess some elements of formula must be adhered to. Having said that there's some great lines of dialogue as Harris convinces Hoyt that the way the world *really* works is not as simple as Hoyt would like to believe and that there is a certain ""survival of the fittest"" element you must follow. The cop's corruption - in particular the first middle-of-movie-3rd-act climax - is quite harrowing and sharply executed.Antoine Fuqua does a nice job of realizing the script he's working from. The fight scenes, for example, pack - pun intended - a lot of punch. You can feel the pain of the blows. The camera-work generally succeeds without having to be overly intrusive. The lighting is generally subdued even during high noon - adding to the movie's generally bleak outlook and feel and the score never over-plays any sentimental or aggressive moments.Overall I really quite enjoyed ""Training Day"" and found it a cut above the average buddy-cop flick. With some good performances, a (generally) sharp script and some fine directing I'd give it a 7.5/10 which is well above average for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel deserved the Oscar so much!!!,"Wow, what an amazing and outstanding movie! I was really looking forward to seeing it since Denzel Washington is absolutely one of my very favorite actors ever! His performance in this one was flawless and really amazing. People just don't know him in such a role and he totally convinced as the bad guy. Denzel found his match in Ethan Hawke, he also gave a stunning performance. It's not only the acting that raises this movie so far above average.

Auuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,"I can't stop thinking about this movie. Yesterday evening I rushed to the cinema because something told me I just had to see it. Whatever it was, I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL!!!!!! I was blown away in the first few minutes. Denzel Washington' performance left me speechless and a day later I still can't find the right words to use. It was as if he'd been preparing his whole life for this role, building and forming it inside his mind but in the mean time also delivering some of the better performances seen on the big screen like the one in ""Crimson Tide"" or ""Devil in a blue dress""... I think a Slovene critic said it best; The role of Alonzo Harris is Denzel's ""Scarface"", it's a role, a character, a movie that breaths in the beat of his heart and it's a role that represents a peak in his career.A movie that never ceases to amaze took me for an unforgettable ride making sure that I will never look at Mr. Washington the same again. When his name is going to be mentioned this is the role I will think of first. Kudos to Ethan Hawke as well who represented another major surprise of the movie proving that he is a good actor and that he could easily follow the tempo of his ""partner in crime"".With the amazing performances by the two actors, a story that kept me begging for more and a bunch of memorable supporting roles (Scott Glen, the surprisingly great Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Macy Gray)and a great sound track this is without a doubt the best 2001 had to offer.Denzel winning his well deserved Oscar (although Russel Crowe's performance was almost equally good) proved to be merely icing on a cake that was already amazing.My ni**a!        10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Street Justice,"With his hopes for one day making detective firmly in mind, a young Los Angeles cop by the name of ""Jake Hoyt"" (Ethan Hawke) is excited about his new transfer to the narcotics division. To assist in his training he is accompanied by the man in charge of the division, ""Detective Alonzo Harris"" (Denzel Washington) who shows him the ropes for the first 24 hours. During this time he quickly learns that the rules he has been taught at the police academy do not apply and that his life is in jeopardy if he fails to adapt. He also learns that there is another sort of justice other than that rendered by the courts-street justice. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was movie offers a no-holds-barred glimpse at the ""war on drugs"" and gang activity from the perspective of those living in the eye of the storm--and it isn't very pretty. The movie, on the other hand, was certainly entertaining enough with Denzel Washington performing in an excellent manner as did Ethan Hawke to a lesser extent. That said, I have rated the movie accordingly. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Films dont get any better than this. 10 out of 10,"I have been so looking forward to watching Taining Day because of the accolades that it has recieved both about the film and the acting and having watched it they are fully justified.

The story is fairly simple it is about a rookie who is on his first day on the department and unluckily has Denzil Washington as his boss who is a corrupt cop. Thw acting is as good as acting can get. Denzil Washington is fantastic and quite rightly recieved an oscar nomination but Ethan Hawke deserves compliments too. this is by far his best acting roll and quite frankly things can't get any better.

"This movie is great. Even with its ""Hollywoodness""","Soo many critics of this film have talked about its plot holes and unexplained events, and its over-the-top action. First off, in my opinion, there were few of these flaws in the movie. I admit there were a few but no movie is perfect. I have watched the movie three times, not because it was the best movie I have ever seen, but to look for these giant holes in the plot and to watch the over the top action scenes. Nothing I saw and noted was that big of a deal to throw the whole movie into the crap pile which is what many people have done. I guess a lot of people don't realize that when these blockbuster movies are created it's not for the people who will look into every nook and cranny of the story and dialogue to find some piece of imperfection. They write it for the average movie go'er. This average movie go'er isn't there to look for the flaws they are there to, in a sense, be put into this movie.If Ethan Hawke hadn't been beating so badly that he couldn't get up and fight back then the next scene of him being hauled off to the hospital would really make the movie less interesting. On the other side if he hadn't received those brutal beatings then his fighting back wouldn't be as enjoyable. Thats what people want to see a glorious fight back, or a tragic fall. In providing the audience with this the writer has to make some adjustments to reality.  Maybe the streets of LA are not correctly portrayed and maybe the way the they went about their police business isn't all realistic, but without these tweaks it wouldn't be a good in your face cop movie. I mean reality can't always be as entertaining as Training Day was.Reading over this I kind of rant, its late and I should be asleep. I hope some who read this can see my point.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

I guess the planet where many of the crap movies that have won in the past [read: Shakespeare in Love] were able to win.

If the academy felt that Denzel Washington deserved an oscar, couldn't they have picked a better vehicle? I'm sure he's done better. Or perhaps a better actor for the oscar entirely -- what about Morgan Freeman, Samuel L. Jackson, or even Will Smith?This movie is definitely worth seeing, it has many interesting plot twists and is entertaining, but not better than the thousands of other [action] movies that were out last year.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Hawke, as Jake Hoyt, becomes the only one of the rookie cops to take a stand against Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington), and a helluva stand he takes, too.This is a powerful movie, unequalled by any other new videos I have seen.

For me, that says a lot (just read some of my other recent reviews). And isn't being entertained what counts?Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington are both superb in their roles, and are instantly beleivable as the naive beat cop and the veteran narcotics detective. Hawke questions Washington's over-the-line methods at every turn, only to be faced with the effectiveness of those methods.

It's thought-provoking and disturbing.Denzel Washington won the best actor Oscar for this, and I can see why--he's utterly mesmerizing as Alonzo, the senior street narc. He's Satan in gangsta clothes: charming, sexy, seductive, manipulative, and larger than life. Ethan Hawke deserves credit for holding his own with Washington; a lot of other actors would have been blown off the screen, but we keep identifying with Hawke's ingenue Jake right up to the end of the film.

Grabbed my attention & never let go...,"This film really got to me like no movie has in a long time.  After about the first hour, I was on the edge of my seat and absolutely glued to the screen.  The ending was somewhat weak like has been commented here before, but I'm not sure I could have taken another moment of intensity... I was 'in' the picture and lost to the world like nothing in a very long time. You could have grabbed a sample of my blood and come up with nothing but pure adrenaline.Part of the reason might be a past history with a bit of street background in it (yes, I've met lowlifes although nothing as bad as portrayed here)... this brought up the atmosphere of some remembered horrors, and by the end of the film my heart was palpitating and I was physically choking.  I went into this film with no 'prior knowledge' whatsoever (as a rookie), and it might have been a near heart attack for this over-35 guy... next time I'll read up on the plot a bit first.For the average moviegoer, the realism may not jump out too much... if you've ever been on the streets sometime in recent memory (even briefly, and not necessarily in LA), this film is like spreading drugs out in front of a former junkie -- not pleasant, but try tearing your eyes away.  And Denzel... was truly a surprise.  I've never been too impressed by his somewhat wooden acting, but his 'moment' toward the end is up there with the best rant-fests I've seen from Al Pacino.

"""Training Day:"" The Film Is A Powerhouse!","Denzel Washington's best acting performance since....""Glory."" No haahahhaha! I was just kidding! You thought that I was going to fall into that Oscar trap, huh? No, really, ""Glory"" was an excellent film, but between the time span of ""Glory"" (1989) and ""Training Day,"" (2001) twelve years if my mathematics are not failing me, Washington has done other top-notch films, namely ""Devil In A Blue Dress,"" (1994) ""He Got Game,"" (1998) ""The Siege,"" (also 1998) and ""The Hurricane"" (1999). This film just happens to have Washington as a completely wicked cop. To me, this film contained one of Denzel Washington's top-notch performances as villain F.E.S. Detective-Sergeant Alonzo Harris. Washington is completely wicked as he double-crosses everybody he knows to get the job done and then some. He holds nothing back. This film has heart, emotion, and adrenaline. It has something, a majestic quality, that Tony Scott's mean, tough ""Man on Fire"" (2004) tried to capture, but not quite as successfully. An incredible Oscar-nominated performance also for Ethan Hawke, who unfortunately lost to Jim Broadbent in ""Iris"" (2001). Probably most people Antoine Fuqua's best film to date, edging out ""Tears of the Sun"" (2003) and ""King Arthur"" (2004).

Jon Monsarrat review:  deep & fascinating action film,"""Training Day"" is either a drama or an action story -- you can take the film for either, which is good because as an action film buff I normally don't get into dramas -- too arty, with melodrama bits that bore me, or overly subtle. Fortunately, Training Day avoids both extremes, being a fascinating police story with outstanding performances that won Ethan Hawke an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and Denzel Washington the Oscar for Best Actor.The story is gritty and real-world, with an ""edge"" that avoids campy entirely. Although it's quite violent, they avoid serious gore. And although the premise of the story is not new (what premise is?), how it's played out, especially at the ending, is original and satisfying. The film has both more drama and more action than the recent spate of Robert DeNiro drama / thrillers, including ""Heat"", which is similar.Who should see this film:-- Action film buffs, even if you hate dramas, even if youare only happy when stuff is blowing up constantly-- Drama / arty types, unless you are turned off by what isperhaps one notch too much violence (less than ""The Professional"" aka ""Leon"" (1994)).-- non-action film types who might see one action film everyso often, and have maybe heard about ""training day"",with the same caveat about violence.I'll give ""Training Day"" an excellent 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Excellent display of corruption.,"Training Day is a the perfect example of corruption, violence, and drug dealing issues inside police.Alonso Harris is a character that will be always remembered for it's realism; people like him sadly exist. Is it for low incomes? Is it for the desire of power? ""Training Day"" perfectly explains Alonso's behavior through many violent scenes that not necessarily deal with phyiscal violence, but also with drug abuse, corruption, sexual matters, and also display situations that start with home.The movie is very intelligent because through Ethan Hawke's character we learn that not every single cop member is the same; in fact, the good cops follow a long hard road before becoming corrupt and more. Through his character, we learn that not only good intentions are needed to fight against crime...So ""Training Day"" is in my opinion one of the best cop movies ever made because it doesn't follow the typical ""cop features"" and goes further and insert sub-plots that satisfy the new millennium tendencies.Please watch Denzel Washington's extraordinary performance.

What was the point of this movie?,"The viewer is supposed to believe that all of these events took place in a 24-hour period. If I believed that the cops in my area pulled that much stuff in one year then I would want to have them run out of town on a rail. Worse, we are not given any strong reasons for the characters doing what they did. It was like ""let's make a dirty cop movie and throw in all of the ugliness that we can"" and the plot went no further than that.I kept waiting for something redeeming to happen in this movie and it never happened. It was an ugly, obscenity-laced piece of garbage that presented black cops in a negative stereotypical light. All it did was further the glamorized hip-hop gangsta lifestyle and pound another nail into some poor viewer's coffin. I usually like Denzel Washington, but in this film I felt ashamed for him. I originally gave it a four, but I'm changing it to a one, now that I've had the chance to think about it.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Rubbish,"I can't believe that Denzel Washington won a Oscar for his hammy, over the top, ridiculous, over the top performance where he practically chewed the scenery.
He probably only got it because he didn't get it for John Q, and Hollywood got accused of racism, so they handed him an award, regardless of the fact that his acting almost made this movie a comedy.
I don't remember much about the movie itself, because I kept being distracted from the actual movie by noticing the terrible acting by Washington instead.

Amazing...,"""Training Day"" is a Crime - Thriller movie in which we follow a rookie police officer with a detective on his first day in Los Angeles. Narcotics, prostitutes and violence come in front and everything change as more information reveal the truth.I liked this movie very much because it had an interesting plot that contained some plot twists I did not expect and the direction which was made by Antoine Fuqua was very good. He succeeded on presenting his main characters very well and at the same time he created a mystery behind the plot accompanied with suspense and action. The interpretations of Denzel Washington who played as Alonzo and Ethan Hawke who played as Jake were absolutely amazing and their combination created this result. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Training Day"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Death, Deception, Drugs and Debt.","After 18 years, I had to watch this again. Denzel's performance is witty, promiscuous and very convincing! Ethan, alongside him, just adds to how diverse a roll he can play. From start to finish your met with complete un-predictablility, action and drama. This dialogue is a true reflection of the location and more importantly it never losses it's substance. You will be entertained even when there's no action involved. You'll constantly be glued to the screen and asking yourselfwhat's gonna happen next!?The storyline is absolutely satisfying, especially when the plot thickens. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, or you thought you knew what's gonna happen next, that's when the direction and momentum of the film changes direction without altering away from the main plot. Everything is connected.A cop over-run by his own egotistical attitude, and self-consuming power, and another with a heart of gold. The contrasting relationship between the two is far from lacklustre!Great film, script, sound-track, and shooting from the camera team. A great all round effort in capturing the intensity portrayed by Denzel and the supporting actors/ actresses.Death, deception, drugs and debt, and not necessarily in that order, the theme is a recipe for filming success.

This movie is magnificent!!!,"Denzel is the devil himself. Deservedly won the oscar. I think it's the only movie where I've seen him play the bad guy and he has fun with the role like it's his very last. Its almost as if the producers of The Shield based their tv show off this film as Vic Mackey is kind of like the tv version of Alonzo Harris - Alonzo is sexy, charming, slick, intelligent and cunning. Denzel is so likeable despite being such a scumbag of a character that you almost want to see him get away with it all. You can also see how a good man in the police force can become corrupt - the temptation to make ridiculous amounts of illegal money is presented in front of cops daily in the form of drug and cash seizures - Alonzo could have begun his career just like Jake - naive and idealistic but over time could have easily given himself over to temptation - cops need to make a living and sometimes that living can easily outweigh the salaries they make.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A masterpiece action thriller (it's not real life bruh),"So many people almost offended by the ""that's impossible"" scenes from this movie just can't enjoy things.At no point I ever thought ""oh this is like real life but onscreen and the director is denouncing police corruption"".It is very obvious, intended by the director/writer or not, that the movie USES real life problems (corruption at every level, starting for the street drug dealers and ending in the judicial system that benefits from it), and like many other great fun movies puts it all together to create and intoxicatingly fun ride of a movie.The fact that Washington, Scott Glenn and the supporting cast gives the characters that much charisma just makes it better, perfect.Some people are bothered by the ending not being realistic enough and too ""happy"" or something like that.

"Impressive, immense impact from Washington...","I stumbled across this amazing film not expecting anything special. But I was completely blown away by the content and theme of this. Only being revolved around two guys, Washington and Hawke. Washington being the so called mentor for the newbie Hawke. Though as a rookie would expect everything to be by the book and to only follow orders he is completely confused and unaware of what Washingtons true methods are. Methods of violence and brutality against criminals unorthodoxed. To be smarter and more cunning than any criminal they fight against is whats become of Washington.Their 24 hour ordeal is action packed thriller with an amazing performance by Washington and truly worthy of an Oscar. His portrayal of a cop gone completely insane with his credibility of being a ""someone"" important and big is truly impressive. There's a unique sense of portrayal of the character from Washington. The scene with the Mexican gangsters is thrilling at the same time this movie gave a feel of realism in connection to the present world.Denzel stepping out of his usual goodie good role at the same time playing it with intensity and command.

Meaninglessness of Life,"In ""Training Days,"" I see life is meaningless and meaningless. What does Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) ""gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun"" (Ecclesiastes 1:3)? In the movie, I see everything is meaningless. Harris was chasing after the wind (1:14). Harris thought that he was the wise man and he must die. And he is forgotten too quickly. Life is like that. But in the Infinite, we find meaning and enjoyment in life. We are simply satisfied when we eat and drink. That's the gift of God. (3:13) Harris was wise in a sense, but he is foolish in God's eyes. Harris didn't seem to enjoy his work, and he looked sad all the time, even when he did smile. Solomon said, ""There is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work"" (3:22). Who is like the wise man? I think Hoyt was the wise man. His wisdom ""brightens a man's face and changes its hard appearance"" (8:1). His wise work saved himself. His saving work of Smiley's cousin changed the hardened heart of a Latino gangster. Hoyt was the one who really enjoyed his work as a policeman.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Training Day makes The Departed seem like a walk in the park,"Talking about defining rolls, try watching Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke in this highly unorthodox crime feature. What starts as your everyday police drama with the trained cop (Washington) showing the new rookie (Hawke) some bad ass moves, fastly turns into a nightmarish all-night experience as we learn more and more about the true nature of Washington's character. Hawke triumphs as the accidental hero of the movie, who is thrust into talking his way out of near-death situations and learns how to survive the crooked streets fast. The final 15 minutes of the movie are some of the more intense and violent cinematic experience I sat through in recent years.

Cynical crime drama,"TRAINING DAYAspect ratio: 2.39:1 (J-D-C Scope)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSA rookie police officer (Ethan Hawke) joins an elite undercover drugs squad and is partnered with an older cop (Denzel Washington) who turns out to be just as corrupt and dangerous as any lowlife criminal.Antoine Fuqua's cynical crime drama features an award-winning performance by Denzel ('Gimme an Oscar') Washington as the crooked cop who believes in breaking the law to enforce the law (""To protect sheep, you gotta catch the wolf - and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf!""), and whose methods are tacitly approved by his bloated, cynical superiors. Clearly inspired by recent events within the LAPD, TRAINING DAY is told from Hawke's point of view, allowing the audience to share in his escalating sense of outrage, until he's finally tipped over the edge by a monstrous betrayal of trust. But, like any number of exploitation movies before it (even those as polished and presentable as this one), TRAINING DAY is conservative in thought and deed: Washington is sexy, dynamic and evil to the bone, and the movie wallows in his decadence before concluding with an audience-pleasing showdown between Good and Evil. The movie is dramatic and watchable, but it's also trite and superficial, and it leaves a bitter aftertaste.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Yes, Denzel was at his usual best but Ethan Hawke stole the show in my book.  Considering his previous movies where he played characters who would have been better portrayed sleeping than speaking (Hamlet, Snow Falling on Cedars, movies I didn't want to see in the first place), Ethan Hawke did a wonderful job as the moral guy.  I have a greater respect for him now.  And let's not forget Denzel.  I'm surprised he doesn't have half a dozen Oscars.  But what does the Academy know anyway?

This is not your average cop duo flick - this is better!,"I went into this film relatively cold and was really enticed to go and see Denzil Washington playing against type. What I was treated to was a very good film.It wouldn't surprise me if Washington was nominated for an Oscar in his role here as Olonzo, a Narcotics cop who is just a little bent. What? A bent cop? Surely not! Oh yes. There are loads of them in this film, and Olonzo is the most cunning, ruthless and fast talking one to be had!The film's events all take place on Jake's (Ethan Hawke) training day. He wants to be on the aforementioned Narcotics team. He is very naive though, Olonzo shows him what it's really like to be on the streets etc. and things get a little bit dodgy to say the least.Good plot structure and two very confident performance's - especially Washington, he is ELECTRIC on screen - make this a great thriller to watch. Hawke puts in a great performance (not a big fan of him, but this film might just make me see his other films!). The film also boasts some nice performances from Dr Dre, Macy Gray, and Scott Glenn too.So, go and watch this film, and be treated to something that although does follow the rule book as far as thriller's go, but also bends the rules to achieve a nice twist to the story.9/10Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tremendous Acting!!!!!!!,"Is this really the way things are?  Does it have to be like this?  These were some of the questions that I asked myself as Alonzo (played by Denzel Washington) explained his brutally harsh behavior to his young drug-unit recruit, Hoyt (played by Ethan Hawke).  What a wonderful performance by Mr. Washington.  He has been truly intense in many other movies but I personally feel that he stepped it up a notch while playing this character.  I thoroughly believed that Denzel was Alonzo.  This feat, not to be confused with great storyline, developement of characters, and other movie characteristics, is not acheived by all actors.  Robert Dinero, Al Pacino, and a few of the other great actors have at least displayed this skill once or twice in their careers.   If you can understand the difference between overly-hyped Tom Cruise and the actors that I have listed, then we see eye to eye. The intensity with which Denzel delivered his lines in this movie makes it a must see for any inspiring actor that wants to one day be a leading man. As Ethan Hawke stated on David Letterman, Denzel Washington is one of the best leading men in Hollywood, and I personally concur.  Highly recommended for serious crime-drama fans.  Watch language for young children though.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of my favorite Denzel characters of all time....great movie!,"I loved Denzel's character in this movie at first.  It wasn't until near the end that he started to become tiresome.  This movie just adds to the huge resume of Denzel that shows his versatility to play so many different characters.  It is unbelievable that he is the same guy who played in The Hurricane and Remember the Titans.  This guy can act, and this movie is no exception.Ethan Hawke did an excellent job as well, but Denzel is who made this movie so good.  Together though, they were superb!My only gripe about this movie is that everything happens in one day. Jake (Hawke) meets with Alonzo (Washington) one morning on a ""training day"" to see if Jake is cut out to handle his new job as an undercover narcotics officer.  Jake has a laid back, shy and almost sheltered personality while Alonzo is completely over the top and in your face.  The things that happen in this one day are things that probably wouldn't happen in an entire career for most people.  However it is Hollywood, so what do ya expect?Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the movie.  There were many scenes which made you laugh, others which made you say wow, and then there were the ones which made you say ""yea right"".  However, even my girlfriend (who was expecting it to totally bomb) said she enjoyed it.For a cop movie, it is very original and realistic in that it takes place right in L.A., no fabricated neighborhoods were used here.  However, it does start to stray from the realistic aspect as the movie draws on, which is why I only gave it a 9 out of 10.

Surprisingly A Fine Tuned Training!,"November 12, 2001 was the day I saw the intensity-filled `Training Day'. Here is how my `Training Day' went:3:30 p.m.- Since it was `Veterans Day' I knew I had some free time to see a matinee. Usually I see romantic-comedies during matinees, so I had not been trained in the action genre that is `Training Day' during this mid-time of the day.4: 13 p.m.- I decided on `Training Day' because of the buzz on Denzel Washington's virtuosos performance as a crooked L.A. cop. So I got up my gear (my movie watcher discount card, my popcorn money, and my glasses) and was ready to be trained.4: 45 p.m.- My training began a little rough when I saw the long line outside the movie theatre waiting to get their tickets. I knew now I was not in this alone.5: 13 p.m.- I now started my neck-stretching warm-up exercise regime as I notice that the only vacant seats left in the cinema room were the ones in the front row.5:45 p.m.- My official training started in the `advertising department' when I saw the trailers of some upcoming yet-to-be-released films.6: 00 p.m.- 7:00 p.m.- During this time, my training moved into the `public relations department' when I was able to notice that the film was very intense and very well-crafted. It had substance that the viewing public, especially those that live in the inner city, could relate to.7:01 p.m.- 8: 15 p.m.- My training ended in the ` motion picture elite department'. Because after watching this immensely entertaining intelligent film, I knew that it belonged in the elite films of 2001. Academy voters should be put on probation if they do not nominate Denzel for a Best Actor Oscar. Ethan Hawke, who plays the rookie cop who gets manipulated by Denzel's character, was surprisingly good in this type of film for him. However, it was Antonio Fuqua's manipulative direction that was one of the most unpredictable aspects of the film.8:30 p.m.- My `training day' had ended!

Sure, Denzel's character (Alonzo) has worked himself into a bind, and time is running out for him, so he has to act quickly and cunningly.

The movie gets nowhere boring or slow and has tons of surprising plot twist that make the story very interesting and even tense multiple times throughout the movie.The power of the movie is in Denzel Washington's Oscar worthy performance and the chemistry between the two main characters. Denzel Washington is perfect as ""bad guy"" and delivers his lines in a most amazing way. His lines sometimes seem to come straight out of a Quentin Tarantino movie.

"""The realness"" indeed","We've all seen the corrupt cop flick done before, and done well.  But it is not so often that we get much more than the standard good cop/bad cop affair.  Training Day often goes beyond the limits of Hollywood with its careful dissection of the moral and ethical dilemma cops face when dealing with ""the streets"" while still remaining a Hollywood flick.What works so well is the combination of faced paced drama that we and our Rookie cop, Ethan Hawke, are thrown into and the intellectual debate that rages today over ""the streets"" and ""what to do about it.""  Hawke's ethics relate closely to that of MLK while Washington takes more of Malcom X's position (fittingly so).Denzel's character may be corrupt now, but the film hints at a change from earlier views, almost as if ""the streets"" showed him that there was no other way of functioning as an effective Narc.  Understanding the value of being ""real,"" he believes to be most important in getting things done.  A ""naive, wanna save the world"" rookie cop, in his mind, ain't gonna cut it out there. And he tries to get Hawke's character to understand his views.  But while this is happening we are then shown how by being so closely related to ""the streets,"" and even living there, what it has done to him.Who is more right in dealing with ""the streets,"" Hawke or Washington?There we have the foundation for the story.We are pretty much thrown into Ethan Hawke's position of constant wonderment of Washington's character.  And for the most part it works.  Is this how things get done?  Can one be a ""good"" cop and be effective?  Is there no hope for the victims of the situation?And the dilemma plays on to a fast beat.  Very good stuff.The only surprise was where was all of the hip-hop music from the soundtrack?  the moody score was effective, but they could have added more than one or two tracks from the soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

As I'm sure many other people than I have felt going to see it, I thought it would be horrible. When the first 10 minutes or so went by, I could tell it would AT LEAST be entertaining. When the story began to unfold, I was actually into the movie.The character development in this movie is great. Denzel Washington played a great anti-hero and I would not be surprised if he won some awards for his performance. Ethan Hawke also played an immensely convincing role.The director, perhaps, was the best part of the movie. Fuqua has a magnificent eye for setting up scenes. The drug hallucination part was a brilliant way of showing it.I gave this film 8/10! If you have a chance and you like action and good plots, GO SEE IT!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wow.,"First off, Training Day should have been rated NC-17. I was not prepared for the violence, language or subject matter of this movie. That said, this movie blew me away. If there was ever any question of Denzel's acting ability, the question is now definitely answered. Denzel was simply brilliant in this role.Training Day is about a young cop who wants to join an elite drug-fighting task force in the worst way. But before he joins he has to prove himself to the task force leader, Denzel. Unfortunately, Denzel has been is the drug war for too long, and has gotten himself into some trouble. Denzel then uses the young cop to help get him out of trouble.Honestly, the plot is not what impressed me with this film. In fact, I found the plot to be disturbing. But, Washington's performance was the best I've seen in a cop film in many, many years. So, while I can't recommend the film due to its hardcore content, I must admit that Denzel delivers in a big way. He is truly one of the elite actors in movies today.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
amazed,"I'm amazed to see so many comments here, based purely on moral opinions and disliking of street language. Maybe those commentators should ask themselves why they see a movie? Just to hear words that no one in the real world is speaking? First look at the performances, which are great, not only by Denzel, but by Ethan Hawke too. Movies are not made to be judged morally, they should be judged on their artistic qualities. And the films' qualities are evident: good acting, unexpected plot turns and impressive camera-work, half the movie being filmed from inside the black Monte Carlo. It bears thriller and action components, which are both believable and do not stand in the way. It's enough to convince me.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the few films where Ethan Hawke gives a stellar performance,"I had my hopes up when I went to see Training Day opening weekend. Thank god it didn't let me down. In fact, I was more impressed than I expected. Denzel Washington gives an amazing performance as a rogue cop who tries to recruit another. For a second, think back to Washington's Oscar-winning performance in Glory, and compare it to this film. Washington plays a great bad good guy. In Glory, he plays a racist black soldier for the Union, who eventually comes around and loses his prejudice. In Training Day, he plays nearly the same role, a disillusioned cop who makes the system and his role as an undercover narcotics cop work in his favor. However, in Training Day, he does not come to his senses. The contrast and conflict between Hawke and Washington is stellar, and the action and suspense is unbelievable. This is a must see for anyone who likes cop/military action movies. Don't miss it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Bad cop, good cop, violence.","This movie can be summarised by: bad cop, good cop, violence. There is nothing more, nothing deeper, nothing exciting, nothing new. It is not the first movie about bad cops doing bad things and getting punished. It's not the first movie about black & white cops either. Let's hope it will be the last.There is nothing to say about the acting. Both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke are playing very well, but the movie never really kicks off and the end is predictable. The movie compensates its poor scenario by a wave of violence and insults. If the US are really like that then it is difficult to understand why anybody would like to immigrate over there. What comes out of the movie is not so much the fact that the nice cop wins but more how poor and miserable the US are. Indeed, not only is the movie showing drugs, violence, alcohol, etc. but it also reveals that 99.9% of Americans are only interested in money. I guess the 'happy end' part shows that there is 0.1% that are above corruption and bribery.A dead boring violent movie that is best to avoid unless you are into this kind of low level scenario.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel deserved the Oscar,"I've heard many complaints about Denzel Wahsington not deserving the Oscar, and quite frankly I'm sick of it. Denzel Washington gives a solid performance in his role as Alonzo Harris. Most viewers aren't used to seeing him in bad guy roles where he's the one everyone's rooting against. He pulls off the performance amazingly, and when I watched the film I was just shocked.Not only was Denzel's performance great Ethan Hawke's character Officer Hoyt was also well written. Ethan and Denzel had a kind of chemistry during the shooting of the film that was just excellent. (especially the sheep and the wolves speech) Training day is just a great film, which tells the uncensored story of a officer trying to learn the ropes of his job. The movie falls into the three act structure perfectly. That's pretty cool sense the movie takes place in a single day.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Superb performance by Denzel Washington,The movie is strong and has great actors in it.  The script is realistic and keeps you bound all the time.  But by far the performance of Denzel Washington is extraordinary.  Denzel should have gotten the Oscar last time but he deserves it again.,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
intense intense intense,"in a year of very dull movies, i would have to say this is one of my favorites by far. though it met with some bad criticism, i felt this film really delivered. the acting was absolutely stellar, denzel washington deserves an oscar, hands down. on top of that, the script is great. i was on the edge of my seat til the very end. i dont know what the critics who badmouthed this one were expecting, but training day stands out like a diamond in the rough this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel Washington At His Finest,"The story is a bit far-fetched (seems to me that an awful lot happens in just one day - police life really is exciting!) but this movie is worth watching even if it's only to see Denzel Washington put on an unforgettable performance. Washington is, in my opinion, one of the finest actors in Hollywood today. This may not be his best performance (""Glory"" and ""Philadelphia"" come to mind) but it's unforgettable because it shows his versatility. Washington generally plays ""good guy"" roles; here he's the corrupt LAPD narcotics officer Alonzo Harris, who recruits Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) to his squad only to set him up in a scheme he has to pay back Russian mobsters to whom he owes money.Washington's Harris comes across as believably ruthless (""the devil incarnate"" my wife called him at one point.) Harris and Hawke made a great team. They seemed to have a chemistry and I hope they work together again. The movie is chock full of action and you definitely will not be bored. It contains a lot of language, but surprisingly little nudity or sexual content, focusing instead on the story itself.Watch this. You will definitely enjoy it. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
