Wonderful Social Classic That Echoes Issues of Its Day...,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is presented like a play in three acts. It is also from the children's perspective. Through the kids, we find that racism is a learned attitude or feeling. We also see a delightful coming of age drama as the young kids realize that there is no Boogeyman down the street and their father is capable of doing a lot more than they think. The great Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a pillar of nobility, social conscience, and, rare for 1930's Americana, a single parent. Peck is such a strong presence, you believe everything about him. It is something you can compare to America's trust in TV anchorman Walter Cronkite. We always took his word for it.Act one puts Atticus in the background and allows the kids to flourish. Director Robert Mulligan was able to get such realistic performances from non-professional kids. They are amusing and fun to watch. The big mystery lies in the house down the street in this small Georgia town. Who is the monstrous, ""6 and a half feet big"" legend living in the end house? Some light suspense ensues, while the buildup to a stirring act two is happening. Atticus must defend an African-American man for the alleged rape of a white woman.After threats galore, an unshaken Peck takes to the courtroom jungle in, without a doubt, one of the top 5 court scenes in motion picture history. Brock Peters lends the film its best moments as the accused ""negro"" on trial. This man has a face chiseled with suffering and deep, deep sorrow. We know Atticus is a good man, a decent human being with a soul. He sees this in his client as well, and in a closing argument that must have roused the civil rights movement, implores the jury to vote justice. An all-male, all-white jury in the 1930's were tough listeners. Peters' breakdown on the stand is one of the most realistic, emotionally saddening moments you'll ever see, especially in Hollywood films of the 1960's. The scene when Peck leaves the courtroom is now legendary as well.Act three produces a tragic death, an unlikely hero, and the bringing together of a family. The filmmakers have such a passion for the material, they seem to handle it with gentleness. Racism is a hard-boiled subject and it is depicted and dealt with through grace and patience. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD poses the injustice of race relations in the 1930's as a front for the events happening in the 1960's. The film came out during turbulent times and was also an adaption of a literary classic. I am one to judge a film solely by film only. The book is a separate art form and should not be compared to the film, an art form itself. It is important, it is enlightening, and it has not aged. Watch it.RATING: 9 of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Perpetually Outstanding...,"It's a story that's riven with themes, of prejudice, hate, broken dreams, there's courage and caring, there's taunting and daring, growing up, finding out what life means. At its heart you'll find Atticus Finch, defends a man most town folk want to lynch, no evidence in play, to support what they say, but they're adamant and won't move an inch. Scout and Jem watch these awful events, through child's eyes losing their innocence, in a world that's gone mad, it makes you so sad, but there's hope that leaves some recompense. Plus there's Boo, who defies more perceptions, all shrouded in cloaked misconceptions, hidden from view, most people eschew, but a saviour, and a child's revelation.As good as it gets.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
It does the book justice.,"After studying the outstanding book of To Kill A Mockingbird at school, I viewed this film, and was on the whole very impressed. Scout and Jem are portrayed brilliantly, considering the ages of the children who played them, and they, as with everything else in the production, are true to the book's spirit. Gregory Peck is perfect as the unflappable Atticus Finch, and deserved his Oscar. The music is worthy of praise, especially for the climatic scene, and the raw emotion and feeling of the book is amply conveyed. All of the cast are well cast, and it's interesting to ponder how much this film, at the time, would've shocked. That the book explores racism and outsiders in a southern town, through the eyes of a child is genius and works very nicely here. The only problems are minor- much of the book's counter-balancing humour was left out, certain characters are omitted (Dolphus Raymond and Aunt Alexandra), and some of the book's early characterisation is missed. Aside from these gripes, this is a magical film and a ""must-see,"" as a companion piece to the classic novel. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the most important films of all time,"To Kill a Mockingbird is the movie based on the Harper Lee novel of the same name about Scout, Jem and their father, Atticus Finch who is an attorney in a small southern town.  It is both a coming of age story about the children as well as a hard-hitting drama, as Atticus defends a black man who is on trial for the rape of a white woman.This review is not an easy one to write, despite the fact that I have seen this film at least 10 times.  The reason it does not come easily is that this is one of the most personally important films I have ever seen and is in my personal `Top Five of All Time'.  I'm certain there is nothing that can be said about the film that has not already been repeated a multitude of times, so I guess the best thing to do is explain why the film is so important to me.I first saw this film several years ago and was so profoundly affected by it that I immediately watched it again.  Of course, the defense of a man wrongly accused of a crime is a common story line, but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out as an exceptional example for several reasons.  Among them, the date that the film was released:  1962, on the cusp of the civil rights movement in America, and the fact that it takes place in the south in the 1930's.  It is also far from the first film to explore the experiences of children and their own personal growth, but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out because of its sheer honesty and natural performances by the child actors portraying these rich characters.But most of all, this film is special because of Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch, a true hero.  At the risk of sounding histrionic, my heart aches when I watch him on screen because he is such an incredible man, and is so inherently good.  No matter how many times I have seen this film, I smile when I see his interaction with his children, and I well with tears when I see his incredible strength of character.  (No easy feat to break through the armor of this cynical film geek who, if given the chance would remake at least a few dozen films with tragic endings.) I was sitting in my car listening to National Public Radio recently the day Gregory Peck died, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I sat and cried hearing the retrospective they offered  mainly because the man who portrayed my own personal cinematic hero was gone, but also because Peck lived his life with the same conviction as his best known role; a fact that makes Atticus Finch all the more tangible.  The American Film Institute recently named Atticus Finch the number one hero of all time, a choice I consider both brave and insightful in an age where our heroes generally either wield weapons or have super human physical strength.  Atticus Finch fights evil as well, but with his strong moral fiber and his mind.To Kill a Mockingbird is generally required reading during the course of one's education.  If you have not read it, do so.  If you have not seen the film, do so; and share it with others.  It is an exceptional film that stands the test of time and will remain an important addition to film history for as long as the genre exists.--Shelly",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Amazing film,"After hearing nothing but critical acclaim for this film, and the book it was based on, I finally got to see it. I am quite amazed at how well done this film is, and how timeless the theme is. I haven't read the book, but I'm considering it, just to see if there are any details that were left out. The story is amazing and exceptionally told. As far as I know, the film is as close to the book as it could possibly be; some call it the most accurate book-to-film conversion ever. The plot is very good, it takes a timeless problem and presents it to us, through the innocent eyes of a naive child. The pace is very good; apart from The Godfather(the first one) and one or two other exceptions, this is the only drama where there was truly not one single moment that I found dull, boring or unimportant. Nothing seemed trivial in the film. The perspective that is forced upon us is that of a young child, naive and innocent. This is a brilliant idea, as the eyes of a child is without a doubt one of the most impressionable things in the world, and the film handles this perfectly. What really makes the film, apart from the brilliant and possibly unique perspective, is the fact that the children are likable, credible and charming. You couldn't help but like them; believe me, normally I really dislike children. I find them annoying, loud and egotistical. But with this film, I couldn't, for one second, muster up any tiny amount of aggression, or even annoyance. They come off as so likable, charming, and, most importantly, *real*. Almost every kid in any Hollywood movie is either a completely ridiculous stereotype/cliché of a brat, who does nothing but destroy things around him, or the exact opposite, a little angel. Everyone knows that no child is the latter all the time, and even I will admit that there probably doesn't exist too many children who are the first, either. In this film, the children are completely real. They are naive, innocent, they disobey what their father tells them, but ultimately, they obviously love and respect their father, and they never do anything, anything at all, with the intent to hurt or harm someone or something. That is what a child is; innocent. They do what they do because they do not know better. This film provides a perfect view into their world, or, rather, their perspective of it. The acting is excellent. The child actors exceed all expectations. I was amazed at how professional and convincing they were. The other actors all give great performances as well. The cinematography is excellent; once again, it gives a perfect perspective on what your surroundings look like when you're a child. The characters are well-written, credible and well-casted. The dialog was well-written. The script was excellent. A very memorable and beautiful film, should be viewed by almost anyone. I recommend this to anyone who likes dramas, and just about anyone who for one reason or another might enjoy this. Don't be scared off by it being over forty years old, or it being black and white; it's an excellent film, and just about anyone would enjoy it. Don't miss this perfect film. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
An Unforgettable Drama,"Hoo boy, am I a sucker for courtroom dramas. The wrangling of legal points and the investigation into the truth just gets my cinematic blood pumping (I s'pose it's in response to my own dashed hopes of becoming an attorney).""To Kill a Mockingbird"" rises to the top of the pile easily.Yes, the courtroom proceedings are nail-bitingly engaging. But played out against the tapestry of bigotry and hate make the legal goings-on even more compelling.The writing here is so beautiful, so lyric, so poetic. The Harper Lee-based screenplay captures wonderfully a time and a place that are absolutely real--where big brothers could solve the universe's problems in an instant and all the treasures of the world could be contained in a cigar box.""To Kill a Mockingbird"" also contains three of the most impressive child performances I have ever witnessed--there's not a false or affected moment in any one of them. Until seeing ""Ponette,"" a movie I would highly recommend, the kids in ""Mockingbird"" received my best child performance ever awards. ""Ponette"" has ratcheted them down one notch, but that doesn't diminish the achievement here. The scene in which Scout dispels the mob simply by identifying its individual members is one of the most powerful moments in filmdom.Peck more than deserved his best actor nod. His quiet dignity is a definite asset. Brock Peters, too, is terrific in what could have been a cliched role.If you are a moviegoer who has a bias against black and white movies and who has therefore never seen ""Mockingbird,"" I pity you. You've passed on one of Hollywood's most unforgettable experiences.",,Anonymous,Crime
enough can't be said,"Enough good things can't be said about this movie.  It is undoubtedly one of the best and most moving films ever made.  No other racial injustice or discriminatory based movie can even compare with ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". This movie not only makes you sympathize with those who were being discriminated against, but also those who fought for those people.  One of the most moving parts of the movie is when Atticus Finch is leaving the court room and Reverend Sykes tells Scout to ""stand up your father is passing"".Gregory Peck has always been one of my favorite actors.  This is definitely one of my favorite roles that he has ever played, and he does an excellent job at it.  Mary Badham and Philip Alford are excellent as Jem and Scout. Mary Badham became the youngest girl to receive an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress for her role as Scout.  Although it had a short time on screen, Robert Duvall's portrayal of ""Boo"" Radley was one of his very first roles on screen and what better movie than ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" to kick off your acting career.A great movie of all times.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wonderful,"This is why I watch movies. Every once in a while I stumble upon such a masterpiece which moves me to tears, because it reminds me that, all bad things aside, there is good in all of us - we just have to help each other search for it and bring it to light.This is definitely one of the best films I've ever seen. Mary Badham is absolutely wonderful as 'Scout', and I think she deserves just as much credit as Gregory Peck for this picture.The rest of the cast are great as well, and a special mention goes to Elmer Bernstein for his delicate and so appropriate score.I love this movie and recommend it to anyone. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Our Greatest Film Hero,"When the American Film Institute polled its members and they selected Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch as the greatest hero on film ever, the selection was met with very few dissenters. I'm sure not going to argue the merits of the choice. But I do have a theory as to why.Gregory Peck for the most part played decent honorable thinking men in his films. A few films like Duel in the Sun and The Boys from Brazil have him as a villain, but the public never accepted him really in those parts.Few of us in our lives can be Horatio Hornblower or spike the Guns of Navarone or command a submarine as in On the Beach. But Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird is well within our grasp. He's a small town lawyer, raising his children as a single parent and most of all trying to lead them by example. The performances of Mary Badham and Philip Alford show the kids have learned it very well as does the uncredited narration of Kim Stanley as the grown-up Scout.Atticus Finch is a very attainable ideal. It is I believe the secret of the popularity of both the book and the film.To Kill a Mockingbird is the story of Atticus Finch and his family during the Thirties in rural Alabama. The action takes place over several months of a given year. The most important part of the film deals with Finch defending a black man for allegedly raping a white woman.It's a thankless task and Finch knows it, because he knows the attitudes of the people there, those who would make up an all white jury. Still he proceeds with courage and determination. His summation to the jury is a film classic and Peck's innate decency is nicely counterbalanced by William Windom's prosecutor who smirks through out the trial knowing he just has to play the race card to win.Other outstanding performances are Brock Peters as the man Peck is defending, James Anderson as the father of the girl he's accused of violating, and Frank Overton as the county sheriff.This film was the debut of Robert Duvall in the part of Boo Radley who plays the autistic neighbor of the Finches. No dialog at all for Duvall who conveys great and pained emotion with a series of expressions that are unforgettable. Duvall played a similar role in another Peck film, Captain Newman, MD.Gregory Peck got the Best Actor Award for 1962. He was up against some very stiff competition that year. Peck beat out Jack Lemmon for Days of Wine and Roses, Burt Lancaster for Birdman of Alcatraz, Peter O'Toole for Lawrence of Arabia and Marcello Mastroianni for Divorce Italian style.No doubt sentiment did play a part in the final award. Lemmon and Lancaster had already gotten Oscars and O'Toole and Mastroianni were relative newcomers. But I sure think the Academy selection that year has stood the test of time.This film has sure stood the same test.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A solid adaptation of a classic,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a tricky adaptation, because as with many great books, it delves deeply into several different topics and themes. Condensing the plot and themes into the shorter timeframe of a movie is always challenging, and while they definitely pull it off successfully here, I do think we see a bit more breadth than depth. They did cut several plot points and scenes which were less essential, which was necessary. Even so, we don't get to know the characters and the nuances of their relationships as much as I would like here. The movie is less about the nuanced characters and themes that the book focuses on and simply tells the compelling story of a murder trial of an innocent black man in old money Alabama. It's still well done and I enjoyed it, but one of my favorite elements of the book was seeing the world from Scout's point of view and understanding her perspective as a precocious young woman in that society. We still get a general sense of her character, but don't see as much about her relationship with Jim and how it evolves, or see much development from her across the film. We do spend plenty of time in the courtroom to understand fully what is happening in the case. It's hard to fault the writers too much, and the safe call is definitely prioritizing storytelling as they did, but as a result no other elements stood out or grabbed me. I did also find that the writing suffered a bit from a problem I also had with the novel: that the story feels a bit segmented, with a few sections that don't flow naturally into each other. Still, these are fairly minor qualms and it is a rock solid adaptation of a good story.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"An utterly moving film, made perfect by the outstanding performance of Gregory Peck. Must see","'To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of the best books ever written but this film does it justice. The performances throughout are stunning, especially that of Gregory Peck (Harper Lee was so impressed she gave him her late father's pocket watch, a prop he uses in the film, to keep). This film will make anyone think hard about how they treat others and it is really heartwarming without being soppy. It isn't necessary to have read the book before seeing this film but it might be advisable. This is one of the classic films of its generation and very few films of nowadays come close to matching it either. A real must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Recommended,"​'TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD' - 1962Directed by Robert MulliganStarring Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and Phillip AlfordPlot Overview: ​Scout Finch (Mary Badham), 6,and her older brother, Jem (Phillip Alford), live in sleepy Maycomb, Ala., spending much of their time with their friend Dill (John Megna) and spying on their reclusive and mysterious neighbour, Boo Radley (Robert Duvall). When Atticus (Gregory Peck), their widowed father and a respected lawyer, defends a black man named Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) against fabricated rape charges, the trial and tangent events expose the children to evils of racism and stereotyping.This might be a movie that I am just not understanding in the slightest. It may genuinely be a testament of cinematic perfection. But, as it stands, I was immensely disappointed by this movie. Is it a poor movie? No. Not at all. In fact, there is a portion of this movie that could stand as one of the greatest 'Acts' in Film history. But the meat surrounding this Act was very lacklustre and poor for me. I am very sad to say that 'To Kill A Mockingbird' disappointed me.But what do I actually like about it? The portion between the first half and last 20 minutes was cinematic perfection. I am serious. I won't specifically say what happens but I will say that it is literally perfect. As for the film surrounding that part, that is a different story for me, but that does not detract from the masterful film making shown my the actors and Mulligan during that sweet, sweet 40 or so minutes.I also loved Gregory Peck in this film. He delivers a heartfelt, slow and meaningful performance as Articus. You can really see a passion and intelligence lurking beneath his calm, steady and articulate demeanour. Peck well and truly deserved his Oscar for this outstanding performance.Brock Peters was also incredible in his, unfortunately, minute role as Tom Robinson. Peters and the writers do excellent jobs in creating sympathy for this character and truly showing the injustice of the situation he finds himself in. I was very disappointed that he did not at least receive an Oscar nomination for this role; it was truly excellent.Phillip Aldford was good as Jem. The character wasn't exactly likable or interesting but I do admire their attempt at giving him an arc. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Mary Badham's Scout for me. It baffles me as to how she earned an Oscar Nomination because I found her performance to be bland and very poor. And Scout as a character was also very disappointing. I mean, she wasn't likable, interesting and I fail to see a true arc for her.Another flaw that I have with this film is the very mediocre beginning and end. The middle is, as stated prior, true cinematic gold. The remainder of the film is a dull, bland, uninteresting, monotonous mess. I fail to see the brilliance in it and, while the message of the film is strong and prosperous, the execution of it was not.Then there is the very annoying ending. Maybe I am an idiot but I did not understand what was happening in the ending of this film. It was very confusing. I understand WHAT happened but I cannot fathom as to why. Perhaps my attention merely lapsed for those precious couple of seconds for the grand reveal but that doesn't change my distaste for it. That, and that man was absurdly creepy.In conclusion, I was unfortunately disappointed by 'To Kill A Mockingbird'. It's not a bad movie by any means, and when it gets it right, it gets it right. But the overall package did not live up to the expectations I had. It was a little over average and the middle on its own would achieve an easy 10/10. Despite that claim, the middle was the middle, and it had the beginning and end bogging it down. Do see this film, though. The message is very important and it features an impeccable middle and performance from Gregory Peck. Aside from that though, it was not that great. I'll rate 'To Kill A Mockingbird' 7 'Creepy Men in the Corner' out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"a ""classic"", are you serious?","I got on a kick of watching two things recently: 1) good courtroom dramas and/or 2) classics. imo this is neither.maybe way back in olden times this movie was something special but all I kept thinking was ""why are these kids in every scene?"" and ""when do we actually get to the court stuff?"" the former is apparently what the movie is about and the latter came and went before I knew it. I guess I could complain the court drama was too short but in hindsight that was actually a blessing.the afi top-10 all-time court dramas incomprehensibly has this as #1!! are you kidding me??

The Best,"Generally, I prefer to review movies I dislike, because I am better able to quantify negative opinions than positive ones, but ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" deserves a review as few other movies I have ever seen.  I probably cannot make any statement about this film that has not already been made many times, but it really is one of the most beautiful and moving films I have ever seen.I first read Harper Lee's lovely novel when I was a young teen, and it was one of those books that gave me an experience that changed the way I perceived the world and my own family.  The movie stays true to the wonderful, innocent prose.Every time I watch, I see my father in Atticus Finch.  He, too, is a southerner who respects people and defends his beliefs.  He also has always respected his children and treated us the way Atticus treats Scout and Jem. I also see other family and friends in various characters in the film, because we have such strong southern roots.  Even the negative aspects of racial antipathy and loss of childish innocence bring certain memories to mind.Those who did not grow up in the south or with southern families might not see parallels the way I do, but the movie would be a gem to anyone.  Gregory Peck put in the performance of his career, and the children acted in the least forced manner I have ever seen.  The cinematography is also beautiful, and the script is perfectly balanced-not too sparse, but also not dialogue heavy.The best thing about ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is that it preserves the spirit of the novel that resounds with so many people.  This film stands as one of the best ever arguments for tolerance, loving families, and the beauty of life through a child's eyes.  Everyone who watches movies ought to see it.",,Anonymous,Crime
A Remarkably Simple and Simply Remarkable Masterpiece!,"Very rarely, it happens that movies are made that are very simple in expression but possess monumental appeals and significant life lessons in a style only of the kind of their own that, we can't expect even. This fact is truthfully exemplified in this movie. It's not just a movie or even just a promising story in general, but all it portray's is ""Innocence"". A girl's recollection of her childhood days which are still at their full bloom in her mind, depicting the innocence of juvenile as well as as adult minds, a period where mostly immature minds become curious to the racial bigotry and sometimes mature minds become its prey and a time when harsh realities of life like intolerance, hatreds, prejudice and adversities of society gradually dawn upon them.Atticus Finch ( Gregory Peck ) is an absolutely Gentleman Lawyer whose wife has passed away and he has a son and a daughter. A Black man Tom Robinson is wrongly alleged of raping a poor white woman. In fact, he a victim of white woman's effort to hide her guilt by targeting his innocence and utilizing favors of racial attitude of unsocial society towards Negros. Finch decides to defend him on his principles realizing that the narrow minded society will turn against him and so it happened and townspeople started making his life agonizing. The whole story is masterfully out shined by the ingenuousness, purity and innocence of his children with with a unique inspirational interaction with their father.Boo Readly who lives in the town is mentally retarded and is sidelined by the society. He is a mark of fear and curiosity for children because he is different from others.

This is a deeply moving and powerful film about right and wrong seen through the eyes of children.,"I first saw this in the early 90s.Revisited it on a dvd which I own in 2009 with my kids. My 6 year old boy n 5 year old daughter was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children.Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, held a kind of mystery.My daughter kinda got scared of the character Boo.I remember she asked me to buy for her bib overalls/dungarees aft enjoying this movie.Revisited again few days back n now my kids are 13 n 12 respectively.Felt like writing a review now inspite of knowing that everything has already been said about this wonderful movie.This is one of the greatest movies of all time, indeed n one of my personal fav.The character Atticus Finch is indeed the greatest screen hero of the 20th century.The child actors are excellent and the young Mary Badham as Scout is remarkable.Mulligan's direction is flawless.

A Clear and Uncluttered Eye,"Equal parts heartwarming and heartrending, this is one of the tiny number of films that is hard to overpraise. Deep south depression-era prejudice is filtered clear and uncluttered through the eyes of white children. I watched this again on Juneteenth and its quiet, gentle impact is devastating. Peck is wonderful, of course, but the kids are incredible. Every scene is crafted by Robert Mulligan with creativity and realism. The final 20 minutes flip from harrowing to something that feels like prayer. If you saw this as a kid in 1962, you watched the story unfold with an innocent eye. As a grownup in 2020, and certainly if you have kids of your own, you'll be an emotional wreck halfway through. The film is every bit as satisfying as the book.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A film that's close to my heart,"About ten years ago, a year or so after I was married, I became quite ill and was bed-ridden for almost two weeks. I was in so much pain I could not sit on the sofa and look at television; my eyes hurt so badly from my fever that I couldn't even lie in bed and read. It was Christmas season and my husband, working in retail, worked extra long hours. With no way to entertain myself or even to sleep, the long hours spent alone were almost unbearable. Then I had an idea: I had seen that our public library had books on tape. I asked my husband if he would find something interesting for me, not having any idea what sort of ""books"" they might have. He chose To Kill a Mockingbird.I had, of course, always heard of the book but apparently it was not on our required reading list in high school. Remembering how I had loathed so many of the books I was forced to read in school, I had mixed feelings when he brought it to me. Still, I welcomed ANY distraction to help pass the time. What an absolutely wonderful book it turned out to be. (If my memory is correct, it was read by Meryl Streep. What a beautiful job she did of it!) Looking back at it now, I'm glad I got so sick that winter, or I might not have had the opportunity to ""read"" it. What a comfort it was to me during a painful, difficult time.A few years later I ran across the movie on television. I was so very pleased to see how well they translated it to film. No film ever captures EVERY facet of a book (or we'd have an awful lot of eight hour films out there!) but the book was definitely given justice. Having grown up in the deep south myself, even having myself attended segregated school and seen INTENSE prejudice amongst the privileged white upper-class, I applaud the book's writer and the film's producer all the more for producing such works during a time of indescribable social struggle and upheaval.To Kill a Mockingbird is a strong, quiet film of great dignity... qualities that are sadly lacking in almost every film made in this country today. To me though, having first come across the book in the isolation of of sickness, listening to it hour after hour in the dim light of my bedroom, watching the grey winter clouds pass by the window as I listened, it will alway be my own special, personal film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
This bird don't sing,"This much-praised movie is about a lawyer and his children living in a racially divisive South in the 1930s. Although the central theme concerns the lawyer defending a black man accused of raping a white woman, much of the film is devoted to the exploits of the children as they play games and make trouble. Therein lies the problem. Watching the children at play is only mildly interesting. The focus shifts to the rape trial for a while and then its back to the children and a weird neighbor (Duvall), who seems to be from another movie. The film is poorly constructed, lacking focus. Peck is good as Finch, who is portrayed as a decent fellow but certainly not the greatest hero in American cinema as AFI would have us believe. Considering its reputation, a very disappointing film.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
When a Book and a Movie Knock It Out of the Park,"There is something so sensitive yet intense in Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch. He is a man of great honor and true humanity. He takes it all inside, dealing with the realities of what he is facing. He ignore the threats and sees a man for a man. However, he is doomed but represents an action out of time. I was especially impressed with the children in this movie. They are not scene stealers but rather show the future if allowed to grow up. As the trial moves along, it is obvious that there is little that can be said to counteract the hate that is there. But like most of us, Atticus and look in the mirror at the end of the day and say he did what was right. Gregory Peck was a top ten actor and wandered smoothly from movies such as ""Moby Dick"" to ""The Omen."" He was masterful in psychological thrillers such as ""Spellbound."" This was, however, his finest hour. The man with the rumpled suit and the big heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Old Gray Bird Ain't What She Used To Be,"One hates to be the skunk at the garden party but this movie simply isn't as good as its reputation might suggest. It is extremely dated and calculated in ways that are now obvious but probably worked back in 1962. The dialogue has a tendency to go on for too long in almost every scene, as points are hammered home continuously, didactically, but aside from the scenes that belong only to the children the film is dramatically leaden and top heavy in what were at the time 'dangerous' and 'radical' ideas about racism and injustice (though they were fashionable in Hollywood), and frequently the movie feels like a sermon, and a self-congratulatory one at that.As the story of children growing up in the Deep South during the Depression the film works fairly well. It is beautiful visually and the photography by the underrated Russell Harlan is flawless. The performances of the actors who play the children are superb. Had the movie stuck to being their story it might have been a masterpiece. The part about the elusive, ghostly Boo Radley struck a chord, and I suspect that most of us can remember a spooky neighbor or two and the stories we used to make up about them. So far, so good. But when the black man accused of rape entered the picture a different movie emerged: preachy, obvious, self-consciously genteel about bigotry being the preserve of poor, ignorant rural folks, and above all obvious. This is when it becomes a star vehicle for Gregory Peck, who delivers an extraordinarily self-righteous summation to the jury complete with ""for the love God!"", and I stopped believing what I was watching and I began thinking about some of the shabbier Rod Serling Twilight Zones of long ago, with their 'messages' about 'little people' at the end. The film shifts into high gear in the last act, with the attack on the children, which I still find frightening, but the damage had been done, and even with Boo (blessedly) back in the story the poetic mood of the earlier parts of the movie was recaptured only fitfully, and I had a feeling of having been set-up.Some of the problem with the film is obviously the Harper Lee novel it was adapted from. Miss Lee wrote a good book but as a writer was a far cry from Faulkner or even Eudora Welty, and having reread large portions of it a few years ago I must say that it dates as badly as the movie. She was trying to do too much with her wistful story, and got her politics and poetics mixed up, and the result is an unsatisfactory stab at greatness, though I must say it's a good try. But alas she missed the mark, and so does the film. There's a good deal of sponantaneous feeling in the stuff about the kids, but when it shifts to grown-ups neither Miss Lee, director Robert Mulligan or screenwriter Horton Foote seems to know how to make things work. Suddenly the story turns moral with a vengeance. It's not easy to treat the issue of a man falsely accused of rape any other way, for sure, but it ruins the magical tone so meticulously built up in the earlier scenes. Yes, the world of childhood has as much to do with imagination as reality, and especially with imagination applied to reality as a means of interpretation, which in adults seems the preserve of artists and no one else. The move from childhood to adulthood is often tragic, as life's unpleasantries become unavoidable. Art at its best provides a respite from this as well as another way of seeing life, of feeling things differently and of thinking deeper thoughts. In art we have the opportunity to recapture at least some of the affect of childhood, but to do so with wisdom and understanding.In To Kill a Mockingbird we see a liberal take on childhood, as imagination is tranformed, in the course of the narrative, into a sense of civic responsibility. Children, mockingbirds and black folks are metamorphosed into a kind of helpless class. Only they, it seems, are truly in touch with nature, truth and the meaning of life. The adult whites are either good or bad, interesting only inasmuch as they have all the power and often use it badly. The trick, as the film implies, is to get these blinkered white grownups to appreciate the pure world of freedom and ease that the children, mockingbirds and blacks enjoy, and all will be well, or at least a whole lot better. But alas the reason the white grownups are so dull and moralistic, in good and bad ways, come from their sense of responsibility, which comes with power, and which children, mockingbirds and blacks don't have. When they do get power (viz. Lord Of the Flies) they prove as capable as adults of doing foul, nasty things. I think that Lee, Mulligan and Foote are aware of this contradiction, if only subconsciously, which is why the prevailing mood of the story is one of sadness.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Healing View of Fatherhood,"I'm surprised that there aren't more comments on Peck's amazing depiction of Atticus Finch, the father. In this era of absent fathers, preoccupied fathers, abusive fathers, immature fathers, etc, etc, Peck's Finch gives us all a soothing view of the best of fatherhood. Where else do we get to watch a man sit up with his ill child, stand firm in his convictions, show patience and gentleness with his children, demonstrate an appropriate level of humility, communicate righteous values to his children, and give his children a picture of integrity to emulate. Every time I view this film I wonder how Peck was able to pull this off. Every time I view this film, it gives me hope for the future of fatherhood.",,Anonymous,Crime
"""A Shattering Look at Innocence Lost""","To Kill a Mockingbird is more than just a film; it's a profound exploration of racial injustice, morality, and the innocence of childhood. Set in the heart of the American South during the Great Depression, the film masterfully captures the complexities of a society grappling with its darkest demons.Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch is nothing short of iconic. His character stands as a towering figure of integrity, courage, and compassion. Atticus' unwavering defense of Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of a crime, in the face of overwhelming prejudice is a testament to his moral fortitude. Peck's performance is nuanced and understated, making Atticus a truly relatable and inspiring character.The story is primarily seen through the eyes of young Scout Finch, played with precocious charm by Mary Badham. Her innocent perspective offers a poignant contrast to the harsh realities of the adult world. The film beautifully captures the wonder, curiosity, and gradual awakening to the complexities of human nature experienced by children.The trial sequence is a masterclass in tension and suspense. Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus is nothing short of iconic, his quiet dignity a powerful counterpoint to the hysteria of the courtroom. Yet, the outcome is a stark reminder of the insurmountable odds faced by Black people in the Jim Crow South.The film's true tragedy unfolds in its final act. The senseless murder of Bob Ewell, while seemingly a victory for justice, is a complex and morally ambiguous event. The revelation that Boo Radley, a mysterious recluse, is the one who saved the Finch children is both shocking and poignant. It's a testament to the darkness that can lurk beneath the surface of a seemingly quiet town.To Kill a Mockingbird is a powerful indictment of racial prejudice and the destructive force of hatred. The film's exploration of themes such as empathy, justice, and the importance of standing up for what is right remains as relevant today as it was when it was released. It is a film that challenges viewers to examine their own biases and to strive for a more just and equitable society.Director Robert Mulligan's sensitive and understated direction brings Harper Lee's beloved novel to life with stunning visual beauty and emotional depth. The film's cinematography captures the essence of the Deep South, creating a rich and atmospheric backdrop for the story.To Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. It is a film that inspires, challenges, and ultimately leaves an enduring impact on the human spirit. It is essential viewing for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of race, justice, and the human condition.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
American Classic,"Based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning book, Scout (Mary Badham) is a 6 year old girl living in Maycomb, Alabama during the 1930s. It's a tired old town life with his lawyer father Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his little brother Jem. Then Atticus takes a case to defend a black man Tom Robinson accused of raping a white teen girl Mayella Ewell. It sends the town into a frenzy which only Atticus and the innocence of Scout are able to withstand.It's an American classic. Gregory Peck exudes stature, compassion and dignity. It takes an important book and honors it with an impressive film. The trick of the movie is to look at the issue of race through the eyes of Scout. It also features Robert Duvall as the iconic Boo Radley. There is one point in the movie after the trial is over that always gets me. As Atticus walks out of the courtroom, all the black folks in the balcony stand up. Reverend Sykes tells Scout to stand. ""Miss Jean Louise. Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passing.""

Good....But overrated.,"Now i think this is a very good movie and a very good book. But just looking at the IMDb rating and the reviews, this movie is clearly overrated. I've read the book about 4 times and have seen the movie twice. Some very good things about the movie was adapting the book. It was very well adapted and stuck very true to the book. Gregory Peck did a great job as Atticus. Also Brock Peters did a very good job as Tom Robinson. Most people perform pretty well. That's not why this film is overrated. The movie when looking at it close is pretty bland. I mean the movie itself isn't that great. The movie can be slow at points, not all the characters were good (Dill and Mayella). The ending was different then the book and i liked the book ending much better. And overall the movie just didn't have anything special to offer. To sum it up perfectly. Its a good book adaptation movie (for the most part) with nothing great to offer and nothing bad either. I like it, it just doesn't deserve the praise it gets.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
This Film Opened My Eyes,"I first saw this film when I was about 10-12 yrs old. I lived in a predominantly white, large city in Canada and had no exposure at all to people that did not look like me. As a consequence, the only prejudice I saw or mildly experienced was due to national origin and accent.When I first saw this movie I remember weeping over the injustice that was so brilliantly portrayed, and since it was the late 60's I was slightly aware (I was only 12) of the ongoing turmoil in the USA so I believed what was portrayed in the film.From that until this one, I have done my best to follow MLK's dictum, paraphrased, ""content of character regardless of appearance or cultural difference"".I don't give a damn what the woke crowd thinks about this movie, but I would not hesitate to say that over the years it (and the book), has done more to change or to educate the attitudes of white people than almost any other film.How on earth is that a bad thing??",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
'Do you know what a compromise is?',"To Kill a Mockingbird is pretty famous in my household. My mom loved Gregory Peck's portrayal of the integrity-filled, honest, caring, patient father so much that she named my brother Atticus. It was a running quotation when I was growing up to say, ""Do you know what a compromise is?"" with a little Southern drawl. I know my family is one of millions who have tried to emulate Gregory Peck's clipped pronunciation of ""Scout""; that one word is another one of our famous and long-running movie quotations.Unfortunately, there's nothing more American than racism, and in this adaptation of one of the most iconic American novels, lawyer Atticus Finch defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Since it's the South, you can only imagine the backlash he and his family receive from the community when he steps up to give Tom Robinson his right to a fair trial. As in the novel, the story is told from the point of view of Scout, Atticus's young daughter. Mary Badham plays Scout, and she's not only adorable, but completely earned her Oscar nomination. She was only ten years old, and the youngest actress to be nominated at that time!To Kill a Mockingbird marks Gregory Peck's most famous role, and while everyone knows the famous ""In the name of God"" powerful courtroom speech, his performance isn't just a ""Gregory Peck role"". He's a caring, concerned father, and the scenes between Greg and Mary are beautiful. Greg won an Oscar for his performance, and the film also picked up statues for Adapted Screenplay and Art Direction. Elmer Bernstein's lovely theme was nominated, but it was hard to compete against Laurence of Arabia, which took the music, director, and picture awards away from To Kill a Mockingbird. This is a real American classic, so if you're that one person in the country who hasn't yet seen it, rent it so you can join in the conversation with all your family and friends. Even if you're particularly attached to the novel and don't generally like film adaptations, give it a chance. Harper Lee herself loved the movie and thought Gregory Peck's performance was so wonderful, she gave him her father's (the real Atticus Finch) pocket watch. Peck's grandson is named Harper, which is really sweet, and it shows just how much this role and film meant to him and his family.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fine child acting, poor direction and story. Extremely Overrated.","Before I start my explanation of the above statements, I would like to comment that I am an avid Gregory Peck fan and I have also found his work to be of exceptional quality. This movie is no exception. I have also read Harper Lee's novel of the same name and found it to succeed in every area and every issue that it was trying to portray. Unfortunately, this success did not transfer to film, even with Mr. Peck and a cast of exceptionally talented child-actors. Every aspect of the film, with the exception of Mr. Peck and the children, is lacking, misguided, and often tries to pull at the heartstrings of early 1960's viewers with lame set-ups and other devices used to show one side and one man as being absolutely unerring and without vice. The movie takes a while to develop and for the first half-hour focuses primarily on the children. The children do rather everyday things and converse with each other about nothing of consequence on the film. They finally decide to explore a ""haunted house"" to see the ""maniac"" that lives within it. While I felt that this avenue might lead somewhere, nothing of any consequence, albeit a small meeting with the maniac at the end of the film, came of this rather long and drawn out plot line. Next, we see that Mr. Peck, who portrays a compassionate, strong father and lawyer, is assigned to defend a black man who has supposedly committed a rape of a white female. Subsequent to this, there is never any conversation among Peck and the defendant, no evidence discussed prior to trial, and no real character development of the defendant and even to a larger extent Mr. Peck. We then see a few scattered scenes of the ultra-racist and completely ignorant father-of-the-victim, who tries his best to cause trouble and say dirty things to black people. Though he is shown as mean and stupid, he doesn't do anything particularly characteristic of an enraged racist father, he merely calls Mr. Peck a ""ni$%er lover "" and spits a lot. You will notice that he is not even with the angry mob that tells Mr. Peck to hand over the prisoner so that they can lynch him. Finally, we arrive at a trial, where it is unbelievable that this case would have even gone to trial based on certain obvious fact that you will see in the movie. In trying to say any more directly involving the film's plot, I would be spoiling the movie for you, but suffice it to say, if Mr. Peck were not in this film and did not give such a rousing courtroom speech, this movie would have been forgotten long ago. The direction is poor and uneven, plot tangents go untouched or under-developed, and many of the characters and actors seem rather silly. Instead of achieving what the book did in terms of portraying racism in the Depression South and the intriguing stories of the children, the film manages to seem poorly done, even cheap, and the child actors's obvious talents go to waste on dead end plot lines. Even the costuming seems badly done. You will notice that all of the whites wear overalls, while the ""enlightened"" Mr. Peck and a handful of kind blacks wear suits. In closing instead of being a thoughtful and poignant depiction of racism in the South, it seems contrived. My recommendation is to avoid this unless you are an avid Gregory Peck fan and read the novel. But if you really want to watch a movie close to this subject that is done well, try In the Heat of the Night or any number of Sidney Portier's films. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Well done,"I was surprised at how well all the elements came together for this film. The main cohesion is centered on Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his relationship with his children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Philip Alford). I would classify this as one of Gregory peck's best movies. It almost had to be shot in black and white to have the feel needed in the all but black and white movie.Scout and Jem know very little about their neighbor 'Boo' (Robert Duvall.) They have heard and made up strange stories. They spend time daring each other and their summer friend, to go up to the neighbor's house as it holds some mysterious crazed person.

It seems to deeply move everyone who watches it. I own this movie and bawl my eyes out every time I see it. But it's a good cry. To Kill a Mockingbird (TKAM, I'll call it) both breaks my heart and inspires me, because it reminds me of human beings' capacity for decency and bravery.Has there ever been a more touching character than Atticus Finch???? Not a perfect man, not a God, but just a person who respected the rights of other people and tried to do the right thing; he was a ""decent"" man. He tried to live his life according to the saying ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" Such quiet dignity! I can see why Atticus Finch was recently named the #1 movie ""Hero"" of all time by the American Film Institute. Just thinking about this movie brings tears to my eyes. The only other film to affect me in such a deep way has been The Shawshank Redemption.Gregory Peck would be forever known as Atticus Finch, and he expressed how honored he felt to be associated with such a character. I saw an interesting documentary about Peck's life, and in it he was doing one-man shows around the country. These shows were question-and-answer sessions with the audience, and the majority of questions and comments were related to TKAM and how portraying Atticus Finch had impacted Peck's life. It was so interesting and touching to hear people talk about how the film and that character affected them. I remember one man standing up and saying that TKAM inspired him to become a lawyer, and that he named his son Atticus. I've read here and there about the favorite movies of various celebrities, and have been amazed that of all the movies out there in the world, there's one title that pops up frequently as a favorite - and that's TKAM. And it's the favorite of all kinds of people, both young and old. I almost fell off my chair when I read that it was Madonna's favorite movie. Didn't think she has such good taste! Anyway, how extraordinary it must have been for G. Peck, Robert Duvall and all the other people who were part of TKAM to realize that they created something really, truly impacted people - and could inspire people to try to be better human beings.

Superb Performance By Gregory Peck; Superb Directing By Robert Mulligan,"In my experience, this may be the best adaptation of a novel that Hollywood has ever produced, the story having been taken from the novel of the same name by Harper Lee. It's a story about racism in the Depression-era South. It's a coming of age story for young Scout and Jem, who watch their father Atticus doggedly defend a black man accused of beating and raping a young white woman. It features magnificent performances from pretty much the entire cast. Young Mary Badham was actually nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Scout - but then, perhaps surprisingly, she went on to do very little acting. And what can one say about Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. This may well have been his best performance; when I think of Gregory Peck it's certainly Atticus Finch who comes into my mind. There's an incredible mix of well known names in the supporting cast: Brock Peters, William Windom, Paul Fix and even a very young Robert Duvall. And there really isn't a weak performance among them. Most of the attention around ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is usually focused on the performances, and especially Peck, but I want to pay special tribute to the directing.Director Robert Mulligan did a superb job as well, and while he went on to direct a number of other movies, this surely was his finest job. There's a very good pace to this movie. It starts out slowly, painting an almost idyllic picture of life in this small town in the South, focusing on Scout and Jem and their friend Dill. It's summer, school is out and they're just kids having fun. It's a casual and carefree existence, they spend most of their time outside, sometimes getting into mischief, sometimes investigating some of the town's mysteries - one of which revolves around the story of Boo, a local boy supposedly kept chained in his basement by his father. You get the feeling that if there was anyplace you wanted to grow up as a child, it was right here in Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's - Depression or not. Until Mayella is attacked, and Tom Robinson (a black man) is accused, and Atticus is assigned to defend him. Then the story becomes dark, the racism starts to be seen; the gulf between black and white must be a shock to Scout and Jem, whose exposure to black people to this point has been to friendly Calpurnia, who kept house for their widowed father and looked after them and was more or less part of the family. Mulligan picks up the pace of the movie once the trial starts. The trial proceeds at a frenetic pace - seemingly it all takes place in a single day, which perhaps makes the point that even with Atticus doing his best and making clear the truth of what had actually happened, there was going to be no long consideration of the facts - just a rush to a pre-ordained judgement, followed by a tragedy. Then there's the suspense of what happened to Scout and Jem on their ""longest journey"" - as the adult Scout (who serves as kind of the narrator) calls it in a voice over. But once that finishes, Mulligan changes the pace again, and the story slows down as the mystery of Boo from the beginning of the movie is revealed, and the film concludes on a very gentle and moving note. Just superb pacing from Mulligan. He was nominated for the Oscar as Best Director in 1963, but lost to David Lean's turn directing ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Both were fine movies, but I'd have given the nod to Mulligan.You could criticize the movie for downplaying to an extent the reality of racism. It really doesn't give us any glimpse into what it was like to be black in Maycomb - it gives far more of a white perspective on the issue of racism. But that's exactly what the novel was of course - a depiction of life in small town Alabama using Harper Lee's own upbringing as a model. I also thought that the combination of the depiction of small town life (and especially the focus at the beginning and the end on Boo) was perhaps a bit awkwardly combined with the rape trial and the reflection on racism, although Boo himself becomes an example of yet another misunderstood figure in the town. Atticus comes across as almost too good to be true. But, really, there's very little to criticize about this movie, which deserves to be thought of as a classic. (9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Masterful transformation of book to screen, evokes the better angels of our nature","Exiled to Pennsylvania for four years, I read this book to then later watched the film with my children because I saw it as the best gift I could possibly give them from my heritage. TKAM showed a whole generation of southerners how we might live up to our ideals and grow out of our bigotry.This is film making at its unpretentious best- unlike Kane or the Godfather, or Kurosawa, this film isn't about the director or even the actors; it is about a story whose poetry and truth have the power to change people. In that sense it renders powerful testimony to what film making can be. Cleverness and ""genius"" in making films will, at best, only rate an ""8"" from me.

Sense and Sentiment,"There are two highlights of this film: One is, as could be expected, Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch as the rock of his family, the law, and even the entire Maycomb County.

This film is one of them for anyone who has seen it.

The screenplay by Horton Foote is good, but only as long as it follows Lee's clearly stated boundaries.To Kill a Mockingbird is a film with a brilliant lead performance, sensible, savvy directing which, when mixed with Lee's touching, fulfilling story of American values, is not going to be forgotten for a long time after the initial viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best ''BLACK AND WHITE'' movies of all time,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful movie, which is based on Harper's Lee novel and it is mainly about ''racial differences"" through the innocence eyes of Atticus's children ''Scout and Jem''.The film is depicted in a simple way which makes it even more interesting in a sense where the problem is showed in a so implicit way.The story occurs in the 1930 in old Maycomb town, ''Scout'' curious and inspirational daughter of the loyal and humble father ''Atticus'', the latter in charge of the defense of the black man Tom Robinson wrongly accused of raping Ewell's white woman.Atticus Finch famous lawyer of the county had to face the curiosity of his children most importantly ''Scout'', she was disturbed by what was happening and it was depicted in a naive way to show us how stupid the problem was, a problem which come from a grey nothingness that is unacceptable and understandable by the children minds and as it is better explained in the novel ''there is something in our world that makes men lose their heads''.Atticus '' Gregory Peck'' amazingly played the role of the lawyer, a white lawyer who's defending a black man against prejudice during an epoch when the black people suffered an incomprehensible discrimination, The court room scene where Atticus is seen so keen to defend and show that ''Tom Robinson'' is not guilty through a meaningful speech in which he pointed out the evidences.Robert Mulligan did a good job to convert the so famous novel into a wonderful movie even though the novel still has some more interesting discussions and actions but still the movie reflected that climate and image the county was in at that time.All in all, the movie panned out to convey to the audience the racial problems that occurred at that time and making it one of the best ''BLACK AND WHITE'' movies of all time.Highly Recommended!!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good story but not that well told,"Told in hindsight by Scout this is the story of how she and her brother remember one summer in the Deep South when their father, Atticus Finch defends a black man (Robinson) who has been accused of forcing himself on a white girl and then beating her.  Atticus finds himself in a battle for the truth in the face of racism and intolerance and also defending his children from the impact of the same on them.I first read the book in school and have re-read it several times as it has really stuck with me. Since then I have seen the film a couple of times but have never felt that it really reaches the same height as the book does. The telling of the story is at it's strongest in the courtroom as it takes on the principles of a courtroom thriller however outside of this central piece it is almost a Southern cliché  with the kids, the community etc.  It still works but it feels like a postcard compared to the reality of the South in the intolerance of the courtroom.The film doesn't totally bring through the themes of the books  instead focusing on the specifics.  This is necessary to make it all fit into the 130min running time but it is to the subject matter's detriment as it loses much of it's significance.  That's not to say it is not impacting, because it still is.  I do have a problem with the first half and the end of the film where the focus is entirely on the children before sudden jumps into the main plot.  In the book it is all part of the same thing, here it does feel like it is a different chapter.Peck is good in his usual moral indignation role and he is well supported by the two child actors who both seem natural  Badham (sister of the director) and Alford.  A very young looking Robert Duvall is in the film briefly and adds a bit of interest to the generally good supporting cast.  It is to the film's credit (considering the period and the setting) that the black characters are not just limited to `yessir' stereotypes although at times they come close.Overall I enjoyed this film and the courtroom scenes are pretty tense even knowing where it is going.  The narration of the grown up Scout is a little weak and some of the film appears to be wandering to no effect but it is still a good film.  I, however, would still rather re-read the book.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Beautifully shot, moving and faithful to the book","To start with, the book is absolutely wonderful with great characters and a moving story. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best adaptations of a book, it is not only faithful to the source material but it almost improves on it. Do I have any criticisms? Not really, other than to say that the film is a tad overlong for my liking. But it is a brilliant film, with a beautifully crafted story that still maintains the emotional punch of the book about a lawyer in the Deep South and the effect of the rape trial on his children. The film is beautifully shot, the whole film is incredible to watch, and the score is sensitive. The script is effective and sticks closely to the book, and the direction from Robert Mulligan is very impressive. The acting is really good, I have read that Henry Fonda would have been better for Atticus Finch, although Fonda was a great actor, Gregory Peck does give a superb and career-best performance in this film. And he is very well supported by an excellent Robert Duvall as disturbed Boo Radley, while Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are very well-cast as the children. Overall, a wonderful and faithful adaptation and just an excellent film really. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"True To Its Source, While Also Adding Some Iconic Canon","When judging a film based on a spectacularly popular novel, there are two things that I usually look for: 1. Does it stick to the compelling themes of the source material reasonably well? I don't need word-for-word and I don't even mind little changes here and there, but it should be faithful to the themes that made the literature iconic. 2. Does it add something unique to the equation? Print literature and film are too entirely different beasts to tame (just ask Stephen King about that!), and one doesn't necessarily (or even usually) translate well into the other. In essence, you can't just expect a movie to be successful because the book was likewise. The film-makers need to make sure the translation is fit for the big screen.On both of those counts, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" receives a solid ""A"" grade.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on a number of events transpiring in the small community of Maycomb, GA during the 1930s. Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), a lawyer, is called upon to defend a Negro man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) over allegations of rape from white woman Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox) and her father (James Anderson). While this race-fueled trial grips Maycomb, the children of Atticus have their own coming-of-age adventures. Jean- Louise, or ""Scout"" (Mary Badham) and Jem (Phillip Alford) make a new friend in out-of-towner Dill (John Megna), obsess over the neighborhood legend of Arthur ""Boo"" Radley, and try (as best they can) to come to terms with their father's work.In terms of capturing the iconic themes of the novel, this film is able to accomplish that heady task, of which much credit can be given to director Robert Mulligan. In terms of getting the ""gist"" of the story, I could recommend either the book OR the novel (though I would highly recommended both!) and feel confident the message would come across in either format. It is also a film that can be enjoyed by children and adults in equal measure. Children will feel akin to young Scout, while adults will be taken in by the solemn themes interspersed with recollections of more ""innocent"" (or were they) and youthful days.What makes ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" truly special, though, is that Peck's Atticus Finch is easily one of the most iconic film characters of all time. I can't imagine reading the novel now and not picturing him as Atticus. He's the father figure of all big-screen father figures. While Atticus was a powerfully-written character even in the novel, one could argue that Peck even transcends that literature and brings more depth to the character. The courtroom scenes featuring Atticus in this movie are truly riveting no matter how many times you see them.Thus, I have to consider ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" to be one of my favorite all-time films. Even having seen it and read the book a number of times, it can still bring a tear to my eye and stir some pretty deep emotions. Both film and book complement each other perfectly.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better than the book I think.,"Gripping court drama/ social critique of law, society and discrimination in the USA.The film immerses you in the feel and culture of this southern town in 1930s America. It's seen largely from the innocence of the three young children who haven't been corrupted yet by it's racist culture, their role model and father lead them is charged with defending a young black man but his idealism and slight naivety is shattered by reality. The film perfectly captures hot nights and the evenings of people sat on their porches.The film looks great with it's stark black and white cinematography, the UHD blu ray is a fantastic transfer, this might be the best looking black and white film I've seen. The film is not just court room drama or a tale of bigotry but also includes exploring the poverty of the school mates the children befriend. I know this film gets attacked now for the racial language in it, the passiveness of the black characters and so on but I think it is a tremendously important film that realistically portrays the 1930s and the way it would be seen from the perspective of a little girl still too young to fully realise the significance of certain moments. The performances are simply phenomenal, especially from Gregory Peck.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""To Kill a Mackingbird"" -- Memorable Because of What It Doesn't Purport to Being","After forty-three years, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (TKAM) remains one of the most effective testimonials to the ravages of ignorance and prejudice ever recorded on film. Asking myself why this gracefully paced narrative has left such an indelible impression on so many, I've concluded it's because the film isn't about what most of its supporters and detractors claim it's about. Not about race or prejudice? . . . No. At its core, TKAM is about ""neighbors"" and ""community"", which concept forms the basis for the gravity of its message in the matter of Tom Robinson.Other films have followed on the familiar theme of racial bigotry and its well-documented devastations. These films have been consistently less effective because we are not asked to think so much, or to connect the history depicted with the histories of our own lives and our own communities.I've performed in two stage versions of TKAM, neither of which benefited from the brilliant input of screenwriter, Horton Foote. Both plays focus, almost exclusively, on the racial element of the story. They, like so many films of later years, come off as ""heavy-handed"" or ""in-your-face"" regarding this element. Well . . . ""If you think this way -- you're bad."" End of story. In TKAM (the film), we see a community of poor, unique, and apparently respectable people helping one another through a Depression. In stark contrast (and beautifully prepared by the film's creators) the injustices meted out to Tom Robinson and his family represent a dramatic anachronism of unthinkable proportions. And, it's as routine, in this gentle Southern community, as a child's fear of a mysterious neighbor, or a shy but happy exchange of hickory nuts for legal services rendered. Memorable? Most emphatically. Think about it. It's what director Mulligan wants us to do.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Classic movie about  a small-town Southern advocate including  intense  court drama , atmospheric scenarios and superb interpretations","Splendid and flavorful rendition based on bestselling novel written by Harper Lee , being perfectly scripted by Horton Foote .

Meanwhile , he attempts to explain proceedings to his kids (Mary Badham , Philip Alford) , trying to understand life and against social prejudice .The most beloved and widely read Pulitzer Prize Winner by Harper Lee now comes vividly alive on the screen in this magnificent picture , being leisurely narrated and stunningly filmed . Interesting and thought-provoking screenplay by Horton Foote who also earned an Oscar along with Gregory Peck . Well realized and deliberately paced ; being a powerful retelling , including evocative settings , appropriate cinematography in white and black by cameraman Russell Harlan and rousing musical score . Extraordinary acting by Gregory Peck as a small-town advocate at law who defends an African-American accused of rape . Support cast is frankly well ; cast members such as Mary Badham (Scout), film debut by Robert Duvall (Boo), Frank Overton (Heck Tate), Collin Wilcox Paxton (Mayella), Ruth White , Richard Hale , Paul Fix , and William Windom (Mr. Gilmer) , being narrated by Kim Stanley . Mary Badham became the youngest girl to receive an Oscar nomination, ironically losing the award to another child actress, Patty Duke in The miracle worker (1962). Special mention to Brock Peters , as an inmate , wrongly accused as rapist ; he started to cry while shooting the testifying scene, without rehearsing it this way, and Gregory Peck said that he had to look past him, instead of looking him in the eye, without choking up himself . With the death of Rosemary Murphy (Maudie Atkinson) on July 5, 2014, Robert Duvall (Boo Radley) is the film's last surviving adult cast member . Sensitive as well as evocative musical score by the great Elmer Bernstein ; the piano in Elmer Bernstein's score was played by John Williams .

Robert's way of handling his child actors was to let them play together while keeping the cameras as unobtrusive as possible. It is the first of six films director Robert Mulligan made with his producer partner, Alan J. Pakula . Director Robert Mulligan and producer Alan J. Pakula traveled to Harper Lee's hometown of Monroeville but found it unsuitable for filming , the town had been modernized ; therefore the production team constructed their own ideal version of Monroeville on a backlot at Universal . Robert Mulligan was a good filmmaker expert on dramas such as he proved in ¨Bloodbrothers¨ , ¨Baby the rain must fall¨, ¨Kiss me goodbye¨ , ¨Same time , next year¨ , ¨The Nickel Ride¨, ¨The man in the moon¨ , being his greatest successes the followings : the eerie tale of supernatural titled ¨The other¨, the adolescent drama ¨Summer of 42¨ and this ¨¨To kill a mockingbird¨ .

Decent adaptation; Overly dated and preachy,"I remember really enjoying Harper Lee's novel when I read it more than 25 years ago. The film is pretty good, I guess. The child actors all did wonderfully. Gregory Peck did well enough as Atticus Finch, although I'm not sure it was an Oscar-worthy performance. The whole rape trial sequence seems overly preachy to me now. I suppose that in the early '60's there may have been people unaware of the realities of Jim Crow, but nowadays it has been forced down everyone's throat for decades. The heroic liberal fighting injustice is a theme whose time has long passed, and viewing TKAM now hasn't the sort of impact that I imagine it did then. Grade: C",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Please Don't Remake This Film!,"Harper Lee created a classic in her novel. This film adaptation is probably the best novel to film ever. It stars Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch in his Oscar winning role. Mary Badham plays the unforgettable Scout. One of the main reasons that I purchased the film was to see Ruth White in her performance as miserable Mrs. Dubose. Sadly she had a much bigger role in the novel but for everybody involved in this film classic, it was worth any minute of time. Alice Ghostley is also in the film as one of the mother and neighbor. Rosemary Murphy plays Maudie Atkinson. The film is first rate and classic which should never be remade even for today's audiences. It stands on it's own much Godfather and Citizen Kane. Please don't remake this film with today's stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
TKAM,"I'm really annoyed by how relevant this still is. Movie came out 60 years ago and we're still dealing with the same nonsense and that is infuriating. That aside, I felt this film did a wonderful job of working a message without becoming preachy at any point in the runtime, something I deeply appreciate. Gregory Peck is exceptional. I know wish I could see a courtroom team-up with him and Jimmy Stewart from Mr Smith Goes to Washington... Maybe during the civil rights movement? Oooh, or maybe a TV show....That idea started as a lark and now I'm kind of obsessed with it.ANYHOW! Peck is amazing, really carries this entire movie on his shoulders because, unfortunately, everyone else was lagging behind. This feels like a stage production, with the over the top theatrics, the utter lack of subtlety. Hell, the 'villain' may as well have been twirling a mustache in that court room scene and the 'victim' was so absurdly bad that it really undercut a lot of what she was trying to say.Still, sign of the times, I suppose. Great movie, solid watch. Glad I finally got around to it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Doesn't cut it.,"The film starts with the same essence as the book, but through experience I've learned not to compare much - they are two very different mediums.The problem begins with the film pacing up and skipping important events that build up motives of the characters and causes shift in their intent. Towards the end all of it looks like a rush. The importance and the the details of how grave the case of a lawyer actually backing up black man is lost in translation across the medium.Well, all of that can be forgiven and the film still somehow works along. But the contextual shock of a man attacking children is totally lost on screenplay, many dialog were changed which the climax dry and juice-less - taking all emotions out of it.Characters, especially Atticus's, were portrayed and played out very well. They are the only reason the film works.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Flawless and poignant portrait of racism, integrity, and childhood","While I must confess to not having read Harper Lee's novel, this movie might possibly rank with me as the greatest cinematic drama ever. It paints a vivid picture of the incredible injustice of racism in the 1930's South, a character study of a very principled lawyer, and a bittersweet view of childhood's innocence.The film relates the story of a widowed Southern lawyer named Atticus Finch, as seen through the eyes of his tomboyish young daughter, Scout. Together with her older brother Jem and their sidekick Dill, the children explore the goings on of their local neighbourhood in Macon, Georgia. They also witness the South's entrenched racism in their own hometown when their father takes on the case of defending an innocent black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a local white girl. Of course the jury is all male & all white, and many of the prejudiced townsfolk do not take kindly to Robinson's defending lawyer, even extending their outrage to Atticus's children. Meanwhile, the youngsters are inquisitive about their reclusive neighbour Boo Bradley, rumoured to be a dangerous madman.It would be difficult to imagine a more compelling and personal depiction of racism than this false accusation laid against the harmless, kind hearted Tom Robinson. These trumped up charges in fact result from the victim Mayella's own sense of guilt. Brock Peters perfectly captures the quiet humanity of this utterly sympathetic, despairing defendant who faces a predictable verdict from jury members who see all black people as liars. The scene where he breaks down on the witness stand will haunt you forever. Robinson's humble home and anguished family round out the portrait of this travesty of justice.Atticus Finch is surely the most principled, gentlemanly fictional character ever conceived, masterfully portrayed here by Gregory Peck, himself such an endearing gentleman. He brilliantly captures Atticus's sense of justice and morality as he takes on the unpopular and even potentially dangerous task of defending Robinson. This is a kind and modest man who treats everyone with equal respect...black and white, rich and poor...the white Sheriff, his black housekeeper, his unjustly accused client, his children, his neighbours, the poverty stricken but proud farmer who pays him with vegetables for past legal services. Atticus never appears more dignified than during his controlled response to a churl who spits upon him. He displays patience and understanding with his two motherless children, as he quietly tries to teach them true values of fairness and decency. If only every child had a father with the integrity of Atticus Finch to emulate, this world would surely be a wonderful place.The three children are engagingly portrayed by marvelous, perfectly cast young stars, the entire story depicted through their eyes. Scout is a feisty tomboy, unwillingly forced to don a dress for her school debut and later prone to fighting with any schoolboy who offends her. Her older brother Jem is fiercely protective of his father, displays endless curiosity about neighbour Boo, and mockingly accuses his sister of 'becoming more like a girl every day'. Their chum Dill, a funny looking and comical fellow, describes himself as 'little but old'. What an appealing and amusing trio they make! Atticus's black housekeeper, Calpurnia, is a concerned and respected mother figure, who takes Scout severely to task for her rude manners toward her young lunch guest!The 1930's Southern small town neighbourhood is perfectly captured. Many of the scenes occur on the porches and in the yards, with the kids up to their assorted shenanigans. Their tree house and tire swing bring back childhood memories, and I can still hear those crickets. Unfolding events compel these innocent youngsters to face the sad adult realities of racism and injustice. Boo teaches the children a valuable lesson about the dangers of preconceptions, and gives the adults an unforgettable sense of true justice. Unexpectedly, he proves to be part of the title's mockingbird allusion.The atmosphere in the small town courtroom is brought vividly to life as the spectators fan themselves against the stifling Georgia heat. William Windom (from Murder She Wrote) portrays the smirking prosecutor. The trial is itself gripping and Atticus's concluding remarks riveting and inspiring. During the final courtroom scene, the local black townsfolk reveal with great dignity their respect and appreciation for Atticus. This film is a moving tribute to those who fought against the evils of racial discrimination and an incredible masterpiece that no one should miss. Though tragic, it proves ultimately uplifting.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Essential.,"Undoubtedly a classic hallmark in cinema, To Kill a Mockingbird dealt with social issues when social issues were still very much an issue in society, much more so than today although some of the same basic feelings are still present. Being younger than the film itself, I can only imagine the impact it had on people when it first came out. And seeing how the film has not been forgotten after the decades since it's release, I think it's safe to say that it had quite an effect as it continues to do so. Having read the book in high school, the film seems fairly accurate to the story except for a few very minor things that are mostly the result of a book being condensed into a much shorter journey.Gregory Peck is perfect in his role as Atticus Finch and apparently I'm not alone in that opinion as he won an Oscar for the role. All three children in the movie are also quite impressive and entirely convincing. I particularly enjoyed seeing Robert Duvall in his first film appearance as the ambiguous Boo Radley.It's very difficult to give reviews for older films, particularly ones that were made prior to my existence, mostly due to the inevitable fact that like everything else films also age, sometimes weakening the original potency. But to be honest, the only thing that I can see that has noticeably aged is the music, which is entirely understandable and is to be expected. And given the fact that it's over four decades old, that is quite a statement. It all boils down to a very important film about a very important and popular book in which social issues were dealt with and still holds relevance today. Like many classics, it's not just a movie, but a film with a message. A heart warming classic and an essential notch in the belt of film history.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Good & Bad Of 'To Kill A Mockingbird',"For some reason, it took a long time before I ever gave this movie a look, and when I finally did last year I was very pleased and saw why all the fuss was made over it. Then, I watched it again about six months later and got disgusted with some of it. Maybe I should have waited another 40 years between viewings! (Only kidding)THE GOOD - Well, I can start with the fine acting and interesting characters, led by Gregory Peck as ""Atticus Finch,"" one of the more noble characters ever put on screen. He is single father taking care of two adolescents and is a strong moral man who stands for all that is right. The main theme of the movie is racism, and I'm sure this much bigger impact 44 years ago than today. It wasn't long after this that the U.S. was embroiled in numerous race riots. It was a tumultuous decade, to say the least. There also is a tiny sub-plot in this story which involves another kind of bias, one against the mentally-ill or simply against pre-conceived notions we might have of people who are different from us.Not only is Peck outstanding, but kudos to the kids in here, too, beginning with Mary Badham as young ""Scout."" She only made one other movie and never acted as an adult. She's a great kid in here and winsome in a tomboy-ish way. Her brother ""Jem"" (Philip Alvord) also is good, and has a wonderful scene in front of the courthouse protecting his dad against a mob. New-found friend ""Dill Harris"" (John Megna) has a much shorter role but completes the trio of youngsters who all prove to be capable actors. Kim Stanley narrates the film as grownup ""Scout"" looking back on those days.Brock Peters is good as the black man accused of something he didn't do, and it was interesting to see Robert Duvall in, I believe, his first movie role. He had done TV for a couple of years prior to this film. His role, however, was right at the end of the film and he said very little, if anything, as the misunderstood ""Boo Radley.""This is a very nicely photographed film with great lighting in here. The whole thing was shot on a Hollywood set. It looks super on the latest special-edition two-disc DVD. I enjoy watching the great black-and-white images in here but then again, it's easier to produce perfect lighting like this rather than going on actual location and adjusting to the conditions. Still, it's a visual treat.BAD - In the filmmakers' zeal to show the ugliness of racism they were insultingly biased in the courtroom finale and unrealistic in portraying the lead male racist. Being ""fair and balanced"" was not something shown in coverage of the trial since the most dramatic parts - the final summations - are wonderfully and powerfully presented by defense attorney Finch but we never hear the prosecution summation! What happened to that speech? We only hear one side! At least give us viewers credit for having enough common sense to know what's right after we hear both sides. The film world rarely treats the moviegoers intelligently, preferring to hit us over the heads with their agendas instead. And, showing this redneck ""Bob Ewell"" (James Anderson) going out all alone and ranting and raving in front of house full of blacks late at night is ridiculous. Nobody, but nobody is that stupid: white, black or any color. But, once again, the filmmakers do everything they can to manipulate their audience and this film is extremely manipulative.OVERALL - Nonetheless, despite the obvious bias it's still a good, powerful story with great moral lessons. It also gives us something we don't see much in modern movies: an ideal father figure, not just in the way he handles his kids but all adults, too. You can't find a much better role model. I'd like to see more of this types of people on film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

The defense of this man and the town's prejudice is all seen through the eyes his children--making this film an excellent one to show children, though its appeal is universal (unless you are an avowed racist, I guess).Peck was one of the greatest actors of his age and perhaps apart from 12 O'CLOCK HIGH and possibly the underrated BIG COUNTRY, this was his greatest film role.

It thrusts us into their world with their playfulness and fears, especially from their mad next door Neighbor.There are certain scenes that are depicted as horror with the right lighting and music to accompany them , for it is the childhood fears that are depicted there , thus letting us experience it through their eyes.The children are there in almost every scene, whether as witnesses or as the main attention. The child actors give some of the best performances I have ever seen of actors their age. They truly behave like kids do, and not like child actors acting as children, they are truly believable.And let's not forget Gregory Peck giving one of his best performances as the loving protecting father on one side, and the protector of justice on the other, as he is defending an innocent black man in the racist American south.In conclusion a great family drama, told with tenderness and care, depicted through the eyes of the children.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the few films that is as good as the book,"To Kill a Mockingbird has always been a favourite of mine. I may have done myself a favour years ago when I decided to read the Harper Lee book before watching the film. It still amazes me to this day how exactly similar Robert Duvall's Boo Radley was to the one I pictured in my mind.Mulligan directed a fine film using a well established movie-star (Gregory Peck) and two children who hadn't been in any films previous to this. The performances of the children is of something beyond acting and it is this aspect that makes the film work so well. The film isn't overly long (which it could have very well been) especially throughout the courtroom scene.The issues dealt with during the film were still very touchy at the time this film was released. Perhaps the fact that this film is seen from the young girls viewpoint helps to be almost completely unbiased. The scene in which the lynching mob tries to get at Atticus and Tom shows the innocence of Scout, especially during her discussion with the father of one of her classmates. The whole basis of this film is the innocence of the children and how they make their way through the adventures and fears of the summer.I fully recommend this film to all.9/10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
a beautiful movie about innocence and racism.,"To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. This movie shows some of the problems between blacks and whites. These differences between two races make this story so special. The characters adaptation was very interesting, starting with Atticus Finch and his children. Also, I love how this story was told through the eyes of one child.In this movie were many things that make it interesting such as the characters, the theme, plot and mysterious elements. First, the main actors had a very good representation on their characters, for instance, Atticus Finch, Scout and Jem. The theme of this story was based in prejudice and was showing the differences between blacks and whites. Also, the plot was very detailed and exciting because Boo was scary and mysterious. Finally, Tom Robinson also brings to the plot the essentials of the movie.Although the movie To Kill a Mockingbird is very exciting, some things do not show the truth of the story. One of these things is when Mr. Radley cemented the tree's knothole and the children get down without knowing the cause. Also, something needing to change may be the Ewell family because they are an evil family without any feeling toward other people. The trial of Tom Robinson is conspicuous and sad because the movie itself makes him an important character. But knowing all these things, this movie is still great.To Kill a Mockingbird is a great movie where you can find one of the most recognized actors of all time, Gregory Peck. Mr. Peck stands out in all his qualities that are made by his values. One of the foremost qualities of Gregory Peck is his courage to confront the goals of his work and his personal life. Atticus Finch and Gregory Peck have a different life and feelings, but they are both moral men. Finally, both conduct themselves with dignity.In conclusion, To Kill a Mockingbird is a beautiful movie that I will like to recommend to everybody to watch. In this movie one learns about the social class, the good and evil. One thing that I really liked was to know about Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. Also, I felt empathy with many situations in the movie that reminded me of similar times in my life.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Flawless in every conceivable way,"This is my very favorite book. Cliched, I know, but it's a classic for a reason. I read it freshman year of high school and immediately fell in love with the story and the characters. We were meant to watch the movie after reading the book, but we didn't get around to it, and at the time, I was glad. At the time, my experience had led me to believe that movie adaptations of good books are rarely good enough to live up to my expectations, and nearly 10 years later, I still believe that when it comes to most books. But after having to watch this movie in a film class in college, I was forced to admit that this is not always the case. This movie is flawless. It perfectly captures the tone and spirit of the book, the casting was absolutely perfect, the score is amazing and well timed, the emotions are real and vivid. This deserves all the accolades it gets and many many more. I only wish I had seen it earlier. While the book continues to be something I come back to time and time again, this is a rare case when I actually feel comfortable watching the movie instead of rereading the book if I want to save time. It's (almost) just as good. It certainly comes closer than any other movie ever did to capturing the subtle perfection of a novel. There's a reason that this is one of the few movies that is this old and Hollywood hasn't yet tried to remake it. I hope they never do.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the greats!,"Probably the best movie ever made about racism! Just like in the book it's not overly dark and depressing but shown through the innocent eyes of a child, many memorable moments don't even have nothing to do with racism. Gregory Peck is amazing in this!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stayed true to the book!,"Director Mulligan did a really good job of keeping true to the book of which this film is based, that was released only a short 2 years prior. Through brilliant framing, subjective pov, and long takes that often included monologues; this told and showed the story that has been a staple in America's history. It was highly culturally significant when it was penned, and it remains something that we look at today, because it dealt with more than just race, but also the stereotypes we place on people and how those are usually wrong (easily seen in Boo Radley's case). The film shows strength, cruelty, bravery in all of the everyday ways in which it as experienced, and that teaching doesn't end at with youth. That the student can just as easily learn, and then become the teacher. The best example is Atticus to his daughter Scout, who then speaks to Mr. Cunnighamn. She does so calmly and casually; she reminds him who he is when he isn't filled with hate and rage, and that her and her family are people just like him, reminding him that his son goes to school with her and of her father saying ""thank you"" after an act of surprise kindness he had done a while ago. She learns and grows throughout this experience, and is the vehicle through which the learning curve can be taught and seen to an audience that would have been conflicted during those times (the 1960s).",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Why To Kill a Mockingbird is the best movie of all time:,"There have been several instances in my life where I am in dire need of something to soothe my soul, I normally recur to the usual things, like going for a walk or perhaps even writing. Other times I simply watch To Kill a Mockingbird. It will draw a smile in me with the first note, and at the last scene a tear.The reason why to Kill a Mockingbird cures my inside is mainly because of a single word: Innocence.In this day and age, these dark times. Like the ones we see in the movie, I believe we all need a drop of innocence on us, but we also need to be strong, we need to be resilient, but above all, we must have justice.In the movie and book, To Kill a Mockingbird means that it is a sin to kill someones innocence/inner peace, because all they do is ''sing'' for us. In a way I have always thought of this as not just that there is a mockingbird in all of us, but that to shoot the beauty and uniqueness of all people on earth has been the one and only sin that we have all committed. This sin may come across in the manifestation of simple thoughts of judgement against peoples actions, personalities or simply physical attributes. Boo Radley is the personification of this situation in the instance of the Novel/Movie.I am applying the situations in this movie to our present day counterparts and situation to explain my most important opinion about the movie: It is Timeless.The historical context of the movie is one of desperation, racism and injustice. But also at times: innocent, playful and hopeful. There is an Atticus Finch, Scout Finch and even Boo Radley in all of us. But the Bob Ewell we all have is also at risk of falling in the desperation and injustice, prejudice and a hate for ourselves and the world that sorrounds us.Atticus Finch brought to life by the one and only Gregory Peck was named AFI's number 1 hero in movie history. A man who will be timeless. His speech at the court is one of the best movie moments in history. Gregory Peck WAS Atticus Finch.All the actors in this movie are completely the way you would imagine them while reading the novel.The compositions by Elmer Bernstein are one of the most beautiful to ever touch the silver screen, and delight our ears. It fills the air with beauty, tension and makes us cry.To Kill a Mockingbird is the greatest film of all time because it isn't perfect, but the message is completely timeless, the world will always go through dire situations because humans tend to be complicated creatures. But there will always be a Mockingbird in all of us, and this movie reminds us of that.I always turn to this movie to find my inner Mockingbird, and to remind me that sometimes, injustice will be present, but the innocence of creatures and the good in mankind will prevail.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Okay, But Not All It's Cracked Up To Be","To Kill A Mockingbird, both as a book and a movie, has been hailed as a classic, a masterpiece, etc. I personally don't see what the big hoopla is.It seems that the movie is trying to be deep, trying to be artistic...and while a bit deep with the whole storyline of Tom's trial, in reality, that's all it did-try.They story is set in Maycomb County, Alabama, in the midst of the Great Depression. It follows the life of Scout Finch, a little girl growing up in that county. Basically, it's about what's going on with the town and what's going on with Scout and her family throughout her growth, leading to different ""storylines"" of events that happens to Scout and the rest of the Finch's.Probably the only storyline I really appreciated was the story of Tom Robinson's trial. Atticus (Scout's father) was defending Tom in a rape case, and since Tom was black, this was taboo in Maycomb. This story really showed unfairness and how cruel prejudice and hate can be. Maybe if the movie was only centered around that story instead of throwing in aspects like Boo Radley, Dill, and others, I would consider calling this movie a classic.I also might've enjoyed it more if they had had a different main character. I personally couldn't stand Scout. I understand that she was supposed to be an innocent, unknowing little girl, but she came off as an annoying, loud, obnoxious brat that I wanted to slap throughout the entire movie. Maybe if it had been from Atticus' point of view, or Jem's, or just ANYONE aside from Scout, I might've enjoyed the movie more.The cinematic work was pretty good, but not extremely artistic. It's a far cry from the fantastic cinematic elements of films such as ""Traffic"" and ""Psycho"". While it had some good angle work and good lighting techniques, it wasn't really a great film in the cinematic field. To be fair, though, I suppose that that's not what the movie was going for.I give it a 3/10. The story involving the trial was beautiful, there was some good acting (Gregory Peck, to give an example-although I don't think his performance was Oscar worthy)...but it was such a long way off from all it was said to be, it just turned out to be an overrated bore.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Everything you've heard is true,"This film is just as powerful and well-performed as you've heard.  From the scenes where Scout and Atticus have discussions, to the scene where Scout innocently confronts a member of a lynch mob, to the trial scenes, to the last scene, (featuring Robert Duvall in his film debut, in which he says so much without ever speaking), every moment is masterfully directed and beautifully perfromed.  Gregory Peck really deserved his Oscar for th role of Atticus Finch; his dignified portrayal of a single father called upon to ""do our unpleseant jobs for us"" is remarkable.  Not only is he wonderful and eloquent in the courtroom scenes, but his scenes at home are wonderful, too. He seems to be every child's image of the ideal father: stern yet kind, all-knowing, able to explain anything, and yet his kids know he can't do everything, though he can do more than they think.  These scenes also give him a chance to interact with the amazing child actors Mary Badham and Philip Alford, both of whom had never done any acting before this and yet are naturals.  Badham is espicially good in the scenes where she and Atticus discuss things; she senses so much, and yet is still so innocent.  She does a lot of growing up, but so does Alford, as he listens in on his father's talks with the judge and watches his visits to the Robinson home.  His maturing is much easier to see.  Both actors are just as good as Peck; their adventures are amusing and their performances excellent.  Brock Peters is also very good as Tom Robinson, the black man accused of raping a white woman.  You are not manipulated into feeling sorry for him; you just naturally are, thanks to his portrayal and the direction of his scenes. This is a wonderful movie.  I don't know if the book is better, as I haven't read it, but I know the movie is excellent.  Please see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Wonderful and faithful adaptation of Harper Lees classic novel,"In a small town in Southern Alabama, a widower Atticus Finch - Gregory Peck - is raising two children by himself. Jeremy or Jem is the older child while tomboy Jean Louise or Scout is the younger. Mr Finch is a lawyer and because these are the 1930s, he sometimes gets paid with farmers crops instead of money. One summer, the children acquire a new friend, Dill Harris, who they play with nearly everyday. It's Dill who is fixated on a reclusive neighbor named Boo Radley who never comes out of the house. Rumors are rampant about what this man is like and Dill wants to try and lure him out into the open. Meanwhile, Atticus gets the case no one wants. He is to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping the daughter of the towns most disreputable white citizen. This may put him and his children in danger because Atticus aims to defend the innocent Robinson with all possible skill. Emotions are stirred up to a boil. What verdict will be reached and what will follow? This wonderful film is a must see movie. Peck is, well, impeccable, as the soft spoken lawyer who believes in justice for all. The kids are adorable and the other cast members quite fine. The choice to film in black and white enhances the historical setting while offering spooky images when the plot thickens near the end. Most of all, the storyline of the humanity and worthiness of all races at a time of racial segregation and oppression is a lesson all need to heed.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A masterpiece about childhood, racism, prejudice, integrity and love","""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is one of the few examples where novel and movie for one really have something to say and where both versions are outstanding achievements in their own right. Harper Lee's bestseller won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and the movie - made with Lee's full support and produced with the same love for the material - received eight well deserved nominations for the Academy Award. The film won three, including Best Actor for Gregory Peck, a portrayal tailored so convincingly after Harper Lee's real life father that a lifelong friendship between actor and writer developed. Even Peck's granddaughter would bear the name ""Harper"", to appreciate the mutual appreciation. Family is also on the forefront of the film: Peck really epitomizes the role of the Southern lawyer Atticus Finch who is set to defend a black man accused of raping a while girl, convinced of his innocence. Finch has two children he needs to teach values of humanity, and these are based on compassion, courage and fighting for the right cause - against all odds. Actor and character shared these principles, and it shows.What makes book and movie so special is that everything is seen through the eyes of the children rather than from a more objective perspective. That way the storytelling provides an unusual and fresh angle when we find ourselves stumbling into events more or less by accident and learn what's really at stake as the youngsters go along. Yet while Atticus' fight against prejudices may seem to be doomed, hope never dies - and it is a given that the viewer will walk away deeply moved by this picture. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a masterpiece about childhood, racism, prejudice, integrity and love, and it excels in dealing with all of the mentioned categories. Whether in form of the novel or the film, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" should be integral part of anyone's education.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
I am sorry...,"I don't know...but I guess I am sorry for not agreeing with the general opinions about this film. I like it. It is a good film, but I don't seem to be able to see why it is so great. The story don't seem to give many 'arguments' as to why the black man was innocent. After the trial, I still don't know if the man is guilty or innocent. The movie is supposed to be about a discrimination trial. However, it is alittle short for the purpose it serves for the movie. However, the first half is not about that. It is pretty much a perspective from the children...it sort of made it a children's film. However, during the second half, the attention was shifted. I guess one can't make a movie entirely on a trial. But because of this spread of storyline, they couldn't touch deep enough of both of the things they wanted to say. There are also few scenes which I thought was not logical. It is a good movie. But I don't think it is a great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

See this first,"I read the book. That's the reason why a film with an 8.5 average gets a 5 from me. I read the book. If I didn't, it would still be an OK film, there are so many scenes that feel out of place, and so many important characters that got cut out, and the characters that they DID leave, were not developed. Another reason was, that the actress who played Scout (I don't care what her real name is, just read) was annoying, really really annoying. Every time she spoke in that false southern accent, it made me cringe. The person who played Mayella Ewell was enjoyable though, and I thought Tommy Wiseau was a bad actor. Now the majority of praise for this film was Gregory Peck as Atticus, and... it really didn't do that for me, not that it was bad or anything, but it was all in a personal preference.

"It's a bird, it's a plane, it's... Superdad!","This film may have been great once, but today it feels rather dated.Sure enough, the film looks and sounds great even by today's standards. It has a sort of fairy-tale feel to it, which is also pretty nice, but it's essentially a 1½ hour kids film with 30 minutes of courtroom drama oddly spliced in there. Therefore, I can't help but feel that the story and the way people act turns very naive at times (Little girl to angry lynch mob: Please, don't be mean! Angry lynch mob: Well... alright then.).And while the movie deals with racism, it does so with such stereotypes that it looses the edge. The blacks are humble good people (saved only by the grace of white super-dad Peck), and the most whites are a bunch of snarling rednecks.The kids are surprisingly good actors, and Dill may be one of the coolest kids I've seen on film, but after an hour of them running around playing, you grow tired of it. Peck (as the best, most caring, fantastic single parent in history) does one of those performances that you're supposed to really admire, but I think it's pretty stiff and stilted.Overall, it's good in parts, but it lacks that ""something special"" that can turn it into a classic.

sweet and tender,"Arguably the strongest bond of any relationship between two human begins, more than; the husband and wife, more than two sister and even more than a mother and her daughter. The strongest of all bonds is the one shared between a father and his son. The father being the mentor, whose job it is to help his son, to guide his son through the unsteady, turbulent and sometimes painful sea that is life. His kind words of encouragements must act as sails boats to guide us into man hood. Well Mockingbird is not strictly just a father and son relationship, there is also a daughter added to the mix, but despite that, Atticus Finch is the perfect illustration of what a good father should be as with stern love and mostly importantly education, he teaches his children to love in a world full of hate, and for me that's the greatest lesson any father could teach his children. And To Kill a Mockingbird is the perfect illustration of a true American classic. Based on the Pulitzer-Prize winning masterpiece novel by Harper Lee (Her only novel), writer Horton Foote and director Robert Mulligan, ingeniously guide us through a painful period in human history for all those involved, a period of economic turmoil and the very apex of racial tension in the deep south, Maycomb, Alabama, in 1932 to be more precise. But what makes the film the even more compelling is how we are shown a world filled with so much ugly, but at the same time we are lead to a single red rose of beauty, because we are shown the world through the eyes of 6 year old girl called Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch (Mary Badham) a high spirited and precocious young girl, who despite her innocent smile, you certainly don't want to find yourself on her bad side. On her journey she is accompanied by Brother Jeremy Atticus ""Jem"" Finch (Phillip Alford), neighbourhood friend Dill Harris and last but not least farther Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. But it's through Scouts eyes we see her father a nigh-on perfect, eloquent and intelligent lawyer seeks to uphold what is true and just, in a world that seeks to abuse and belittle a whole race of people, as he puts it upon himself to protect a black man in court against the bigoted arm of injustice. The black man is Tom Robinson and he has been accused of raping a poor white girl named Mayella Violet Ewell, but as you would expect in 1932, an all white jury sees him as guilty even though the film consistently paints him a positive light, suggesting he is innocent. Despite this, Atticus still endeavours to protect a man he firmly believes is innocent, leading to one of the most impressive and compelling (and longest) courtroom scenes in history. The two things that stood out to me the most was, for one Gregory Peck performance as the father, which I felt he defiantly deserved his Best Actors Oscar for his performance, because as many times as I watch the film back I can't help but fall in love with it again and again, because peck is able to take a onion layered character who one point his a pacifists, loving father, then a second later he shots down a dog 100 meters away with just one bullet, as if he was in a Clint Eastwood film. And it's this ability to take such a complex character, with so such juxtapositions at his core, and be able to do Harper Lee's character a great service with a gentle, controlled and fine paint brush flick from a true artist. The second thing that stood out for me was the three young actors who made the film such an enjoyable and funny watch, each brought passion and enthusiasm to the role, which helped Foote's script truly come alive. Ranked 33rd greatest American film for a reason! An intoxicating watch, I strongly recommended it as viewing for all occasion.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

However, in my opinion, the overall story and message is rather decent in today's setting, as I'm not too invested in the plot or the old-movie- vibe of the film. Indeed, I'm aware that the film is still a renowned examination of racial discrimination within the judiciary system, but personally, I view it as another outdated sensation of the time.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good, but hasn't aged all that well","There's no doubt that in the time this movie was released, it made quite an impact, an in many aspects it's still a good movie. The anti-racist message this movie carries might not be as bold as when the movie was released, but since racism is still happening around the world, it never hurts to warn against it. No problems here.Overall, the movie also makes a well-made impression. The acting is good (I'm surprised that a movie this old sports such good performances by children), telling everything from the perspective of the little girl work surprisingly well, too, and the movie is very honest and direct, without the sentimentality or audience manipulation you'd probably see in (most) modern movies about such serious themes.However, I think this movie hasn't aged particularly well. By now, we've just come to expect a bit more of movies in terms of plot and cinematography. In ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" the plot is rather simple, the pacing very slow (with way too much time spent on the children and their games), and the cinematography very static.Ultimately, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is still a well-made, genuinely honest and touching movie with a message that manages to still be quite good in spite of its (when compared to modern movies) cozy pacing, static cinematography, and somewhat simple plot*** out of **** stars",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A classic? How?!?!?!,"I have read the novel & seen the movie, & I don't understand why everyone says it's great. I hated both, though the film was a tad better than the novel. Gregory Peck is probably the only good thing about the film. However, he is like Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi. His scenes are solemn, while just about everything else is goofy.There are several things I didn't like about both the film & the novel. First, the names. We have two Greek names (note, this is the southern US), a dog's name, a pickle, an onomatopoeia, and a name that's being pronounced 3 different ways. Second, Dil should not have been written into the story in the first place. He was annoying in the book, & even more annoying in the movie. He had one of the most annoying voices I've ever heard, it looked like his head was too big for his body, and if he's so rich why does he only have one change of clothes? Third, events that were irrelevant to the story. There were a lot more in the novel, which the screenwriters were smart enough to leave out. In the film, there are only two big ones: Mrs. DuBose & the mad dog problem. The last one I'm going to talk about is how fast Jem matures. He's only 12! To quote Cameron Crowe's film Almost Famous, ""You've robbed him of an adolescence!!"" I'd explain more things I didn't like, but I have a word limit.So in conclusion, I thought this was a bad film, though I thought the novel was worse. If you haven't read it yet, don't waste your time. I've seen the movie twice and I don't get why it's such a classic.

A Great Film Adaptation Of A Great Book.,"I am not much of a reader, so I don't usually compare movies that are based on books. However, I sort of have to with To Kill A Mockingbird. I read the book for English when I was a high school junior, and I actually found the movie on Blu-ray around that time.That was 7 years ago, and I saw it again today on TCM. It was being played for Father's Day. Even on its own, it is a great film, and it's one of the best adaptations of a book ever created, and one of the best movies I have ever seen.To Kill A Mockingbird follows Scout, a tomboy with a brother named Jem, and a summer friend named Dill. They live in the South in the Depression Era, where racist prejudice is abundant in town, but not from her lawyer widower father Atticus, played by Gregory Peck in his most famous role.Atticus takes on a big case, one that has the whole town talking. Tom Robinson, a common black man in the town, is accused of raping a white woman. Atticus is the only white man in town who thinks that he is innocent, and that causes a stirrup in their town.Like I said, I can't write about the movie without mentioning the book. Luckily, even that is praise. The book by Harper Lee is already a fantastic classic novel, and one of the best books I have ever read.The movie follows the book very closely, very little is taken away and I don't think anything is added, apart from maybe some dialogue. Those who love movies that stay close to books will adore To Kill A Mockingbird.To Kill A Mockingbird is also one of the finest courtroom dramas ever made, one to rank with 12 Angry Men, A Few Good Men, and Judgement At Nuremberg.The acting is also superb, especially from Gregory Peck, who won an Oscar for playing Atticus. In fact, the American Film Institue (AFI) named Atticus Finch the #1 Hero of American Cinema.His acting shines best near the end, when he gives a powerful and riveting summation speech in court. It's a 6.5 minute speech, and Gregory Peck did it all in one single take. How he memorized that so well is beyond me, but he deserves much acclamation for that scene alone. It's a miracle.Speaking of that scene being riveting, I watched it on YouTube once and never looked at the time stamp, I was so invested.Harper Lee, who wrote the novel, also loved his performance. She based Atticus on her own father, and said that Gregory Peck was the only actor who could have played Atticus. She even gave Peck her father's pocket watch, and refused to let any sequel or series be made on screen, since no one else could fill the role other than him.The kids are wonderful in their roles too, particularly Mary Badham, who plays Scout. Fun Fact: Her and Gregory Peck remained good friends up until Peck died, 41 years after the movie's release. They even still called each other Atticus and Scout.Also, there is a minor character named Boo Radley who speaks no lines. This is the first major film role of Robert Duvall, a whole decade before he played Tom Hagen in The Godfather.To Kill A Mockingbird is an absolute masterpiece. The pace may slow down a time or 2, but that is a very nit-picky flaw (the size of a period on a page) in an otherwise excellent movie.It was even nominated for Best Picture at the 1963 Oscars, however it lost to Lawrence of Arabia. That's not a bad movie by any means, but if Best Picture winners were up to me, I'd pick this before Lawrence of Arabia.Regardless if you are a bookworm who wants a great book to film adaptation, a film buff who loves classic movies like me, or you just want a really wonderful movie to kill 2 hours of your day, there are few movies that I could recommend any higher than To Kill A Mockingbird.Happy Father's Day.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"disturbing, but not for the reasons (probably) intended","I have seen this film several times over the years, from childhood to middle age. I used to like it better, as a child, than I do now, as a middle-aged woman. Parts of the film, most notably the lyrical and sometimes humorous treatment of childhood and maturation, remain moving and beautiful. The segments about the unbalanced neighbor are just as scary for me today as in the 1960's. I wish to raise a point on which I will concede that I am acutely sensitive. What bothers me about this film (and probably would about the book, tho' I haven't read it) is its treatment of the white woman and her allegation--namely, that she must (of course!) be lying. I'm well aware that there was and is plenty of racism in our society, and that grave injustices have been and sometimes still are committed. However, all too often members of society seek to ""make up"" (as tho' that were possible) for past injustices by inflicting new ones, or to use this line of reasoning as an excuse to not deal with real problems. I spent 17 1/2 years in school and I've been in the working world for a quarter-century in several different organizations; in all of these places, I've experienced a lot of harassment, both physical and verbal. I can assure you that even today, supervisors, coworkers, the whole personnel and management apparatus will do practically anything to avoid having to deal with harassment, particularly sexual harassment, just as they failed to deal effectively with it in any of the schools I attended. To use a legal term, the burden of proof rests squarely on the accuser, to report, document, and (my personal favorite!), explain why the person would do what he's doing, rather than put the harasser on notice that his behavior is totally unacceptable and must stop. No, instead these caring/sharing/wonderful folks in society want to examine your words and deeds to see whether you did anything to provoke the harasser. Then come the excuses; he's having problems at home/school/work, so you should exercise a little forbearance when he hits you, screams obscenities at you, and otherwise treats you like dirt. Or, he comes from a ""different culture"" (which, near as I can tell, is code for he's from somewhere--perhaps from somewhere as nearby as his own head--where it's OK to treat girls and women as 3 steps lower than a goat--who knows, maybe it's just your perceptions that are off!). So, these sweetly reasonable, compassionate people imply that it's OK for him to scream, or hit, or kick you. Of course the problem isn't that he doesn't choose to exercise the ordinary self-control required of civilized beings, or that the powers that be, thru their excuses and inaction, tacitly but nevertheless clearly communicate to him that it's OK to continue behaving this way. It's rather as if they want to balance the whole burden of society's past problems on your back! Of course they can preach to you in this offensive way--after all, it's Just you it's happening to, not them! Observe what happened to Anita Hill at the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. If that disgraceful episode proved anything, it's that women are the only group in America that it's still OK to treat badly. I realize that in this film, the viewer is supposed to know that the accused man is innocent, not guilty. I just wish the powers that be, the PC crowd, could've used some other example to show this. And I wish that some of the admiring viewers could discern the major flaw in this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
a passable book becomes a terrible movie,"If you've read the book of the same name, that's really as far as you need to go. Skip the movie, it's not worth your time.While the book had a somewhat richer storyline and a better narrative, the movie falls flat on these areas, concentrating far too intensely on the center plotline, effectively snubbing most of the cast in one way or another. Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch becomes the main character in place of Scout, which was probably the worst decision of the entire movie. It drags on like nothing else I've seen, and in general is the worst adaptation I've ever watched, and a terrible movie by itself.

A Classic...?  Really?,"I finally saw this movie last night after I checked it out at my local library. This is a wonderful service of our state tax dollars, loading up on a bunch of DVD's that we all can check out for free. Anyways, I checked out this movie as it is called by most movie fan's as a classic and supposedly one of Gregory Peck's greatest roles, especially since he won an Academy Award for his performance. Without going into a lengthy review, I will say that I went in expecting a riveting, profound movie with excellent court scenes throughout most of the movie. While there is some genuinely interesting, thoughtfully written and superbly executed court drama going on, it couldn't have been more than 25 minutes of this two-hour movie. The remains of the time goes to the two children and what they get themselves into while Atticus is off at the courtroom. While that would have been perfectly fine for say, 30 minutes or so, it runs rampant at nearly 90 minutes of the movie. This was honestly astounding as I thought this was going to be a courtroom drama with minimal activity outside of it. This was hardly the case. Still, it is far from a bad movie, and the scenes with the children are entertaining in their simplicity of a time long since gone. And Peck, while a bit emotionally stunted (as usual), still does a very good job in his role (though I am interested in the quality of the other Oscar-nominated actors from that year because I don't see Peck's role as an Oscar winner, rather just Nomination-worthy.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Another thing is that the focusing was not so appropriate: the focus should be put on the rape trial; but in the film, the rape trial was rather sketchy. However, the junior actors (the children) acted well, as well as Gregory Peck (as Atticus).

"An Efficient, Loyal Adaptation That's Stuffed with Memorable Performances","A powerful, loyal adaptation of Harper Lee's novel that cuts to the heart of the racial dialogue without condescending or coddling.Gregory Peck won an Academy Award for his performance as Atticus Finch, the thoughtful father and dignified lawyer who's driven by moral convictions, but his work is enriched by several crucial supporting roles. Child actors Phillip Alford and Mary Badham (also nominated for an Oscar) play a convincingly earnest set of siblings, enthusiastic and inquisitive avatars for the audience. The authenticity of their lock-stepped performances might be partially lain at the feet of director Robert Mulligan, who opted to run with many first takes, lest the youngsters grow weary of the repetition. Brock Peters also shines in limited work as Tom Robinson, a black man on trial for a flimsy rape accusation. Peters really only gets one opportunity to make his mark, but it comes at the emotional crux of the story and he sees that it hits home.The film isn't without weaknesses - antagonists often seem a little too narrow and stereotypical, and the flat (if essential) epilogue undercuts the power of the film's real climax - but those are minor nitpicks. On the whole, To Kill a Mockingbird is a smart, well-reasoned picture that still speaks to America today, generations after it was set, published and adapted. Jim Crow may be dead and buried, but so long his influence still resonates, this story will carry extra relevance.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the truly great films of the 1960's.,"This film takes place during the peak of post-slavery racism in the South. When this film premiered, and although the South had lost the Civil War nearly 100 years before, the Civil Rights movement was still just building momentum in the South, and meeting violent opposition from Southerners. Author Harper Lee, herself a Southerner, showed great courage in writing this novel. Alan Pakula and Robert Mulligan showed commendable character resisting the not always subtle pressures from people to tone down the depiction of racism as it really was.

Gregory Peck was his pleasant, calm self, but he was a man of courage nonetheless. He was definitely brave: to defend a Negro in the 1930's South, especially in Georgia, did definitely require a plethora of courage. Brock Peters showed prowess as the black falsely accused of a heinous crime. I liked seeing Paul Fix as the local judge. As for the small part of Robert Duvall, who would have ever thought that nine years later he would be portraying a very capable and shrewd Mafia lawyer? As for the setting and the life style of a small southern town, I could identify myself with that: I was raised in a small town in central Kentucky, about five thousand in population at the time (the 1950's) where everybody knew their neighbors well.

"It's a Classic, But...","...to be honest I expected a bit more: Having heard so much praise for ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" since my childhood, and with the added fact that it enjoys a permanent position in IMDb's top 250, I had very high expectations for this classic film. However, when I recently watched it, I was somewhat deflated: Expecting a 9/10 or 10/10 film, I could barely give it a 7/10. Here is why:""TKAM"" is about the story of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), an idealistic lawyer in America's South, who defends a wrongly accused black man (B. Peters) during the depression era; his passionate defense drives him to face the hostility of his racist fellow citizens. Although the story sounds like a courtroom drama, in fact it is hardly such: The plot revolves around the everyday life of the two little kids of Finch (M. Badham and P. Alford), with the trial being rather out of focus, and portrayed in a piecemeal way.This last point is the grave weakness of the film, at least in my humble opinion. Everything else is fine: The acting is superb (with the two children definitely stealing the show, despite Peck's indisputable calibre), the atmosphere of the small city is skillfully presented, and of course, the anti-racist message of the movie is powerful. Yet, the problem is that ""TKAM"" continuously preoccupies us with the children's games and mischiefs, thus distracting us from following soberly (a) the capture and trial of the accused man, (b) the clash between Finch and his co-villagers, and (c) the clarification of what finally happened and who is responsible. In other words, the film fails to keep the focus on where I believe it should remain from the beginning to end: Finch, the defendant, and the community.I am aware that at the time when this film was produced (early sixties), the issue of racism was still considered a taboo, and thus the launch of ""TKAM"" probably would touch sensitive cords; perhaps this explains the rather childish and melodramatic approach used by its producers, as they were possibly trying to take off some heat from its core message. This might be OK for the sixties, seventies, or even eighties. Yet, by watching it in 2004, I definitely left only partially satisfied. ""TKAM"" is a classic, yes: But if it had been produced today from scratch, I believe it would be much more focused and coherent.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Of course the two children do what kids do, they do get better, especially Scout our narrator who learns important life lessons. Of all of them, the one that stuck with me the most was ""you can never understand a person until you have crawled inside their skin and walked around in it"". Some people may to this day balk at watching a black and white picture, but the time period it takes place in and the style of the story is enhanced by being in black and white.

Just Call Me Iconoclastic,"The courtroom procedure is the worst ever shown on the big screen. Lawyer Finch never brought up the impossibility of a one handed rapist to choke his victim as described. He did a silly exercise to show the girl's father was left-handed yet never brought this point home. He never brought up character references to show the reliability of the defendant. This oversight even existed in the novel, even though Tom's employer interrupted the court to pronounce this fact, and was dismissed from court. Prior to the trial the movie was more believable than the novel, which portrayed a first grade girl with vocabulary and reasoning ability of a much older person. This reminded me of a similar performance by the similarly aged young boy in the novel ""Painted House"". Just not realistic. I realize that to be critical of such a popular movie is akin to griping about movies such as ""Casablanca"", ""Miracle on Forty Second Street"", ""Its A Wonderful Life"", and their brethren. To my mind the performance of Gregory Peck is the bright spot in an otherwise boring movie.

But all this does not coalesce into greatness. The drama is too overwrought, long-winded, and there is never any doubt who the good guy is. I especially disliked the courtroom scene with its histrionics revolving around a tawdry subject. It clashes with the film's overall dreamy lyricism. I tend to dislike films based on novels.

An intriguing slice of Americana from living memory,"Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, this movie combines truth with fiction to illustrate a certain time in America's history. It takes a while to suss out the nature of this movie or what it's about. So, we're sort of like the nominal central character of the movie, ""Scout"" (Mary Badham), the young daughter of Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck), a hick town lawyer in America's Deep South (in the 1930s). Therefore, the early part of the movie has Scout be the centre of attention along with her childish concerns and relations with her younger brother and a new friend who is visiting.Later, this child centred point of view comes to encompass more adult concerns and, particularly, a legal case Atticus Finch has decided to take on...the defence of a black man charged with raping, I think, a white woman. At first, Atticus, seen from the children's' point of view is nothing special or exceptional. One of the pleasures of this movie is how their father transforms into someone to celebrate.Brilliantly evoking an America which existed even as little as 40 odd years ago, this movie and the book it was based on must have seemed a pebble in the shoe to a country which eulogised itself and its virtues.Finch, in court, is a quiet and smouldering figure exemplifying integrity and the pursuit of justice. Perhaps the court scenes aren't the most realistic ever filmed but the evidence conveyed is plausible and lucid. In fact, it's superior to the jury deliberations found in ""12 angry men"" which are somewhat logically jumpy. In other words, this movie seems to want to keep the court room evidence to a minimum for fear of boring us. It's brevity isn't a major flaw though.Sensitive issues are dealt with subtly in Mockingbird, but I do wonder if the fate of Finch's client was glossed over superficially without Finch type analysis from the film makers...or author?In black and white. Check out ""The curse of the Cat People"" which I review here and also deals with the world of childhood.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A very faithful adaptation of the novel.,"This movie is a very faithful retelling of the classic novel of the same name. Faithfulness seems to be one of the main goals of this film; Even though colored film was very possible in 1962, they intentionally chose to film the movie in black-and-white in order to capture the feel of the 1930s setting. It also does a good job at tackling the themes of racism and discrimination in a manner significantly less vulgar than you'd expect, though I'll avoid going into details to keep this relatively spoiler-free.Every aspect of the film is finely crafted. The child actors, despite their youth, do a great job at portraying their characters' emotions and stances changing throughout the film. The music intentionally plays primarily in scenes involving the children, whereas scenes focusing on grown-up Atticus have none to emphasize the essentially different world that the children and adults live in. The camera also uses a lot of low shots pointed upwards to emphasize how small the children are. It's a finely crafted film that allows you to pick up on different details every time you watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"...you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...""","TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a crime drama about family love, racial intolerance, ignorance, playfulness and acceptance in the difficult times after the Great Depression. Film is based on Harper Lee's 1960 novel of the same name.The two young protagonists are brother and sister, who lives in a fictional town in Alabama. The story covers three years, during which, they undergo changes in their lives. They begin as innocent children, who spend their days happily playing games while imagining a subject of their lush imagination. The children's widowed father is a town lawyer and has strong beliefs that all people are to be treated fairly. However, the racism and evil in their city are exacerbated by poverty. The children's need to grow up very quickly. A local judge appoints their father to defend a black man, against an accusation of rape of a poor white girl. Their father accepts the case, that will stir up passions in the entire city. The children's will finally meet their Mockingbird...This emotional story is full of innocence, positive energy and charm. The young protagonists are like drifters on the street, which are trying to play relentlessly in a very dangerous world. An excellent cinematography takes us into a mystical world of the American South. Everything is very close, and yet, everything is so far in that world. This is not a strong human or courtroom drama. The magic is present in those little moments that change our everyday lives. That magic is visible through the voice of a young girl, the smell of ripe melons, laziness of the summer heat, wind that sways a swing on a porch and a friendly face in the night. Mr. Mulligan has added these segments in a line with the social crisis in a community. A man, as an individual, is completely helpless in this melodrama.Plots are constantly alternating, so we can think that their social whirl does not have its place. The consciousness about good and evil is a part of a harsh knowledge in the eyes of two young children. Mr. Mulligan has balanced this story between children's fetches and serious themes. The essence is in the relationship between a father and his children. This story did not show, in a credible way, trouble with growing up, first encounters with evil people and situations in a society that is far from an ideal. But those are minor shortcomings in it.Characterization is excellent.Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch is the embodiment of a tolerance, compassion, understanding and courage. Mr. Peck has offered a convincing performance. John Megna (Charles Baker ""Dill"" Harris), Mary Badham (Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch) and Phillip Alford (Jeremy Atticus ""Jem"" Finch) were excellent, along with the fact that little Mary has definitely stole the show as a curious girl.Brock Peters as Tom Robinson was impressive in a small, but very significant role. He is like an injured beast, which is aware of the fact that no one will be able to save her. Robert Duvall as Arthur ""Boo"" Radley is an invisible monster and fallen angel at the same time. His character has contributed to the strong finale of this film.Everyone has, given the time and place, met a Mockingbird.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A voice from the past,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a strange experience viewed with the wisdom of hindsight. It's like two movies grafted together, luckily both being pretty good, but making an uneasy hybrid.It works best as a coming of age tale, told from the perspective of Scout. I wish the whole movie could just have been that. When the perspective shifts to Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck, who won an Oscar for the role, it gets a bit creaky. I think coming-of-age stories are timeless. Treatment of racism, however? That gets old and embarrassing quickly.It is a testament to the movie's power that it's treatment of the racially motivated false accusation of rape at the movie's centre is not as bad as it might be, but it is still pretty cringe inducing in the way it resolves to make Finch into a noble white hero at the expense of black extras playing characters who should have gotten speaking roles.The resolution attempts to tie together the coming-of-age story and the legal drama, and is a brilliant resolution for the first, but barely seems to touch the second.It might have worked in '62, and I think the real reason why people still worship this movie is because it reminds us of a time when these queasy issues could be dismissed without too much thought. It's not adored for its agelessness - on the contrary. It's a time capsule. A reminder of a simpler time.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A great movie if you have the stomach flu and are over 45,"This is a great movie if you have the stomach flu and are over 45. It also helps to be a white liberal who wishes he could be the kind of upright, loving, articulate father Gregory Peck plays in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" I remember watching the movie when it was originally released in 1962 after having read the book. I am not the kind of person who cries easily, but I remembered crying over both the book and the movie. It was with my tears in mind and a difficult-to-define recollection that this is truly one of the great films that caused me to rent the DVD.Watching it made me realize that there is a world out there that doesn't have the stomach flu. ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" is better than any stomach remedy if you are of the right demographic, as I am. I cannot imagine a 22 year-old (one of my children is 22) sitting still for the slow-moving pace of the drama or for the tedious subplot concerning the emotionally-disturbed young man who lives in the neighborhood.This is a movie about racial injustice and how wonderful Gregory Peck is to defend a poor, frightened black man who is accused of rape in the South during the Depression. The sort of injustice described here is now lost to boring history books. Racism in America still exists, but not this particular flavor of racism that those of us who found it so familiar can appreciate. The racism I have in mind is like a fine old wine; namely African-Americans not treated as human beings in the deep South while a noble white guy enters the fray and gets credit for being noble.Watching this movie is like reliving the bad old days when every stereotype is blatantly reenacted and the pleasure is in watching which stereotype will come next. This is not a movie about how hard it was to be black in the South in 1932. This is a movie about how pleasurable it is to remember the days when a brave white man like Gregory Peck represented what we like to think of as bravery and racial justice.My guess is that most 22 year-olds wouldn't like Gregory Peck even if they knew who he was. Try it and see. Even if ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" does not stand the test of time, it still will be a comfort in a time of stress to folks like me.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Must Watch Classic with Thought-provoking message,"A Must Watch Classic with Thought-provoking message and Brillant Acting. My rating 8.5/10.Premise - A story of two children Scott and Jem where they experience the harsh reality of 1930s southern America, and how they learn life lessons from their father Atticus Finch who is Nobel, Respected lawyer. And he is also our hero Atticus, defends Tom Robinson a black man who falsely accused of rape by Mayella Ewell a white woman. Some of the town members were against the decision of Atticus and gives him a hard time. And a subplot of Boo Radley who is mentally handicapped, Scout, Jem, and Dill (A Neighbor kid) was curious about Boo Radley.Features - Based on the novel by - Harper lee's ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" widely successful and earning the Pulitzer Prize.
Director - Robert Mulligan.
Cast - Incredible actor Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, Mary Badham, and Filip Alford as Scott and Jem
Review - To Kill A Mockingbird was Nominated for 8 Oscars including the Best picture. And Won 3 i.e. in Best Actor role, Best Set decoration, and for Adapted Screenplay.Unlike the other movies where the Story more focuses on Characters of Accuser, Victim and Crime scene, Investigation.... To Kill A Mockingbird tells the story of racism, injustice, prejudice through the eyes of Scott and Jem (kids) who are, innocent, empathetic, different from others who lost theirs in adulthood. This isn't only a story of racism, To kill a Mockingbird tells the story of courage, poverty differentiation, protecting innocence, and a story of Scott and Jem who feared and integrated by Boo Radley, And how they learn life lessons from their father Atticus, who teaches them the importance of treating all equally irrespective Of Skin color, Status, knowledge, religion. Like Atticus said in the movie ""You never really understand a person Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it"". Every discussion between Scott, Jem, and their father Atticus is just astonishingly beautiful.The best part of the movie, The 40 minutes courtroom segment where every aspect like Dialogues about injustice, law, and racism, Camera angles, Smooth editing is brilliantly done with perfection. maybe this is the Best Courtroom scene in Movie History. Some might say this movie is overrated but considering the time it came out, During the civil rights moment, and showing a different perspective, I call Mockingbird Movie Daring, influential, inspiring, and must-watch movies.The performance of Gregory Peck playing Atticus with wise, compassionate, and thoughtful is marvelous also earning him an Oscar. The 6-minute long continuous scene in court where Atticus gives a closing statement to defend Tom Robinson talks about racism and also the reason for Mayella accusing, Gregory Peck gave a tremendous performance. The other actors also did a decent job and other factors like directing, Cinematography given such good care to the script.Verdict - To kill a Mockingbird explains complex issues in a simple manner makes it the best storytelling for all kinds of ages and the performance of Gregory Peck will be remembered. Definitely, a must watch the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brings tears to my eyes,"Every once in a while, there is a movie that successfully brings tears to my eyes, no matter how often I watch it.  To Kill a Mockingbird is at the top of that list. The scenes of Scout being shown by Atticus what she will inherit when he dies, of Scout finally meeting Boo Radley, and most of all, that most important journey through the woods by Scout and Jem -- these are the key tearjerker moments for me.(COMMENT: I have read many of the previous comments.  As with so many other movies, I am tired of hearing comparisons to the novel.  You simply cannot do in a movie what you can in a novel, and conversely, you cannot accomplish in a novel what you can in a movie.  This film is so intense, so innovative in cinematography, acting and music, and you simply could not get that out of the novel.  That's why there are novels and that's why there are movies. It's a different experience! I recall people complaining about how major plot elements from the novels Dr. Zhivago and East of Eden were left out of the movie versions.  Well, duh! Look at the sizes of those novels!  There is no way you can cover it all in a theatre!  You must choose what is most important to the main theme, and go with that.  This is what happened in To Kill a Mockingbird, the movie.  You do know, by the way, that Harper Lee loved the movie, don't you?)I remember the first time I showed the video to my youngest son and his best friend.  They were about Jem's age.  They were literally transfixed.  They were glued to the screen.  One of the elements that helps keep us so emotionally caught up in the viewing of the film is Elmer Bernstein's exceptional soundtrack. Then, there's the opening credits set inside the cigar box full of childhood toys, possibly the most original I have ever seen, and definitely a brief commentary on Boo Radley's childhood and on the loss of innocence.The theme of innocence is so integral to this film.  Boo is innocent.  Tom Robinson is innocent.  Scout and Jem are innocent now, but we realize that someday, they could be like all their bigoted neighbors...except for the superb example their father is showing them.Atticus Finch is indeed one of the outstanding heros of American film.  What he does is not much in the grand scheme of things, but he puts his neck out for an innocent black man, knowing the consequences of his actions.  And yes, there are awful consequences.  This is his heritage to his children. You know they will be like him some day.   I appreciate knowing that the character of Dill was based upon Truman Capote as a young child, as this was a semi-autobiographical novel by Harper Lee, who knew Capote.  This helps us understand Capote a lot more.This movie is a masterpiece.  It moves me, and I take it that it moves many others.  (By the way, I have a new CD of the soundtrack by Elmer Bernstein, re-recorded and with the orchestra directed by Mr. Bernstein.  I highly recommend it.  It goes from sweet and lovely to downright frightening. If you've seen the movie at least twice, you can follow the story just by hearing the music.)",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not just about racism,"Almost all of the comments focus on the anti racist aspects of the film and honestly, when I read the description, I did not really like I wanted to see this film. But when it came on the TV, I stayed up late to see the movie and was deeply impressed by it. And here's a thought:It is not just about racism, it is about the morality of the people. The title refers to that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, for those are beautiful creatures. In essence the film (as well as the book) is about the morality of Atticus Finch. You may consider him too idealized, but he is there to represent a morality, and as that he is necessary a stereotype. Furthermore, there is the popular morality and all sorts of private morality that linger through the film. Some examples:-Atticus reminds us: 'shoot all the blue jays I wanted - if I could hit 'em; but to remember it was a sin to kill a mockingbird' (Remember that Atticus is capable of doing quite much, but is not showing off. For instance, he is silent about his good shooting skills towards his children. That's because he has a sort of inner peace and does not need the outside world to really understand him.)-Scout: If you shouldn't be defending him, then why are you doing it?Atticus Finch: For a number of reasons. The main one is that if I didn't, I couldn't hold my head up in town. I couldn't even tell you or Jem not to do somethin' again.-Heck Tate: To my way of thinking', Mr. Finch, taking the one man who's done you and this town a great service an' draggin' him with his shy ways into the limelight-to me, that's a sin. It's a sin and I'm not about to have it on my head. If it was any other man it'd be different. But not this man, Mr. Finch.In the end, this movie is not about social issues, but about moral ones.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)  ***1/2,"Based on the classic novel by Harper Lee, this wholesome adaptation stars Gregory Peck in an Oscar-winning part as Atticus Finch, a righteous defense lawyer during the depression era down South. He's a loving single parent who tries to instill values into his two children, Jem (Philip Alford) and his younger sister ""Scout"" (Mary Badham). The story is told as a flashback from the perspective of a now-grown Scout (who narrates) during one memorable summer in her youth where her father elected to defend a Negro farmhand named Tom Robinson (Brock Peters). At a time when black people were not well respected in small southern towns, Finch stands alone in his plight to help the innocent young man who has been wrongly accused of raping and beating a white woman. Brock Peters is highly sympathetic as the good-natured Robinson during an unfair courtroom trial, with Gregory Peck as his well-meaning attorney with the odds stacked against him. Fine acting also by young Alford and especially Badham as the children learning about bigotry through their dad in addition to the ongoing trial. Robert DuVall makes his very first motion picture appearance in a small but unforgettable part that remains crucial to the success of the story. ***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fairly engaging, just a rather old movie","To Kill A Mockingbird was fairly engaging considering it was a movie
that was shot in the 1960s. Although I will say that it does start off
rather slow but right around when Tom Robinson's court case starts the
movie starts to pick up and become a more interesting movie. Another
good thing about this movie is that other than skipping a few parts it
was a lot like the book that was written and the book was very well
done as well. I think the only weakness of this movie is that it was
shot in the 1960s so being so old the acting isn't always as great and
it was in black and white which can also be less appealing to some
people, mainly teenagers that haven't been exposed to black and white
movies and might not like them as much. All in all, it was a pretty
solid movie, Gregory Peck did a very good job acting as Atticus Finch,
although the rest of the acting wasn't that great but that wasn't all
that relevant because Atticus was really the main guy to watch in the
movie. I'd say give it a watch unless you aren't interested in black
and white or old movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wonderful film in all respects!,"""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is a masterpiece to me.  The film in its quiet way speaks volumes about racism in America.The performances in the film:  Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, and Brock Peters were outstanding.  I believe that Mr. Peck has said that ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was his proudest accomplishment on film.  To me, Gregory Peck has always been my favorite screen actor.  No matter what role he has every played, you believed what he said.  His remarks in the courtroom scenes were so heartwrenching.  Atticus Finch was a wonderful character.  He stood up for what he believed in even though he was being ridiculed by his friends!In this age of technology, I sincerely hope that someone doesn't ""remake"" or ""colorize"" this classic film.  To do so would be to destroy a truly magnificent film.  To all those studio executives in Hollywood, please listen to your public ---- please, please do not remake this wonderful film.You owe it to yourself to see this film.

Atticus Finch and His Mockingbirds,"what is it that makes this film different and so much better then many other similar films?well first of all it has the great Atticus Finch (Gregory Pack) in it, who delivers an outstanding heroic and historic acting performance, that will make it hard for each and every one to stay indifferent to.second of all, after watching it it will be clear that it is not just one more film that comes to tell us a civil rights story in which the black person turns out to be the victim.in my opinion the whole Tom Robinson story in 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is only secondary.it is a good connection between the children and their fathers enemy that thanks to his attack the real mockingbird of the story is revealed.you can try for hours but trust me this is the only way in which a person like Atticus Finch could create himself a true enemy, by representing and protecting someone that is hated.with Tom Robinson being secondary we are left with the children being what makes this film so great.Jem, Dill and Scout that the whole film is narrated through her eyes.we get the summer adventures of those three children's childhood years and even if this doesn't sound too exciting it is just an extraordinary thing to watch.'To Kill A Mockingbird' is simply unforgettable, a film that will stick with you long after you finish watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passing.","With three wins among eight Oscar nominations, this is one of the best pictures of all times.

It was also Phillip Alford's first film. Both of these children performed as well as many actors with years more experience. Of course, Horton Foote's Oscar-winning screenplay, based upon Harper Lee's novel contributed immensely, but the two young actors really made you believe you were watching real characters.In an interesting note, it was also Robert Duvall's first film. He was the ""Boo"" Radley referred to throughout and not seen until the end.The summation given by Peck has to be one of the greatest of all times, and he truly was, in the words of Miss Maudie, ""born to do our unpleasant jobs for us...""

Give it up for Elmer Bernstein,"I can't say enough good things about this film. It's one of my personal top ten films of all time. One of the best things is the music by Elmer Bernstein.

I want to zero in on the quality musical score. It really drove home the emotional impact. Bernstein captured the curiosity and fear the kids had for Boo Radley, that later became understanding and appreciation.

Pretty average white guilt apologetic piece of cinema,"It's a good film in that it's got content, that is well executed, by strong acting throughout, and a good moral at the center of it.It's overrated in that it's really not a brilliant film but was one of the first big films that put the oppression of the American black man in the foreground of the plot, with a very strong emphasis on the injustice of racial discrimination. Most of the film's strength, the thing most people will remember, is that scene at the trial of the black worker. But there isn't in fact anything cinematically exceptional about that scene, or anything else here for that matter.It's slightly untidy as well, and a bit disjointed. As the film starts it seems we'll the protagonists will be the group of children which we closely follow the adventures of, until a drastic change in atmosphere occurs as we're plunged right into the trial's guts; and it seems the momentum built in one area of the film goes silent for a new one to take rise, and so on; the dynamics are on alternative current. Just take the film's very title and tagline: 'to kill a mocking bird'. It isn't obvious until the very last scene, an ambiguous ending really, where it seems the film loses a lot of what it's setting out to do in the first place.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

An Incredible Masterpiece!,"To Kill A Mockingbird is a film that could very well be two films. It's a drama about growing up and coming of age during an era of civil rights unrest. But that civil rights unrest also is the subject of the second ""film,"" a courtroom drama featuring a black man wrongfully convicted of a crime. This is a fantastic movie and one of the best movies to come out of the 1960's. But the racial themes underlying this film is still relevant today, and perhaps people should pay more attention to Gregory Peck's speech at the end of the movie regarding racism. There have never been more truer words spoken on film. I loved every aspect of the film from the very tense drama to the excellent black-and-white cinematography to the satisfying ending to the excellent score by Elmer Bernstein.Robert Mulligan's film takes us to a Depression-era town where a poor lawyer named Atticus Finch lives with his two children, Jem and Scout. Finch is assigned to a case where this black man is convicted for the rape of a young woman. The town gets riled up about the case, and Atticus and his two kids may find themselves in danger.It's funny because a film based off a beloved novel would gain more of a well-known cast. But the only star here is Gregory Peck and he does a wonderful job as Atticus Finch. I think that speech he delivers in the end gave him that Oscar. Mary Badham does a wonderful job as the young Scout, and I am disheartened that she stopped her acting career soon after this film's release, because she gave such a magnificent performance. Also, this film is Robert Duvall's first screen role and with limited screen time, his character as Boo Radley is another memorable character this movie offers.Overall, To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the best films of the 1960's or even in the history of cinema. Not only is it an effective drama, it has racial themes that occurred during the height of the Civil Rights Movement. This is one of the films that actually put sympathy towards the movement during this time period. One of my favorite scenes involves Atticus standing guard against a mob in which Scout comes to his rescue. That was a very moving scene and one of the many memorable scenes in the film. A fantastic movie that is part of our history and one for every generation to see.My Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Certainly a fine adaption of Harper Lee's remarkable book, and it is the masterpiece of the 60's, which was a great period in cinema. There is a dark side to life in this sleepy Southern town, moral dilemmas, and racism, as seen through the eyes of the children, with the lightness of touch that endears us to the characters, and a wonderful feeling for the mood of the early 1930's.

It's something of a legend and is reflected that it's in the IMDb top 250 movies at position 46 but i'm somewhat baffled as to why . Grogory Peck isn't bad but his performance as attorney Atticus Finch is disappointingly one note . He won the best actor Oscar for his role here but it's not a performance that shows that Peck has much range and other actors have failed to win Oscars for better performances through the years . The story itself is inoffensive but very predictable in that you know fine well that the man in the dock is a victim of racism rather than a murdererI truly believe that the only things this film has in its favour is that the child actors are bearable , but so were the children in Charles Laughton's NIGHT OF THE HUNTER , which despite being a masterpiece , did not come close to achieving the commercial and critical acclaim that this film did .

"Stand up, your father's passingTo Kill a Mockingbird","While enjoying many novels that I read during my stint in the public school system, Harper Lee's classic To Kill a Mockingbird was always one of the most memorable. The story was beautifully told and showed a great example of moral fiber. Atticus Finch is the epitome of class and trust. He sees past age, race, intelligence and instead views the soul. After watching this film you might start believing that people really are inherently good.Perusing through the list of films that director Robert Mulligan sat behind the camera on shows me that maybe this film was his masterpiece. I have never seen nor heard of the rest of his filmography, (not to say he doesn't have any other gems in that list, I just wouldn't be able to tell you their names). He seems to be a very capable director, however, as the movie is shot quite well. The contrast of the black and white during many night scenes is effective and he does a good job framing the actors as they do their thing. There aren't any effects shots or skewed angles; Mulligan allows his cast to carry the film and that is a good move. The story is strong and the words are what matter most.Gregory Peck is just as good as everyone says he is here. He embodies Atticus completely, as a strong willed man of the community, a shrewd and moral man of the law, and a caring, loving father. Peck displays the many facets of his character as he treats all with the same care. His children call him by his first name and wander around the town alone. To Atticus, they are just as independently responsible as himhow can he second-guess his own children? Speaking of those children, it is hard to believe that both Scout and Jem are played by first-time actors. The kids, Mary Badham and Phillip Alford, are amazing. They act well beyond their years, showing the teaching that goes on at home behind the scenes. Not only are they intelligent, but they can watch out for themselves. Scout is not afraid to pick a fight if she believes someone close to her has had his/her honor called into question, and no matter how much Jem chides his sister for being too much of a girl, he is always there to defuse hostile situations and make sure his sibling is unharmed. Both child actors are very effective in their line delivery and most noticeably in their facial expressions. It sometimes appears that their reactions are about to go over the top, but they have the ability to keep it all grounded to reality. The most fun is their stubborn fear of neighbor Boo Radley, whom they've never met. Although shown very briefly, and without a single line of dialogue, Robert Duvall, also making his film debut, (which surprised me as I thought his premiere was THX-1138 since it almost seemed like a collegiate film, but in fact was filmed nine years later), is very convincing as the troubled young man who has come out of seclusion to help resolve the incident which takes place at the movie's finale. Talk about speaking and emoting through only your body language; one knows exactly what Boo is thinking thanks to Duvall's performance.To Kill a Mockingbird never drags throughout its duration. Even for someone who has read the novel, everything occurs with suspense and spontaneity. While yes, the climax in the courthouse is the shining moment, all that bookends the sequence is just as enjoyable. Gregory Pecks' closing statement to the jury is magnificent however. His powerful performance almost made me want to stand with those watching on screen as he left through the door upon the verdict. Atticus Finch truly is the greatest screen hero of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Warmly prestigious (which is both pro and con),"Well-made film from Harper Lee's controversial but justly-celebrated book with Gregory Peck standing pensively tall and mighty as Atticus Finch, one of the most warmly regarded literary figures of the past century.

The coming-of-age dramatics and the rural atmospherics are ladled smoothly but thickly, and the juxtaposition with the heated courtroom theatrics is a bit bumpy; still, all the trial scenes are riveting, and Peck certainly earns his Best Actor Oscar with his fatherly approach and quiet grace.

Until proven .... well,"In face of cancel culture, this may take another dimension. As if the theme of charging a black individual and already judging him, before any facts are clear, wasn't enough. Also there are almost no facts except two witnesses who may not be too reliable themselves. But I'm getting ahead of myself. This is about a time, when things like this could happen. Ok, so even in 2020 (and cancel culture aside), they are still happening. Especially with police either not being trained rightfully or having a biased view against the black community.And the current POTUS has not done much to help the situation. Rather the opposite has been the case with him. Attacking BLM and other protest forms that have this as their goal. This movie is a bit of a throwback still and yet for some it may feel like nothing much has changed ... let's hope we'll see the day where this isn't true anymore and everyone can agree it was a dark time.

still a classic,"I saw this movie while I was reading the novel, and the movie did a great job; it was literally as great as the novel. Gregory Peck won a well deserved Oscar for playing Atticus Finch, the lawyer in 1930s Alabama who is defending a black man wrongly accused of rape. The important point is that in the Deep South in the '30s, it was unheard of (not to mention dangerous) for a white man to defend a black man. But the story is told from the point of view of his daughter Scout (Mary Badham), who gets taunted at school; everyone tells her that her daddy defends (N-words). One of the most touching scenes in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is when Atticus has to explain to Scout the whole situation and what the greater ramifications could be.I can't say with words how wonderful this movie is. I think that it was the first movie to deal with the race issue in America (at least the first major one). Some people have said that Gregory Peck's face belongs on a dollar bill, and I have to agree, judging from ""To Kill a Mockingbird"".",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
To Kill a Mockingbird: Timeless Lessons from the Past,"I recently watched the classic film ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" dating back to 1962. Vintage films not only tell compelling stories but also aim to impart valuable lessons without squandering the viewer's time. It's uncertain whether they achieve this goal successfully or not.From the struggle against racism to parenting, the war between poverty and wealth, the role of religion, defense of the oppressed, the refusal to take on guilt by a young girl's narrative, and the exercise of democracy throughout the years, the film explores various themes. It confronts illusions and superstitions, providing the viewer with insightful reflections.Directed by Robert Mulligan, the film is a cinematic journey worth experiencing. A friend who had read the book, like many adaptations, claimed that the original novel offers a richer and more detailed narrative. Nonetheless, watching the film is a worthwhile endeavor.As a side note, I also watched ""Holly Motor"" and found it rather perplexing, unable to decipher its meaning.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Does not let the book down in any aspect!,"I guess balance would be the right word to sum up this movie. Be it direction, screenplay or acting, everything seemed to be balanced in this movie. I had read the book before watching the movie and doubted if the movie could live up to the book. But it certainly does. Gregory Peck is as though he was born to play the role of Atticus Finch. More like he's not acting but just living the role. That dash of subtlety needed for the role was perfect, at the same time maintaining Atticus' dignity without coming across as too stern or adamant. I thought he was amazing. The kids did marvelous jobs too. Their acting didn't seem forced or exaggerated. All in all a nice movie to watch. Not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A film that showcases the brilliance of Gregory Peck's acting,"To Kill a Mockingbird is the acclaimed adaption of Harper Lee's novel, which until this year was the only novel the author had written. It quickly became a standard text, taught routinely in schools. Set in 1930's Depression era Alabama, it focuses on a principled lawyer called Atticus Finch, who takes on a case to represent a black man accused of raping a white woman; in the subsequent trial Finch raises serious doubts about the legitimacy of the accusation. The story is told through the eyes of his young daughter Scout.The story is an autobiographical one to some extent, with Scout being a fictional version of the young Lee. It must've been a particularly pertinent film in the 1960's in the middle of the Civil Rights movement, when there were other films addressing the issue of racial discrimination in different ways, such as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? (1967). Unlike that one, this one is a little more intense, as it is set thirty years in the past in the deep south, at a time where lynchings were not uncommon. The courtroom drama part of the story actually only occupies a quite small portion of the film, with much of the runtime devoted to character development showing small details of life, both before the pivotal trial and later after the fallout. For me though, it was the court scenes that were the real highlight, with some stellar drama and acting. Of the latter much credit has to go to Gregory Peck, who brings to life Atticus Finch with extreme skill and measured understatement. He was definitely one of the top actors of his day and this film really shows why. The child actors were also very convincing also, which is hardly a given. It was also the film debut of the great Robert Duvall who appears late on in the picture as the mysterious Boo Radley.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

No, this movie had all the poignancy of a rock.I want to read the book because it has to be at least ten times more interesting than this movie.The story presented is not new. It wasn't new when the book was written. I say this because I think people get swept away by the story rather than by its treatment in this particular case.When I watched this movie I felt lost and detached, not knowing what was going on and why.The music was obtrusive, although it was typical of the era, so I'll give it that. The sets and the costumes were well done, I'll give it that, too. But the only good performance was from Gregory Peck. Everyone else was stilted and forced.The only way this movie can be justified as good is by comparing it to other films made at that time. It seems real actors hadn't yet realized it was respectable to perform their craft on the silver screen, and directors hadn't yet become artists. Even this doesn't totally fly. I have seen great films made then and before (Cape Fear, High Noon), so I know it could have been done well.I fault the screenwriter and the director, and whoever it was who told them they were doing a good job.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Huckleberry Finn -- For Stupid People,"At first glance this movie/book seems like an innocuous little HUCKLEBERRY FINN knockoff -- the pitch is seemingly the same, i.e. ""cute kids battle racism.""But look a bit closer and you see a great deal of smug, fatuous hypocrisy in the way race and class are presented in this dreary, pious and interminable sermon of a movie.Blacks are mistreated. Who's to blame? Why, those no-account white trash Ewells who live down by the dump. Who comes to the rescue? Why those affluent, civilized Finches.You don't need to be a genius to figure out that whatever the Finch family has comes from generations of exploitation and racial as well as class privilege. They are the first family in Maycomb because their ancestors owned the most slaves. Whatever goodwill they feel towards blacks now does not require any self-sacrifice or self knowledge on their part. They have the luxury of doing what's right while holding onto all the privileges their ancestors won for them by doing what was wrong. The Finches don't make sacrifices to end racism, they just punish the Ewells -- the whites who have benefited least from racism do all of the dirty work and take all of the blame.It is for just this reason that this movie/book is so popular with clueless types like high school teachers and liberal columnists. (Hello, Cynthia Tucker! Hello, Anna Quindlen! Hello, Kathleen Parker!) Unlike HUCKLEBERRY FINN, this book lets well to do white folks off the hook by reassuring them that it's only the white trash who will have to pay the price for racial justice.The thing that keeps HUCKLEBERRY FINN controversial after 150 years is that it questions both race AND class privilege. (Wealthy Widow Douglas is just as brutal in her racism as ignorant Pap Finn.) TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a tired, cynical attempt to defend the status quo while pretending to challenge it. As Aunt Maudie puts it (with no sense of irony at all) ""it's the people of BREEDING who must do something to stop this."" The unpleasant fact that it was people of ""breeding"" who promoted (and profited from) slavery in the first place is rigorously suppressed -- and that is why this book is a wholesome classroom favorite while bad boy HUCKLEBERRY FINN remains as dangerous as ever.",,Anonymous,Crime

A True Classic,"To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the best movies of all time. It may be difficult for others to agree with this statement because many people were forced to watch this moving as part of their high school education. However- the first time I ever watched this film was in grade 10 English class. It has been one of my favourite movies since that very day.I read the novel TKAM when I was very young, with my father. I understood the content of the book and asked my father constantly why Tom Robison was treated that way(I don't want to spoil). Now, I alway judge a film differently after I have read the novel, and usually I'm disappointed in the quality and consistency of the movie. THIS IS NOT THE CASE! Not only was the film true to Harper Lee, but it also took the story to a whole new level. Gregory Peck is at his finest is this film - every child wishes he could have a father like Atticus.This film offers so much more than a good story told by great actors - it allows oneself to look inside themselves, as well as where we have come from as a civilization. It shows us too, how much farther we need to go. As I watch TKAM over and over (I'm surprised the DVD still works) I am able to relate to Scout, Jem, Atticus and even Boo.Any film that is able to invoke so much emotion within myself, portray true heroes with brilliant acting, and have such profound insight, deserves a number one in my books.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Wow,"I'm not American. So while I've heard of the title ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" over the years, I didn't really knew what to expect going into this movie. While some others might have needed to read the book in school, and knew what was coming.So while I read the synopsis, and I assumed it was going to be about the father defending the man from an injustice in court. Which was true to a point. However instead we were seeing this happen through the eyes of the children. Which gave a whole new dimension to the story in my opinion, and made for a really original and surprising (to me) experience. I really loved this movie because of it.We don't even learn what the case is about at first, as the children don't get told. So we as the viewer don't get either. We only know that it's something big, when the kids go along with Atticus (the father) to the suspect's family and see all the worried and serious faces. There are hints here and there, where we as adults can connect the dots, while the children stay naive in their childlike innocence.This is not even a horror movie, well I guess it sort of is considering the court case, but this movie had 2 scenes which really caught me off guard and actually made me nervous. The scene with the kid in the car (you'll know what I am talking about) and when they were walking through the woods. Both really well done scenes where they make the viewer anxious.You know how some of the 'classic' movies with high ratings here seem a bit boring that you'd think the rating has more to do with the production values which could have been great for its time or nostalgia (cough Gone with the Wind cough) but no sir not for this one.

A great story,"Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name, To Kill A Mockingbird deals with the serious issues of racism and tolerance.

It is simply a good story well told.Peck's performance is solid.

"The only cinematic landmark, ever, with order in the courtroom!","There are many reasons why ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is - and forever will remain - listed among the greatest movies ever made, but they have all been written down already in the other reviews on this page, in fancy books about cinematic history, and on specialized websites. What else can yours truly add? Not much, except that this film deserves every littlest piece of praise that it gets, whether it is for the depressing atmosphere that so aptly depicts the racist Southern states during the poverty of the 30s, the stellar performances of the ensemble cast (including the least annoying child actors I ever beheld), or the captivating plot with its numerous highlights of sheer drama and tension. It's all perfect. Well, ... almost. The only thing I always found weird, when I first saw the film 25 years ago and still today, is the unnatural silence and discipline in the courthouse. Despite the huge differences and hatred between the Maycomb people present in court, everybody listens politely to the other party's pleas and respectfully allow the others to finish their sentences.

Classic books don't always beget classic films,"A classic book about a noble theme doesn't guarantee a classic film. I started the DVD with high hopes but found the barely intelligible infantile antics of the first hour almost unwatchable. Did it have to take that long to introduce the unseen Boo Radley and announce an accusation of rape?The courtroom scenes were excellent, as were almost all the moments when those irritating kids weren't running around, slamming doors, being stupid and shouting in high-pitched voices.A child's words on a page, especially if precocious, don't easily translate to moving pictures. The film suffers from its attempts at faithfulness. The story is strong enough without the distractions of playground fights.Fans of the film should visit the ridiculous 'Rotten Tomatoes' review by Emanuel (Mr Moustache) Levy. He seems to think Jem is a girl. He says that Boo is chained to a bed (not shown) and that he has yellow teeth (hard to spot in a black and white film), and that he drools.The issues are important and an enduring embarrassment to the 'Land of the Free' (which was founded on slavery), but that's not enough to qualify the film for greatness.

It's a sin to destroy the music of loving kindness,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD; 1962, ROBERT MULLIGAN  (9 out of 10)The film deals with racial relations in the American South in the shadow of America's peculiar institution, about seventy years after its formal demise. It manages to condemn racial bigotry without being preachy or demonizing the victims of culturally instilled racism who are otherwise decent and reasonable people.The leading protagonist, Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck is a father of two (a young boy and a girl), a widower, an attorney and one of the town's most respected citizens, who defends a black man falsely accused of beating and raping a young, poverty-stricken white woman.  At the trail it becomes obvious that the accused is innocent (indeed, that a rape did not even take place), and without directly accusing anyone, Atticus makes it abundantly clear to all who is truly responsible for beating the poor, illiterate woman.The background story is about a mysterious recluse who lives in the home next to Atticus', an obviously kindhearted and generous person who leaves gifts for Atticus' son to find in a rotted-out knot in a tree on the property.The story is sparsely narrated by Atticus' grown daughter in voiceover, so we only see her as a child as she describes her life, the people around her and the events that take place over a period of roughly seventeen months. Ironically, the little girl's older brother has the more prominent role in the story, and since it is he, not she, who is present at some of the story's most important happenings, we must assume that her brother later described these events to her when they were children.This is a story about the magic of small-town life in America and the sweet blessings of healthy familial love in the face of human nature's irrational tendency which drives people to fear and to envy those who are different than ourselves.   It suggests that  loving kindness is our only effective weapon against this dragon though the outcome is always uncertain; that we must be wise enough to see the world as it is and foolish enough to live our lives as if the world were something else.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Warm, beautifully-realized piece of Americana, and now a part of Hollywood's treasured classics.","The warmth and affection generated by Kim Stanley's brilliant, thoughtful narration in the Oscar-winning ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" couldn't capture better the essence of Harper Lee's semi-autobiographical novel.  I could swear hers is the inner voice I heard when I first read this book as a young teen.A woman recaptures a single childhood summer during the Great Depression, a period she recalls with great fondness despite the difficult times. As seen through the eyes of an impressionable tomboy (nicknamed ""Scout""), the story, set in a drowsy, dusty Alabama community, initially centers comfortably around typical adolescent escapades, until the town is jarred by a grown-up incident in which an indigent black man is accused of raping a white woman. Scout's widower father is given the daunting, disputatious assignment of representing the already condemned man.Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch is exemplary as the father we wished for as a child.  A tower of quiet strength, he is a man of utmost integrity, a steady voice of logic and reason, a man of disciplined, yet tender reserve.  A father you can count on to defend you against mad dogs or pervasive demons that disturb your sleep at night.  Too perfect?  Maybe.  But in that perfection Atticus represents everything we aspire not only in ourselves, but for mankind as well.  He is a reassuring factor that man, in spite of his flaws, is innately good and decent -- his saintliness accentuated by his offspring's loving reflection.  Peck's utter sincerity in this role is never doubtful for a minute.  And for once his sometimes stiff, sobering demeanor meshes beautifully with a character that has become his signature piece.The superbly talented ""young 'uns"", Mary Badham and Philip Alford, play the children Scout and Jem.  They may not have had longevity in their acting careers, but here they make an everlasting imprint with performances so natural, triggering sweet memories of our own lost innocence.  Their simple joys and fears are exquisitely realized and instantly become our own.  They and the late John Megna, as their rather frail, awkward summer-time friend, touch the heart with their simple discoveries, theories and revelations.The trial aspects may seem overblown by today's standard but the dramatic tension and poignancy is not lost.  Brock Peters gives a deeply felt performance as defendant Tom Robinson, a man rife with fear, yet able to muster shaky courage and dignity throughout his ordeal.  On the other side of the coin, James Anderson gives despicable meaning to the term ""poor white trash"" as the bigoted, redneck father of a piteous rape victim, played with neurotic intensity by Collin Wilcox.  Atticus's closing argument and the trial's denouement are only two of many highlights, with Peck's speech one of cinema's most memorable soliloquies.Slow-minded recluse Arthur Radley, who is taunted by the nickname ""Boo"" (a compelling Robert Duvall), serves to represent the fear in all of us...fear of the unknown.  He becomes a phantom-like symbol for those who have ever been unfairly judged or persecuted due to prejudice, gossip, opinion, and/or ignorance.  His final scene with Scout remains etched in my mind.Director Robert Mulligan evokes welcoming sentiment without the saccharine in this sensitive Horton Foote adaptation.  ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" never fails to open my heart, mind and tear ducts.A triumph of the human spirit.  It is a treasure to be sure.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"An exceptional, black& white tale set in the depression","The basic plot: A weaving of the lives of the Finch family, southern society, and Atticus Finch's attempts to defend a black man in a legal case.The praise: Basically an untwining of depression era southern society , it sets the lives of Scout( Mary Badham)and Jem(Philip Alford) Finch, as they live their lives along the backdrop of depression-era southern society, in which their father, Atticus ( Gregory Peck) must defend a black man in a rape case. A film which presents its setting excellently, it boasts beautiful,crisp,detailed black& white photography. Gregory Peck is at his ramrod peak in a demanding role as Atticus Finch . Everyone else is good too, including Robert Duvall in his debut as Boo Radley, a reclusive neighbor. It also shows that logic does not always win over prejudice, as Atticus, a lone individual, does not win the case.It touches the themes of racism and childhood coming-of-age and seeing people for their hearts and not for their outside behavior together, and in a very good fashion.must-see.The flaws: none.",,Anonymous,Crime

Fantastic screen adaptation of a great American classic,"Most of us are familiar with Harper Lee's classical novel by this name about depression-era racism in the south seen through a child's eyes, so the first question that comes to mind about this movie is 'does it do justice to the book?', and the answer is a resounding 'yes!'.Gregory Peck delivers a great performance as Atticus Finch, the conscientious lawyer who defends a black man against false rape allegations. His children, Jem and Scout, played by Philip Alford and Mary Badham are extremely well-cast and act very naturally. Brock Peters is right-on as the accused Negro, with James Anderson doing a phenomenal job as the villain, Bob Ewell.Although this a story which is probably better fitted for a book than a movie, it does not lose any of its heart on-screen, thanks in part to screenwriter Horton Foote. Although filmed on a Hollywood set, the rustic ambiance of the old southern town is brought to life very vividly.The Bonus Features on the DVD include the academy award best-actor acceptance speech by Gregory Peck, as well as an interesting recent interview with Mary Badham.In the Two-Disc Special Edition the bonus features include an extensive interview with Gregory Peck, as well as a long documentary about the movie and its production.

"Possibly, my all-time favorite film...","...and I see a LOT of movies.  There are so few films that transcend merely entertaining or provoking thought and actually make a difference to at least some people.  To Kill a Mockingbird is one of them.When I look at movies, I frequently look at messages and values.  A movie doesn't HAVE to have these (AIRPLANE! is also pretty high on my ""all-time"" list), but to be considered truly ""great"", I think there has to be some substance.Some of the messages in TKAM are fairly obvious: Jim Robinson's trial displays the ugliness of racism, and Boo Radley shows how easy it is to misjudge people and dismiss them.  But there are more subtle, richer, messages as well: Atticus Finch doesn't just love his children, he respects them; Atticus also demonstrates by representing Jim Robinson that a good man isn't just ""good"" for some and not for others.The messages in the film--even the most obvious ones--are presented with an air of dignity and understatement, many through Gregory Peck's character of Atticus.  The characters are believable (Jem and Scout rank among the most unaffected child performances ever captured on film), and they present a marvellously moving story.I consider myself a fairly sophisticated film-goer, and I have my favorites among foreign film, documentaries, action flicks, and even animation.  But for me, To Kill a Mockingbird is like an old, dear friend due to its sincerity, and its charm.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A masterpiece, a splendid cinematographic voyage:","A fabulous screenplay, brilliant performances, masterful direction, beautiful cinematography and production design. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (1962) is one of a kind of an experience in the art of cinema.Atticus (Gregory Peck, Academy Award of best actor) is a lawyer of a small town in Alabama, in a Great Depression era. Judge of town assigns him to defend a black humble man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters, fantastic) unfairly accused for the rape of a white maiden, Mayella (Collin Wilcox Paxton, a well-directed standard actress).What follows is a background for a fundamental Socratic question: Is It possible to be fair, in a unfair city? Question imposes itself in two crucial moments of the story, and it is answered by two different ways, exposing tears of racism and other awful prejudices. Peck is heart touching, empathic, dramatic but not ridiculous. In that very year, his contenders where not less than Jack Lemmon (Days of Wines and Roses), Peter O'Toole (Lawrence of Arabia), Mastroianni and Burt Lancaster, a titanic setlist that enlightens even more his (nevertheless well deserved) victory. His speech at court is mesmerizing, one of the greatest performances on screen, featuring only one cut in more than nine minutes. His sons are beautifully lived by Mary Bradham (herself a nominated), and Phillip Alford, bringing even more light to the perfect screenplay.Atticus by itself is not a aleatory name: it means ""Man of Attica"", region of Athens, in Ancient Greece, where Socrate flourished and took the most important step in thinking history, philosophizing about the Human Being, instead of Cosmos. Moral questions faced by the principal character are answered sometimes by himself, sometimes by others, named the scene where his daughter gives to the men of the unfair city a exquisite lesson about to be righteous.""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a unmissable movie, a proof of the wonderful transforming capacity of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Classic film of the 50s,"'To Kill a Mockingbird' would have to be one of the classic on-screen court-room dramas and Gregory Peck once said that his award-winning portrayal of Atticus Finch, a small-town lawyer during the Depression, was his crowning achievement as an actor.The other character dominating the movie is 'Scout', Atticus' school-age daughter, who seems like she would rather be a boy at times. Her adult character (never seen on screen) acts as a narrator, quietly reflecting on and interpreting some of what we see.'Jem' is Scout's older brother. Jem and Scout's mother had passed away previously and there is a touching scene early in the film where the children quietly remember their mother and are overheard by Atticus. At the same time Sheriff Tate arrives to offer Atticus the most difficult case of his career -- that of Tom Robinson.Tom is an African-American and race relations in the 'Deep South' is another major theme of the film. Tom has been accused by a white woman, and will face a white judge and white jury. Some might say that the movie points to social inequalities and the fallibility of our judicial system.The movie is filmed in black and white and this seemed wholly appropriate given the subject matter and austere setting. It's a poignant movie that can be enjoyed many times over...",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Justice in Shadows,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless classic that continues to resonate deeply, earning its place as one of the most important films of all time. Directed by Robert Mulligan and released in 1962, this adaptation of Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel explores themes of racial injustice, morality, and the loss of innocence, brought to life through powerful performances and a poignant narrative.Set in the racially segregated American South during the 1930s, the film follows young Scout Finch (Mary Badham) and her brother Jem (Phillip Alford) as they navigate a world deeply entrenched in prejudice and cruelty. At the heart of the story is their father, Atticus Finch, a principled lawyer portrayed with quiet dignity by Gregory Peck. Atticus defends Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman, and in doing so, he embodies integrity, compassion, and courage, becoming one of cinema's most iconic characters.Peck's performance as Atticus is nothing short of legendary, with his impassioned courtroom scenes, particularly his closing argument, standing as some of the most memorable moments in cinematic history. Badham's portrayal of Scout is equally remarkable, capturing both the curiosity of childhood and the confusion that arises from witnessing injustice in her community.The film's direction and cinematography are expertly crafted, using subtle imagery to underscore the themes of racial inequality and tension. The visual style enhances the emotional weight of the narrative, with every shot thoughtfully composed to reflect the gravity of the story. Elmer Bernstein's understated score complements the film's quieter moments, adding to the emotional depth without overwhelming the subtlety of the narrative.Though the film is a product of its time, the themes it explores-racial injustice, moral courage, and empathy-remain profoundly relevant today. The narrative is both heartbreaking and uplifting, portraying the ugliness of prejudice while celebrating the strength of those who stand against it.A minor critique could be the underdevelopment of some secondary characters, such as Boo Radley, whose storyline is intriguing but could have been more fully explored. Nevertheless, these elements contribute to the richness of the overall narrative, enhancing the film's depth.In conclusion, To Kill a Mockingbird is a deeply moving and beautifully crafted film that stands as a testament to the enduring power of empathy and justice. With exceptional performances, timeless themes, and a lasting emotional impact, it remains an essential watch for anyone who values storytelling that speaks to both the heart and the mind.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Truly Heartwarming, Despite The Hatred","Quite a few of the Video/DVD stores in my town have the 35th Anniversary version of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" in stock (this came out in 1997).  At the end of the movie there is an excellent documentary about the making of ""Mockingbird"".There were two statements from this documentary, which really impressed me. First, Gregory Peck, then in his early 80s, stated that it was the luckiest day of his life, when he was picked to play Atticus Finch in this film! Second, Elmer Bernstein, who composed the film's music (he was also the same man who composed the alma mater band song for ""Animal House""), explained how he came up with the theme song.  He said that, since ""Mockingbird"" was a story told though a child's eyes, he tried to come up with a tune similar to what children do at a piano (simply playing around, haphazardly, with the keys).  Out of that crude dalliance came one of the most beautiful and touching signature songs (once he magically polished it up with violins and other sentimental instruments).""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is about a lawyer and his children, who paid dearly for his (Atticus Finch's) decision to do what was right.  His acceptance of a case to defend a Black man, falsely accused of raping a local White woman (in early 1930s Macon, Georgia) certainly did extract some HEAVY COSTS on him and his children.  As good and as noble a man as he was (and as respected as he was in his community), this trial and its aftermath turned his household UPSIDE DOWN!  There was a great deal of pain, even before the trial, as well.We see the Finch family, at the end of the film, picking up all the shattered pieces and moving on with their lives, as best they can.  We see Atticus, every bit as much the loving and dedicated father that he was throughout the entire story.  This is why (for me, anyway) the very touching and moving theme song is like a song of TRIUMPH and COURAGE  (as they prepare to move into the next chapter of their lives).What a wonderful father Gregory Peck's Atticus was (especially as a widower, and a very busy lawyer, raising two children).  Of all the moving and powerful interactions he had with his children, what impressed me most was how he reasoned with them as if they were little adults (rather than ""children"").  He never seemed to talk down to them.  He tried to talk (and negotiate) with them, as he would with one of his peers (a very interesting irony, since both children called him ""Atticus"" rather than Dad or Daddy!).I was also quite mesmerized by Peck's dramatic voice in the courtroom; especially when he was giving his closing arguments for the defendant.  In addition I was quite struck by the statement of one of his neighbors (to his son, Jem):""Some men are born to do our unpleasant tasks..........Your father is one of them!""In a small way I saw a symbolism of Christ, when I heard Atticus described that way.  Though he did not die for doing what was right, it took an incredibly heavy toll on him and his loved ones.The first time that I saw this movie, I was with a family member who felt uncomfortable about watching it.  Her reason for feeling this way was because she thought that it would be ""depressing"" to watch something about racial strife between Blacks and Whites.  I come away with so much more than that, every time I watch ""Mockingbird"".  I would venture to say that it is my favorite movie of all time!",,Anonymous,Crime

Two stories under a lovely title,"The film is considered a classic. However, in my opinion it could have been much better. I haven't read the book but I guess the film has some problems with the screenplay. It is like two distinct subjects being forcefully integrated. First is the daily lives of some perky children in a small town, and the second is a lawsuit of a black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Hence the second one is a very serious subject that still preserves its popularity today. In my opinion, the narrative of the second one could have been elaborated more delicately. For example, when a lot of men came to bust the jail which was guarded only by Atticus, I wonder how he would have dealt with the situation if the children hadn't showed up to interfere in the midnight. As I said, it is like two stories being integrated. It worked somehow because the acting is awesome.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
My favorite movie,"This is my favorite movie ever. I think we are all often greatly impacted by movies we see at a certain age. I was about 10 the first time I saw To Kill a Mockingbird (I had already read the book twice), and I have probably watched it 15 or so times since then. It is really 2 movies in 1. First, it is the story of Jem, Scout, Dill and their childhood in a small depression era southern town. Second, it the story of Atticus and Tom Robinson, and the relationship they developed during Tom's trial.The musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the most effective scores in developing the mood of the movie. If the scene near the end of the movie where Jem and Scout are walking home after a Halloween play at their school doesn't send chills up and down your spine, then you must have been de-sensitized by the packaged horror techniques of the modern horror flicks.Unfortunately, in this day of special effects and movie gimmicks, a movie like this will probably not have the same impact on an impressionable child like it did on me.

I don't get why this is a classic....,"This is a sad excuse for a film adaptation of an AMAZING book. Don't get me wrong, I know that the book will almost always be better than the movie, but this was garbage. It's so boring. I can enjoy older films that move at a slower pace, but this was EXCRUCIATING. This film is over 2 hours long, yet it feels like about only 15-30 min (30 being generous) of plot played out. It truly blows my mind that it felt super rushed, yet I kept checking the run time to see when the atrocity was over. I actually was falling asleep during it and had to stop it midway to take a nap. When I started it again I figured I was about 10-15 minutes into the movie because not much had happened.....turns out I was about 40 minutes in. So basically the first hour absolutely NOTHING happens and it is a big waste of your time. I remember being absolutely captivated by the book just within the first chapter, so it's not the original story's fault. I will say that the acting is really good, even the children did a good job which can be hard to come by, but that's about all this film has going for it. Honestly I just don't think this is a book made for film. Do yourself a favor and just stick to reading the book because this film ain't it.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not an old movie about a black man on trial in the south.,"This is an old movie about a young girl growing up in the south.  Her father is a lawyer involved in what turns out to be a very interesting side plot. Yes, a side plot.  I know this movie is touted as being about an important civil rights trial during the depression, but the film is all hers.This is a coming of age film that will make you wish you lived with her and her brother while you were growing up.  The book, ""To Kill a Mockingbird""(1961) by (Nelle) Harper Lee, paints a perfect little picture of home life.  The movie lets you slip into that black and white house without feeling the transition.  There is enough tension and adventure to keep things interesting though, this homestead is only a backdrop for the happenings all around their old fashioned suburb.Comparing movies to the books that came before them is getting old. But a comparison in inevitable.  While watching this movie I was given the luxury of revisiting  these characters again, without many of the familiar complaints that usually accompany a made form a book movie.  The movie is indeed, as interesting as the novel.  And furthermore, the movie is well worth seeing on it's own merits.  Which, by the way,  include Best Screenplay and Best Actor at the Academy Awards, a 1961 Pulitzer Prize winning book to inspire a screenplay from, and a warm involved story with very enduring characters.  The movie is well worth seeing period.You will find this one in the ""Classics"" section, so go there and get it. Those old movies only rent for a dollar or so, and this one is worth a New Release price. But all in all, if you are going to a deserted island any time soon, bring the book if you have to choose one or the other.

Gregory Peck Spot on as Atticus,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" as a book is unparalleled. The movie is a solid rendition and I suppose that's the best we could hope to get.Gregory Peck was superb as Atticus Finch. He was a picture of stoicism, patience, and forbearance. Atticus is a calm, mild-mannered, cerebral man that is very much out of place in Maycomb County, Alabama but very much respected. Gregory Peck very much embodied that.Almost nothing Atticus does complies to social norms from his child rearing up to his most difficult task of defending a black man accused of raping a white woman.

"""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it. ""","I always thought that ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was nothing more than a court-drama. A predecessor of ""A Time to Kill"" if you like, however the movie turned out to be much more than a court-drama. The movie is truly about and told from the point of view of the children, growing up in the depression-era of the '30's in a small racial divided Alabama town.The story is told beautifully and takes it time to tell the story in a good suitable slow pace. The emotions of the movie are truly gripping and all have a very real, realistic feeling. The fact that the story is told through the eyes of a child makes it even more effective. All the scene's with the children feel very realistic and should bring back some childhood memories. The way their playing outside with each other should is especially recognizable.The movie has several subplots. The scene's with Atticus Finch and his defense of the black man who is accused of raping a white woman is one of them but the movie never looses its focus on Atticus his two children Jem and Scout who truly are the main characters of the movie. The children have to deal with the loss of their mother, their fears and prejudices. The way these things are handled make ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" a powerful and important movie.Gregory Peck is mostly excellent as the ordinary but yet highly admirable Atticus Finch, who besides his own personal problems and that as a lawyer also fights to hide the ugly things of the world for his children. Also really excellent were the child actors. Especially Mary Badham as Scout deeply impressed me. It's no wonder that the then 9/10 year old received an Oscar nomination. Peck received a nomination and unlike Bedham he also got the take the statue home with him. Other Oscar wins for this movie were Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.Also of course worth mentioning is the very good musical score by Elmer Bernstein. This one is among his best work of his lifetime.Is there nothing wrong with this movie? Unfortunately yes, even though I still consider this a classic and one of the most memorable and impressive movies it is not a perfect one. It's obvious that this movie is based on a book and some typical book elements are present throughout the movie that don't really work out the way they're supposed to, such as the entire 'Boo' Radley (played by Robert Duvall, in his very first movie role!) story at the end of the movie. Also the whole 'Boo' Radley thing feels a bit old fashioned and perhaps a bit too over-the-top.A movie that you should experience at least once in your lifetime.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Who is the mockingbird? Is it the black man? Is it Boo? Early in the movie we are told that mockingbird are the only kinds of birds that shouldn't be shot because all they do is good things for us. Are we supposed to believe that the black man or Boo shouldn't be shot because they are creatures like mockingbirds that shouldn't be harmed simply because they know less and do everything for the benefit of others???I have decided to watch the movie another time again but for now all i feel is a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
An important life lesson,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRDAlthough I am not a huge fan of trial movies, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was a very different and amazing movie.  To me, this movie was really realistic in that it shows us a little bit of the prejudice that the United States lived back in the 1930's. All students should watch this movie to have a better understanding and learn the importance of fairness and treating everybody the same way. That might be a good method to learn more about realistic fiction.After seeing the movie I understood how important it is to acquire knowledge about different themes that directly or indirectly can affect us. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is an excellent movie that was pretty much like the book, written by Harper Lee. It is a realistic film that includes idioms and symbols to give to the audience a better idea of the book and also a better understanding.  The movie emphasizes in the trial scenes but also in the history that was going on with the children and Boo. It gives us an idea of how different the world of the kids is and makes us understand that even though they are children they also understand what is going on around them and with the innocence and truth they can make adults understand them. The characters of the movie were definitely well played. The actors were really into their roles and made all scenes to be realistic to have an impact on the audience.The movie counts with an amazing group of actors that   portray their characters in an excellent way. However, the actor that I liked the most is Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch; who is a great person full of grace, greatness, style, and more. to me the most important virtue is his immense humanity. Gregory Peck was a person that knew how to treat people and was always worried about others. All his efforts brought him to the Kennedy Center Honors in 1991 where he was honored for all his achievements in life. People close to him showed love and respect to this great actor who taught us that we have to have a great heart to succeed in life like he did.Although I really liked the movie TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, in my opinion there are many things that I would definitely change to make it even better. Something that I think is really important is to include the scenes from the book that were left out, like the part were Mrs. Maudie's house got on fire or when Jem damaged Mrs. Duboses's garden. Personally I think that it would be more interesting to the young audience if the movie were in color, so definitely I would make it in color to attract people's attention and make them interested about the movie. The characters were well played by the actors but over all I would change some of them for others that I think would do it better and more realistically. Making changes in a movie is not an easy thing and might work or not. Some people would think that the changes you made were really good and you would really see the difference but you also have to be prepared to be rejected and criticize, even though those are some changes that I think would work for teenagers.Rating the movies you see is really important because it would help you to know what kind of person you are and what type of literature are you inclined for. As reader of the book I can compare it with the movie and I rated it also as a viewer. The movie shows the most important things of the book and emphasizes really well on the main ideas of it. They use good vocabulary that is easy to understand and itself explanatory, helping the viewers with symbolisms and idioms that are in the book. The movie is definitely better for a person that prefers it instead of a book, however it is very important to read the book first and then watch the movie to compare and understand better.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a great movie that teaches us a lot about life; it shows reality and cruelty that makes us change our way of thinking. Racism and prejudice are present in our society, not as in the 1930's, but still here. I think that by watching this movie everybody would understand that life is hard to live in a society that rejects you and discriminates against you all the time without a valid reason, so I strongly recommend this movie to everyone. you will have goose bumps.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Rare Movie About Fatherhood,"It's not often you get movies that are actually about purely being a father, but this one manages to get it mostly right.

No not watch this movie!,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The casting was horrible, for one thing. Atticus was bland and uninteresting, Scout looked nothing like the book describes her, Dill was ugly and loud and annoying, the kids in general were really bad actors, the aunt was nowhere near as evil as she is in the book, etc. The lines were all taken directly out of the book, which is something you never do in a movie unless you want it to go really slowly. The story was centered more on the trial, which takes about three chapters in the book, than on the lives of these kids. The trial itself was actually funnier than moving full of overacting and stupidity. None of the actors sounded southern anyway. The book was actually pretty good; I had to read it in class, and then we watched the movie, and it sucked. The direction was really bad too, and the characters had no depth. I mean, I'm 14 and I could do better. You probably think that just because I'm young I can't appreciate a classic, but this thing just sucked. If people of all ages can't enjoy a movie, the makers have failed in their job. I have no idea how anybody could actually enjoy this or spend money to buy the video.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the greatest movie experiences ever,"In commenting on African-Americans in film in chronological order for Black History Month, we're now at 1962 with the release of the movie version of Harper Lee's novel, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". The crux of the story is lawyer Atticus Finch's (Oscar-winning performance of Gregory Peck) defending black farmer Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) against the testimony of Mayella's (Collin Wilcox Paxton) accusation of her rape by him. These scenes are some of the most touching and intense I've ever seen of a movie made while there was still a Production Code in effect (though the rules of that Code were relaxed by this time compared to the '30s and '40s). Peters' testimony and, especially, Peck's closing statement were especially touching. Since we're talking about black performers, here's a few more I'd like to mention from this movie: Estelle Evans as Peck's housekeeper for his kids-this actress is the sister of Esther Rolle from ""Good Times"", David Crawford as Tom's son David, Jester Hairston-who I remember from ""Amen""-as Tom's father Spence, Kim Hamilton as Tom's wife Helen, and Bill Walker as the Rev. Sykes who says perhaps the most famous line in the movie, ""Miss Jean Louise, stand up, your father is passing."" (I had earlier misquoted this line in a review of the ""Our Gang"" comedy, Young Sherlocks, which starred his wife, Peggy Cartwright, as a child) Others in the cast are Kim Stanley who's Scout as an adult in narration, Alice Ghostley and William Windon in their film debuts, and, as the children, John Megna-brother of Connie Stevens-as neighbor boy Dill, Philip Alford as Finch's son Jem, and Mary Badham-whose brother John would become a movie director-as Finch's daughter Jean Louise, better known as ""Scout"". Then there's Robert Duvall in his scene stealing turn as the silent Boo Radley. What else can I say about this movie produced by Alan J. Pakula, directed by Robert Mulligan, with screenplay adapted by Horton Foote except this is one of the best ever made in my lifetime! Everyone I've just mentioned was just superb and the score by Elmer Bernstein was a most wonderful addition to this great movie from 1962. Kudos to Ms. Lee for the only novel she ever published that turned out to be one of the most exhilarating movie experiences I've ever had. So on that note, I definitely recommend To Kill a Mockingbird.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The film is better than I can present it,"I was happy to find a lot of positive comments about the film I value so high; nevertheless I think it's underestimated. Indeed, it's not only one of the greatest movies ever made, it's a movie which can not come out of date. I would disagree with `Smatysia' from Houston: `The heroic liberal fighting injustice' is a theme whose time has not yet passed. A number of prejudices still live and there are still `a lot of ugly things in this world '. Though such cases as described in the story are impossible nowadays, it's the reason not to forget that they were possible ones, but to be proud of the society's development. We must be very careful and try to understand people considering things from their point of view (`You never really knew a man until you stood in his shoes and walked around in them'). My words may seem naive, but the film does not. It's very intelligent movie without becoming preachy or otherwise sentimental. You come to understanding what is right or wrong simply by sympathizing with the heroes of the story.  Furthermore, it's a wonderful example of educating children rightly. Gregory Peck creates a splendid image of Atticus Finch, honest, dignified and courageous lawyer as well as wise and tender father, who is able to explain anything. I can do otherwise but admire him. The scene in the court is especially powerful; it moves me every time I watch it. On the whole, the film is interesting and charming with masterful camera work and beautiful music. The scenery really gives you a sample of what life was like in Southern states during the Great Depression. Children actors are fantastically good. They are so natural, you feel as participating in their small adventures, fantasies, new experiences and impressions.  I would recommend this film to all  youngsters and adults. It's an unparalleled story about right way of living in the world and keeping your head high in spite of prejudices.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
An American Classic,"Harper Lee is the literary equivalent of the musical term one hit wonder. Her fictional book was faithfully adapted and is still considered a classic in both genres. Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch, a lawyer in segregated Alabama of the 1930s; or the good old days. His two children, Jean and Jem, are typical kids, running around the neighborhood playing with friends and living comfortable lives.All is going smoothly until a black man, Tom Robinson, is accused of raping a teenage white girl. The racial antagonism is vicious and an innocent man is railroaded despite a vigorous defense by Atticus. His son and daughter are in the courtroom as their father wishes to teach them a lesson about fairness and the evils of prejudice. The town turns against the barrister for his work on behalf of a colored man.Gregory Peck was the best possible choice for the lead role and he deservedly won the Academy Award for best actor. He gives a towering performance. To Kill a Mockingbird is great achievement in filmmaking.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Much better than the Book 10 out of 10,"In my literature class in eight grade (I'm now a freshmen in high school) we read To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee. I loved the book but I like the movie even more. The part I liked most of the movie was Gregory Peck's stellar performance as Atticus Finch. Peck really became Atticus for the role. I think this is Greg's best acting role. It really pays homage to the book. Also it is the first role for Robert Duval as Boo Radley. It is a simply fantastic film and deserved it's Oscar.

Good classic,"Good classic film. The other character dominating the movie is 'Scout', Atticus' school-age daughter, who seems like she would rather be a boy at times. Her adult character (never seen on screen) acts as a narrator, quietly reflecting on and interpreting some of what we see. 'Jem' is Scout's older brother. Jem and Scout's mother had passed away previously and there is a touching scene early in the film where the children quietly remember their mother and are overheard by Atticus. At the same time Sheriff Tate arrives to offer Atticus the most difficult case of his career -- that of Tom Robinson. Tom is an African-American and race relations in the 'Deep South' is another major theme of the film. Tom has been accused by a white woman, and will face a white judge and white jury. Some might say that the movie points to social inequalities and the fallibility of our judicial system.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

an anti-racist masterpiece,"I've just watched this movie for a second time and was reminded of what a cinematic masterpiece it is. The pivotal moment in which the jury returns with its verdict is still a stunner. Released in 1962, but set during the Great Depression, this dramatized depiction of the noble attorney Atticus Finch, his family, and the community in which he practices his profession offers a (still) powerful and necessary indictment of racism as consisting of an entire social system. Just about everything about this film is superb, including the acting of Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch (for which Peck won an Oscar) and Mary Badham and Philip Alford as his children, Scout and Jem, along with the remainder of the cast. The direction by Robert Mulligan also heightens the drama.What really worked for me here is that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD generally offers us three dimensional characters (though Boo Radley was not very well fleshed out, and the ending, in which he figured rather prominently was perhaps the film's weakest moment). Like the good courtroom drama that it is, it gets underneath the characters so as to uncover something hidden about them; in fact, as Atticus says more than once to his children, it is necessary to get underneath another's skin so as to be able to understand them. But as a tragic depiction of what the sociologist Gunnar Myrdal called ""the American Dilemma"" (i.e., a very deep rooted racist social system), it shows us persons who are complex, who are in some senses victims of their own thwarted ambitions and years of poverty's hardship, and who are capable of both lynch mob irrationalities as well as acts of justice and reciprocity. Even the highly moral Atticus seems to recognize his own limited capacity to do much toward changing this world to which he is tied. Some of the more poignant moments also come about as his children, particularly Jem, come to see the world as it really is, i.e., populated with weak beings who commit acts of grave injustice.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Important Movie in American History,"To Kill a Mockingbird, based on the novel by Harper Lee, is a movie that is iconic, on the order of the Wizard of Oz and Star Wars. Unlike these other movies, the subject of this movie is the deadly serious topic of racial injustice. The movie and the book highlight the perverse nature of this injustice be letting it be seen through the eyes of children, the main characters. Their ordeal of witnessing the (most likely) unjust prosecution of a black man for rape represents a fall from innocence for the kids and a stark commentary on the sick nature of American racist society.To Kill a Mockingbird is a great film. It accurately depicts human nature both at its most virtuous and most ugly. Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, an amazing character that lets us believe that we as human beings are capable of great compassion and love. Peck understates it but plays it with great passion, and the effect is extraordinary. On the flip side, James Anderson plays brilliantly Bob Ewall, a drunken bigot of the type we know that most likely beat up his own daughter and blamed it on Tom Robinson, the luckless defendant. The child actors, Mary Badham and Phillip Alford, playing Scout and Jem, are terrific and take us along for their trip out of innocence.In my view, the most important thing about this movie is that it stands beautifully on the cusp of a key battle of ideas in the 60s-- the question of whether racism in any form is justifiable. The film is iconic because it provides a strong answer--NO.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Magnificent,"This movie is nothing short of fantastic. I read the book at some point in high school and really loved it but didn't quite understand the social significance as much as I do now. The movie adaptation did the book justice and I love both of them just the same. The actors in this film are fantastic, especially the child actors. Child actors always leave me amazed that they are so young yet so skilled. They made me feel like I could relate to them and reminded me of my own childhood. The movie is focused around such serious issues that the parallel story of the kids and Boo Radley adds just enough innocence and mystery to make it appropriate for most audiences. I've always admired the crisp image this movie has despite it being in black and white. This possibly may be due to some sort of remastering but I'm still impressed. Also, I took note of the audio not sounding drowned out like some older films do. The audio was just as crisp as the cinematography. All in all, this movie gives me the feeling that it was filmed recently and the issues it discusses are, unfortunately, still relevant today. I would definitely re-watch this many more times.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fairly engaging, just a rather old movie","To Kill A Mockingbird was fairly engaging considering it was a movie that was shot in the 1960s. Although I will say that it does start off rather slow but right around when Tom Robinson's court case starts the movie starts to pick up and become a more interesting movie. Another good thing about this movie is that other than skipping a few parts it was a lot like the book that was written and the book was very well done as well. I think the only weakness of this movie is that it was shot in the 1960s so being so old the acting isn't always as great and it was in black and white which can also be less appealing to some people, mainly teenagers that haven't been exposed to black and white movies and might not like them as much. All in all, it was a pretty solid movie, Gregory Peck did a very good job acting as Atticus Finch, although the rest of the acting wasn't that great but that wasn't all that relevant because Atticus was really the main guy to watch in the movie. I'd say give it a watch unless you aren't interested in black and white or old movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Could have killed me....yawn!!,"I watched this film as I decided that it was about time I watched some of the classics that 'Greatest Films of All Time' lists keep raving on about. I have to say after watching a couple of them I feel the list needs tearing up and starting over.To Kill A Mockingbird is a famous book written by Harper Lee. She won the Pulitzer Prize for her writing and I believe that this is the reason the film is deemed a classic as I have to say I found it utterly dull and boring.Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a lawyer who looks after his kids alone after the death of his wife. The beginning of the film is from the point of view of his daughter Scout, who plays in the street and has a good relationship with her brother Jem. They have a belief that a man who lives down the street is actually insane and they taunt this man by sneaking onto his property and banging on his door. The fun of being a youth hey. Their fun soon changes though when their Dad is offered the job of defending a black man who is accused of rape. Due to them living in a racist era the town's folk don't take too kindly to Atticus defending a clearly 'guilty' black man and they intend to make his life hell. Their kids fight Atticus' kids, they lynch mob the police station and threaten Atticus and they all lose great respect for this man and his family. As the film gets to the trial we see the children losing a part of their innocence as they realise there is evil in this world.The trial scenes are not as tense as they should have been and they take all the attention away from the children. For forty minutes or so they are barely in a shot. Atticus tries to defend the black man, Tony Robinson and although he is clearly innocent he faces a losing battle against an all white jury. Tony is killed after the trial and the father of the man Tony apparently raped, goes after Atticus' children.I won't tell you what happens after as I wouldn't want to give away an ending of a classic, although if you listen to me I wouldn't bother watching it. People will though due to its status in society and I am aware that it conveys a meaningful message, especially for the era it was released in but the whole ending throws out the principal Atticus is fighting at the beginning. The film to me is just a mess. I know the book is a classic and no I haven't read it but that doesn't make the film a good one. It is just plain boring.I had this problem a while back whilst watching another film voted as one of the greatest of all time: Citizen Kane. Oh my, that film must have been the most boring film I've ever seen, it was painful to watch and I felt tears streaming down my face. This wasn't quite as bad but it is one of those classic films that people of today won't get, especially if they are under thirty.I have no problem with the acting in it. Gregory Peck is very good as Atticus and there are a few good scenes that I found myself interested in but very quickly I would be falling asleep again. Maybe I'm not appreciating what is supposed to be beautiful about this movie but to me there is absolutely nothing.Disappointed to say the least but there is one thing To Kill A Mockingbird has taught me, to not trust the 'All Time Greatest Movie' lists that are around unless of course they actually have something about them, like The Shawshank Redemption for instance. Now that is a classic.",,Anonymous,Crime

A revolutionary film.,"It is obvious from the opening credits that ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is going to be a great film. Competing against David Lean's epic ""Lawrence of Arabia"" at the Oscars in 1962, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" would have been guaranteed Best Picture if Lean's film hadn't been in the race that year.Gregory Peck gives his best performance as Atticus Finch, the southern lawyer who takes on the case of a black man accused of having raped a young white woman.Many town residents accuse Atticus of many things for defending a black man, and his children (Mary Badham and Phillip Alford as Scout and Jem) are even attacked at one point.This is not a happy movie, and in fact for its time it must have been rather bleak. The hero doesn't necessarily win; it is the opposite of the typical courtroom dramas where the protagonist lawyer proves the defendant is innocent and the real criminal is put in jail.Without giving away too much of the plot, suffice to say it's not quite so simple in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Not everything works out the way it should.The direction by Robert Mulligan perfectly evokes the era, mixing the racial intolerance with the peachy-clean familiarity of southern America. Peck's portrayal of Atticus was named by AFI as the #1 movie hero of all time. I don't necessarily agree with this, but it is one of the most memorable performances of all time and my personal favorite of Peck's.The supporting cast is excellent - Badham is very convincing and Robert Duvall in one of his early performances (I believe his screen debut, actually) as Boo Radley is effective also.""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is not the best film ever made and I do think some aspects of it have been overrated - I wouldn't say Atticus Finch is the best hero of all time nor would I say this is the most important film of the century, as some have named it. However, I do think it is a very well-made and effective film that manages to translate Harper Lee's story to the screen without losing its heart.

Book and film similar,"The book uses the thread of the story (sexual frustration, false accusation, cowardly herd condemnation, resentful attack, salvation by an innocent guardian) as mere chickenwire into which is woven many terrific small chunks of language. That language is not poetic in the sense of using the familiar to define the unfamiliar; instead it works the other way and is shocking and effective. To appreciate the book, you have to know Truman Capote's manner of enlarging the small, finding decision points inside characters and stringing them together in an external logic. Lee's approach to writing is to add another layer of observation: essentially she is reporting her view of what his view would have been. (The Dill character is Capote.) The mockingbird is a mimic who reports the songs of other birds found in its territory. It is fiercely territorial and seems to define its own identity as definer/reporter of that place.The film jettisons all this to give us a simple morality play. What a scandal. If the primary tone of the book is the respect for the richness of tradition in place, that respect is trampled by Hollywood. Well, nothing new there.But what we do get is some very interesting staging of the children. These kids are so formally choreographed, it is almost balletic. There is some movement, sometimes rushing movement, but everything is toward the goal of getting them in lovely group positions. Very theatrical, and I must say, very effective. None of their movements are natural, all come from the director's mind. But they perform them naturally, and this carries over the philosophy of how the story is told in the book. Some of the spooky staging is from ""Meet Me in St Louis.""",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

For example the important scene in the book were the white children are challenged in the church was not included.  Calpurnia, and most of the black actors in the movie had next to nothing to say.  This stopped the viewer from getting to know the black people.  The only time a black person gets to say his opinion is in the court.  The killer line, ""The meanest person god ever blew breath into"" was said by the wrong person and lost it's impact.

"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, AGAIN","TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, AGAINThe movie, To Kill A Mockingbird, is being re-released in movie theaters on March 24, 27, 2019. Originally, it was released on Christmas Day, 1962, based on the best-seller of 1960 written by Harper Lee.Directed by Robert Mulligan and written by Horton Foote, the movie closely follows the book's plot - Scout, a six year old girl, and her ten year old old brother, Jem, live in a small southern town in the 1930s with their father, Atticus Finch, an attorney. Their mother died when Scout was only two and neither child has clear memories of her. During the summer, a young boy, Dill, joins Scout and Jem to explore the neighborhood, and, especially, the home of a mysterious character, Boo Radley, a young man kept in isolation by his father.The opening title sequence, created by Stephen Frankfurt with music by Elmer Bernstein, is one of the best ever done in film, setting up the adult story told by children.The book is narrated by Scout and the movie makes a virtue of this by having an adult woman, voiced by Kim Stanley, narrate throughout as the adult Scout. Stanley's voice and the beautiful music of Elmer Bernstein create an atmosphere that is difficult to resist.

I saw it when I was a child,"I saw this when I was a child at a drive-in movie theatre in Phoenix, AZ (where is was a $1 a car) and I remember it so vividly because even as a young child I understood that what happened to Tom Robinson was wrong. Not because I was precocious but because even as young child I could understand what were the underlying tenants of this movie. The storytelling is straight-forward and yet it plumbs the depths. I didn't know anything at that age about civil rights or the struggle of African Americans. This movie is profound because even if you never had encountered this environment (the South) you would come away with a profound understanding of it in all of its levels and permutations. It has a deceptively simple script that belies it's deep roots and in that way Horton Foote's script truly honors Harper Lee's book. PS--Truman didn't write that book --he would have been the first to claim it --IF he had! It is a genuine, true American movie that never fails to move one by it's deeply human characters and story.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Outstanding acting, but some parts feel contrived","It's a period drama about growing up in 1932-1933 in small-town Alabama from the perspective of six-year-old Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch (Mary Badham) and her ten-year-old brother, Jem (Philip Alford). Their widowed father, Atticus (Gregory Peck), is the town's unusually liberal lawyer. Their African American maid, Calpurnia (Estelle Evans), goes home to her family in the Black community at night. A seven-year-old friend who visits in the have violent tendencies called Boo (Robert Duvall). A widow, Maudie Atkinson (Rosemary Murphy), lives across the street and has a close relationship with the Finch family.The first half of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" focuses on the children's adventures. Judge Taylor (Paul Fix) asks Atticus to defend Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), an African American man accused of sexually assaulting Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox), the eldest daughter of Bob Ewell (James Anderson), a racist alcoholic. The film's second half focuses on the trial and its dramatic aftermath. We also meet Sheriff Heck Tate (Frank Overton) and District Attorney Gilmer (William Windom).""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is brilliantly cast and has a rich emotional story. It won many prizes but has suffered some over time as parts of the script no longer sound plausible. Atticus Finch's closing argument to the jury sounds more like the 1960s than what a prudent lawyer would say in 1933 to save the life of an African American man who is clearly innocent. It was too high-flying for speaking to a jury of uneducated men with an apparent racial bias. The whole ending drama with Scout, Jem, and Bob Ewell felt implausible.It was neat to see Robert Duvall's first (silent) role in a film; he remains one of my favorite character actors. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" truly belongs to Mary Badham and Philip Alford. They are outstanding. But the movie's ""White Savior"" angle does not age well.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
An absolute all-time classic,"A British survey once rated the novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" as one of the absolute must books you should read while on this earth. I think it would probably not be an exaggeration to say that this is also true of the movie adaptation of this novel -that it is one movie you should definitely see while on this earth The beauty of the plot and script of this movie is that it captures all the heartfelt emotion, passion and depth of the book and conveys it beautifully throughout the film while also exploring the important issues and themes contained in the novel in a way that gets the message across as powerfully as the movie did.I have very rarely seen such an entire cast do such a wonderful job of accurately portraying the characters that were assigned to them from the novel. Each actor and actress in this movie proves adept at making their characters come to life and giving them the same amount of depth and dimension that they do in the novel. Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch is so perfect and flawless that it makes the viewer wonder whether he is really acting at all or whether he is just portraying his true character and persona in the guise of a another name and another occupation. I have rarely ever seen child actors as brilliant as the three children in this film -they portray their respective characters with a much greater depth than I have seen in most grown-up actors. The supporting cast equally does not disappoint -from Brock Peter's portrayal of Tom Robinson to Rosemary Murphy's portrayal of Maudie Atkinson to Estelle Evans's portrayal of Calpurnia. I have never seen a movie adaptation of a novel so perfectly castThis is a truly moving, powerful and heartfelt movie that is as challenging as it is beautiful.

"Good & Bad, but music was awful!","In general I like movies from the 1950s and early 1960s, especially in B & W. Maybe I'm lazy, but they usually have a simple moral which is easy to understand and not hard to empathise with. This was no exception, even though it had periods when it was overly melodramatic and others when it was uninteresting - possibly, the book's written words held attention but didn't translate well to the screen.The big thing that let the movie down was the background music by Elmer Bernstein. Did I say BACKGROUND? At times, you could hardly hear the dialogue and the music's mood didn't match the action, added to which, it was tuneless to the point of being awful.

Miss Maudie's fire was not mentioned at all in the movie.

Profoundly Moving,"Before the movie came out, I had already read To Kill a Mockingbird at least 3 times.  I was in junior high then and one of my friends gave me a copy and told me that I HAD to read it.  I think I was only through about two chapters when I bought my own copy and returned hers.  I finally wore that copy out I read it so many times.I really didn't want to see the movie.  I was afraid that it would somehow profane a book that touched my soul more deeply than anything I had read up to that time.  But the same friend who gave me the book told me I HAD to see the movie.  I went to see To Kill a Mockingbird by myself.  I wanted to be able to leave the theater if it wasn't as good as I had been told.It was better than I had been told.  It was as good as the book.  Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and the others in the movie gave faces and voices and an outside to people I already knew from the inside.  It was a profound and profoundly moving book that became a profound and profoundly moving motion picture.  And in one small way, it was even better than the book - the music.  It has one of the most beautiful musical scores ever written for a movie.  The music does not dominate or overwhelm, but it enfolds the story with grace and beauty.If I were required to pick the greatest movie ever made, I would not be able to choose between To Kill a Mockingbird and The Shawshank Redemption.  Other movies are, perhaps, technically more perfect.  Some movies, such as Citizen Kane, have influenced the art of making motion pictures in many ways.  But To Kill a Mockingbird touches the soul and leaves you feeling cleaner for having seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fantastic!,"When I was in 9th grade, we had to read ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (I was in an advanced class), and I didn't like it much.

Robert Mulligan Shoots To Kill,"In depression-era Alabama, two young children (Mary Badham and Phillip Alford) are afraid of a light-skinned White man (Robert Duvall) while their father (Gregory Peck) defends a dark-skinned Black man (Brock Peters) accused of rape. Mr. Peck helps his children maneuver the fear and prejudice that grips us on the verge of adulthood. The prosecution of Tom Robinson, which has become a cliché, is often given as the film's basic plot; but, this is a serious miscalculation as this much more than a courtroom drama. That story is meant to work in conjunction with the one involving Arthur ""Boo"" Radley; together, they give the story poetic justice.This film is impeccable. The ensemble cast is miraculous (witness John Megna as Truman Capote). The photography (by Russell Harlan) and music (by Elmer Bernstein) are symphonious. And, director Robert Mulligan shoots it as a horror story. This may seem strange; but, when you think about it, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" couldn't be shot any other way. It's terrifying. Remember, ""It's a sin to kill a mockingbird."" If you've never read Harper Lee's Pulitzer prize-winning novel (1960), watching Horton Foote's Oscar-awarded adaptation and reading Ms. Lee's book (in whatever order you wish) are a couple of those things to do before you die.********** To Kill a Mockingbird (12/25/62) Robert Mulligan ~ Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Phillip Alford, John Megna",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A great story,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRDTo Kill A Mockingbird is a good trial movie, about interesting themes like racism, respect, compassion, and different social classes. It is a very good movie, especially if you like trial movies. It also has good actors. Even though it is an old movie, it is a good one. Also, this movie won many awards. Here on imdb it has a good percentage of high user rating. In my opinion, I like the book more than the movie.I like this movie because it is very realistic. One of my favorite parts is the trial, which was sad but interesting. Even though Tom Robinson had a good lawyer and he was a good man, he struggled. Another thing that I like is Scout's character. She is good and very funny sometimes. Although I don't like old movies, this one was good.One of the aspects of To Kill A Mockingbird that I most appreciate is Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck. He does a perfect performance in the movie. He is not only a good actor. He was also a good person and friend. That's why he had a Kennedy Center Honors in 1991. He made lots of good movies, so he was very famous. He brought greatness to this film with his personality and with his good acting ability.Even though it is a good movie there are some things that I would change. I dislike the movie because it is in black and white, and it is old. I don't like that kind of movie at all. I think they are boring, and you can appreciate the movie better if it is in color. I would change when Atticus killed the dog, I don't think that they have to kill the dog just because it is sick. I don't really like the end because I think that it could be more interesting to the audience.I recommend this movie to everyone. I think that every single person would be satisfied after seeing the movie. It is very interesting and it is full of emotions, it could make you cry, feel happy, mad, etc. I also recommend reading the book; in my opinion it is better than the movie, it has some passages that the movie doesn't.

Masterful Adaption,"This film is one of the few based-on-book movies that actually manages to bring forth an accurate and true picture of the original story (To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee). Too often, the adaption to film throws story elements far off track, loses touch with the author's deeper intimacy or skips key details. Not here. Because of the era this film was made in, there was no temptation to substitute story for technical wizardry.The child actors do well to hold up the bulk of such a strong film, and Gregory Peck's ""Atticus"" is amazingly genuine. The complex emotions and responses of the children are brought forth very well, considering that they could not be ""described"" as they were in the novel. The court scenes are also very powerful.If you enjoyed the book, don't be afraid that the film will not live up to your expectations - whilst this concept is usually true, here we have one of the exceptions.The film deals a lot with old American racism and prejudice. It is interesting to compare the methods used in this film to those of Mel Brook's ""Blazing Saddles"". Watch TKAMB, and expect to be challenged.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
an amazing film,"It's hard to express what an emotional experience seeing this movie was for me. How something done so simply can be so profound is beyond my limited abilities, but that's what ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is, a simple, beautiful film with profound messages. It takes one back in time, to 1932 - and you don't for a minute doubt that you're there, in a small southern town. It shows us, through the eyes of imaginative and energetic children, what life was like. It also shows us a great man, Atticus Finch, and demonstrates through action the values with which this widower has raised his children: by the respect he shows his black housekeeper, in his taking of a controversial case involving the alleged rape of a white woman by a black man, and in the way he tells them what his father said, that it's wrong to kill a mockingbird, because they are only on earth to give joy and harm nothing and no one.The acting, of course, from top to bottom, is superb. The children - Mary Badham, Philip Alford, and John Megna, are perfect. Brock Peters gives a marvelous, sympathetic performance as the defendant. Gregory Peck delivers the performance of his lifetime in the role of anyone's lifetime.I'm glad to see that TCM has this film in its educational package for schools, because it should be seen by everyone.There are tough lessons in this world, Atticus points out. One of the toughest is one of the messages in this film, that it's not the Boo Radleys of the world we need to fear. Evil is, as Edmund Burke said, when good men do nothing.

I feel Philip Alford deserves special credit for his portrayal as Jem - entirely believable as the boy who wants to help his father.Despite the fact it is an incredibly good movie, read the book first. The movie gives a visual portrayal of characters, but the book has little nuances, little quirks that just capture life.

To Kill A Mockingbird is a popular novel required to read by nearly all students in public schools in my area that has come to life through film!,"To Kill A Mockingbird is a popular novel required to read by nearly all students in public schools in my area. I can merely remember in ninth grade when this book first caught my attention. This was the first time my teachers had addressed the issue of discrimination and we were able to, as a class, openly discuss about it. I was excited to see that this intriguing tale came to life in a movie! To Kill A Mockingbird is set in Alabama in the 1930's. The film was released in 1962 however, and it is interesting enough that this was also a time of major movement for civil rights in America. In the movie, Atticus Finch is a young attorney with two young children, Jem and Scout, and he chooses to defend a black man who was being accused of raping a white woman. Although this sounds like a horror story, this was actually a major issue during this time. Whites were falsely accusing black men of things they were completely innocent for primarily because of the increasing use of discrimination. Discrimination was becoming increasingly more common during the 1950's and 60's because of many new reforms against segregation. Blacks were gradually rising up against the white for equality, Although it was working, whites (especially in the south) were so angry with these changes that they would do anything to put a black man away for good even if the man was completely innocent. This was a crazy time period in our American history and To Kill A Mockingbird greatly reflects on those issues. To Kill A Mockingbird is hands-down a must-see film! It is such an incredible story that every American should hear and understand... To me, it really grasps the idea of how times used to be and also goes to show how things have changed. It fascinates me how much progress we have made in America concerning equality among blacks and whites. I would recommend this film to everyone!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Moving masterpiece with a simple message,"I have seen many reviewers complaining about the simple message presented in this film- of the evil of prejudice. They say the film languidly hugs this simple message, and there isn't much else to this film. I think they are misinformed. Oftentimes it is not so much the depth of the message, but rather how it is presented which is important. To kill a mockingbird stands testament to this fact. It presents its simple message clearly and beautifully, with the right mix of the rational and the emotional, to show us, vividly, the dangers of prejudice and racism. The dangers of prejudice is presented through two parallel stories, one involving the main plot going on in the courtroom, and the other with the sub plot taking place near Boos house. In the main courtroom plot involving the grown ups, a black man dies because of the prejudice surrounding his skin colour, that the white men in the jury dismiss the veracity of his statement entirely just because he is black. In the sub plot involving the children, Scout and Jem are prejudiced towards this Boo character which they have never met. They have only heard rumours and hearsay purporting him to be a dangerous lunatic. In the main plot, justice is not served, and the black man dies. In the sub plot, Boo is revealed to be a gentle, even brave person who helps the children fend off an attack. The children are witness to the main plot and participants in the sub plot, and they learn through these two experiences of the dangers of prejudice. This simple message is delivered poignantly and powerfully through these two parallel stories. Gregory Peck, in a cinematic coup, delivers a restrained, yet powerful performance as the lawyer defending the black man. He does not break into melodramatic emotionality because Peck strives for realism, so what we get is a repressed, but still vividly felt performance of indignance and anger. A rare accomplishment for any actor. My only complaint with the film however, is that it is undeniably slow, and only picks up steam at the second half. I feel the first half could have been sped up by devoting less time to the children and their adventures. Overall, To kill a mockingbird is an undisputed masterpiece of cinema, of a message rarely done just right- a special achievement for any movie with a message.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

One of the finest films of the century.,"A neglected classic, that needs and deserves to be seen a lot more than it is. No other film or series, with the possible exception of The Waltons, has got as close to the heart and soul of rural America as this one.Gregory Peck, in his finest role, plays Atticus Finch exactly as the book describes him - a good and decent man trying to to the right thing in a society that just will not allow him to do that. The fact that we see how all aspects of the community interact and view the trial of Tom Robinson hammers home the point of how pervasive and common racism was in those days. The closing scenes in the courtroom still give a chill today.The two child actors do an excellent job of bringing Jem and Scout to life, but the other real star to me is Robert Duvall. Boo Radley is the great unheard presence in the book, and he manages without words to bring out the tragedy and heroism in this character.

Little Town Blues,"The American novelist Harper Lee was born in 1926, in the small town of Monroeville, Alabama. There, she spent her entire childhood, usually in the company of her same-age neighbor (and best friend) Truman Capote. So, when Harper Lee made her literary debut as an adult, it was with a depiction of growing up in the Deep South in the 1930s. A story built around family and friends, about adults' attitudes towards race and class seen through the eyes of two little children. Harper Lee named her book ""To Kill a Mockingbird"".To everyone's surprise, (not least Harper Lee's) ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" became a great sales success. When the book also won a Pulitzer Prize for literature in 1960, Universal Pictures decided to buy the movie rights. The studio picked one of the foremost masters of TV drama, Robert Mulligan, to direct. Then Gregory Peck was asked to do the leading part as Harper Lee's father. Now, it was just a matter of finding some kids who could play the film's important child roles.The shooting wasn't without complications. Because Monroeville, where Harper Lee's story took place, had changed so radically since World War Two, the film's production manager had to scout for locations more reminiscent of the Deep South in the 1930s. Since the abandoned town he found was going to be demolished anyway, he had most of the houses moved to the Universal back lot in Hollywood. When Lee visited the set on the first day of shooting, she was amazed that everything looked so much like her old hometown.After the film's premiere, an almost unanimous body of critics praised the director and his cast for their effort. Harper Lee said that the movie managed to keep the spirit of her original story, and Gregory Peck stated that it was his favorite work (and the picture for which he is best remembered).

A Fine Screen Adaptation of a Beloved Book,"""To Kill a Mockinbird"" is one of those movies that is bound to fail on a first viewing, because it has to of course compete with the book on which it is based, which has captivated readers ever since it was written.But when you revisit the film after the initial ""it's not as good as the book"" reaction, you find that it's a wonderful piece of art in its own right, and if it sacrifices much of the texture and detail that makes the book so compelling, it keeps the tone and the book's humanist message intact.Gregory Peck was perhaps born to play Atticus Finch. I most admire him and the screenwriter and director for keeping the role of Atticus true to the book and not allowing a certain cloying brand of sentimentality typical of Hollywood films to creep into the performance. Atticus is a noble and good man, and a reliable father, but he's rather cold and formidable. Scout and Jem love him, but they're also slightly scared of him, and he keeps them at a distance. The very traits that count as deficiencies as a father are what make him a good lawyer. This aspect of Atticus's character always fascinated me, and Peck gets it just right.My biggest lament is that the filmmakers could not include the story of Jem and Mrs. Dubose, the mean old lady who lives in the Finches' neighborhood, that provides perhaps the single most beautiful moment in the novel. As punishment for destroying her flowers, Jem must read to Mrs. Dubose every day after school, for increasingly longer periods of time. When she dies, Jem receives a box containing the petals of a flower, the kind that Jem destroyed. He thinks she's haunting him from the grave, but Atticus explains to him that Jem was unknowingly helping Mrs. Dubose kick a morphine addiction. Jem's reading distracted her through her periods of withdrawal, and enabled the proud woman to leave the earth without taking the shameful secret with her. Sending the flower to Jem was her way of thanking him. What a wonderful moment in 20th Century literature.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Classic?,"Based on the award-winning novel by Harper Lee, the 1962 film, To Kill a Mockingbird is still a classic decades later. The film follows the Finch family, Atticus (Gregory Peck), Scout (Mary Badham), and Jem (Phillip Alford). The beginning of the film shows the family in their everyday living. One day, Atticus is asked to defend a black man in a rape trial. The latter half of the film follows the trial and Finch family as they watch the ordeal. The theme of the movie can be perceived as; don't pass judgment on people just because they live differently then you, try to understand who they truly are.Throughout the film you can see the theme being stated. Multiple times Atticus tries to teach Scout that judging people because they are different than her is wrong. In one instance we see this is when a young boy whose family is poor, comes over for dinner. Scout comments about the way the boy eats his food. Atticus scolds Scout for this. Atticus does his best throughout the film to teach his children to try and understand everyone and give them a chance before you pass judgment.The beginning of the film can be hard to watch. Scout isn't the most likeable character and constantly finds herself in the middle of something because she speaks when silence is better. But, if you hold out a little longer, and allow the true plot of the story to start, the movie truly is gripping. The musical soundtrack to the film gives depth to the scenes. The closeup on the woman's face as she tells her story in court accentuates her emotion of her desperateness of getting everyone to believe her. The amazing performance by Gregory Peck as Atticus makes it a must watch film. The lessons Atticus tries to teach his children are lessons we all should learn. It is best said by Atticus himself, ""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it"".",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Imperfect, Populist 'Must-See Classic'","Being a film student, I have known about 'To Kill a Mockingbird' for ages. My father had a copy on our bookshelf while I was growing up (he was a voracious reader). I was always puzzled by the title, and had no idea what the story was about. And, I had known about the film for many years, but had put it off - even though I'm a fairly big Gregory Peck fan. So I finally bought the DVD, and I must agree with that gentleman from Troy, NY. A lot of his comments are right on the mark. However, I disagree with his attack on the Finch legacy. Yes, their ancestors probably owned slaves, and that was no doubt the base for their family economy and fortune. But to fault them as being hypocrites; this is unfair. Can you say that all liberals in the South are hypocrites? No! Someone has to turn the tide in such a racially volatile area. However, the film takes its sweet time developing, and there is a severe lack of conflict in the first half, and even the second half. I think much of this is due to the smarmy portrayal of the children, and the obvious idyllic life in their small town. Also, the characters on both sides are too black and white (no pun intended!). Although James Anderson does a SUPERB job playing Bob Ewell (He made me hate that character so much!), this is a stereotype. Also, the blacks in the film are southern stereotypes too. They're all humble, forgiving, obedient, etc. It would've been nice to see an angry young man or woman amongst them. Also, I thought that in the novel Mayell finally confesses she committed perjury, but there's no evidence of this in the film. So, I give this a '7' for the acting, production values, and direction. I enjoyed it somewhat the first time, but now I feel I watched it more out of duty than anything else.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mary Badham should have won,"I enjoyed reading dweck (An Unforgettable Drama, 9 December 1998) and sylviastel@aol.com (Please Don't Remake This Film!, 23 February 2008).""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is an acting showcase, where everyone who appears is very good. Three actors I have enjoyed from ""Star Trek"" and ""Twilight Zone"" and who fit into the landscape here are Paul Fix, Frank Overton and William Windom. Phillip Alford as Jem and John Megna as Dill are good children actors. James Anderson and Collin Wilcox Paxton as the Ewell father and daughter are both filled with spite. Brock Peters is convincing as the accused rapist. Robert Duvall makes a memorable appearance as Boo Radley very late in the show.The two acting standouts are Gregory Peck as Atticus and Mary Badham as Scout. Peck immerses himself so thoroughly as Atticus that it is difficult imagining anyone else appearing here. Atticus is cinema's limit as the dignified and moral lawyer struggling to prevent mob rule from holding sway.Mary Badham should have won the supporting Oscar she was nominated for. She has great depth and range for a child actor. (It is a pity her career was so limited.) The credit sequence is pretty interesting. Elmer Bertstein's music, with jazzy piano, is also well done.The trial scenes are effective despite how easy it should be to defend a man accused of being a left-handed rapist who can't use his left arm at all.The only weakness that 'Mockingbird' has is the direction. There isn't a single image from director Robert Mulligan that is uniquely memorable. He's competent but not elite. His Oscar nomination is difficult to understand.'Mockingbird' is an important film for people to see today. Before Guantanamo Bay eviscerated it, America used to be a Constitutional Republic. In the 1960s there were many cultural references on behalf of the US legal system. While America continues to advance the use of illegal, extra-Constitutional star chambers (e.g., Guantanamo Bay), 'Mockingbird' shows us that it was once considered shocking for justice to be so clearly denied.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Farewell Atticus. You will be missed. Gregory Peck 1916-2003,"It seems sad when you think that all that is best in a man, personal integrity, nobility, generosity, tolerance, self-sacrifice for family and friends, a willingness to put one's entire reputation on the line for others, was never more eloquently expressed than in the pages of a book in the character of Atticus Finch in Harper Lees' To Kill A Mockingbird'. Sadder still because there was only one actor born to play him on the screen, who, like Atticus, embodied all those qualities in every characterization he brought to the screen. And that actor has gone. Whether he was a young priest struggling with ignorance and poverty in post war China in 'Keys to the Kingdom' (44). Become loving father to both his son and an orphaned fawn in the Florida wilds in 'The Yearling' (46)  or an idealistic journalist out to single-handedly fight religious intolerance in 'Gentlemen's Agreement' (47).  A tough as nails upper echelon flight commander expecting no less than perfection from his men in '12 O'Clock High' (49). Or at home with light comedy  'Roman Holiday' (53) and 'Designing Women' (56). Gregory Peck was spot on everytime. And it has been said of him that he was one of those rare talents incapable of giving a bad performance. He may have been the wrong choice for the part as his Captain Ahab was in John Huston's 'Moby Dick' (56). But even when he went over the top, it was always at the right pitch as in 'The Boys From Brazil' (72) or 'The Omen' (74). But it was his honest portrayal as Atticus Finch which will long be remembered. The everyman who became the voice of the American conscience at a time when the civil rights issue was weighing heavily on our minds. Sad because there will never be another character so uniquely American and so perfectly heroic in literature. Nor another actor capable of epitomizing Atticus with such tenacious force that is only found in the human spirit when the highest ideals we cherish are to be compromised.  But, perhaps, that's not a reason to mourn. For each time we read Harper Lee's book we think of Gregory Peck, and, each time we view Peck's Oscar winning performance we think how accurately he came to Lee's indomitable Atticus.  A fact recognized by the American Film Institute's tribute to the 100 all time greatest screen heroes with Atticus/Peck # 1 on the list. After all, how many of us will ever be able to say, 'now that's the way I wish to be remembered'.",,Anonymous,Crime

A compelling drama and a best written work for celluloid as far courtroom drama goes.,"A compelling drama and a best written work for celluloid as far courtroom drama goes.Written as a novel and adapted as a screenplay, made as a film, the century's most widely known novel is one of the finest pieces of writing. Now, you have half job done, the best work is written, but Robert Mulligan as a director has to handle a tougher task, he has to bring a well written and much known work with life and living characters onto the screen. Man, he does this job with flying colors. Firstly, the acting be it a Tom Robinson or a Mayella or a lesser known Cunningham, all have done exceptionally well. Above all stands, Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, a disciplined father and a lovable one indeed. He brings life to a character of rare dignity that is realistic yet ideal.Told through the eyes of a small girl Jean Finch, this story is one good one to hear or see. It has many moments that give us a lump in the throat. The climax is a befitting one and is symbolism of ""Natures judgement"". The courtroom acting of Tom Robinson and Finch and Mayella is enough to say that even for a brief 20 minutes of courtroom scene, this movie is still considered as one of the best courtroom dramas. That was the power and passion involved in the making.Acting and writing both are sublime and all else just falls in place, be it art direction or background score, they would have been good anyways, with the acting that we see it is obvious why it is hailed as a textbook for classic acting and same is the case with writing too.I loved it and am hopeful any one who see it will.Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between. Boo was our neighbor. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain,a knife and our lives. That dialogue summarizes most of the movie. But the very point that is being said is humanism, we alienate humans with our own prejudices, be it a beggar or a toilet cleaner even guards at offices are not treated as humans as we feel as if we are above them, there is only color and it colorless, there is only one caste and religion that is humanity. It's a 5/5 without any doubt and please request all to see it. Have patience though, we have to endure it. Watch it for acting and writing above everything else.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
the best movie ever made,"There have been so many eloquent praises laid at the feet of this fine movie by previous posters to this forum, I find myself wholeheartedly agreeing with them all.I'll try to focus on a couple of aspects of this masterpiece, TKAM, that I haven't seen many people comment on ... they are ""vignette's"" that add their own peculiar flavour, in small but charming ways: 1) The opening credits: What an amazing piece of cinematography ! With Elmer Bernstein's simple but elegant music, and the sight of that marble rolling along, while an innocent childish voice of Scout singing and chatting to herself, while drawing and rubbing impressions with a crayon. Simply brilliant.2) Mrs. Dubose: A crotchety old neighbour living two houses from the Finche's, who yells at Scout that she's an ""ugly girl"". Atticus considers her one of the bravest people he's ever met, since she was able to break free from a morphine addiction. The children imagine she has a Confederate pistol hidden beneath her shawl, and as Jem explains, ""she'll shoot you just as quick as look at you"". Atticus, in his charming Southern way praises Mrs. Duboses' rose bushes, while trying to swat his children with his hat as they hide behind him.Again, a very brief little vignette that makes you feel as though you are living in the old South of the 1930's.

A great film of the 60's that can blown you away,"To Kill a Mockingbird started as a book, and when I read it, I didn't understand what the heck I was reading. It got confusing at some points, and I got mixed up with all the characters. When I saw the movie, I really enjoyed watching it, the acting the amazing for two little kids, and it really affected the deep plot of the story. The portrayal of the two kids showed the audience that these were two little, innocent kids who lived in a world much bigger and more complex than it should be for any kid. Atticus Finch, the dad, a troubled lawyer, who defended people, was no help to the kids, but moved the story along with lots of events. Racism is also portrayed here, involving hate crimes and other racist remarks and actions. Then there's the mysterious and ""frightening"" neighbors the kids are so curious of. He lives all alone in his old house, and they find out what's going on in there. Like all children, kids are curious of everything and will do anything to find their answers to their dangerous and innocent questions. The cinematography for the film also made it more relaxing, and the story line moved well after the beginning. The beginning goes a little slow, but not enough, hopefully to put you to sleep. To Kill A Mockingbird is probably one of the most important films of all time, because of the plot, acting and it's moral, that teaches all viewers and valuable lesson in life.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A cultural masterpiece,"To Kill a Mockingbird, adapting the Harper Lee novel released just two years earlier, is centered around Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch, the six-year-old daughter of defense attorney Atticus Finch, who's given a case defending a black man in an Alabama town and culture favored heavily against them. The movie both follows the events leading up to and culminating in the trial predominantly from Scout's perspective, maturing from the experiences. Outside of the trial, the movie also depicts everyday life for its main characters and the culture they follow.Right from the beginning the movie starts out strong and keeps it up to the end; establishing themes of tradition, appearances, and societal pressures. The actual trial the movie revolves around doesn't start until more than halfway through the movie. Instead, we see thoughts and ideas established, including the infamous urban legend of Boo Radley, a story Scout and her brother Jem take a liking to. It's exciting and somewhat tense in the beginning as Scout has fun chasing ghost stories and following her father's lessons, but things take a turn when she realizes firsthand the effect her father taking a controversial case has.Atticus Finch is hands down one of the greatest characters in fiction and Gregory Peck fully defines him with his performance, but that's easy to say when he's a great father and his kid is telling the story. Even so, his willpower in staying principled and just against such large cultural adversity is admirable and bold. It's not hard to tell he's a dissident to the traditions of the times: just the fact of Scout calling him by only his first name ""Atticus"" is enough to suggest his relationship with his children is far from strict. Sure, he's never seen openly advocating desegregation, but as a lawyer he's bound to serve and defend to his best abilities all accused without bias, and that he does.But Atticus also isn't entirely in contradiction with the mood of the times either. He keeps up appearances, maintains unspoken agreements, and has a clear grasp on the particular ways the community functions. This fits with the movie's position on cultural traditions as a whole: tradition can be good, but just because something is tradition doesn't make it good. A toxic tradition like racism causes useless conflict that drives what are usually good, upstanding people away from what is morally right. A message like this with so much chance for a sloppy execution is handled subtly and deftly here.Everything on a technical level is first-rate; the black-and-white color scheme to immediately establish the bygone era the movie takes place in, the musical direction that perfectly encapsulates the tone of a scene, even the cinematography is at the top of it's game, with some fantastic shots and memorable scenes. But in all honesty, a lot of that can be forgotten in the mix when the story is this amazing and told as smoothly as it is here.To Kill a Mockingbird, a story taking place in the 1930's, was released in 1960 with a message that's timeless. It only serves right that the movie adapting it would be just as timeless and acclaimed for many generations to come. It would be unnecessary to call the message of To Kill a Mockingbird ""more important than ever"", when it's message will always be so important for all cultures. It's not just about a lack of hate or holding a critical mind to tradition; it's about remembering yourself, and remembering others as well. A shared empathy and respect we should all have.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The portrait of life in Depression-era South is painstakingly wrought, from the subtle generosity of inviting a poor child to dinner to the childhood mythology of the ""crazy"" neighbor to, finally, the finest trial summation ever presented in a courtroom drama, period.

A MEMORABLE MOCKINGBIRD,"Since its publication in 1960, Harper Lee's novel TO KILL  A MOCKINGBIRD has attained the status of  a classic work of American Literature , and rightfully so. Winner of the 1961 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction , it has become one of the most beloved books of all time ; indeed, one survey has claimed the book's popularity as being second only to The Bible !  However open to question those statistics are, there is no denying the charm and power of  Ms. Lee's  prose in telling a story of  the Depression Era South ( fictional Maycomb, a ""tired old town"" in Alabama.) I first read the novel in the Spring of  ""63, just prior to seeing the film version which was soon opening at  my home town's local movie theater. As  an impressionable 14 year old, I was hooked by the  book's Southern Gothic atmosphere, which seemed strangely alien to a middle class High School freshman living in upstate New York. As narrated in the first person by  Jean Louise Finch (nickname Scout) ,  TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a remembrance of things past, at times humorous, often rueful and sometimes terrifying. It is also a memorial  to Scout's father Atticus Finch, a middle aged trial lawyer who defends a local black man accused of raping a white woman. Scout's reminiscences cover alot of territory, and it is Harper Lee's special gift to be able to give the reader a succinct but substantial history of  the Finch family tree, a short but important history of Maycomb County and its environs, and an evocative description of the Finch home and neighborhood surroundings. The  novel's greatest achievement is giving voice to childhood joys and fears as delivered through the mind's eye of the older Scout , who sounds like a sophisticated, female variation of Huckleberry Finn ; older, wiser but  possessing the charm, compassion and raillery of Twain's immortal character. And Lee's foray into Huck Finn territory is brilliantly displayed when Scout, her older brother Jem and friend Dill pursue the mystery of Boo Radley , a reclusive tenant who lives in the ramshackle house down the street. There's a bit of the Hardy Boys and  Penrod on display here coupled with unnerving suspense, and a hint of the dangers that lurk just outside the imagined safe world of childhood. In adapting MOCKINGBIRD to the screen, veteran playwright Horton Foote was faced with the unenviable task of trying to preserve as closely as possible the outline of Lee's novel and to recreate as many memorable scenes and characters that had captivated an enormous reading public. This is usually a Herculean task, and right from the outset  Foote started eliminating several  characters and incidents  in the book.  Gone was Atticus's judgmental but well-meaning sister , Scout's Aunt Alexandra ; childhood friend Dill's Aunt Rachel was transformed into Aunt Stephanie , a more eccentric character to no doubt provide a little comic relief ; and Atticus's amiable brother Jack, an M.D. A  striking sequence depicting a house fire was scratched, along with a memorable visit to Aunt Alexandra's house at Finch's Landing. What emerged on the screen was the basic story whittled down to it's most important elements :  Atticus's  decision to defend Tom Robinson , culminating in the trial itself ; and the childhood adventures of Scout, Jem and Dill and their obsession with the unseen Boo Radley. What is immediately obvious is that the film is not the book. There really is no substitute for Lee's indelible narrative. Scout's first person commentary is relegated to a few sparse musings, albeit expertly culled from the book.  Since the narrative voice of Scout is basically missing, the movie is guided along by a more conventional story, and incidents that happen to and are observed by Scout (the great , often riotous classroom scenes) are mentioned as off stage happenings. However, the movie is a significant achievement and memorable in its own way. Producer Alan Pakula (who went on to become a topflight director), director Robert Mulligan and Mr. Foote have been faithful to the novel's essence. The screenplay includes the major plot points and retains as much of the original dialogue between characters as is possible in a film running a little over two hours. The stroke of genius in the production lies in the casting. Gregory Peck IS Atticus Finch. Not only does he fit the part like a glove ; he brings tremendous nuance to the role. It's a brilliant performance, one that  speaks volumes even when the actor doesn't  say a word. The inspiration continues in the roles of Atticus's children, superbly played by Philip Alford as Jem and Mary Badham as Scout. Badham's performance is particularly memorable. She beautifully captures Scout's tomboyish nature while exhibiting the tender qualities needed for her scenes with Atticus. Indeed, some of the movie's most unforgettable moments consist of father and daughter alone together. A scene where Atticus lets Scout handle his pocketwatch is indescribably moving, as is the subsequent bedtime dialogue between sister and brother concerning their deceased mother. As long as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD stays rooted in the childrens' experience it remains a sublime entertainment. Unfortunately it hits a rough patch  about halfway through when it comes to the trial scene, a crucial part of the story, but one the nearly undermines the steady filmic narrative that has gone before. In the novel Tom Robinson's trial is seen through Scout's literary eyes and ears. In the movie that voice is missing and we see Scout  as part of the crowd in the balcony above, only when the camera decides to focus in that direction. As well acted as the trial sequence is, as beautifully as Gregory Peck conveys the earnestness and acuity of a smalltown defense attorney trying to save one man's life, the trial sequence stops the film dead in its tracks. Lasting a half hour in screen time , it is the film's one major caveat. And yet it is hard to figure what would have worked better. So much pertinent information is given here, the inherent prejudices of the townspeople , the underlying behavior of the witnesses on the stand : all crucial material.  Once the trial ends the movie quickly gets back on its feet and as it draws towards its conclusion it becomes an unforgettable experience. One of the most beautifully lyrical and frightening scenes ever filmed is Scout and Jem's fateful nightime journey home through the woods. In a forest  right out of Hansel and Gretel , the two children take their precarious steps in a moonlit shadowy landscape that rivals anything done by the great black and white cinematographers of the Silent Era. And then there is that magnificent ending, which I defy even the most hardened viewer not to feel a lump in the throat. When  Mary Badham walks down that sidewalk for the last time on her way home,accompanied by composer Elmer Bernstein's  haunting music score, you realize what kind of greatness motion pictures can achieve.",,Anonymous,Crime
Touching story that will bring you back to the troubles of the time,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a story that encompasses the racial issues of its time. Although it is a serious and, ""grown up"" topic, the movie is easy to follow and relate to for all ages. Atticus Finch is a well-to-do lawyer, who goes against social norms by representing a black man, (Tom Robinson) who is falsely accused of rape. There is dramatic irony in the sense that the audience is aware that Tom is innocent, but people in Alabama don't want to believe it. This is a gut-wrenching factor, as you can feel nothing but sympathy for the mistreatment this innocent man faces. I find the most moving part of this film to be the morals that Atticus works to implement on his children Scout & Jem. Although they are growing up in a highly segregated era, they are open-minded and kind to all who are kind to them, regardless of the stereotypes surrounding them. The movie does an excellent job reflecting the time period, through the use of derogatory language and clear separation of the races. For example, in the courthouse, blacks mustn't sit on the first floor. Instead, they are to watch from the balcony. Moreover, the most obvious example of separation is the fact that Tom Robinsons guilt is hardly questioned. And although the defense does an excellent job exposing the true culprit, Tom's ethnicity is enough to label him a rapist.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

So many mockingbirds,"While Harper Lee's drinking problems most likely played a large role in why none of her other works were successful, To Kill a Mockingbird stands as testimony to the fact that she was a great American talent.

I cannot imagine anyone other than Gregory Peck playing Atticus Finch.  The role of Scout was also done extremely well.The message of the story is timeless, and in fact, perhaps more important today than ever before.  Some sad aspect of human nature causes us to reject what we don't understand as being dangerous.  The worst part about it is that we live such complicated lives that those we reject are often, not only harmless, but simple, gentle creatures.  I content that there are two mockingbirds in this story.  The persecution of a black man and the persecution of an emotionally disturbed white man stand side by side, not only as the persecuted, but in many ways as the pure of heart.

If only everyone would see and understand this film,"Based on a book of the same name by Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird takes place in Alabama in the 1930s. It centers around two young protagonists, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Phillip Alford), but it's really the story about their father's, Atticus Finch's (Gregory Peck), struggle to prove the innocence of a black man accused of rape and assault. And this during times when to even suggest such a thing was almost unthinkable.I admire how the story is told. It's a heavy theme to explore. To state that all people should be seen as equals, especially in the eyes of the law, which should stand above as all. To hold to your conviction, even in the face of universal spite and mockery. But to further the exploration, we view this question and dilemma through the eyes of children. And all of a sudden the issue becomes quite simple indeed. Difficult to achieve in practice, but simple in principle. And we're left wondering alongside the children, why is it so hard for everyone?There are some side stories, dealing with the children's lives and adventures around the neighbourhood, but the courtroom drama is the heart of the film and the one thing everyone knows it by. Although I do think that the final scene, which gives the film its name, is also very nice and poignant, even though it doesn't necessarily have all that much to do with the courtroom case. Thematically, certainly, but otherwise not so much.Aside from that, it's a nice film all around. The child actors are surprisingly talented and Peck is magnificent as an uncompromising and fully moral attorney father. It's also shot well, told well, scripted well and even though its pace is rather measured and even slow, you're not going to be bored during any single minute.Definitely one of the classics for a reason.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Don't Kill it, Just Scare it a LIttle","I read the Lee novel some time ago and really enjoyed it. Seeing the film recently I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the book but it's still a solid effort with a lot of good things going for it. For starters the acting is solid, all the way around everyone gives an engaging performance. I thought Peck was well cast and particularly effective in his role here. Some of the script does feel kind of dated at this point, and one wonders how else this story might have been handled differently, as it is fairly in line with the book. I just try and appreciate that this was likely very topical and relevant during its original run and now just enjoy what it has to offer without over thinking it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Charming and passionate,"I previously saw this classic film when I was in middle school, but had mostly forgotten how the film went, and to some extent, even how the story went, so I decided to go back and watch it.It was worth it. This film doesn't have the latest and greatest techniques of its time, but what it does have is a determined and capable cast, direction that really manages to capture the innocence of youth, and one hell of a story to work with. One little treat is the credits sequence at the beginning of the film--it contains some of the most gorgeous black and white cinematography that I've seen in a credits sequence. The rest of the film's ""eye"" plays like an enhanced television ""eye"", in that everything's shot fairly plainly, although some of the mis-en-scene is used well for suspense.Really though, the film has few noticeable faults and manages to portray Harper Lee's classic in such a way that it retains many of its charms and all of its heart. It's very good; I recommend it. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Atticus, simply a gentleman","I've seen this movie and read the book.

On his own.The respect people from Maycomb felt for him is clearly noticed when Tom Robinson's trial ends, and all the African American community stands up just because he is passing by. Breathtaking.

Even Worse Book,"I had to read this book. It was one of the most horrible books I've ever had to read. Then we were stuck watching the movie in class. It was horrible and boring to watch.

Or Aresnic and The Old Lace there's a great movie too. Horrible acting the only reason to watch the movie is to see who plays that deranged neighbor. I'd like to give specifics why I don't like it but I haven't read it in a while but I do know I couldn't stand the book. Then again people thought the Lord of the Rings was a good movie.

One of the all-time classics,"I have read the book many years ago and many times and when I saw the movie for the first time, I was enchanted.  It followed the storyline so faithfully (naturally no movie can ever get all details out like a book)and the movie set a mood that took one away to the deep south in the 30's.  You could almost feel the poverty and sadness of the depression years.  Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck) was sober and serious and also a bit down (after all, he lost his wife just a few years earlier).  The entire cast was very well chosen and did an exemplary job at bringing the story to life. This is a must see for children of all ages and anyone else who wants to watch a truly good movie. Get ready to get disgusted at some of the characters, and feel pure sympathy and compassion for others. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Crime
One Of The Best Movies Based On A Book,"To Kill A Mockingbird is a Classic Drama that is based on the book by Harper Lee. The theme of the movie is preconceived notions and there are two examples of this in the theme: 1) Boo Radley and 2) Tom Robinson. Both are viewed as dangerous as violent due to preconceived notions that the townspeople have about them.The main character is Jean Louise Finch. Her father, Atticus Finch, was appointed by the judge to defend Tom Robinson. Atticus believes that Tom is innocent and is a victim of racism and false accusations. Both are incredibly interesting and the acting is done well. The casting is magnificent and is very close to what was described in the book.I don't like this movie quite as much as the book, as I almost never do, but I still really enjoyed it. You can gain a lot more from the story by reading the book but if you are looking for a way to see the story in a short amount of time, this is a great film to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The American Classic,"Up in Canada, To Kill A Mockingbird was our novel studied in the eighth grade. I don't remember too much about Grade 8 now, and even less about the book, except that it was dreadfully boring for a 13-year old: I was too preoccupied by Lord of the Flies. Not even the movie could gather my interest.I'm a bit older now and a lot more educated, so it was time to really take in this treasured film. And wow, what a difference a few years makes. This film, extraordinarily faithful to the source, grabs the atmosphere and setting of the film and spells it out on screen. TKAM is a wonderful story of adult issues through a child's eyes, under the watchful eye of moral hero Atticus Finch.In just over two hours the effects of the Depression in the South is seen, as well as the lingering racism and prejudice of the Civil War, the vivid imagination of children and the effect a strong parent can have on children. The themes have very positive stances: this is no Grapes of Wrath. The film is family-friendly except for several contextual uses of the N- word.Though it is a positive film, it is not an easy viewing. Like any great example of any medium, To Kill A Mockingbird is dense and not extremely easy to follow, due in part to its age and content- there's virtually no ""action"" and the one true scene of physical conflict is weak compared to the rest of the film. Another way to say it is that if you have a meeting with a film buff and you want to appear smart but haven't seen many classic films, don't start with this one.I remember seeing the AFI's Heroes and Villains list and being a little put off by Atticus' place... but I can't now. He's a model parent and an inspiration to all- he has integrity and a calm persona, never letting his temper flare. Peck's voice is so assuring, and he just looks like an upstanding citizen who knows that kids are kids and that it's more important to go with what you believe is right than what others would try to make you do.Seeing To Kill A Mockingbird is to read the book- a slow but expansive look at a slice of time through young eyes. It's a shame this came out in the same year as Lawrence of Arabia- one year either way and it may have received the awards to place it physically in the halls of time, if not our hearts. 9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Timeless Tale of Justice and Morality Unfolds,"Experiencing ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was like stepping into a time capsule that transported me to the heart of a small Southern town in the 1930s. The film's ability to capture the innocence of childhood against the backdrop of deep-seated racial prejudice is nothing short of remarkable. As I settled into my seat, I felt an immediate connection to Scout and Jem, whose curiosity and bravery resonated with my own childhood memories of exploring the world around me.Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch is iconic, embodying the moral compass of the story with a quiet strength that is both inspiring and heartbreaking. His unwavering commitment to justice, despite the overwhelming odds stacked against him, left me in awe. The courtroom scenes are etched in my mind, particularly the moment when he delivers his closing argument. It was as if time stood still; the tension in the room was palpable, and I felt every ounce of emotion that flowed from the screen.The cinematography beautifully captured the essence of the era, with its warm, sun-soaked streets and the looming shadow of the courthouse. Each frame felt like a painting, meticulously crafted to evoke a sense of nostalgia and urgency. The children's performances were a delightful surprise; their innocence and genuine reactions added layers of authenticity to the narrative. I found myself laughing at their playful antics, only to be quickly reminded of the harsh realities that surrounded them.One of the film's most poignant aspects is its exploration of empathy and understanding. The character of Boo Radley, initially perceived as a monster, ultimately becomes a symbol of kindness and protection. This transformation mirrored my own journey of learning to look beyond surface appearances, a lesson that remains relevant today.While the film does omit some of the book's humor and secondary characters, I found that it maintained the spirit of Harper Lee's masterpiece. The emotional weight of the story lingered long after the credits rolled, prompting me to reflect on the themes of justice, morality, and the loss of innocence.""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is not just a film; it's a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up for what is right, even when the world seems to be against you. It's a cinematic experience that I believe everyone should witness at least once in their lifetime.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a great film,"I saw this film for the first time in my late 20's and wasn't sure if I would like it without any major special effects or huge production costs. What I found was a story about morality and justice and the fact that justice isn't always done. This film touched me in many ways and showed how one honorable man can make a difference in the world. This film was made before the civil rights movement really took off in America and yet takes a great stand for the rights of the individual. The fact that the story is told from the perspective of Atticus Finch's daughter was a great twist. The mixture of real life problems with the wonders of a child's summer vacation give this film a great ""American"" feel. I highly recommend this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Faulkner vs Harper Lee,"I don 't really understand why people prefers Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird to William Faulkner's Intruder in the Dust. A white lawyer tries to free a black man falsely accused of a capital crime. OK. But watch Clarence Brown adaptation of Faulkner's play (1949!), and you'll see a challenging and thrilling drama, with young actors at their best. The white paternalism of Atticus in ""to kill a Mockingbird"" is no longer acceptable. To fight racism is better to defend Lucas Beauchamp than Tom Robinson. Mockingbird seems to be censored in 1962. We have here a simply and easy morality, things are not like that, but it's better for the soul.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
different medias...different,"well i've saw quite some arguments comparing the book and the movie...i can only say they are different, and it's hard to compare (sounds cliche, man^^). i like the book better, personally, but the film is excellent in its effort...i like the opening credit much with the great music by Elmer Bernstein, and Mary Bedhem was an excellent Scout (liked her hair style^^), and not to mention that lo~~~~ng but exciting speech delivered by Atticus on the trial (i told my friends that i wanted to be a lawyer after i watched it). this is the first film that made me think about equality and courage...and of course, to know that one must stand upright. i guess some people prefer the book probably because that literature provides a better room for imagination, and it's very disappointing if the movie doesn't turn out as what we expect. but as a movie it is great, and everyone should watch it as a movie, not as reading a novel...different medias, after all.NB. and on Elmer Bernstein's music...i agree that he's done a great job again^^",,Anonymous,Crime

A breath of thoughtful air..,"I first watched 'To Kill a Mockingbird' when I was about ten. At that time my big hero was John Wayne who would normally be the good guy that would gun down the baddies. Yes, there were the offerings of right and wrong in these films and were, as ever, compounded by violence, which was,as it is now, an attraction TKAB has it's hero in the guise of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), a lawyer in a racially divided Alabama town. To me, at my tender age, this character became a different hero who portrayed strength and conviction without violence or aggression. I was continually drawn in by Peck's wonderful performance as the Lawyer Finch. The guidance, patience and moralising he offers to his young motherless children, Jem and Scout. His display of unwavering duty in the face of adversity whilst preparing to defend a young black man who is accused of rape. Also,Finch offers great restrain in situations that would have given John Wayne the right hump. All in all, I was able to take on board the goodness of this character, not in a 'Goody-Goody' sense, but seeing another way of being tough and strong. There are good performances from Phillip Alford and Mary Badham who play Jem and Scout. They are central to the whole story and their characters offer a blend of honesty, naivety and adventure not to mention a strong sense of curiosity, particularly concerning the goings on involving their father who they continuously refer to as Atticus. I saw the film for a third time just recently, and loved it just as much as when I first saw it. I would also recommend the book by Harper Lee on which the film is based.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Movie Outdoes The Book,"That was said by none other than an article I read about the movie years ago in The New Yorker magazine, and I agree. The book is essentially a series of stories about a little girl's view of events in a 1930's southern small town, while the movie leaves out subplots like the house fire and concentrates more on the black man on trial for rape. Good performances by all and the movie has tension, even if the movie also has the book's major fault-Atticus Finch is rather like a Gary Stu who can stand up to anything. Still, recommended even if you aren't a fan of the book.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

It played on negative stereotypes of people and the region, and I found the sanctimonious character of Atticus unappealing.Robert Duvall's portrayal of ""Boo"" Radley stood out, marking one of his early breakthrough roles.

Small town attorney fights bigotry,"An outstanding movie with Gregory Peck, To Kill a Mockingbird is based on the Harper Lee novel set during the Depression of the 1930's. While it has a strong civil rights message that is the core of the film, it is also a great family story. This comes out early in the film as Jem and Scout, Peck's two children, meet up with Dill, the boy staying next door for the summer. It is a small town where children play and explore the neighbourhood. We see a mad dog that Atticus shoots to spare his family from any attack and a house that the neighbours avoid out of fear of what lies within it. Mary Badham and Philip Alford are Scout and Jem, the two children of Atticus Finch. Atticus is a single father and a lawyer whose wife died several years earlier. Atticus spends time with his children and answers their questions in an honest and loving way. When a judge comes by to ask him to take on a case of alleged assault by a black man, Atticus knows he will be taking on a huge burden in a town where blacks are up against bigotry and ignorance. Yet, he agrees right off. No discussion with a judge...just a simple yes to the judge's question. It is clear that the accused black man is innocent but justice for blacks does not come easily with the climate in this town. During the trial, all the black people look down from the balcony above in the segregated courtroom, symbolic of their distance from laws that govern them. At the end of the trial, they all stand in unison when Atticus leaves. Atticus is a great role model for his community, a lawyer and parent who raises his children and fights for justice in his own town. There is a lesson in how to be a good neighbour toward the end that puts an end to a neighbourhood fallacy. This is one very moving and inspiring film and a great achievement for director Robert Mulligan (Up the Down Staircase, Love with a Proper Stranger).",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A Very Powerful, Very Meaningful Classic","Screen legend Gregory Peck lights up the screen and steals the show in To Kill A Mockingbird. This is the classic movie based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel. The story is very powerful as it shows how a white lawyer named Aticus Finch (Gregory Peck) defends a black man accused of rape in a racially divided town. The story also shows how he raises his children. He has a tomboy daughter named Scout, and an intelligent son named Jeremy. The meaning of To Kill A Mockingbird is great, but you have to watch it to figure out what the meaning of this classic film is. The character development is great as we see how Aticus Finch deals with his job difficulties, as well as life difficulties. Scout learns how to deal with people in her way, and Jeremy learns that as brave as he is, there is still danger and evil in the world.To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic and is wonderfully acted.

"""Stand up.  Your Father's Passin'.""","In a rural county somewhere in the Deep South, some time between the Depression and Pearl Harbor, a black field worker is accused of raping a white woman.  Atticus Finch is the country attorney who takes on the defence of Tom Robinson.  Atticus is a well-respected man, but ""lawin' fer niggers"" is not going to make life in Maycomb County easy for him or his family.""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is one of the best, and best-selling, American novels of the twentieth century, and hardly needs any introduction here. The story is recounted by Scout, Atticus' tomboy daughter, who is six years old at the time of the events which she describes.  Her adored older brother Jem is her constant companion, and the narrative evokes (in both book and film) the distinctive world of childhood.When I first saw the film, the novel was already a much-loved part of my mental furniture.  I felt that Gregory Peck's Atticus was right from a cinematic perspective, but wrong in terms of fidelity to the novel.  To me, Atticus was older and more frail, and yet somehow less grave.  On a second viewing, however, I have revised my opinion.  Peck is an outstanding Atticus, and this is borne out by the IMDb trivia section, which usefully explains that Harper Lee was so pleased with the way Peck captured her father's essence that she made a gift to him of Atticus' watch.It is not putting it too strongly to describe 'Mockingbird' as the first film of the American nouvelle vague.  With their clean, unpretentious images, the opening credits could have been filmed by Truffaut.  This is a style which suffuses the whole film.  Everything is shot with an unfussy clarity and a complete absence of fancy tricks and fancy lenses.  Russell Harlan deserves credit for his intelligent cinematography.All the novel's major incidents are here.  Scout rides the tyre onto the Radley porch, Jem loses his pants on the fence, Walter souses his vegetables in syrup and the lynch mob is disarmed by Scout's innocent but apposite remarks.  If the Tom Robinson saga seems hurried into the film, as compared with the book, this is entirely understandable - a movie has ninety minutes in which to do the work of three hundred pages.As Scout the narrator introduces herself, Scout the protagonist swings into camera shot.  This elegant efficiency is characteristic of the whole film.  The energy of the children, and their excitement and confusion on Scout's first day at school, are beautifully in the breakfast scene, with the staccato banging of the screen door.  The Walter Cunningham lunch is terrific, with Peck admirably putting across the deadpan wisdom of Atticus. Mayella's mendacity, and the wretchedness of her position, are exposed by the very simple but very effective zoom-in during her cross-examination.  As the good ol' boy prosecutor questions Tom, the US flag stands between them, symbolising both the gulf which separates the two cultures and the enlightened work of bridging the chasm being undertaken by the federal government.  This was the era of civil rights agitation, and of the progressive outlook of the Kennedy administration.  It is shocking to the people in the courtroom that Tom should pity Mayella, but for us it confirms his integrity as a man.Elmer Bernstein's music is, as always, classy, subtle and designed to enhance the meaning of the film.  The opening credits are accompanied by the lone voice of a child, humming.  This was revolutionary for the time, but perfectly-judged, being in keeping with the film's nouvelle vague style, and highly evocative of the child's-eye-view.  The 'creepy' theme for the night raid on the Radley house is brilliant, the piano and clarinet combination producing a memorably haunting effect.Dill, the little boy whose return signals the advent of lazy summer days as surely as the flowering of the cotton, is an interesting character in his own right.  In real life this youngster was Truman Capote, Harper Lee's childhood friend.  Here he is played by the excellent John Megna.  All three child actors (Mary Badham as Scout and Phillip Alford as Jem) are simply marvellous.  Scout's mixture of self-assurance and childish vulnerability, and Jem's leadership qualities, are captured perfectly.I accept that I may be wrong in this, but it seems to me that the film hints at a sexual relationship between Atticus and Cal (Estelle Evans), the black woman who runs the Finch menage.  After all, it would make thematic sense.  For all practical purposes Cal is a mother to the children and a wife to Atticus.  Man and woman share a bond of mutual respect which is never voiced because it does not need to be.  At one point, something crops up and Atticus asks Cal to stay the night.  She agrees without hesitation. Symbolically, this union (enlightened white with decent black) will bear fruit in a future America.  Peck seems to go for a 'Clark Kent' look for Atticus, and my guess is, it's deliberate.  Atticus is Superman, the totally benign, totally capable American hero.  That he can couple with the flower of black womanhood is implicit in, and important to, the film's meaning.The cramped little 'Huck Finn' courthouse with its imposing facade is wonderful, as is Scout's familiar neighbourhood, with its mature trees and creaking verandahs, flawlessly evoking the Maycomb of the book.'Boo' Radley is played by the always-admirable Robert Duvall, here making his first feature appearance.  Onscreen for a matter of seconds, with no dialogue, he sears onto the viewer's memory the definitive image of Boo, ""the unlikeliest of guardian angels"".",,Anonymous,Crime
Outstanding DVD.,"I recently watched this film on DVD and was very surprised by the high quality of this film. Robert Mulligan's directing was phenomenal.

Scout and Jem stole the show.,"Of course, the story is somewhat guaranteed to be the level of greatness since it is based on one of the masterpiece literary work, but works of all the actors are beyond satisfactory. Ok, I take that back. It is harder to adapt original work into a screenplay when the former is perfection. I just said that to emphasize the power of attraction each individual brings on to the screen. The story does not lose the message of the book and still keeps organization and tension. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' stays modern because its message, performance, storyline, tension, and lighting are subtle not blunt like many other so-called 'classic' films. Scout's narration manages to avoid being too serious and gives chance to hear personal story in addition to grand message. Finally, praise to Brock Peters' performance.

Maybe it was more novel and moving in 1962, but for me in 2021 it just doesn't do much. And why don't the kids call their father 'dad' instead of 'Atticus'? It went on too long and the first half was really just a kids' movie, told from their perspective and about their adventures. I didn't care for the ending either. I rate this film a 4/10. Moreover, it's a poorly developed story in that all the black characters are just noble statues to be used as props while not actually interacted with, and the white townsfolk are all bigoted racists with the exception of Atticus the great white savior for the blacks. It's actually a racist story against both blacks and whites because of this profiling and treatment of the characters. For example, none of the black family reacts to seeing Tom's would-be killer show up at their house and stare down Atticus. Thus, a severely overrated story and movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Beautiful Adaptation of Harper Lee's Beautiful Novel!,"One of the best of '62 with a masterful and charismatic performance by Gregory Peck. Great music and wonderful cast. Mary Badham as Scout was the youngest nominated for an Oscar until Tatum O'Neal 11 years later and she's perfect, as is Phillip Alford as Jem and John Megna as Dill (based on Truman Capote). In fact, this is the best film ever portraying pre-teen children in any time frame. Brock Peters, Frank Overton, and James Anderson also give definitive performance.A 9 out of 10. Best performance = Gregory Peck. Great opening scene with music and wonderful debut by Robert Duvall as the haunting Boo Radley.

Still a monument of anti racism to me,"In ""To kill a mockingbird"" a black man (Tom Robinson played by Brock Peters) is falsely accused of raping a white woman (Mayella Violet Ewell played by Collin Wilcox Paxton). To the dismay of the white community respected lawyer Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) takes on the defence of the black man.At the time of release ""To kill a mockingbird"" was seen as an anti racist film, later doubts arose about this. These doubts were based on the fact that in the movie more emphasis is given to the fact that Atticus Finch is a hero than to the fact that Tom Robinson is a victim.I am not impressed by this criticism. In ""12 angry men"" (1957, Sidney Lumet) the Henry Fonda character is also a hero. Nobody however took this as an argument to cast doubt on the anti racist character of the film.In fact a comparison of ""To kill a mockingbird"" and ""12 angry men"" is quite interesting.In ""12 angry men"" the innocence of the black suspect is not sure. This is however irrelevant for the anti racist character of the film. The central message of the film is that initially most members of the jury are sure of his quilt on the basis of the color of his skin only. In ""To kill a mockingbird"" the innocence of the black man is sure. Strangely enough in my opinion this weakens the anti racist character of the movie. This character is however strengthened again by the reason why Mayella accuses this man. In reality she has a crush on him, but a false accusation is the lesser evil compared to admitting a sexual attraction to a black man.I think that the real damage was done to the film when in 2015 the 89 years old Harper Lee (the writer of ""To kill a mockingbird"") published the sequel """"Go set a watchman"". In this book Atticus Finch falls off his pedestal. Oddly enough both making Atticus Finch a hero and let him fall from his pedestal is a reason to question the anti racist character of ""To kill a mockingbird"". I am not convinced by either reason, let alone the combination of them.By the way at the end of ""To kill a mockingbird"" Atticus Finch turns out to be no saint in the way he handles the case of Mr Ewell, the father of Mayella.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of my favorite films about small-town America,"This is one of Gregory Peck's finest hours.  It's a moving, thoughtful portrait of a rural town during the Depression years.  The story is told as seen through the eyes of Scout, the daughter of a small-town lawyer (Peck). The child's narration imbues this film with a sense of wonder, adventure, love and innocence that help the story work on several levels: as an adventure and morality play for children; as an absorbing social commentary on racism; as a way for adults to rediscover the joys and wonder of those childhood years; and as a celebration of all those things that make families the bedrock of a civilized nation. Two more good things about this film are: 1) It was filmed in glorious black and white, and 2) The soundtrack music  (by Alex North) is beautiful. Reminds one of Aaron Copland music.

A great adaptation with a few writing flaws.,"To Kill A Mockingbird is a great example of a book adaptation gone right. It knows what details to keep and which ones to leave alone, and therefore creates a sympathetic, complex, cohesive film. The way the film handles race, class, childhood and poverty, was not made this film stand out at the time it was released, but is relevant even now. All of the performances here are really stellar, but Gregory Peck's performance of Atticus Finch and Brock Peters performance of Tom Robinson are the stand outs. The emotion and dedication both bring to their roles is astounding. Every time Atticus is on screen, he steals the show. The character's quiet compassion and brilliance are really translated well to the film, and he really holds the film together. For me, the parts that fall a little more flat are mostly the parts that have to do with Scout, which is a shame considering she's our main character. It's not that she's performed poorly or anything, but often times shots linger on her for too long or the writing for her is just not very good. The child acting in this movie is overall very good, with Phillip Alford's portrayal of Jem being the highlight. Dill and Scout are more just okay than anything else, but it isn't a detrimental things at all. The main problems I have with the film are all hinged on the way Scout is written. Sometimes just seems to do things for no other reason than to progress the plot, rather than to actually contribute to the message of the film. All in all though, To Kill A Mockingbird is a poignant film that I can easily recommend. 8.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Pretty uninteresting, but it shines occasionally","I didn't really know what to expect going into this film. I knew that it tackled the issue of racism, but that was about it. What I instead got (mostly) were some children running around doing things. I'm usually not a fan of children in movies, but the performances by Mary Badham, Philip Alford and John Megna are in fact not that bad.The problem is that after a while, it just becomes a bit boring. And when the film gets to the interesting part, the courtroom scene, it is over in the blink of an eye. I simply can't look it over, and it is in my opinion one of the major flaws of To Kill a MockingbirdWhat I must praise however is the atmosphere of the movie, and how it builds up a feeling of unease and tension in what is seemingly a tranquil Southern town. Sometimes, it even delves into horror territory, but masterfully, and not by too much.Gregory Peck brings out a great performance as lawyer Atticus Finch, but the actor who I actually think stole the show was Brock Peters as Tom Robinson, the accused rapist. He is just so excellent, and you can truly see the pain in his eyes when speaking in court, trying to get everyone to understand that he is innocent.To conclude, I think To Kill a Mockingbird is for the most part quite an uninteresting movie.

Adding to this movie is the cast of children, whose plain naivety makes the movie a whole lot better.Set in the time where being black was a cause of concern. To kill a mockingbird tells the story of a man Atticus Finch and his kids during a 3 summer period. The story arc spans over 3 years about how Atticus kids Jem (Philip Alford) and Scout (Mary Badham) go through each summer with heartwarming adventures.Their story is wrapped round the case in which Atticus was defending a black man who is being held on rape charge.Guilty or not Atticus defends this man with all that he has in his kitty.The movies screenplay/script is something that you will be able to relate too, making the movie hit home in the first 10 minutes.Directing also was top notch as it all plays well.The script's lose end for me is the character Boo, who in some way I didn't get his full involvement in the movie as the director may have skipped some parts making us understand much of his liking to the kids.Phillip Alford did not initially want to audition for the part.

To Kill a Mockingbird (1962),"A lot of good things can be said about this movie. I have never watched any other racial injustice or prejudiced based movie that compares to ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". This movie not only influences you sympathize with those who were being discriminated against, but also the ones who stood up for those people. When Atticus Finch is leaving the court room and Reverend Sykes tells Scout to ""stand up your father is passing"" was one of the most remembered parts of the movie.Gregory Peck was a great actor who played Atticus a lawyer who is widowed, Mary Badham and Philip Alford are excellent as Jem and Scout. Mary Badham became the youngest girl to receive an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress for her role as Scout. ""Boo"" Radley was one of Robert Duvall's first roles on screen and ""To Kill a Mockingbird was a great movie to start his acting career.The movie starts out by scout age 6 who now a grown woman thinking back and telling a story from her childhood. Jem short for Jeremy is her brother. Calpurnia is their housekeeper that helps with the children. The children meet Dill Harris who is visiting his aunt for the summer. Scout, Jem, and Dill have some great adventures. It seems children used their imagination more than they do today.Gregory Peck who plays the part of Atticus Finch is portrayed a Gentleman Lawyer whose wife has passed away and he is left to raise his son and a daughter. Tom Robinson, a black man is wrongly accused of raping a poor white woman. He becomes a victim of a white women's attempt to hide her guilt. She had been asking favors of Tom Robinson and even tried to seduce him. When he rejected her she targeted him knowing his innocence but also living in an unsocial society towards Negros. Realizing that the narrow minded society they live in will turn against him, Finch decides to defend him. The townspeople did try to cause harm to him but Scout recognized the man who was paying her father with pecans for some service he couldn't afford. Without thinking with the angry mob standing around she asked him to tell his son hello because they went to school together. The innocents of the child changed the attitude of the men and they decided to leave. The movie is based around the innocence and purity of his children and their relationship with their father.Due to society Tom Roberts never had a chance of being found innocent. The community had already made their minds up only because Tom was a negro. If it had been a white man with the lack of evidence he would have had a better chance of being found innocent.Boo Radley was the climax of the whole story. After a couple of years the children wanting to see him and even accepting the gifts from the tree, Boo comes to their rescue. When Scout realized who saved her brother she knew he was a good man and instantly became friends. The sheriff knew what society would do if Boo had to go to trial so he chose to say Bob Yule fell on his own knife.It is unusual that a movie is very simple in expression but teaches significant life lessons. This movie reflects the innocence of a child. A young woman thinks back to her childhood days which were a time where mostly immature, curious minds dealt with the racial bigotry, hatreds, prejudice and adversities of society. In today's society a lot of prejudice still exists but it seems as if people of a different race get a fair trial just as any white person would. Look at OJ Simpson he was found innocent of murder when a lot of Americans had already made their minds up that he was guilty.I think Atticus done a very well job of explaining the situation to Scout. Expressing his dislike for the word ""Niger"" he explained to her negro was a better word, and that he did not want her fighting over what anyone said to her about him or the case.Even though I had to read this book in the 5th grade there was a lot I had forgotten about. This movie really brought the book alive. It was very much like the book. I found it hard to watch a black and white film without getting sleepy through the movie, but It was such a well made film it kept me interested.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Boo Radley--American hero,"I have lived with this movie, and the novel on which it is based, most of my life. My parents took us kids to see this movie first run, figuring the I was too young to understand the disturbing, crucial courtroom scenes about rape and racism. The parents were right. I fell asleep.Scary movie for a little kid! Very Southern Gothic, beautifully shot. I was riveted during the early scenes with the kids. The scary Boo house and the soap figurines made a big impression on me. I slept though the middle of the movie, so at the very end, I thought the skulking but kindly Boo was still scary. I now realize that he's the most wonderful person in the story. He is the Mockingbird.I read the book as soon as I could read, and again, skipped over just about everything but the kid portions of the novel. What great episodes, and what beautiful writing. Since then, I read the book at least once a decade and see the movie whenever I can.Had I been a teen when the movie first came out I would have wanted to protest the ""Stand up Jean Louise, your father's passin' by "" scene--a little too adorable and grateful, is that Negro pastor. This movie's set in the lynch era, but it was released during the the brave civil rights era. Black citizens were laying their lives on the line at that time. Some White people were out there, but not nearly as many. So the movie's emphasis on the middle aged white dicty hottie lawyer, who will save us all, is a bit skewed.All the posters who claim to love the book, yet say that the movie is enough, frustrate me. Please read the book once every decade of your life. You will have grown, and, strangely the book will have grown. And bless you posters for mentioning powerful characters in the book, like the horrible Mrs. DuBose, who never made it to the screen.Since my last re-read, I am struck as never before, by Dill literally becoming sick about racism during the trial.But such a rich book has to be condensed for movie length, and Mulligan and Foote have presented the best.

An Effortlessly Poignant Social Commentary!,"To Kill A Mockingbird is a hauntingly nostalgic portrayal of childhood mischief set in a racially divided Alabama town in the 1930s. If the film's tone seems overly righteous, it's offset by a poetic lyricism that is difficult to resist embracing.At the outset, it plops us down serenely in the comfort of a grubby Southern town at the time of the Great Depression, before 'desegregation' was even a word. Gregory Peck plays incorruptible lawyer Atticus Finch, a widower with two loving, if rambunctious children - 10-year-old Jem (Phillip Alford) and a thoroughly beguiling 6-year-old tomboy Scout (Mary Badham). We are immediately squeezed inside the skin of Scout and Jem as they go racing and tumbling around the neighborhood, shrieking with childish defiance at crusty old Mrs. Dubose, skirting with awe around the creaky wooden house where the mysterious Boo Radley (Robert Duvall) lives, who according to neighborhood legend, is crazy and chained to his bed by his father. While the kids play, Atticus has been chosen to defend a young black man accused of rape. As the trial looms and the townsfolk attempt to enact street justice against the accused, Atticus' pursuit of justice remains unwavering. As the trial ensues, Atticus, Jem, and especially Scout learn as much about each other as they do about their own fears and prejudices.Its success is in part due to its source material - Harper Lee's best-selling novel tells a fierce story. However, Lee's child's-eye view of southern bigotry gains something in its translation to the screen by Robert Mulligan, who knows exactly how to capture a child's subjective experience. Mulligan achieves a bewitching indication of the excitement and thrill of being a child. There is so much feeling for children in the film, so much delightful observation of their spirit, energy and charm as depicted by two superb discoveries, Badham and Alford. Mulligan even wrings a remarkable performance from Gregory Peck. As Atticus, his performance is the bedrock of this classic film, one of those rare instances when a character perfectly captures the essence of its source material without compromising it in any way. It's a simple, controlled performance of passion and restraint which turns out to be curiously effective.To Kill A Mockingbird is effortlessly engaging as a social commentary, while the sobering subtext gives the film a heart and soul that most filmmakers would kill to replicate. This is storytelling at its very best!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best films of the 1960s,"The film explored could only be possibly left undisturbed in all its proud, grim glory, in black and white cinematography, rather than using inferior colour processes. The 60s remains the peak of time in which the moral certainty and controversially challenging racial themes were most strongly implied, although the classic story of innocence and a black man charged with the rape of a white girl is still alarmingly relevant today, even to a lesser extent.Could To Kill a Mockingbird be able to survive a modern day movie re-make, miniseries or television film?Remaking Mockingbird as a feature film in a sense would almost be as bad as a sequel to Casablanca or a remake of Gone With the Wind. It is to morals as what Citizen Kane is to its own powerful themes and what Singin in the Rain or The Wizard of Oz is to musicals. In other words, any sign of a duplicate could do no justice to its predecessor, without undoing the originals power, which had first debuted on the screen in celebrated style almost forty years ago.Unfortunately, incidence had to be compromised with cinematic length, and some of the novels key events were not filmed. I saw Mockingbird some months before I studied the novel, which happens to be the text currently being studied at school, and despite its excellence, it has not been entirely helpful. The question remains as to whether even some of the film s darkest themes were deemed unfilmable. Apart from that, the screenplay of Horton Foote remains largely faithful, and retains most of the literary brilliance of Harper Lees original Pulitzer Prize winning work. In turn, the director has done the same.No actor of the day could have played Atticus Finch better than the great man, Gregory Peck himself. Any sign of the comic, cynical newspaper reporter he played previously in Roman Holiday is far removed. The dignified symbolism of human idealism was a well-deserved Oscar win, played to the upper core of conviction.The usage of literal unknown actors, including Mary Badham as Scout, has therefore not compromised some of the all-important supporting creations by bastardising the film with big names. Finally, Kim Stanleys narration of the older Scout is fitting and appropriately convincing.Technical elements for this 60s film are generally above average. Visibly rugged sets and costumes have been well created. The musical score is not an intrusion, but rather a befitting haunting melody that becomes increasingly better with each viewing of the film. Its a relief to know a lousy, irrelevant theme song does not accompany the film.Against Lawrence of Arabia, David Leans masterpiece epic, the fact that the underdog Mockingbird won any Oscars at all is truly a wonder. Named by the AFI as one of the top 100 films of all time in 1998 only further proves why this film has been one of the most successful adaptations and perhaps the best film of any year in the 1960s. Unfortunately, 1962 was simply not one of them.Rating: 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

It sounds funny to call it a fairy tale, but it's not a full out great novel, either. Maybe it is something that exists somewhere in between, delighting readers and challenging critics. (""Coming of age novel"" minimizes it.)Scout Finch is arguably the most charming female character in American fiction in the second half of the century, and the heart of the book is really her narration, and how she relates to everyone in her world, particularly her father. Through Scout's eyes we see the changing humanity of her older brother Jem. The author goes to great lengths to make Scout as adorable as possible and yes she is a little bit in love with her childhood self.The book, set in the 30s, is flavored by the coming pressures of the times in which it was written, the 1950s and 60s. The living room conversations among the women about the differences between North and South in their treatment of blacks were very recognizable. But, the book's power, for me, does not lie in the Tom Robinson trial and his subsequent fate, true as it was. That part moved along predictably enough, and Atticus weathers the town's outrages nobly, holding the klieg light steady for all who so choose to see the way out of darkness. No one does.Strangely, there was no portrayal of a married couple, to my reading. Most of the adult male characters' wives had died, and the women either lived alone or with a maid. Maybe it was meant to convey the dying South or maybe it reflects the author's own life or her assessment or faith (or lack of it) in the future of the South.Still, To Kill a Mockingbird is a portrayal of a once noble family, and a very decent family, grounded in some pretty good values and going out to experience life eagerly and with honor, not shrinking from anything.It's not a work of Great Fiction but there is something about it in line with great American works. What that something is, is hard to pin down. Maybe it is the richness in every sentence, the warmth and understanding. The recognizable history, the sweep of years and ages that one phrase embodies and evokes, and the nostalgia it stirs up. Maybe it is the everyday poetry of the language, instantly recognizable as classic American writing. Maybe it is the completely true characters, each one unique in a land where conformity was valued and enforced.The film necessarily cuts out a significant portion of the book but for the most part the choices made for what was left in are good ones. Still, the omissions include the development of important characters (Miss Maudie, Mrs DuBose, and Calpurnia among others), while other characters are left out entirely (Aunt Alexandra). A lot of family back-story is also cut. The result is that the outlines are there (albeit with some pretty steep mountains in the background!) and that seems to have satisfied a good many people.Phillip Alford as Jem was unquestionably the best casting choice of this movie, while Mary Badham's pampered background shows through. I picked up on a sullen, mocking reluctance in scenes requiring a demonstration of affection and lovingness. Alford, more down-home, does just fine, and is all boy, with a lovely voice. Dill is hardly anyone's notion of a beautiful child contest winner and is clearly not Southern. Peck certainly looks the part of Atticus Finch, and while Atticus clearly is a reserved man, I don't think he is a dead one. Too bad the one actor who most looked the part, the freckle-faced, tow-headed Walter Cunningham, did not also sound it.Perhaps it is the experience of watching the movie so soon after having read the book. There simply is no comparison. Read the book! It is so much better.",,Anonymous,Crime
A Timeless Tale of Justice and Morality,"Watching ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" for the first time was an experience that left an indelible mark on my heart. I had read Harper Lee's novel in school, and while I was familiar with the themes of racial injustice and moral integrity, seeing them brought to life on the screen added a whole new layer of depth to my understanding.From the moment the film began, I was transported to the small town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930s. The cinematography beautifully captured the essence of the time, with its dusty streets and quaint homes, creating an atmosphere that felt both nostalgic and haunting. The children, Scout and Jem, portrayed by Mary Badham and Phillip Alford, were nothing short of remarkable. Their innocence and curiosity shone through, making their journey of discovery all the more poignant.Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch was nothing less than iconic. He embodied the character's unwavering moral compass and quiet strength with such grace that I found myself rooting for him in every scene. The courtroom scenes were particularly gripping; I felt a palpable tension as Atticus stood up against the prejudices of his community. His closing argument resonated deeply, reminding us of the importance of empathy and justice in a world often clouded by hatred and ignorance.What struck me most was the film's ability to balance the heavy themes of racism and injustice with moments of warmth and humor, especially through the eyes of the children. Their interactions with Boo Radley added a layer of intrigue and mystery, serving as a metaphor for the fear of the unknown and the judgments we often make about others without understanding their true nature.The emotional weight of the film lingered long after the credits rolled. It forced me to reflect on the societal issues that persist today, making it feel relevant even decades after its release. The film is a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up for what is right, even when faced with overwhelming opposition.In the end, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is not just a film; it's a profound experience that challenges us to confront our own biases and strive for a more just world. I left the theater feeling inspired and hopeful, with a renewed commitment to empathy and understanding. It's a cinematic masterpiece that deserves to be seen and cherished by generations to come.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good movie for people into The Great Depression,"To Kill A Mockingbird is a movie about a lawyer from the 1930s named Atticus Finch, who is trying to defend a colored man by the name of Tom Robinson, who has been charged with rape. Atticus is also trying to prevent his two kids named Scout and Jem, from prejudice. This movie has a lot of positives with very little negatives, the story is based on a hit novel, not much is changed, and is overall a pretty good adaptation. My only complaint is that the movie was filmed in black and white to keep the 1930s aesthetic. The movie was almost as great as the novel, but they did remove some things, like they removed some characters from the book like Francis Hancock, and Aunt Alexandra. Even though this is a serious movie, there are some funny moments, like Scout goes in a tire and crashes into a building, and the actors for Jem and Dill made their respective characters feel real. I feel that someone who is into The Great Depression, or people who liked the original book. Overall I would recommend this movie to a friend.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A beautiful classic,"I love classics. Both the movie and the book are considered a masterpiece. The movie is serious, i like that, it combines the innocence of kids, the suspense of what is coming up next in the movie, brings a film that is consider a classic, a gem for Hollywood and that is going to last till the end of times. Gegory's Peck performance, suits the character of Atticus Finch just perfect,the production of the film is gorgeous; it made me feel like if I was there; I believe they showed perfectly the description of the place. Also the costume design was great. I also have to give a little credit to Mary Badham who played Scout, the little girl who just tries to be like her brother.

Just a great film,"I found it a very powerful film. Interestingly, film critics like Ebert appear to not like this film that much. Indeed, its simplicity does not bode well for film critics.Cute kiddies are always a good bonus as well. A story told through their eyes becomes more powerful as it contrasts the aggression of the adults with the innocence of the children and the impact of the unjust prosecution of the ""negro"" on the lives of the children at school and home.Overall, very enjoyable film, though a bit simple at times. Has an epic speech in the end as well. That surely added a point to my vote.I will have to include it as one of my top 100 favorite films.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
To Kill a Mockingbird,"When I was in high school, I had to read the book. I was not a fan of the book at all, but then again I had no care for the idea of reading back then. After reading it, we also had to watch the movie. Again, I was not a fan of it. But, re-watching it now, I have come to realize that in fact it really was a great film. It had great camera work, lighting, and fantastic actors to it all. I am sure that Harper was very proud of how her book came out into the adaptation of a film, because it is in fact a spectacular film where you feel immersed into the entirety of it. You feel like you're in the court room during the case, in the houses of the characters, and have feelings for when all the action takes place. It truly is a fantastic film. Maybe it is time to go and reread the book as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Catechism,"Boy, is this movie confused or what? Almost a movie of two halves, and like all such movies doomed to have one half weighed against the other, a case where neither half wins but both lose, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD begins as a sort of southern Gothic reverie not unlike Charles Laughton's iconic NIGHT OF THE HUNTER. A pervading atmosphere you can almost smell of hot wet summer nights and a sense of childlike wonder and mystery, that uncanny ability of children to find the macabre in the ordinary, the fantastical in the mundane, which we all return to again and again in our creative moments as adults; this, I think is Mockingbird's biggest asset, its charm and beauty. Not the courtroom scene that hijacks the movie halfway through, not the subplot of racism and smalltown bigotry in a rural Southern community and not even Gregory Peck (whom I find almost unbearable). The real stars here are the children.I have no doubt in my mind that at some not so distant point, the movie was not only educational but important. The message still is. But, having progressed thankfully to the point where racism should really be a non-issue (although often it's not), Atticus' catechism in the courtroom seems to be stating the obvious. That it's not exactly layered throughout the movie, that the movie itself makes such an about-turn when it enters the courtroom, makes it stand out like a sore thumb. As a reminder of what were and could be again, no doubt it's still relevant. But in the context of a dramatic movie it is a bit of a false note.We're lucky then that the movie reverts back to the great first half for its climactic conclusion. I haven't read the book to know how well the story works there as a whole, but this seems to me like a missing opportunity. The world of the adults seems awfully uninvolving compared to that of the children, the one full of magic and possibility. Maybe contrasting the two was kind of the point.",,Anonymous,Crime
Perfect adaptation of perfect novel about racial prejudice.,"Without waxing too rhapsodic, film doesn't get any better than this! Evocative, touching without being saccharine, and -- a dying breed -- a movie that's ABOUT something. This is one of those films that never gets old either in its message or its style. Unlike many other films that rely too heavily on voiceover narration, the film uses just enough of the poetry of Harper Lee's first-person tale to set the stage and bookend her poetic fable. And the characters are not stereotypes, nor even mere archetypes. Gregory Peck is splendidly dignified and understated as Atticus Finch, and Mary Badham and Brock Peters are first rate. Robert Duvall's ""Boo"" Radley is one of the great performances in all of film. The lyrical score (Elmer Bernstein), black-and-white cinematography (Russell Harlan), and beautifully detailed art direction (Henry Bumstead) support Robert Mulligan's deft direction. Parents, take your children to see this film! -- at a revival or repertory theater if possible, or if not, rent the widescreen version of the video. This is better education in social values than can be had in classroom -- and can't help but touch young people at their core without being preachy or self-righteous. For audiences of all ages, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" more than survives repeated viewing. Without a shred of sentimentality, this film leaves not a dry eye in the house.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A masterpiece of acting,"This film is a masterpiece with some of the best acting I've seen. The characters are all lifelike, compelling and believable. For starters, Gregory Peck portrays Atticus Finch as a principled, wise and compassionate father, committed both to the justice of his defendant and the safe upbringing of his children. Speaking of the children, the film is presented from their point of view, which is also portrayed in a realistic and relatable manner. The children are bubbly, curious and mischievous, trying to find out more about the mysterious Boo Radley and their father's court case, which they hold as highly significant. The defendant is resigned to his fate, weeping yet calm, aware of just how much the world is stacked against him. Lastly, Mayella displays her own kind of anxiety, raging against her circumstances in the only way she knows how, a kind of forlorn anger. All of this adds up to a compelling tale of racism through innocent eyes - a kind of drama without melodrama.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Movie with many life lessons,"""To kill a mockingbird"" was released 60 years ago and is still as relevant as it was in its days. Based on a novel with the same name written by Harper Lee, the movie touches some important themes such as what real courage is, the value of family and how to avoid prejudice.The plot follows Atticus who is about to defend a black man, named Tom Robinson who is accused of raping a woman. Atticus takes the case even though he knows that his chances are very slim, due to the fact that racism was very apperent in those years. The whole story is seen and told through the eyes of Atticus's little daughter - Scout, who together with her brother, Jem learn lots of life lessons along the way.If I am to judge the movie in itself I have to say that Gregory Peck ( Atticus in the movie ), gives his best performance, for which he is awarded an oscar. All the actors represent the characters very accurately, just like one would imagine them while reading the book. What made me like the movie even more was that a big part of the script was written with almost the exact same words as is the book.To kill a mockingbird is a real eye-opener especially when it comes to karma. I have seen many movies from the golden age of Hollywood and this one, despite being at the end of that age, is definately one of the most influential movies I have seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent portrayal of the novel,"The novel I have to say was brilliant, and the movie, which was also great, captures the emotions of the movie. At the end of the movie, I could feel myself begin to choke up with tears, and I am not one who usually get overly emotional over movies. The movie stays fairly close to the story, but it combines and consolidates some scenes, and eliminates others, so I highly recommend reading the book in addition. The makers of this movie were wise, however, in choosing how to condense the story into a movie format, in that they captured the same feeling and sent the veiwer the same message. This is a must read and must see. 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overrated,"To Kill A Mockingbird is not a bad film, but it's pretty overrated. Apologies to the fans.I'm amazed Gregory Peck won the Academy Award. He took what seems like a great part, on paper, and managed to give a stiff, heavy (though convincing) performance, in my opinion. This guy once had a great deal of looseness and charm, as in: The Yearling (1946). Is Atticus such a paragon and saint that he has to be played with clenched jaw and stiff neck? I would have liked it if he loosened up occasionally. I just felt Peck was playing one note throughout. I hate to say he was bad, but I felt he was verging on it. I read somewhere that Harper Lee originally wanted Spencer Tracy. Though I suppose Tracy was a bit too old, by then, he had the ability to humanize saintly characters. (Meanwhile, Universal wanted Rock Hudson, their biggest box office star.)The children are natural, but not especially great actors. Alice Ghostly is good, though her ebullience seems toned down to fit in with the ""Playhouse 90"" acting style that pervades everything. Robert Duvall is good. The various supporting players are all commendable but without much presence. They seem to underplay to the point of fading into the background. Maudie, Calpurnia, etc. Then in the courtroom we get some overacting.I can't put my finger on what I don't like about the film, overall, but I just think it's not altogether life-like. I also wish it had been shot on location; I think a lot of atmosphere could have been achieved. The set, which was completely constructed on the Universal back lot by a brilliant art director, Henry Bumstead, is quite an achievement. But no set has the same ""life"" to it that a real location has.This isn't a bad film, and of course it has its touching scenes (with several moments greatly enhanced, emotionally, by Elmer Bernstein's score). I just don't have the same reaction to it that many others seem to have.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Peck won a Golden Globe award for Best Actor of 1962, my ass. He should've won a Golden Raspberry Award for worst actor of that year and for that trashy movie.

"""This movie become my favorite""","To Kill a Mockingbird has become my favorite trial movie ever. I usually hate old style movies, but this movie is great. It is based on American history, and it gives historical information about how discrimination was unfair to black people. I was so sad when I finished the movie, and I saw it three times, over and over. This was my first black and white movie that became my favorite. I like most parts of this movie. I like the setting of this film, because it describes small towns of the 1930's, but it was so different that I was amazed in my mind. I thought it is really old living condition and old fashion. Also, Atticus was riding a car. I thought it was great. When I was in Korea, I saw movies and Thought the America has two story houses and have nice garden. And second thing I liked the actresses. My favorite one was Scout  Finch, because when I see her in the film I always think of my old friend, that I was a kid that really close to me. Also, this movie shows a lot of detail about the judgment and trial. Most of I liked the sound one the film. The sound makes me feel scare and sad. I remember that sound, when Atticus loses his trial. I love the actor Gregory peck as Atticus Finch, because they're look similar persons, Autticus was smart and courtly man, and so is Gregory Peck. I think it was good casting for Atticus Finch. Gregory Peck is dead now, but I saw the TV show of The 1991 Kennedy Center Honor. I can see his gentle and courtly manner also. On the TV show the violinist Issac Stern introduced him as a courtly man he also has a good relationship with his friends. Now that I have seen the show, I feel honor toward Gregory Peck. Most parts of this movie are great, but if I could change some, I would change the black and white to color I think that will be more beautiful view of Maycomb. It would be more interesting. Also, I think the story goes so fast, when I read the book, it had more detail in it. I think the movie skips some information about Scout, how she was smart. Also, I disliked sound, but it was very old, so if they change to the new sound, it would be more interesting. My user rating is `9' because I like most part s of this movie, but the story was little different than a book, also I like book better. They skip some part in the book. but it was pretty good . Later if they make new version of this movie, I would positively watch it. I think this movie is the great movie that I have ever watched, In the school.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best films on Social Tolerance,"This movie really gave me a sense of what it must have been like to grow up in the 1930's. We follow a young girl's development as she takes the lesson from her father on how ""it's a sin to kill a mockingbird"" and later starts applying it to people, and develops principals of tolerance of others, from the poor to their outcast neighbor. I love the message of this movie, especially Atticus Finch's monologues on justice and the rule of law. There are some flaws to the film story itself though, such as the movie doesn't really say what Mr. Ewell's motivations are in regards to Atticus' children, among other things. Despite minor flaws I would highly recommend this film to anyone. 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Exquisite in all aspects!!!,"This movie is based on the prize-winning book of the same name by Harper Lee. It is semi-autobiographical, and so it cannot be dismissed or taken lightly as a work of pure fiction. In my opinion, the movie is very faithful to the book. Hats off to Gregory Peck for a superb acting job as Atticus. Robert Duvall has a small but very pivotal part in this movie. He does an excellent job as well. On another front, the musical score soothes its way into your heart from the start of the movie and stays with you for a long time afterwards. The message of Love and Compassion is the central theme of this movie, and by my estimation, it has rarely been so well communicated.

EXTREMELY POOR MOVIE,"This movie which was released 50 years depicted society at that point in time where racism was at an extremely extremely high level much much much worse than it is today in USA.However the fact that this movie was a huge success despite having a situation where there was clear cut case of extremely poor parenting from the father towards his children who continuously disobeyed him and treated him with scant respect is mind boggling seeing that this was a reflection of society 60 years ago.One of his children used to call him continously by his name. Athough today it would be frowned upon,60 years it should have been totally unacceptable to do so anywhere in the world,except I guess USA!At 2hrs 9 minutes this movie was at least 39 minutes too long!I found everything about this film to be of a very low standard especially the acting by everyone,especially Gregory Peck who incidentally won an Oscar for his acting

There is a wonderful depth and mystery to the movie...,"I watched the movie for the first time yesterday, and it was very interesting to me.  I'm 18 years old, and not from the south, but the kids' playing reminds me a bit of playing with my brothers and sisters when I was growing up.  Everything was a mystery and adventure.  The kids did an excellent job of acting, and the little girl who played Scout had never even acted or been trained in acting before!  There was a great depth to the characters and a great mysterious aura to the Radley house.  Gregory Peck, as usual, did a great job in his part, and the man who played Tom Robinson did, too.  For me it was a riveting movie, though there were no explosions or shoot-outs or high-tech graphics.  It was plain and simple but effective. There were some funny moments, some scary moments, some emotional moments. I saw it in the original B&W on DVD...At first I wished I could see it in color, but then I thought making it in B&W gave it more mystery and interest.  The ""Fearful Symmetry"" (making of the movie) was very interesting, too, talking about what we have lost as a country, even while we have gained things.

Proper representation of the fight for civil rights,"To Kill A Mockingbird is a movie that effectively shows the evils of racism in the nineteen thirties in the south. Gregory Peck plays the calm and collected lawyer, Atticus, who valiantly defends a black man in racist Maycomb Alabama. He does a wonderful job of portraying the Atticus Finch as he struggles to prove the man's innocence. He plays the character as Harper Lee describes him in the book, which is a great factor for me. I love that the book and the movie are very closely associated. I was very impressed with Mary Badham's performance as Scout. She properly displays Scout's innocence and that is a huge theme in the book. Scout's discovery of the racism within her town shows the malicious behaviors of the white people and the mistreatment of the black community. This movie properly represents the mistreatment of the black community and that is another factor that is appealing to me. It shows the cruelty of the whites and creates empathy within the viewer.

Man's courage to fight injustice and racial prejudice in a dignified manner,"To Kill a Mockingbird, in my opinion, is and will always be one of Hollywood's best productions about social injustice and racial prejudice as well as man's courage to cure and fight against those social ills in a dignified manner. Hence it is a must-see movie.The film, based on Harper Lee's novel of the same name, shot in black and white and released in 1962, opens with scenery of a small ""nowhere to go and nothing to buy"" town in Alabama. Yet in this sleepy town there lives a white and good-hearted lawyer who not only faithfully adheres to the principles of human rights and social justice but also dares to fight against bigots while defending the noble cause he believes in. He stands invincibly despite mockery and threats.The lawyer, Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck), is assigned to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. During the trial, Atticus establishes an important piece of evidence that the accused Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) is innocent. He shows the jury that Tom's left hand is incapacitated. Earlier in the trial, Sheriff Tate has testified that he saw bruises on the woman right neck after the incident was reported to him, indicating that the attacker must have been a left-handed person. That person is none other than the woman's own father who often mistreats her when he gets drunk.Peck's portrayal as a serious and professional lawyer as well as a widower and loving father is superb. Compared with The Paradine Case, another courtroom drama also starred by Peck who plays the role of a defense attorney of a woman suspected of murder, his performance in To Kill a Mockingbird is far better and more convincing. Understandably that Peck won the 1962 Oscar for Best Actor for his role as Atticus.Good acting is also demonstrated by then child actors Mary Badham and Philip Alford, respectively playing the role of Scout and Jem, Atticus's children who stand tall by their father's side. Indeed, their acting in the film is down-to-earth and captivating.Besides pointing out that prejudice against anyone is wrong and intolerable, the film  directed by Robert Mulligan and adapted to the screenplay by Horton Foote  also affirms the importance of understanding and tender feeling in building up human relations. The best example for this is the scene that depicts how Boo Radley (played by then unknown Robert Duvall), considered by the townspeople as a half monster, turns out to be a kind-hearted man who saves Scout and Jem from being harassed by the woman's father who strongly opposes Atticus's undertaking.Lee earned the 1961 Pulitzer Prize for her fiction, and although To Kill a Mockingbird is her only novel, it nevertheless became a best-seller not long after its publication.

Just Watch This Movie!,"To Kill A Mockingbird has always been looked upon as an instant classic because of its very important themes dealing with race during the 1930's Alabama, a time where racism was rampant all across the United States especially in the southern states. The film itself, based on the popular and timely novel by Harper Lee, was released in 1962 which was during the civil rights movement. Some critics called this film an innocent film because of the time it was released. It was released back when people were more relaxed, but in the fifty years since then, society has gotten more uptight due to everything that has been going on. Despite a loss of innocence, this is a fantastic movie that has very important themes, even by today's standards. This is one of my all-time favorite movies.This movie can be divided into two mini-movies. One movie is a coming-of-age story told through the eyes of a six-year-old girl named Scout. Scout and her older brother, Jem play in the hot, hazy Alabama sun every day and they have adventures with their next door neighbor, whom they just met. They tell each other tales about another neighbor of theirs named Mr. Radley, whom rumor has it chained up his son, Boo every day. I believe this part of the story was told extremely well, and it returned the memories of my childhood where I used to go off on similar adventures.While the children play, their father named Atticus Finch goes to the courthouse every day, and that leads us on to what the other half of the film is about. This can also be perceived as a courtroom drama, an effective one to boot. The basic story goes that Finch is asked by the town's sheriff to defend a black man who has been accused of rape. The townspeople request Atticus, who is a white man, to stop defending the black man, Tom Robinson. But Atticus believes everyone has a right to be defended, so he decided to continue along with the case.The courtroom scene is the most powerful scene of the movie. There is no doubt about that. The speech Atticus gave talking about ideals and values to show why Tom was innocent of his accused crime is the most powerful speech you'll hear in any movie. I won't deny there were some tears running down my cheeks as I listened to those tender, powerful words. The movie made clear it was on Atticus's side. Through the evidence and the witnesses in the trial, it was clear Tom is innocent, But given this is Alabama in the 1930's, the all-white jury had other ideas. Another extremely powerful scene is after the jury gave its verdict. The black people were segregated from the white people of course, but as everyone cleared out, they all stood in silence watching Atticus. A sign of respect for what he did for their cause. It was only one man, but now it was clear that there were people out there who believed in equal rights. Not just people, but white people who believed.The first half of the movie was all about Scout and her adventures, before it transitioned to a courtroom drama. But after the courtroom drama ended, you would expect the movie to be over. Actually, we transition back to Scout who finds herself in trouble from a racist man named Ewell, whom her father gave a hard time during the trial. Ewell is actually the father of the supposed rape victim and he was doing anything to make sure Robinson was guilty. But this is the time where the mysterious Boo Radley comes into play, where he shows he is not the person the whispers across town make him out to be. This is the part of the movie where the title comes from.I really loved this story. It may be a clichéd story in today's world, but it was something fresh back in 1962. Despite all the clichés, it is all about story execution. The screenplay and the direction by Robert Mulligan are rather light, but I felt for each character. I rooted for Atticus, Scout, and even Boo the entire movie. You know a movie is great when that happens. In other words, I loved the proper people and I hated the proper people. Another thing to look at in getting to know the characters is how the actors bring them to life. In this movie, the actors brought Harper Lee's words to life and gave that life meaning. Gregory Peck won Best Actor at the Oscars for his wonderful, stirring performance as Atticus Finch. But his performance throughout the entire film was a reserved, quiet performance. A performance that resembled the real-life Gregory Peck. Mary Badham gave a terrific performance as the young tomboy, Scout. She gave the film a sense of adventure and she was very supportive of her father, despite her limited understanding of what was going on. She was an incredible part of this movie's success.Overall, To Kill A Mockingbird is a very powerful, effective movie that came out at a time where hope was in the air. Hope for the black people to finally receive equal rights. Thematically, this was a very important movie. It was one of the earliest movies to actually portray black people in a positive light from the view of white people. Looking at events occurring across the world today, the themes of this movie can still be considered important. The acting and the story received the most praise from me. But let's not forget about the wonderful black-and-white cinematography nor the beautiful piano score by Elmer Bernstein. This is a movie for all movie lovers should see.My Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of my alltime favorites,"There are not enough good things that I can say about this film. Every time I watch it I think it gets better and better. The acting is certainly spot on and every actor and actress that was cast certainly owned the character they were assigned. The cinematography had to be the best part of this film. It really focused where the action was making it easy for the viewers to see the action or keep them in suspense until later on in the movie. The lack of light in some parts of the film also helped to heighten this film's intensity. As someone who has also read the book, I am surprised at how some of the cinematic characteristics have stayed true to what was written in the book.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A classic revisited mainly for Gregory Peck's award winning performance,"This classic was on my revisit watch list for quite sometime. In 1962 it was a much discussed movie of its time due to its bold storyline of a white lawyer Atticus Finch ( Gregory Peck) defending a black man facing a rape charge. The setting is a small town in USA where widower Atticus resides with his two young children Jean and Jem and their black nanny. Atticus attracts the anger and displeasure of the white community for taking up the case to defend a black man and faces humiliation at various times. His kids are also threatened with harm. Director Robert Mulligan had done an excellent job in converting this absorbing screenplay into a riveting movie which deals with prejudice and injustice. ( It is quite interesting to note that soon after a romcom like "" Come September"" in 1961, in the very next year he embarked upon an extremely serious story like this one).The movie can be split up in two parts, the first about the two kids and their friend trying to solve the mystery of the secret actions of their reclusive neighbour Arthur and the second part focuses on the trial in the packed courthouse ( A well deserved Oscar award for best art direction). I for one found the first part focused on the kids a bit slow and a drag mainly because the shooting style, the editing and the background music was typical of the 60s ( six decades earlier) which is radically different from what we have nowadays. I was waiting for the trial to begin and when it did, it was electrifying as Gregory Peck held us spellbound with his strong dialogue delivery and the conviction of his arguments. A well deserved Oscar award indeed. Those who have read the novel will no doubt find watching this movie more engrossing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Wonderful Classic,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a classic film. I'm sure most of you know the story. Atticus, an attorney, is appointed to defending an African- American being accused of raping a white woman. I read the book when I was in 8th grade and was not a huge fan of it. Then again, I wasn't a huge fan of any book I read in school, which is one of the reasons why I detest the schooling systems. But before I go into any more of a rant, I shall share my thoughts on the film.For me, the strongest aspect of the film was the acting. Gregory Peck played the difficult role of Atticus, but did a great job with it. I think that Atticus is one of the most well liked characters in film history. Robert Duvall was spot on with his short, but important role of Boo Radley. And finally, Mary Badham and Phillip Alford gave two wonderful child acting performances as Scout and Jem.One thing I did not expect from this film was that a relatively small amount of time was spent in the courtroom. I think this was a smart move by the filmmakers, as it avoided any slow parts. Instead, it produces one of the best and most dramatic scenes in the entire film that is quick and to the point.The only weakness I found in the film was emotion. This may have been because I already knew the story, but either way, I felt that there was little to cheer or feel bad about.Overall, a great story and great acting makes this film a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Courtroom Drama at it's Best,"To Kill a Mockingbird is without question a perfect 10. The story , the actors, everything is perfect. Gregory Peck delivers a performance that is hard to describe with words. The way he carried himself about the courtroom, the way he spoke  with a firmness no person could challenge made you believe every single word he said.And although tragic , this movie also shows how justice can be served outside the law, ironically. There is plenty of emotion, good and bad, to keep you interested throughout the entire picture. That is why To Kill a Mockingbird is a perfect 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The film has the same effect on me, every time. The early- to mid-sixties produced some superb films, of which this is a stellar example. Many older films seem hokey and dated after a couple of decades. ""Mockingbird"" holds up superbly. It is a perfect movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Horrendous Adaptation,"The only was this movie will be enjoyed is by people who haven't read the book. If you've read the book, you will be disgusted by the shabby treatment it received here. The book was charming, and centered mainly around Scout, Dill and Jem. This movie was nonsense, with Atticus as the lead character. It dragged on and on and never really gained much momentum. One scene after the next fell flat. I'm not sure why Scout narrated this, as she was sadly relegated to a peripheral character as Gregory Peck bumbled about chewing up the screen. His acting was merely sufficient, as he's the same in everything. The children did a fine job, as did most of the supporting characters. The exceptions to decent acting were Aunt Stephanie (bit hokey and overdone), but luckily she was only in a few scenes. The main anchors were the Ewells, who were so horrible in the courtroom scenes it's where the movie fell apart for me. Beyond stupid, really. And the shaky camera work during the infamous attack on the kids at the end was also miserably done. Showing just feet and bits and pieces of the action, it was impossible to discern what was going on. Any rating over 8 is insane for this dreck. The trial took up way too much time and wasn't ever that interesting. Read the book. This slop is simply a poorly done rendition of a book I immensely enjoyed. One star for the performance of the young actress playing Scout, which impressed me greatly. And another one for, um.....not sure, really. Guess I'm just feeling generous.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

very Good Book and Movie,"I was first introduced to Harper Lee's ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" in it's book form. This was required reading in 9th grade English class. There were so many elements in that narrative that drew the reader into a world dictated by the narrative efforts of Scout. Small town southern America is where I grew up.The daily discoveries, challenges, curiosities, and coming of age scenarios were key elements of my childhood. The mysterious ways of adults was real. The allegiance to my kinfolk was real. The unseen terrors of the night were real. For these things I admire Harper Lee for a work well done. In addition to this, this wonderful bit of literature made a remarkable leap to the silver screen. By the time I first saw it, I had read the book several times.The premise of the story never faltered. The magical changing of the seasons, the night of the school program, and the comment Scout made about it being ""the beginning of their longest journey together"", caused a back-of-the-head tingling of warmth and nostalgia.So from the start of Scout's narrative, where she commented on the poverty of that small southern hamlet, toward the end where Sheriff Tate tells Atticus to ""Let the dead bury the dead this time Mister Finch!"", this cinematographic effort has earned a well deserved place in the archives of celluloid splendor.Finally, as I consider the many years of viewing this film, I can not help but notice that the scene depicting the young white woman trying to seduce Tom Robinson has been omitted from any VHS or DVD that one may add to his/her collection.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A MUST see Classic!!,"Simply put, To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best racial and discriminatory based movies in the industry. I'm amazed how the movie forced me to empathize with black people who were being discriminated against. There were multiple times during the movie that I felt a deep sorrow and anguish towards an individual. One of my favorite scenes, and arguably the most compelling scene of the movie took place when Atticus Finch was exiting the courtroom. When court was adjourned, out of respect, all the black people remained in the courtroom and stood up as Atticus Finch exited the courtroom. The appreciation and gratitude that was demonstrated by the black people towards a white man that fought for them was stunning and packed full of emotions.To Kill a Mockingbird was produced in 1960 by Alan J. Pakula. The director, Robert Mulligan, faced an overwhelming task of transforming the famous novel into a film. The film's success was due in large part of the spectacular job that Pakula and Mulligan did with developing the roles played by the characters. There were three children that played major roles in this film; Jem was played by Philip Alford, Mary Badham as Scout, and John Megna played the role of Dill. I learned that all three of these youngsters had minimal experience in the acting business. I would have never known this to be true; the director did an amazing job of filming the scenes with the children. It was as if the director allowed them to be natural opposed to acting from a script.One of the main characters was Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck. Atticus is an attorney in the film, and represents the black man accused of raping a girl. In the film Atticus is a man of integrity and is highly respected in every aspect of his life. He is highly regarded as a professional, father figure, and is well respected in the community. Another main character is played by Brock Peters; he plays the role of Tom Robinson, a black man who is falsely accused of raping a white girl. Tom faces the death penalty if he is found guilty of rape. Even if he isn't found guilty, I felt that he was going to be killed either way. This message hit home with me, I could relate to the power and hopelessness that prejudice can have on someone.When Atticus Finch makes the decision to lawfully represent a minority in Tom Robinson, I knew immediately the type of person Atticus was. A white man representing a black man in the deep south of Alabama during the 1930's was unheard of. It took someone with courage, dignity, and compassion to stand up and do the right thing; Atticus Finch was the perfect man for the job.There was not a better man that could have represented a minority during this time period. The courtroom proceedings will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. Atticus Finch does not disappoint as he uses a strategy to unveil Tom Robinson's innocence. The children make a surprise, yet sneaky court appearance to watch Atticus represent a minority. The children sit in the balcony with all of the black folks; this was a marvelous way that the director uses to demonstrate the children's innocence towards racism. The director's main idea in doing this is to demonstrate that racism is a learned idea and attitude that is developed based on ones' surroundings.The way the movie is filmed allows an individual to feel as if they are in the movie themselves. The acting presented in the film is very natural, and is aided by the simple film angles that are used. From the humanized characters, to the simplistic film angles, the director does a great job in making To Kill a Mockingbird a personable film. This personal down home feel allows viewers to indulge themselves into the movie. This indulgence makes it near impossible for the viewer not to relate and sympathize with the black community. The one scene that demonstrates this best for me was the scene when the white man spits in Atticus' face for representing Tom Robinson. I was so indulged in the film, I literally felt that the white man spat in my face. I felt the disgust and the hurt that Atticus must have been feeling. Faced with a tremendous amount of disrespect, Atticus was true to his character, and was the better man in turning and walking away. Even though Atticus was a white man he could now directly relate to how the black community felt.I cannot recommend To Kill a Mockingbird enough. While children in their innocence may not be able to sympathize with the movie, this is a great movie for young adults and adults alike. The film represents humanity and equality at its' greatest. The character of Atticus Finch alone is an adequate reason to watch this film. If you want to learn about true character, dignity, humbleness, and respect, just watch the character of Atticus Finch and be prepared to be blown away. I have a feeling that this film will be a classic for many years to come, and will remind Americans of their past time and how far society has come.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Timeless story, timeless performance...","To be honest, it has been many years since I've seen this film, and of course I'm here today on hearing of Peck's death last night.In a way, it's just as well that it's a good couple of decades since seeing MOCKINGBIRD (though I'll be buying my own copy soon), since it remains one of my all-time favorite movies.  Yes, it was beautifully, understatedly filmed (and the lovely black and white cinematography seems to highlight the shades of grey in the story).  And yes, there was a powerful, confidently-presented message of toleranceWhat stays with me to this day, though, is the relationship Finch had with his children.  As a father, Atticus Finch showed more respect for his children than I recall ever seeing ANYWHERE.  I remember seeing this respectful relationship, and being deeply touched by it.  I still remember it as my own daughter grows up, and while I can't claim to reach that standard, I at least do my best to remember it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Great book and great movie,"To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite books, and it was amazing to see the characters come alive on the screen. Gregory Peck is absolutely perfect as Atticus Finch, the intelligent and kind father of Scout and Jem, and Robert Duvall is able to depict Boo Radley's deep pain without saying a word. One amazing thing about this film is the way that it is from the perspective of a child. Director Robert Mulligan is able to flawlessly translate this from the book, and ensures that it does not falter throughout the movie. The black-and- white cinematography is evocative of the 1930s Deep South, but To Kill a Mockingbird is not just a period piece. Unfortunately, its portrayal of racism and a corrupt legal system are still relevant today. It is an important film in terms of style and content, and one that I will definitely be seeing again.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

To Kill has provided me with a social injustice scale for my life.,"In 1962 my mother, a huge Greg Peck fan, took me, my older brother and my dad to see To Kill a Mockingbird. We went to a drive-in movie in of all places Fort Fairfield Maine. I was only 7 at the time and we did not have many opportunities to see highly touted films like To Kill, so off we went with anticipation, the 4 of us not knowing what was about to play out.The film started without much fanfare and I became bored and started to fall asleep. Just as I was nodding off, the fog swept in as it is wont to do in Northern Maine even in the summer. The decision was made by the drive-in management to delay the film until the fog blew over (they hoped). My mother had settled my older brother and myself in the backseat of the car hoping we would leave her to be absorbed by Atticus's commanding presence on the screen. Alas the fog had delayed the movie and the question between mom and dad was should we go home. Dad readied the car to go when a tunnel occurred through the fog allowing us to see the screen of the now restarted film.So in a state of half awake in the backseat of a 1960 Blue Plymouth Fury I viewed this enchanting visual, the subtle gray tones of the movie made even more wispy and enchanting by the effect of viewing through the fog. Do you have any idea the effect this had on me, to this day it has influenced me in my view of the goodness and not so good in people. Watching Boo Radley through a fog tunnel was terrifying to a 7 year old but this was balanced by the safety and security of Atticus, fighting the good fight.To this day Atticus and indeed Greg Peck is my yardstick of a person who despite the whirlwind of being a white man in the American south of the 1960's wants to do the right thing and resists getting caught up in the racial maelstrom prevalent of the day.

"""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view""","Storytelling simply do not get better than this. It's a story where we see the world from childrens eyes. The children sees the unnoticeable and realize that the good guy doesn't always win and people are
treated unequally.This movie doesn't just stand out in storytelling but also in acting. The cast all delivers great performance, especially Gregory Peck who's performance is simply stunning.This is a movie made in the 60's that states all are equal. A statement alot of people thought was incorrect at the time. Like i said To kill a mockingbird is a story where the world is seen through childrens point of view. The children see that this world and society is unkind and prejudical.

To Kill a Mockingbird,"Based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer winning work about an Alabama woman recalling a dramatic year in her Depression-era childhood when she learned enough to fill a lifetime: 1) being poor is no sin; 2) heeding gossip very much is one; 3) brothers can be more than siblings; 4) dads more than providers; 5) prejudice can wither; 6) young girls need a mom; 7) we all need a treasure box. More criers than a Charles Dickens novel (Oyez oyez!): rape-charged Tom Robinson's testimony, syrup poor (Condit), ham & roll (still the scariest scene in all of filmdom), Boo Radley there, tree toys, facing down the mob, Elmer Bernstein's score (Globe) & Kim Stanley's warm narration.If putting aside the hero-worship moves me to imagine Robinson's acquital or dismissal in this fictional case, I'm happy to step out from the congregation. Movies invite our own model of what should be. For me, it's the Finch trial strategy. When prejudice and craven conformity are likely common denominators in a jury, one impaneled in part by the defense, truth and passion will not ensure justice is served, not when 'he said, she said' gives such triers of fact an excuse to evade duty. You need to blow the roof off, Mr Estate Planner, by drama, shame, whatever it takes within bounds of decorum. But Tom cannot be allowed to escape if the makers' point is to be made (racism), for without the conflicts (tug of war on Vicky in The Red Shoes), without the absurd (court gentleman Atticus), we'd not have the moving masterpiece that is Mockingbird (4/4).And know this, ""it's a sin"" to kill ANY bird, ""blue jays"" included, just for practice or prejudice. But how Harper Lee got the idea the mockingbird is sweetheart of the South, I can't imagine (Atticus: ""all it does is sing its heart out!""). One of the most efficient and graceful of creatures, it is also the biggest bully on the block, the J. P. Morgan of the bird set, believing it holds title to all it surveys and reigning down terror on any feathered flier who dares challenge its territory or sits feeding unawares.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ground Stirring,"1962. If you read the book or see the movie today, you HAVE to remember that this story was written in a time where the issues covered by this story were not just controversial, but nuclear in their heat. The characters depicted (outside of Atticus Finch and his kids) were not stereotypes, but the mainstream. Harper Lee's story and Horton Foote's adaptation are miraculous. The acting is superb. The subtlety of the scenes, awesome. Citizen Kane, Casablanca, are great movies, but To Kill a Mockingbird transcends all. PLEASE put your mind in that time before you watch this movie and you will see how great it really is. OK, that covers the trial, but then you get to the heart of the story and how Scout brings the innocence we are all born with into fruition. She tells us that Mr. Cunningham and all of us that wander astray can be redeemed. This isn't a story with one aim, this is a masterpiece that brings all things right. There is good in this world and all involved with this production believed that. YOU need to see this movie and believe that, too.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

There are very few adaptations of novels that I find as moving as the original work but this is number one for me. I cannot imagine anybody but Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch and I did read the book before I saw the film. All the rest of the cast (I believe) got the accolades that they richly deserved. It is genuinely moving, not merely sentimental.It is also funny, quirky and full of the joy of life as well as it's darker side.

"Powerful, moving story of injustice, prejudice, family and growing up","Small-town Alabama, 1932. Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck) is a lawyer and a widower. He has two young children, Jem and Scout. Atticus Finch is currently defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. Meanwhile, Jem and Scout are intrigued by their neighbours, the Radleys, and the mysterious, seldom-seen Boo Radley in particular.Based on the Harper Lee novel, a powerful, moving story of injustice, prejudice, family and growing up. The examination of ""justice"" based on racial lines is particularly profound and relevant to its time. The racism that forms the background to the trial is also incredibly gut-wrenching.Just the justice/injustice/racism angle alone was enough to make this movie great. The court scenes, and Finch's closing argument, are among the most powerful ever committed to film. However, tipping the movie over into the masterpiece category are the scenes involving the children.Showing Atticus Funch's family life creates a great sense of engagement with the characters and the town in particular. The children bring a wonderful sense of innocence, boundless vitality and the wonder of discovery and growing up to the movie, and provide some great comedic moments. They also bring some great drama, especially towards the end.Gregory Peck deservedly won a Best Actor Oscar for his stirring, emotional portrayal of Atticus Finch. Incidentally, this was his first and only win, on his fifth and final nomination.Mary Badham, at 9/10 years old, did a great job of playing the hyper-energetic, tomboyish Scout and got a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her efforts. At the time she was the youngest ever nominee in the Best Supporting Actress category.Good support from a great cast, none of whom put a foot wrong. Robert Duvall made his feature film debut in this movie and, although he has no lines and little screen time, his performance, especially his opening shot, is very memorable and powerful.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A lawyer against a village.,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a movie based on Harper Lee's book of 1961 (Pulitzer Prize winning). It's a movie that displays the racial racism of the time (1930s) and how people treat each other in such times.It all starts when a black man (Brock Peters) accused of raping a white woman and Gregory Peck (Atticus Finch) represent him as his lawyer. When villagers learn about this representation of Atticus Finch they want to change his mind but Atticus decides to go ahead of it.I liked very much the performances of Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch a lawyer who fights for justice and of course the performances of the two little ones (son and daughter of Atticus Finch) Mary Badham as Scout and Phillip Alford as Jem.I recommend it because I think that this movie shows us a different treatment of a black man in those times from a white man.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Southern Gothic at its Finest,"Reading this book as a child, I was immediately drawn to it for its simple yet complex themes. It wasn't part of our school curriculum; growing up in the South, it's easily understood why. This film holds an equal candle to the novel, something most movies fail in accomplishing. I grew up in a town similar to Maycomb (even though Maycomb itself is fictitious), as did my ancestors before me. Quirky characters, Southern colloquiums, culture -- it's all here. And we'll represented. The screenplay honorably serves Miss Lee's narrative. The musical score is achingly beautiful. Echoes of that time and place ring true in this film, which remains all these many years later, as haunting and evocative a story ever told.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A wonderfully adapted classic to the big screen. Atticus personifies the true American hero,"""Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passing.""To Kill a Mockingbird is one of those rare classic films that actually manages to hold up to its source material. Harper Lee's novel is so touching and powerful that it would've been a shame if the film didn't do it justice, but after 50 years I can honestly say that it holds up as a true classic. The story is told through the point of view of a young innocent girl who sees her attorney father as a hero and that is what makes this story so easy to engage with. It's a film that focuses on social injustice and it is told through an innocent child's perspective which gives it a fresh spin. The courtroom scene is powerful and moving, but everything that leads up to it is also very fascinating. Watching the children play and gossip about their mysterious neighbor is sort of a parable for the social injustice that the story tackles on later in the film. It's as if Lee were trying to show us how primitive and childish society had become during that time of racial segregation. The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Mulligan and perfectly adapted by Horton Foote. After I return from my vacations I will try to write a more thoughtful and insightful review, but for now I wanted to point out some of my initial thoughts about this inspiring movie. I can finally understand why this is Clark Kent's favorite movie because Aticcus FInch is simply the personification of that superhero. Gregory Peck gives a masterful performance, but he did have a great character to work with.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Unguilty person has to die. Guilty person doesn't have to die. It is unreasonable but reasonable in that setting,"""To kill a mocking bird"" is worth to be seen (and read, of course). It's an very interesting movie and you are inevitable to watch it again! The movie is about an outstanding matter in American society at that time: racial discrimination. Black people are not people at its full meaning of this word. The plot brings us interesting feeling with character's dramatic interaction. Unguilty person has to die. Guilty person doesn't have to die. It is unreasonable but reasonable in that setting. Maybe Lawyer Atticus'effort gains no result but the largest thing he has received is people's respect. ""Scout, stand up. Your dad is passing"" is an humanity and emotional image. The ending part with the sentence ""let's the dead buries the dead"" has the same meaning with ""we reap as we sow"" in Eastern proverb.There is no reason to kill a mocking bird, particularly when it brings no harm but happy birdsong for our life.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the all time greats.,"To Kill a Mocking Bird is one of the all time greatest books and films of all time. It's the timeless story of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) a lawyer in the Great Depression in Alabama and his relationship with his children Jean ""Scout"" Finch (Mary Badham) and Jem Finch (Phillip Alford) and his devotion in defending Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) an African American man accused of rape. The book is one of the most critically acclaimed works of literature ever and it was brought to the screen with great success. Atticus is one of my favorite characters of all time. He's a hero who strives to serve justice to an unrepresented minority. And the scenes where he talks to his kids about different things are great too. The best scene of all though is the courtroom scene. I highly recommend To Kill a Mocking Bird in literary or cinematic form.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Foreigner,"Being such, racism mainly, as long as other issues/trend/habits, like guns everywhere, acceptance of self justice, drinking as entertainment I fail to understand a lot of meanings in such movies. Having quite an experience on the subject, I'd say it has an excellent directing, good scenario, superb acting, specially from the adorable ""Scout"" (sorry, Gregory Peck) and almost perfect photography. Generally speaking for a country with no national core (although ""nation"" is repeatedly used in USA, where the citizens form a unique patchwork of nationalities) for a non US citizen, some things and ideas are not easy to understand. And I dare to say that 3 Academy Awards were a comfortable ""forgiveness"" to the unspeakable racism, even today, in US. I do not mean to insult anyone, but on the other hand, I can not ignore one, maybe the most critical trend on the ""civilized"" world, racism, and spot it whenever recognized. Scratching my head, I think ""In the heat of the night"" was a louder and more positive voice against racism. Anyway, it's just an (my) opinion!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Captures the Essence of the Deep South During This Particular Era,"This film takes place in the depression-era South with a small-town lawyer named ""Atticus Finch"" (Gregory Peck) being asked by ""Judge John Taylor"" (Paul Fix) to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. Firm in his belief that every man deserves equal protection under the law, Atticus agrees--even though he knows that certain people in town will resent him for it. Sure enough, not long after he accepts the assignment, his two young children are taunted in school by some of the other kids. Beyond that, however, their main focus is on a reclusive neighbor named ""Arthur 'Boo' Radley"" (Robert Duvall) who serves as the town boogeyman and frightens the young children, even though none of them have ever met him. Meanwhile, as the trial date nears, the raw hatred and ugliness of some of the people intensifies. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this is an outstanding movie which, I believe, accurately captures the essence of the South during this particular time in American history. It should also be noted that Gregory Peck deservedly won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in this movie as well. Be that as it may, I found this to be an incredibly good picture, and I have rated it accordingly.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Duvall plays the next door neighbor that everyone is afraid of except Scout, Aticus' daughter who steals the film.  It's a story of racism in the south during the early 60's and how one man, Aticus Finch (Gregory Peck) helps to bring a small town together when he defends a black man accused of raping and murdering a white woman.  This film ranks up there with Citizen Kane and others that are considered to be the best of all time. I can't recommend this film enough.

A Cinematic Masterwork About Human Fallibility in a World of Wearying Intolerance,"Having just read Charles Shields' biography of Harper Lee, ""Mockingbird"", and re-read her classic (and only) novel for at least the third time, I was able recently to watch Robert Mulligan's 1962 classic film adaptation with fresh eyes, and the 2005 Legacy Series Edition DVD fortunately contains a pristine print transfer and a bundle of extras that make repeated viewings more than worthwhile. Rarely has a film so accurately captured the emotional consequences of human fallibility steadfastly within the grip of racial intolerance. Set in the Deep South of Lee's childhood in the fictional town of Maycomb in 1932, the story, adapted by writer Horton Foote, focuses on six-year old Scout, the tomboy, motherless daughter of lawyer Atticus Finch.Along with her four-years older brother Jem, Scout regales the new neighbor boy Dill with horror stories about the bleak-looking Radley house and its chief occupant, ""Boo"", whom they believe has been locked up in the basement. Finch, in the meantime, has been given the unenviable task of defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping Mayella, the cry-wolf daughter of a white trash racist farmer, Bob Ewell. The two stories meld seamlessly with the model behavior of Finch, who tries to teach his children not to come to judgment based on hearsay and perception. Facing great odds, Finch attempts to discredit Mayella on the stand, but Tom's sympathetic testimony proves to be his own undoing. Because of the town's pervasive racism, Finch loses the case, and tragic consequences ensue. However, life lessons for the children emerge as well as ""Boo"" in an unexpected heroic act.Gregory Peck gives his career-best performance as Finch, bringing the necessary human-sized dimensions to a most honorable man. It's inspiring work from a great screen legend. Mary Badham is wonderful as the inquisitive Scout never veering off toward precociousness in her acting, and almost as good is Philip Alford as Jem. Brock Peters plays Tom with palpable dignity, while James Anderson dexterously handles the unenviable task of playing the disturbingly vile Ewell. An almost-albino-looking Robert Duvall makes his film debut as ""Boo"" Radley, making his late appearance in the film impactful. I did not know that the remarkable Kim Stanley is the one who provides the voice-over for the grown-up Scout neé Jean Louise. Elmer Bernstein composed the sparse but resonate musical score, and Russell Harlan's black-and-white cinematography is effectively evocative. This masterwork is as good as family films get.The two-disc DVD set has a superb package of extras for any fan of the film and the book. Beyond providing an excellent print and audio transfer, the first disc contains a deeply insightful commentary track with full participation from Mulligan and the late producer, Alan J. Pakula, a superb director in his own right. There is also video footage of Peck's acceptance speech when he won the 1962 Best Actor Oscar for his role, his quite touching speech when he received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989, a tribute from his daughter Cecilia, a brief 1999 interview with the seldom-seen Badham, and the original theatrical trailer.The second disc offers a fascinating, ninety-minute 1998 documentary, ""Fearful Symmetry"", filmed effectively in black-and-white, which goes well beyond the standard making-of featurette. It includes interviews with Peck, Badham, Alford, Pakula, Mulligan, Foote and Bernstein, and paints a remarkably penetrating story of the production. There is a second feature, 1999's ""A Conversation with Gregory Peck"", directed by famed documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple, which is actually a full-blown feature about the actor as he prepares for an onstage tribute. Providing revealing glimpses of the private man, it originally aired on PBS's ""American Masters"" series.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Almost as good as the book,"This was some bold subject matter, and it is semi-autobiographical. The movie came out two years after the book, and the fact that Civil Rights was still going on is why this was all such a big deal. What really shows the risk factor, is how such a divisive issue is shown through the eyes of Scout, and not Atticus. It's a great idea, and really gives some thought provoking insight by framing such a big issue through the eyes of a young, precocious child. This also serves as a great way to educate children on the issue. The performances all around are brilliant. The kids are great and likable (which is quite a rarity), Robert Duvall makes a stunning film debut, Brock Peters is agonizingly sympathetic and compelling as Robinson, and then we get the man who really shines above all: Gregory Peck. This was a much deserved Oscar winning and career defining performance for him, and it really is one of the greats. He's wonderful through the whole thing, and he comes off as the kind of dad a person would love to have as their own. What seals the deal though is his lengthy courtroom monologue. I get all kinds of shaken and emotionally stirred up every time I watch that scene. It's some of the most powerful, riveting, and memorable acting ever put on film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
