The Ultimate Edition,"Great improvement over the lukewarm PG-13 theatrical version.If the film studio had had more courage, who knows in which directions this story would have continued.The Ultimate Edition is certainly a superior product in all segments compared to the theatrical version. The gaps in the story are filled, and the characters have more depth.In PG-13 films the action is lukewarm, bloodless, and that degrades the impression of the whole film. The film received intensity, atmosphere and worthy action in its R-rated version. A lot of films failed due to the short-sightedness of producers and film studios.The cast, with the exception of Jesse Eisenberg, is excellent. Yes, I didn't like Lex Luthor, but Henry Cavill as Superman and Ben Affleck as Batman are great. Henry Cavill seems to have stepped down from the pages of comics and is certainly a great choice for this role.In this version his character is more complete and gains in depth. Ben Affleck excellently portrayed this iconic figure. His Batman is dark, furious and brutal. The only miss is Lex Luthor, but maybe his character would improve in the sequels that would follow.Apart from the improved story, the action is better, more brutal and there are no restrictions set by the PG-13 standard.The casting is really great, although Lex Luthor is a complete failure, but like I said, maybe his character would have evolved further had we been able to see how the story unfolded later. The cinematography is excellent, and the costume design itself did a great job.This version of the film would definitely have been better accepted, if only the film studio had a little more courage. The action scenes are superbly directed.Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition is certainly a big improvement over the theatrical version.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
DON'T watch the 2h32m version! Watch the Extented instead!,"If you are lazy to read the entire review, just read this: 31 minutes of footage makes a HUGE difference in the film/storyline.To be honest, I was not so impressed when I saw the first cut (2h32m) as I got the impression that the story was rushed and confused... but then I watched the extended version and it all made sense, the added details matter a lot!If you like me thought that this filme was not good, I say this to you: give it a try, but watch the extended one. If possible, watch it in IMAX and I'm sure your experience will be different!One more thing... if you recently watched the Snyder Cut, BvS will make even more sense now - trust me.Rating 8/10 for the extended version (6/10 for the 2h32m cut).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best Comic-book movies of all time,Thank God this is up for rating. Avoid the theatrical cut. This is the director's intent. I still remember being in the theaters waiting for a World's Finest movie. I got something so much more. I'd have to wait for this edition however to come out on blu-ray but it changed all the issues I had with the theater cut experience. The reason we got the Snyder cut movement was because of this. We knew the studio tampered with an epic vision. If you want the true Ultimate experience watch this back to back with Man of Steel and Zack Snyder's Justice League.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Stronger version,"Surprisingly, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition manages to fix a lot of the problems with the original version with only half an hour of extra content. It's able to recontextualize the central conflict of the title with added depth and fixes a lot of the plot holes.It also comes to a more satisfying conclusion due to great callbacks to previously unseen characters and is allowed to be more mature by being able to show more of the violence rather than hide from it or edit it out. Additionally, seeing more of Henry Cavill's Superman saving people is always welcome.Not all of the problems are fixed as the unnecessarily destructive third act is obviously still present as is the forced franchise set-up that still feels very clunky. Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman is still excellent but the increased violence makes him killing even more distracting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Extended Cut- Outstanding,The first Batman v Superman movie I saw was the extended cut and it was incredible. I loved this film. The story was good. Loved all the dc Easter eggs in the film. The only thing that I didn't like was Jesse eisenberg as lex luthor. He is a great actor but him as lex luthor just didn't work. Other than that I highly recommend watching the extended cut other than the regular version.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
OK is a two-letter word that describes the most anticipated movie of 2016!,"Let's be honest! We were all, even marvel fan boys, waiting for this movie. The two most well known superheroes fighting... what could go wrong!? A lot.The positives:1. Batman & Alfred; Batfleck was amazing! Ben Affleck represented a batman that is damaged, changed his moral code(which if they play their cards right could be a center piece of solo batman films) and made him more bad-ass because of it.2. The action: Amazing Action! It's thrilling, exciting and beautifully shot. That is what Zack does though and I expected nothing less.3. Wonder woman: Supringsly well done. Her as Diana prince was maybe a bit stiff sometimes but she can make the character her own along the way. I trust her that much. Her as wonder woman was amazing!! I got chills when she joined the fight!4. Cinematography is general. It is a beautiful film to look at. Nicely shot and as I said the action is amazing. The CGI in certain places are a bit ""meh"" and one shot did take me out of the movie, but that's it.Now the bad stuff why this movie went downhill:1. the editing/pacing: Guys, this movie was a mess. The movie begins great with an introduction of batman and some stuff you saw in the trailer. Then we go to a scene... which tells us a story then it goes to another scene. You're invested in that particular and then it jump cuts to another scene. You are seeing 4 different story lines play out in 5 minute scenes after each other. As a general movie goer-ER you will lose track. As a DC-fan, as myself, I could understand everything but i needed to bring all my previous knowledge to actually understand. Really bad pacing2. Superman: Not everyone will agree on this, but I think they handled superman horribly. He needs to be symbol of hope and yet he is never exactly that. There was certain montage, where it should shown that he was, but i never felt that he was. This representation was too dark. This was also more of a batman movie with superman playing a small part in that, yet batman's world is too dark for superman. If you want to combine their worlds, let Batman play a role in superman's world.3. Lex Luther. I hated his representation of the power hungry and menacing villain. He played mark suckable and was a complete miscast. I don't care if he was the son of the ""real"" lex Luther. It didn't fit.4. Doomsday: A complete waste of a great story arc. Why did they bring him in while there was so much going on..5. The justice league set up: It felt rushed. The way they shoehorned all the other characters in was lazy writing.6. the whole motivation of superman fighting batman. batman's motivation was clear and great. Superman's was horrible. They were one conversation away from understanding each other, but they had to fight of course.7. Many many plot holes, but i cant go into those because i don't wanna spoil the whole movie.verdict: If you love flashy action.. go watch it in Max. If you like great story.. wait till it releases on blue-ray.6 out of 10 for a mediocre movie that should been an epic man. I was so disappointed. I see so many DC fans raging this movie was epic, but we're dealing with the phantom menace effect.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Waaaaaaaaayy better than theatrical version,I will never understand why this cut was not in theaters. The theatrical cut was choppy and I struggled to follow the story because of holes in the plot.

Watch this version not the theatrical cut!,This movie really does fix many of the issues many had with the theatrical cut. The pacing is perfect and this movie is much more balanced between superman and batman compared to the theatrical cut. Many of those additional 30 minutes are Clark Kent scenes that was cut. The desert scene in this version is also different and the movie makes much more sense. I really think this is a great movie. 10/10!,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""Is it really surprising that the most powerful character in the world would be a figure of controversy?""","I could go on and on about the symbolism, political commentary, strong themes and amazing character work embedded throughout this movie.I could also go on and on about how WB, critics and some D. C. Fans have since the TC's release in 2015 unfairly misrepresented, misinterpreted and misunderstood the film to drag it down. This, the Ultimate, most complete Edition (especially the new Remaster with some IMAX scenes restored) is rather more immune to that bad-faith criticism as it spends more time going in-depth to each plot point as well as adding and explaining characters and decisions which simply did not make sense in the Theatrical Cut.Is the movie perfect now? Of course not. But is it an amazing, extremely well-written, excellently shot and scored and brilliantly performed breath of fresh air amongst the hordes of by-the-numbers comic book movies?

It's an OK movie; don't go to the cinema with high expectations,"Sadly, a step down from Man of Steel. First of all, I was a bit skeptical about this movie, and thought the runtime (about 2 and a half hours) was way too long (and I wasn't completely wrong though). The action scenes were better than what we saw in the trailer. Although the doomsday scenes had terrible CGI (you'll know it when you'll see it), but overall I was happy. The movie had a lot crazy-packed action (it was directed by Zack Snyder, what do ya expect?) but the plot didn't know where it was going. A lot of scenes were a treat for me to see and I got goosebumps watching them. There was more to Jesse Eisenberg than what I saw (and hated, like most people) in the trailer. I made a bet to my friend that he'll suck in the movie, guess I'll have to pay up. He really WAS good. But just like any other movie, it's not perfect and has flaws. You can see that Zack tried hard very hard to fit everything nicely into the movie, but over stuffing was bound to happen. Other than that, I think there are some fan-boys who'll be satisfied no matter how bad the movie is. Hope my review didn't give away any spoilers in any way whatsoever, and that you end up enjoying the movie as much as (or more than) I did.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Theatrical was fine, but this is better","After I saw the original theatrical cut opening night, I was conflicted. I knew I still liked it but couldn't tell how much. So I watched it again that weekend. Upon my second viewing I realized I liked it a lot and gave it an 8. Still a great, although misunderstood, film. It made me think, feel, and had my favorite Batman and Superman in it (with an awesome Wonder Woman too).When this Ultimate Edition came out though, I had to buy it and watch it right away. I was blown away. It was actually better than the theatrical cut! And seeing it several times over the years, this film has become even better than the day it released. In my opinion it is one of the most interesting, thoughtful, emotional, and beautiful superhero movies ever created. I can honestly say it changed my life, and I will always defend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Sloppy, Misleading, And Disappointing, With Some Incredible Moments Mixed In","Well, the wait is finally over. Batman and Superman are in a big screen film together for the first time in history. The result? A sloppy attempt at setting up the DC Universe. Batman v Superman has its moments though with great performances from almost every one and action that could rival Man of Steel, but it was difficult to not walk out of this film and feel overwhelmingly disappointed. For a film that finished filming over a year ago, you would think Zack Snyder and Warner Bros would make all the effort in the world to edit in and out the stuff that's important and tighten the movie, but that isn't the case.It's directed by the aforementioned Snyder and stars almost the entire Man of Steel cast along with Ben Affleck and Jeremy Irons as Batman and Alfred respectively. The performances are mostly great all around, including Amy Adams, who unfortunately felt out of place for most of the film. I have no problem with Adams' portrayal or the character of Lois Lane being in the film, but she was misused and overused here. She and General Swanwick from the first film have several small scenes that are used for us to find out more about Lex Luthor. But the problem is, it's a good 15 minutes of the film that could have shaved down to 3 or 4 minutes worth of scenes.Speaking of Lex Luthor, the casting of Jesse Eisenberg caused a big stew of controversy when it was first announced, and I think it was warranted. I've seen the film twice now and had different opinions both times. The first time I was entertained by Lex but also confused as to why they went the route they did with the character. The second time, I was annoyed by the performance and the over the top portrayal of what should be a menacing villain. A few scenes here and there had those classic Luthor aspects that I've loved from the animated series and films, but the tone they went with for Eisenberg's performance just doesn't work. There's little humor in an incredibly dark film, and Lex seems like he's from a completely different film.The other big problem the film unfortunately has is its title and marketing. Most of the marketing material was well done and proposed ""the greatest gladiator match in the history of man"", but the reality is that it's merely 10 minutes of a 2 and a half hour film. The fight itself is phenomenal. It doesn't hold a candle to the fight in the comic book/film ""The Dark Knight Returns"", but it's probably the best part of Batman v Superman. The focus was all over the place though. Everything from the fight onto the ending is good cinema, but man does it take a long time to get there. I actually sat in the theater saying to myself ""I'm kind of bored right now"". How in the world does that happen in a superhero film, let alone a Batman film?There are still plenty of great aspects to this film, however. Diane Lane has a few heart-warming and gut-wrenching scenes. Laurence Fishburne provides some good comic relief as the head of the Daily Planet, Perry White. Jeremy Irons gives us our most involved and bada** Alfred to date. Even Gal Gadot, another questionable casting choice, showed acting chops that I didn't think she had here and got me excited for the Wonder Woman film next year. Which brings me to the weirdest part about my feelings about this film. As many problems as there are, it didn't get me any less enthused for the future of the DCEU. Some few surprises in the film, tease Justice League which was neat. And I'm incredibly stoked for Ben Affleck's solo Batman film. With that said, I don't think I can get that excited for Justice League if Snyder still directs. I have to believe many of the directing and editing mistakes came from him. But perhaps even Warner Bros themselves needs to take some of the fault for giving Snyder too much reign? Another positive though was Hans Zimmer's score, unsurprisingly. I loved the way him and Junkie XL managed to weave in Superman's theme with the new haunting Batman theme.Ben Affleck may very well be the definitive Batman. Everyone knew his Bruce Wayne would be great but his Batman does not disappoint. There are scenes which rival the action in the Arkham video games in terms of style, creativity, and fluidity. I couldn't be more excited for Affleck to write, direct, and star in the solo film whenever it may come out.I honestly can't believe I'm sitting here typing an average review for a film that's one of my most anticipated of all time, but I am. There are plenty moments of pure greatness here, but for every incredible scene, there's an unnecessary or strange scene out of place. Sure, I enjoyed the film more the second time I saw it, but I just can't believe how sloppy of a filmmaking job this was. A missed opportunity for Warner Bros for sure.+Affleck+Action+Last 40 minutes are awesome+Zimmer's score+Performances-Except for the tonally off performance by Eisenberg-Sloppy editing-Slow and almost boring first half7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Such potential, such a missed opportunity","'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' was not as awful as reputed, but was a huge disappointment. With the cast it had and the characters it was going to have in it it had the potential. It is such a shame that, despite some bright spots, Zach Snyder badly bungles its execution.The best things about 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' are the final battle and Ben Affleck. The final battle, which takes up much of the final 40 minutes, is explosively thrilling, dynamically choreographed, passionately performed and beautifully shot. That's true of all of the action actually. Am usually not a big fan of Affleck, but he does do a surprisingly great job as Batman. The casting could have been disastrous but Affleck gives a brooding intensity to the character and more range than he usually exudes. Other bright spots in the cast are Jeremy Irons' very amusing Alfred, Amy Adams' feisty if somewhat underused Lois Lane and particularly Gal Gadot's positively show-stopping Wonder Woman.Visually, 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' mostly looks good, with the sole exceptions of some very jumpy editing and the rather artificial-looking Doomsday. It's beautifully shot however and boldly dark and gritty look fits beautifully within the story. Hans Zimmer's music score has many moments of sheer power and beauty, one of his more dynamic and involving scores in recent years.These great things are unfortunately outweighed by the bad. The weakest asset of 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' is the story, which only really comes to life in the last forty minutes. In the meantime it takes seemingly forever to get there with a particularly ham-fisted, rambling and dull first hour. Another big problem with the story is that it's overstuffed, from trying to insert so many ideas, subplots and characters, and too often under-cooked dramatically, from too many of the characters being given short shrift and from too many of the subplots being underdeveloped, discarded or at the end of the day unnecessary. Half an hour's trimming at least would have made it far better already.Snyder is great in visual style and in the action, but in the drama, which is a mess of overwrought and undercooked, and storytelling he does flounder badly here. The script is at best clunky and dreary, with few moments that evoke thought, very few moments resonate emotionally and the funnier quirkier scenes apart from with Irons seem misplaced. Pacing is all over the place, with some parts feeling jumpy and then most parts in serious begging of a steroid shot. While there are some bright spots in the cast, too many of the performances don't come off well. Jesse Eisenberg is the biggest problem, his manic and almost comical Lex Luthor belongs in another film entirely, while Henry Cavill is stiff and ill at ease this time round as Superman complete with limited expression. Laurence Fishburne tries his best and has moments but he doesn't blend as well as he could have done. And to say that the film makes a complete waste of Doomsday, who was non-threatening and pretty pointless actually, is an insult to the word wasted.In conclusion, the potential was high but despite some bright spots 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' misses the mark. 4/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Too many stories in one movie,"It really had potential, but was ruined by the odd story structure. It tried following way too many characters. It felt like each of the characters had their own side-story, but parts of it was removed and when something happened, may it be an emotional happening or a finding, it was thrown right at your face with no explanation.I truly had hopes in this movie, considering Watchmen being one of the greatest movies. It was built correctly and didn't have absurd events with no relation to the actual consequences of something.It was all a bit anti-climax, to short it up. If something was introduced, it was shown an hour later. If something emotional happened, it was at the worst place of time and just made the excitement go to waste. There was one scene which had me sitting on the edge of the seat.. but still, it was predictable and quite odd as well. It felt like that character was (you know who I'm talking about) was fairly unnecessary, and as Zack Snyder said at comic-con ""put in the movie so Holly Hunter could be in the movie"".It's really depressing to say this, honestly. It had some amazing potential, but it was too big with too little time. Had it had an hour longer (my god that'd be too long though), some back-story could of made sense and some turns of events would be more plausible. But it wasn't and sure, it was an OK watch, but it had me yawning and grasping for something deeper and emotional.I hope the continuing DC movies will be better. I understand this movie had a lot of pressure on it, seeing as this is setting up the whole universe. But it could of been more detailed and perhaps some side-stories could have been saved for another movie or even scrapped. Oh well.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Watch the extended version and you'll surely enjoy the film.,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a superhero film directed by Zack Snyder. The film stars an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Jesse Eisenberg, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Jeremy Irons, Holly Hunter, and Gal Gadot.Both Batman and Superman feels each other as the threat to humanity and hence stars battle against each other.Quite shocked to see so much negative reviews about the film, the film is not that bad as mentioned by majorly of critics and should be watched the extened version instead.Acting is good but in opinion it was Henry Cavill who looked much more impressive then Ben Affleck, however it would be wrong in saying that Ben Affleck wasn't that impressive but out of the two it was Henry who steals the show, Jesse Eisenberg shocked me with is acting and despite of a huge star cast he was very much successful in showcasing his talent and making a mark for himself.Screenplay was average and gets slow in between however this doesn't spoils the overall film viewing experience. Climax is strong gives a good closure to the film.In my opinion if you are willing to watch the film than please watch the extended version and please watch ignoring the critics.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"An overlong, awkwardly paced, poorly edited mess, yet BvS improves on Man of Steel in almost every way and boasts some of the greatest superhero moments ever put to screen.","I was skeptical about this one from the get-go. Zack Snyder, basically a more talented and flashier Michael Bay, taking over the DC Extended Universe and pinning two of the greatest superheros against each other. I wasn't sure he could make it work. And I'm still not quite sure if he did. The reason I say that is because the movie is missing scenes. Like most of Snyder's work, it was meant to be a rated R, three hour long movie, and in order for a wide release it had to be trimmed which means some crucial scenes were modified or cut completely, and you can tell. The editing is choppy, even frustrating at times, and the pacing is nonexistent. There aren't any build ups. It just goes from exposition to AMAZINGNESS to exposition to BADASSERY to exposition to AWESOME HOLY SH*T EXPLOSIONS, etc. I won't blame Snyder until I see his version so as of now I'd pin that on the writers and editors (if there were any editors because holy hell some of the cuts are atrocious). When the big moments come, like Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne's first meeting, or Lex Luthor's birthing of Doomsday, or hell when Batman and Superman finally go at it, they just happen. There's no emotional weight attached to any of it. It's freaking awesome to look at, but there's no pathos to give it the extra oomph that pushes great movies into the extraordinary.Having said that, Batman v Superman is highly entertaining. The action set pieces are gorgeous and the titular showdown is indeed awesome when it finally comes. The heroes themselves are amazing. Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne is one of the most perfect choices in casting since Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. He IS Bruce Wayne. You never question it when he's on screen. Henry Cavill is great as the man of steel. He doesn't have much to work with but he shines when he needs to. And Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman steals the screen whenever she comes on. She's perfect. And when these heroes come together to fight the common enemy, Doomsday, it's truly a sight to behold. That is the main thing Dawn of Justice has over Man of Steel, the heroes. But while Man of Steel succeeded in the villain department with the commanding presence of General Zod, that is where Batman v Superman suffers most.Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor didn't bother me as much as I thought it would honestly. For what he had to do, he was fine in the role. The problem is that the character is written as an obnoxious rich sociopath with a penchant for mayhem, so he's basically in the shadows for a majority of the movie acting as a puppeteer to pit Superman against Batman. He poses no physical threat of any sort. Hell, seeing him stand next to Batman and Superman you can easily see either of them crushing him like the cockroach that he is. But there is something unsettling about his unassuming manner. The courtroom scene in particular is a chilling one, and his rooftop monologue actually hits all the right beats and he borders on threatening. Again, it's less against Eisenberg and more on how the script wanted the character to be. Doomsday is fine also. The only reason he exists is to have an epic fight in the third act and it delivers, but as a character he's just... an anti-character. That's exactly what he is actually. The antithesis of Superman - a godless killing machine, a creature with no conscience, an unkillable force of nature. So he served his purpose, but there was no charismatic villain for me to be rooting for (or against). It's just a waiting game for the heroes to get into action.The movie is also too long. Mind you, a sh*tload of stuff is crammed into the two and a half hours to warrant the runtime, but a few subplots could've been scrapped and the movie would've been better for it. I feel like if a good editor swept through the movie, trimmed the fat, put all the pieces in the right place and kept it at a tight two hours, Batman v Superman could be one of the greatest superhero movies ever made. As of now, it's a beautifully fun mess. Entertaining as all hell but lacking in depth. And again, Zack Snyder's ultimate cut may be the perfect superhero movie, but we'll just have to wait and see.Which brings me to my main point, and that's Batman v Superman is a comic book movie. It's meant to entertain. Dissecting it and critiquing it as a piece of cinema is too easy and is an exercise in futility really, which is why I dismiss most of the critic reviews claiming it's a cinematic disaster when its entire premise is based around fantasy and the absurd. It's incredibly fun, and that's all it's supposed to be. The fact that it has some truly awe-inspiring moments and intermittently amazing dialogue is just icing on the cake. Batman v Superman is a flawed movie, no doubt about it, but it accomplishes what it sets out to. It gives us Batman versus Superman. It gives us the dawn of the Justice League. It gives us a big screen adaptation of Lex Luthor and a juggernaut of a villain in Doomsday. All the pieces are there. The question is whether or not you're willing to shut off your brain and sit back and enjoy the comic book epicness happening on screen. If you are, then Batman v Superman is an absolute must-watch thrill ride. If not, then why on earth are you seeing a Zack Snyder film in the first place?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Decent start to the Justice League franchise,"'Batman v Superman's main aim is to set up the two Justice League films coming out in the next three years and combat Marvel's dominance of superhero films. It has the tough job of reintroducing/shoehorning a new Batman (Affleck) into the 'Man of Steel' world (even though the tone's darker, like Nolan's Batman films), with Bruce Wayne driving around Metropolis during Superman (Cavill)'s big fight with General Zod from the previous film. Why? Not sure - he just appears reckless. We also have to see Batman's parents die again - must be at least the third time on film...The film tries to blend together two popular graphic novels - 'The Dark Knight Returns' from the late 80s and 'The Death of Superman' from the early 90s - with varying degrees of success. I wish it had more of the former, but it instead almost makes Lois (Adams) the main star and puts her in the middle of everything. There's heaps of political manoeuvring and ""is Superman a risk or not?"" with Lex (Eisenberg) and a Senator Finch (Hunter), but it all takes 90min to set up and there's finally a pay-off, but it leaves a lot of action that needs to be squeezed into the final hour.I didn't like that Gotham was right across the harbour from Metropolis (a la San Francisco & Oakland), rather than hundreds of kilometres distant as it's supposed to be. Batman has a few too many dreams/visions for my liking... However, the score's great, Irons was good as Alfred, but underused, as is Perry (Fishburne). FYI, there's no after credit scene, so don't bother sitting through the extra 5min! When they get to the big Doomsday battle at the end, and Wonder Woman (Godot) joins in, it is pretty exciting and eventful. A good film, just not spectacular.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

He also has an incredible fight scene involving him fighting mercs/thugs using everything from his hands, knees, feet, head and elbows as well as tech such as grappling hook, gum jammer, batarang.

Watch The Ultimate Edition!!!,"When I first saw this in theaters to me it was a good movie, I thought it was great, but after seeing the Ultimate Edition, I can finally say that This version of the movie could've been way better if it was in theaters. Meaning that this 3hr and 20min movie would've made the movie more awesome hadn't Warner Brothers cut out certain parts of the Ultimate Edition. Looking back after seeing the UE this version totally sucked ass if it wasn't cut that much. Having a movie that can run 4hrs or 3hrs can definitely make the theatres. You can still do that, it doesn't have to always be a 2hr and 20min movie. Now after watching the UE I finally understand what they cut again.

A once in a lifetime movie (BVS ultimate edition),"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of ""extra"" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements.The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the ""Martha"" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in.So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Not a single moment I wasn't entertained!,"I entered the theatre expecting a great film but not amazing, as I never really did enjoy Zack Snyder's movies, but I left putting this as my favourite film I've ever seen.The plot is completely original in my view, and separates itself from guessable outcomes, non being like most movies where it's good v bad, but makes each characters role seem understandable and makes sense, with the reasoning of batman fighting superman.The film finds a way to make the character development and giving details of the position the characters are in, in an entertaining way, so that I couldn't look away for a moment. I cared about the plot and the lives of these charactersHow each character in this film is portrayed is unique and different, separating itself from the comics, but not becoming unknown to the fans of DC and makes both non reader and readers, both equally understand the filmThe fight scenes are stunning to the eye and is extraordinary to watch throughout, with non stop pace in each of these scenes without overdosing your eyes.This film is amazing and a MUST see for anyone.

Some Greatness Undermined by Fatal Flaws,"There is an utter greatness that thrusts BATMAN v SUPERMAN: Dawn of Justice into immediate attention. The brawl from which it explodes and paves way for relentless epic action sequences, conjures breathtaking forms, never less monumental than what Snyder seemingly tries to make them appear on the big screen. It's a visual spectacle, only much grittier and grimmer than any of its Marvel counterparts has ever been, even darker than the already dimly- toned 'Man of Steel' in 2013. In such measure, it is no question that this pre-Justice League movie has created for itself a towering achievement. But if that's how you gauge cinematic greatness, alone, then let's call the recent 'Fantastic Four' resurrection, a colossal epic (note the exaggeration). True enough, the absurd amount of explosive action takes the film into some time-stopping, jaw-dropping prodigiousness, but it is ultimately the absence of a decent plot that pulls itself to the ground. And while the overstuffed narrative is what tends its already complex plot line into further convolusion, it is not entirely what it is adequate of, that ultimately gives 'Dawn of Justice' unnecessary weight, but the horrendous lack of coherence and proper structure of its narrative.Picking up from where 'Man of Steel' ended, the film paints the kryptonian superhero, a figure of destruction. Half of his city worships him, while the other regards him as its very destroyer, capable enough to rend the earth apart. Much of this film is spent in introductions, of hints about a looming mega-franchise that, let me guess, is set to counter what is Avengers to Marvel. That could have been alright if only the film knows where to place them. A recurring streak of ominous dreams introduces Bruce Wayne's (Ben Affleck) visions, while also becoming Clark Kent's (Henry Cavill) ultimate nemesis. Gal Gadot's entry as Diana Prince and Wonder Woman is nothing more spectacular than how the trailers made her appear, in fact, her underwritten character may have made her role shrunk to the miniature levels of her fellow Justice League members, whose cameo introductions you might have missed if you happened to go to the restroom for at least two minutes. Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor is epic in both good and bad way, but more of the latter I guess. Amy Adams' Lois Lane— forget her, she's just there to prove she really loves Clark.The movie bleeds from these flaws, the same way the Caped Crusader becomes kryptonite to Superman, and the Man of Steel becomes Batman's very Bane. The very same struggle inflicts the audience who thirst for some sensible story lines and not just shreds of unresolved, horribly- knitted sidestories. We might as well be grateful we're not Kryptonians.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Don't get your expectations too high,"This is the kind of movie I like. A lot of action, very good acting and a (somewhat) deeper meaning in the story. Henry Cavill is okay as usual, but Ben Affleck took me by surprise. He was amazing in his role as Batman. The highlight for me was however Gal Gadot's fleeting performance of Wonder Woman and Jeremy Irons' Alfred, who gave the film some much needed humour.Now story-wise this movie is a mess, I'll admit. The script is a bit sloppy and the pacing was off. They were trying to cram too many things into this movie. In some of them, they succeeded, but in others they didn't. Don't believe the critics, however, because this movie certainly isn't a bad one. It's just a beautiful, aesthetically pleasing mess.

Predictable Yet so Entertaining,"I went on to watch with few doubts in mind especially about Ben Affleck playing the Batman. But at the end he has become my most favorite Batman ever (even though I am die hard fan of Christian Bale). Ben Affleck has completely nailed his role. The second thing which I like the most was terrific action sequences between Batman and Superman. It was undoubtedly the most difficult aspect to show on big screen but the action between both super heroes looked so real (by the way it could have been avoided). But for me editing was a problem as at some times the film seems to be going nowhere. When you are watching Batman V Superman, you already knew that its going to be Batman's film which is quite unfair actually.Overall it is pretty good watch.

Not a bad movie at all (haters gonna hate),"This is my first review and i made an account just to tell you that this isn't a bad movie.i understand that people have various reasons to hate.some reasons are legit others are just haters.many people complain they expected something totally out of the box and they were disappointed.so movie turned out to be different for them.Does this justify the reason for 1 star ? Seriously. I am not a great fan of superhero movies.in my opinion they are just money bragging, light films with same formula(Marvel).when i first saw the dark knight trilogy , i was completely blown away.it was a great movie.why ? Because it wasn't just another comic book adaptation. It had everything required for movie. Then there are marvel movies.most of them are good for what they are made for.just entertainment.but that doesn't make them great movies.but still everybody love them. On the other hand dc tries to implement dark themes.half the people don't like dc movies for this reason.the other half want perfection.BvS isn't a perfect movie.there are a lot of flaws.the first hour is boring,no doubt.though it was important for character development.the first hour of the movie could have been made a lot better.as soon as you enter the second hour,i don't see the reason for any dislike.the action scenes aren't lame.they are interesting.the music accompanying the action is quite good too.i was bored in the first hour , but after that the movie held me back at my seat.the script is poor at a lot of places.confrontation of batman and superman , the ending of their fight scene.and at a lot of other places the script was poorly written.the same with other average superhero movies, but people somehow want to like them ,no matter how lame the script is.BvS make up for all those poorly scripted scenes through the action,direction ,cinematography .the story isn't that bad either , acting is good(overacted at a lot of places, but maybe that's just the characters).but i definitely don't understand how is this a poor boring Sleep medicine.its better than half the marvel movies. People go crazy for mediocre, poorly scripted marvel movies(good movies aside).all of the marvel movies have good ratings,i don't know why.people will find every reason to like marvel and every reason to tear apart BvS.

"epic, not perfect","OK, i have to start with a confession, i wasn't completely excited for the movie. i actually thought it will suck and it will be the grate downfall of the attempt of kick-start the DC cinematic universe.let's begin saying this. the movie is not perfect, there to many plot lines, to many references that don't have to be there or have no purpose in the movie, some of the CGI is bad, half of the movie makes no sense and the pacing is wear (if that bothers you, of course).however, i can't say that the movie did'nt entertain, or never got me invested in what was happening. the performances where grate, Ben Affleck earn that batman logo, but also the Bruce Wayne name, Henry Cavil has good as superman (all do, is not the superman that we all know from the 1978 film, wicth is fine by me) and i have to say, i really like the Jesse eisenberg's lex luthor Jr., he is not the lex luthor that every comic book fan want, wicth is fine by me. i found sole little surprises in the film, wicth is more than fair to say since the third trailer basically spoiled doomsday. if we had complains for the action in Man of Steel, in this movie the action is much better film and overall, with good choreography. the plot is dumb, do. this something that i don't want to hold against the movie since most superhero movies's plots are dumb. the dark tone works for me, but if you want a happy superman, don't bother to watch the film. the special effects are good, the music is grate (as you expect from Hans zimmer) and the run time is fine. the movie is also very gorgeous (zach Snyder's fetish) and it was a blast to watch.the movie is not like the marvel studios's movies. is not happy, is taking it self way too serious. is definitely an improvement over man of steel, but if you have a lot expectations, you will leave the theater disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Reflects corporate need,"This was probably never going to be a very good idea to begin with. Having a vs film with these two be a watchable version of itself must be a nightmare of logistics of story and world. By now you know they failed, bitterly so.You probably knew the moment they announced Affleck. It was the strangest piece of news, the kind I would expect to read in an Onion parody. I remember wincing at the time. Someone like Depp who has actual acting chops wouldn't do either so it's not acting ability. It's because actors are embedded into contexts of how we've known them, how they've been defined by prior work. Sometimes that's why you cast them, hoping to mine that context.So when he's your choice and no one in the room bats an eye, it's the kind of creative choice that to me presages a certain way of doing things in that room. It told me that executives in charge thought any known face would do or he was the best they could land on short notice. It told me they had no idea what they had in Nolan's Batman. They weren't going to extend that world or work with Nolan's blueprint of prolonged anticipation. It promised a Joel Schumacher style debacle.It's really as bad as this. You're going to read more acerbic barbs in other comments. I'll just rest with the observation that it has all the marks of a film where company employees sat through meetings trying to come up with a film for no other reason than the company decided it must have this particular product to sell. No one is particularly in charge of overall vision or has some particular creative interest in bringing it to life. Everyone is an employee who simply has to deliver by Friday on the company memos of Monday. Affleck will do. All they probably had in front of them was a timetable of when they had to launch.What actually happened is their arch rivals beat them to something that proved lucrative, opening up market possibility they were late in noting, so they're now rushing a product to market to avoid falling behind. It's as simple as this and the sole reason this whole filmic world exists. It's the cinematic equivalent of Microsoft realizing they've been squeezed out of the new ecosystem of mobile connectivity and trying to quickly patch their own together, throwing around mountains of money to make up for lost time.They tried to squeeze a bunch of things in here at the same time as patching together the platform; reintroducing Batman and his world, the story arch the title promises, an Avengers of sorts with joined heroes trying to avert doom while also setting up an Avengers proper for down the road. They bungled it up so bad that Wonder Woman was squeezed in here as introduction while her own film proper was a year away. But that's how rushed they must have been.I even hunted down for the longer version. No dice. I do happen to think of Snyder as a dull mind; Michael Bay with simply different lists of movie and music favorites. But I don't think him to be this incompetent. This is the work of management.You'll see the circumstances of its making in the fabric of the film itself. It feels as if different segments have been carted into place upon completion while other departments are still working on theirs; the assumption being that when everyone's finished, the result will be a film.Everything we come across has potential to enlighten. Watch this to see the result of trying to substitute creative concentration with committee work, how something looks when born out of need rather than immersion. They should have had the patience to sit this round out. Me-too-ism is the path to gaffe.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I cannot stand fights where the two who are fighting never actually make physical contact with one another.That's it.

"""Perry when you assign a story you are making a choice about what  is important.""","Reviewers Notes, humbly submitted:1. Synder's work in Watchmen will always rank him as one of the greats.

Casting the Ben is like spinning a red cape in front of a bull. We all know Ben's brother can act. But Ben himself has the chin but not the chops.4. The core idea behind going all dark and dreary is to appeal the adult audience. The flaw in the logic is that the implication is that adults have hitherto been avoiding superhero movies...? But that is not true. Is it? Think about it.5. The first 20 minutes of any film is called the ""Hook."" Synder knows this because he is a film God and he did Watchmen. But the Hook here is all over the map. It fails to grab. Not a great start.6. A ""black"" Perry White is politically correct. And it is important to be politically correct in a movie offering a more ""realistic"" portrait of superheroes. Or is that an oxymoron? I get confused.7. Once America had ideals. Superman and Batman were part of that. Now we have TV shows that feature greed, schools that teach it, bankers who flaunt it, politicians who emulate it. On TV, we have a dozen variations of zombie narratives. Is there a connection?8. ""Perry when you assign a story you are making choice about what is important."" (dialog) Good point. When you engage top talent to do major film you are making a similar choice. This may not have a completely wrong choice, but it was not the right choice either.9. ""Don't worry. I am a friend of your son's."" ""I figured. The cape."" (dialog). Well, now the GOOD news, if you are prepared to slog through an astonishing hour and a half of pure cinematic muddle, the payoff is kinda fun. And, ironically, for a film that is supposed to be the penultimate ""anti-superhero"" film, it reminds us, briefly, of a time when superhero movies were just plain fun.10.

This movie and Man of Steel make me a Superman Fan,"I never watch a superman movie movie because I always thought superman was boring,almost no one can kill him in the end he will always win, saving cats from a tree and smile to the camera , his charactor is like a buddha you can do whatever you want to him and he'll be standing there smilling like nothing happen all the time.You Can't Act Like A God,Buddha or Jesus from start to finish Just Because You Have Superpower. Nobody Want 15 superman movies where superman always acting like Buddha And Jesus. That will make him robotic. That will make him flawless. That will make him boring.But this movie change my mind ,This superman have charactor development,This superman is just like ""some of us"" ,he have flaw,he got emotion like a real person. I mean he was raised just like us.He will get angry sometime like a real teenager. He might do something bad when he got angry and that's Ok because that's what a real person do ,that's make him relatable. But in the end he will
always learn ,he will always come back,he will always give us HOPE,he will always be SUPERMAN.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I thought I was going to have a heart attack watching this!,"My Batman v Superman review So it has been an hour since I watched BvS and these are my reactions to it: BIG, BOLD ACTION AND SURREAL! I have been watching so long to watch this movie and I had heard some really harsh (at times stupid) critic reviews about it but that didn't affect my excitement at all. I won't talk about everything because there is so much and my head is still spinning - I loved the interactions between Bruce Wayne and Alfred! I really enjoy this new take on the characters and how they work together - Ben Affleck was brilliant as Batman/Bruce Wayne! I had no doubt going into the film and his fight sequence were BRUTALLY OUTSTANDING! - Gal Gadot .. YAASS MY AMAZON! First of all I had a mini heart attack every time she appeared on screen because she carried herself with such grace, class and fierceness. Her fight with Doomsday was good even though I wanted to see a bit more combat from her I really enjoyed it. (By the way her soundtrack was EVERYTHING!) -Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luther all I can say is YES YES YES! From the trailers I knew we weren't going to get the same traditional Lex but they way Jesse played him in such a scary, evil, obsessive and power hungry way I was so surprised at how much I enjoyed his performance - I thought the film started a but slow but it then started to pick up, like the first act I really wasn't into it. - At times I thought the storyline was a a bit all over the place, a bit messed up but it slowly started to get back on the right track - Also the amount of destruction Doomsday caused was a bit over the top for me but took away nothing from the film - Finally the cameos .. HOLY SMOKES I HAD TEARS OF JOY RUNNING DOWN MY FACE! So overall I give the film a 7-8/10! Of course I'm going to watch the film again and what I took away from the movie is that I'm looking forward to this big DC Universe.. Just brilliant!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"The movie has the elements to be great but somehow muddles it up in it 2.5 hour runtime as it tries to be too many things at once.The movie also suffers from trying to set up the DC universe all in one movie. It forgets to focus on making us care about this movie and the characters in it which in turn may not leave you begging or caring for a Justice League movie or it could leave you feeling like maybe DC should not even try with a Justice League movie,yet.Ben Affleck is good as Batman but some new pieces added to the Batman character may leave comic book fans who love the ideology of what Batman stood for feeling a little ripped off",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Put aside pride and watch the extended version,"Listen I'm with most of you. I was a huge DC fan and was beyond excited to see this movie in the theaters. But upon seeing the theatrical version I was disappointed. It had the looks of a great superhero movie but real substance was nowhere to be found. There wasn't enough back story for casual fans to understand what was going on, so not a lot of people could really enjoy it. But luckily they released the extended version. While it makes the movie longer, it explains so much and helps keep fans who aren't that familiar with the DC universe keep up with the flow of the movie. With the release of the extended version hopefully people will give the movie another shot.

Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this (Like the rest of the world) but I did have reservations. And I was right. Too much clutter. You could have had a straightforward, 2 hour film with Superman and Batman at loggerheads, leading up to an epic smackdown. However the film repeats the mistakes of Avengers: Age of Ultron by unnecessarily crow barring in characters to set up the future Justice League movie. they could have taken a page from the MCU and done the slow build up, with a solo Batman movie, with a cameo from Superman, that lead up to this movie. The final battle was impressive, but due to the spoiler trailer, I knew exactly what was going to happen, so there was no surprises. And the bombastic action that Snyder puts in all his movies is here too, and it does get old fast.The haters can shut up about Ben Affleck though, he nailed it as Batman and Bruce Wayne, and that's a rare thing. previous actors to don the cowl have always mastered one role but fallen flat with the other (I'm looking at you, Val Kilmer). It wasn't nearly as good as The Avengers or Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, but I have to admit the action was good. Just a shame it couldn't have had a more streamlined story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Detective Comics, unfortunately not","I wanted to like this movie. Apparently some people did because the first ten user reviews I saw all seemed to be super positive. I love that if you found fault in this joyless slog you are by definition apparently an MCU fanboy. Yet to believe this is the greatest superhero movie ever you have to be a DC or Snyder fan sticking your fingers in your ears. I enjoyed Affleck doing the best he could with a subpar script, I hope he gets to direct a solo bat outing asap. I don't know how people could so soon forget the sheer brilliance of the dark knight, heath ledgers joker was a revelation in an outstanding film. Batman v Superman is just so unfocused, and why implement Ezra Miller, when Grant Gustin has been killing it as the flash. Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns is amazing and Alan Moores for the man who has everything are amazing stories that if rendered properly could be the foundation for amazing cinematic stories one day but this is not on par with those. I get that people get defensive when they perceive that something they love is somehow under siege. I love Batman the character but not what Snyder has done with him in this flick, which is Bury him in this mess and it's worse here than even Batman and Robin because Affleck has the acting chops and gravitas to pull it off but isn't given the material to work with. I was nervous when the bat lifting bruce up Jesus imagery kicked things off and Snyder is not a well rounded enough filmmaker to utilize him. I wanted so badly for this to be the revelation the dark knight was, to leave the theater with a spring in my step, maybe someone will do a live action batman year one or just something to represent the cowl, but for now I'm going to binge the Nolan flicks and hope for something better.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much better than the Theatrical. Still not good.,"While the theatrical version of BvS was an incoherent mess, the ultimate cut more or less restores much narrative coherence, has better pacing and makes for a more satisfying movie experience.Zack Snyder is an interesting director in that he has a stellar talent for action scenes and visuals (nowhere more obvious than in his masterpiece 300), who embraces pathos and tries to add deeper themes to his work, but who's reach ultimately exceeds his grasp. Unlike the corporate slop served at Marvel or some of the other DCEU movies, Synder tries to make ateur cinema, even if he usually falls short (300 and Watchmen aside) of his ambitions, usually tripping over his need to be an edgelord. That makes his movies equally interesting and frustrating to watch.BvS is a failure, but a big, bold and crazy failure. For all its narrative shortcomings, it has some great acting, the best action scenes to date in any Batman movie, and the fight between Batman and Superman is both hilarious and insane. It's straight out of a comic book, and the ending to the fight has become a meme for how silly it is.Snyder never once winks at the audience, he goes all in on every idea, not matter how dumb it is. When comparing it to safer, more corporate comic book films, I draw a parrallel to car racing. Would I rather watch a race where everyone drives safely and respectully, or would I rather watch a race where they ram each other off the road and go full speed even when it's not always safe?BvS is the latter. There's lots of crashes and fails, but it's undeniably entertaining and there are moments of greatness hidden within the mayhem.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Disappointing Film....,"I saw the 1st showing last night and was immediately amazed by how choppy the film is. The first third of the film has the worst continuity I have ever seen. While the effects were good, the basic story is what really let me down... Everyone did a good job of carrying their characters, but they didn't have a whole lot to carry! It felt like they were trying to make an epic movie, without making any attempt to make the movie epic! They threw in everything they could and in the process, robbed the fans of a good film. Wonder Woman serves no purpose in the entire film other than to link her to her own upcoming movie. The liberties the filmmakers took with the two main characters behaviors and attitudes is in direct conflict to what they have always stood for. All in all, it was a rushed product whose only real purpose is to expand a universe they haven't created yet!!!",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It Stunk!!,"My relationship with the Batman/Superman source material and all media  associated with it has outlasted most of my relationships. So when I  sat down to watch this. I kept a open mind, despite the early reviews.  Sad to say, this movie was a big disappointment. No substance in the  character development. The Lex Luthor/Jesse Eisenberg had to be the  worst acting job I've sent in any comic book related movie ever. Every  time he was on screen was like someone throwing junk into my face. The  rest of the cast look bored except for Gal Gadot. Also, I really don't  understand why Snyder decided that the heroes could kill the bad guys  in this version. The entire point of Superman and Batman that they were  held at a higher standard than others because they didn't kill the  villains.

How to drop the ball,"On paper Batman vs Superman is one of the biggest movies of all time. The two biggest names in comics going face to face and with Wonder Woman in tow. So how did it all go so wrong? Why is it universally panned by and yet (At present time) it's IMDb rating so contradictingly high? Truth be told BVS isn't a bad film in my view, it just isn't a good one either.Where to begin? Jesse Eisenberg's performance was great but in no way did he appear to be playing Lex Luthor in anyway shape or form.Gal Gadot exceeded my expectations and played her role well.Affleck is shaping up to be a decent batman.Henry Cavill is terrible.........seriously, he's proving once again that he's the mainstream Segal. Wooden, tired & undeserving of such roles. To add to that Amy Adams fails spectacularly as Lane.Without spoilers the other ""Big Bad"" is poorly represented, if they aren't willing to do it correctly why bring these characters into the film? Why not just make a new one. Smallville did a better job! The story is solid, it's the execution that lets it down.The movie has several completely baffling and unneeded sequences and it's pacing felt sporadic.Further casting problems include Fishburne as Perry because of the ethnicity change (What is it with Superhero movies & their insistence on doing that) You're telling me if Black Panther took his mask off in Civil War & he was played by Brad Pitt people wouldn't rage? Next year Dev Patel as Superman & Justin Chong as Batman.......Also Jeffrey Dean Morgan & Lauren Cohan thoroughly wasted in their 10 seconds no lines cameo appearances.My biggest problem with the film is this, just how unremarkable the film was considering the subject matter. This needed to be a supernova of a film, whereas it turned into a lit fart.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
People fear what they don't understand,"I consider Sucker Punch to be Snyder's only middling film, view the director´s cut of Watchmen as one of the best adaptations of all time and adore the source material, so this film is tailor made for me. Especially due to my love for the utterly daring Man of Steel. I understand where some (but not all!) of the mixed reviews are coming from but share few of their opinions.First with the bad: The juicy Justice League teaser needed to be placed differently. I also expected a longer final battle and a stronger acknowledgement of how much carnage the 2 cities undergo at the end. There is also 1 scene of Superman in peril too many towards the end. None of these complains took away from my enjoyment and i was BLOWN AWAY by everything else. The film features top of the line directing and the best score Hans Zimmer/Junkie XL ever composed. The well-constructed script by Chris Terrio explained the clashing ideologies very well and is downright Nolan-esque, due to the continued involvement of David Goyer who is the secondary writer of the final film. Every single performance is some of the finest acting the A-level cast put on film. Especially Jesse Eisenberg! His psychotic and utterly unhinged Lex Luthor outshines even Heath Ledger. Gal Gadot is another standout and shows how well cast and though out the whole DCU truly is.Now to the titular heroes: Ben Affleck matches Christian Bale and Kevin Konroy as being a definitive take on the character but don't expect him to be ""likable"". His version is a Frank Miller Batman gone too far and the film is a clear redemption arc for the bitter warrior. Some will be turned off by his high body count and his deeply flawed tunnel vision but that is the whole point of the film and especially the ending. Batman is the tragic villain of the film. Henry Cavill's Superman is again on point and presents a tragic take on John Byrne's and more importantly Dan Jurgens' iconic version. I now repeatedly mentioned the source material but this film is an adaptation first and foremost, unlike the MCU competition. I am also a fan of their highly different films and they constantly veer off the source. Not here. Basically every scene has a counterpart in a comic or even videogame. The mentioned creators (and many more) are proudly listed in the credits and produced some of the most iconic and bestselling comics of all time. I highly suggest looking them up after digesting this monumental epos and the film adapted way more of The Dark Knight Returns than i ever expected. This brings me to the film's one glaring and fascinating ""problem"". The films should be near incomprehensible to non-comic readers and may be the first 200+ million film that goes out its way to target an adult and comic literate audience! Young children, family audiences and casual fans are destined to be baffled by this film and i am not even sure if i can call it a ""mainstream"" movie. The pacing is more comparable to a cerebral thriller and the whole product is a blatant deconstruction of messianic ideals, which will offend many on principle alone. A true Twilight of the Superheroes. The best cinematic comparison i can make is the equally busy Excalibur 1981. I further believe that all of Zack Snyder's superhero adaptations got unfair scrutiny because they dared to go beyond preconceived notions of what a big budget comic adaptation should be and hope that future generations will reassess them and join me in the sun.I can only conclude that i view the film as a complete and utter creative successes. I also hope that this daring film will lead to more creativity and equal risks down the line, from all competitors on the market. The DCU weight on the right shoulders and its future is now in the hands of the fans, as never before. The film often asks if there must be a Superman. I say yes but we also need Zack Synder.PS: The shorter and WB mandated theatrical cut is a 8/10 and make sure to watch the ""Remastered"" version of Snyder´s intended vision as it has the correct color grading and the 4:3 aspect ratio during the 4 prolonged Imax sequences.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It seems that Nolan got surprised by a new idea and made up the story over a night with no editing! Batman is used to be known as a fair and rational person.

While Clark saying that name caught him off guard, once Lois explained it's his mother's name, Bruce realized in that moment that Superman was as human as anyone else. Remember, right before""Martha"", Batman said he probably isn't even human. But by having a mother, Bruce realized Clark was as human as anyone else, since all humans have a mother.

Lots of Hype But Still Good,"It's easy to gloss over the awesome special effects in this film, and they're worth enjoying for themselves. But...every film needs a strong plot and human involvement and BvS suffers a little in that respect. For that reason, I'd rate it lower than the first Superman which to me was surprisingly strong in the arc and reach of its story.I suspect it's down to having too much money available: ""we've got a franchise now, throw all the CGI you can think of at 'em"".Ben Afflect would not have been my first or fifth choice as Batman but he is surprisingly good. I like Henry Clavill but his character's personality change since MoS is not really explained nor developed here. Neither is Batman's hatred of him. And what was all that early stuff about Batman being a baddie?, it led nowhere.The new Wonder Woman is great and I was fine with Lex Luther (unlike some).

Every part of me wanted to like this movie, but BvS managed to take everything with it, sparing no survivors. This film was ruled by money, and its pure purpose was profit. All the dignity of making a respectable film had been stripped away before it began.

The music added gravitas to the epic showdowns, and the casting, particularly Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, was a highlight. Cinematography brought a dark and gritty visual style to the superhero narrative. Zack Snyder's directing had a grand scope, but the writing struggled to balance its multiple plotlines, and the pacing could be uneven.

Affleck is excellent as Batman But Everything Else Is Very Messy.,"In Retrospect, Now i see how bad this mess is. Yeah there's some awesome scenes & great ideas, but the huge weight of it all became a big CGI dramatic mess.David Ayer's Suicide Squad is still my favourite DC movie, even with it's faults.Ben Affleck's performance as Batman is great but he cannot save this over-stuffed mess, saying that i believe he saved the whole film with his excellent performance as both Bruce Wayne & Batman. The guy so needs his own full-on Batman movie.Zack Snyder isn't a great Director, he can be decent like with his best movie: Dawn of the Dead, but mostly his films are big CGI messes that feel soulless.The Lex Luther character was absolutely HORRENDOUS here with an annoying performance that ruins the movie, one of the worst performances in Cinema history.Henry Caville as Superman is a dreary & drippy presence that is depressing to watch here, but i do understand he was meant to be struggling with everything.His mum ""Martha"" is also such grim & depressing character.Lois Lane i didn't like either, too cocky.Batman & Wonder Woman are the best bits of this gloomy & stuffy drama.The end is just a huge over stuffed CGI MESS.I liked the Nightmare scene best & that was over in a minute, also when Batman is introduced was awesome & the fight he has near the end with all those henchmen, it was Ben Affleck that saved the movie with his powerhouse performance as the Dark Knight.I was kind to this movie at first but after trying to watch it again i see how really bad & depressing this mess is, I'm all for a tougher take on Superhero material but this film often felt sunken by all its dramatic weight. Too many damaged characters storylines, too much time spent with the atrociously terrible Lex Luther performance & many drawn-out boring scenes.

It doesn't get better than this!,"A movie with the impossible task of following up to Man of Steel, introducing this version of Batman, and setting up the Justice League, while achieving that and so much more with great success.Snyder doesn't hold back with his unique visual flair, and neither does this version of Batman.Set in the backdrop of a world much like our own (skeptical, cynical, and nihilistic), Clark Kent has to come to terms with a world that ultimately rejects Superman out of fear, with Batman (and Lex Luthor) personifying that fear and hatred.Can there be a Superman in our modern day?

Good movie with big flaws,"I went into this movie thinking it was going to be very good. I have watched a few of Zack Snyders movies before like ""Watchmen"". I was really excited to see what he was going to do cinematography wise and see how dark he would go.The movie starts out with action right of the bat (no pun intended). There was a lot of back story going into the film and you really have to be watching the screen at all times or else you might miss something. Some flaws that I had with the movie was that it had so many story lines and back stories for people watching it to handle. I can't even count how many different story lines there were. If I were to guess, maybe 7. That is fine when you have a 3 hour movie, but it ruins the flow of the movie. I think it even forgot to finish some of the plot points. The movie jumped quickly between parts and it did have a consistent flow. For example, the spray paint on that Robin statue wasn't explained. It literally just showed it once in the trailer then left it at that the entire movie. There were just so many story changes. Another flaw I had with the movie was that it was really messy. The editing in the movie was done poorly and it was very mediocre. That was my big problem with the movie.What really blew me away was the acting. The acting was phenomenal! Jesse Eisenberg was just perfect. I thought he just took that role to a new universe. His witty insane acting that I saw in the Social Network but to a different level. He was probably my favorite character in the entire film. Personally, I thought he was too good for the role. Another actor who I thought did amazing was Ben Affleck. This was far better than Daredevil in ways I can't even describe. You will not walk out of the movie theater without saying how great of a job he did. He took the batman character and made him so much darker, which I didn't event think was possible. At first I had no idea what to expect, but he killed it. I hope to see him in his own movie, real soon.Overall, I would recommend seeing it. Is it worth all the hype? Not really. They definitely could have made it so much better. Maybe they could have waited a bit longer to make the editing and flow of the movie better. David Brenner ruined this movie with his poor editing skills. He has done some amazing work but has been very mediocre and lazy lately. His recent movies reflect how he did in this movie and I hope he is not part of any big movies, like this, in the future. And even though Zack Snyder did a great job but I believe the actors are the best part of this movie. They are fun to watch and worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A well-executed dark superhero movie,"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film.3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection.4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg.B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"This movie was badly edited, written & destroyed an iconic story & villain",This movie had all the hallmarks of being a long endurance classic but turned an iconic villain into a joker Zuckerburg. The best parts of the movie were in the trailer & the mishmash of editing left you feeling like there was no continuity to the movie & I really don't care about seeing a Justice League made up of these characters. I really enjoyed Man of Steel & the Dark Knight series but this movie sucked. I can't blame it on Afflack because he wasn't what brought this movie down. It was the story & editing that did that. I wouldn't waste my money for this movie on DVD let alone flop down the cash to see it in 3D. I hope for more from Suicide Squad because the previews look just as good or better than BvS & I know it can't get worse than BvS.

Cavill could've gotten more screen time.This is more akin to The Dark Knight than Avengers. Altough it could've been balanced like Captain America Civil War it feels like Zack made an amazing movie first and foremost and THEN but Batman and Superman in it.

Only watch the Ultimate Edition,"*Watched the Ultimate Edition*Theatrical Cut Rating = 2.5/5It's been said a million times before: The script is the most important part of a blockbuster film. It's what separates ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"". It's what makes me absolutely hate all the ""Transformers"" movies with extreme passion.The Ultimate Edition of ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" doesn't wholeheartedly right the wrongs of the theatrical cut, but it does make this a much more enjoyable and cohesive experience. The added material makes this so much better that it's actually insulting it was removed from the theatrical cut.Now, that's not to say this the Ultimate Cut is great, because this movie still has major problems all the way down to the roots. Doomsday is still a terrible CGI mess, Batman still casually murders dozens of people, and this version of Lex Luthor is still not something I'm comfortable with. Eisenberg's performance is growing on me incrementally, as his grand plan is much more fleshed out in the Ultimate Cut. It's still a dumb and convoluted plan.The score absolutely rocks, the dark lighting perfectly sets the mood, Affleck is the best Batman (yeah, I said it, you want to fight me about it?), and Cavill is great as Superman.While I don't believe it totally succeeds, I'm glad Zack Snyder decided to take the DCEU down a darker path instead of slavishly imitating the MCU like the executives wanted to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An expensive-looking super hero movie that entertains,"The visual-effects-heavy Zack Snyder film featuring arguably the two biggest superheroes in comic book history, is one where we find the two protagonists facing off with each other, lending the motion picture its quirky title. The prospect of seeing a square-off between two giants of DC comics-lineage served for many probably as an incentive alone to watch the film on the big screen. And as someone not particularly fond of the purveyor of arts in question (Snyder), I was pleased to see that the experience was worth the while. From the enormous $250 000 000 budget we get a glossy, stylized and action-packed blockbuster, a welcome collaboration between Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL (who made the musical score for ""Mad Max: Fury Road""), and a satisfying Batman-rendering by a capable Ben Affleck, among other things.The film does have appeal. For the most part it looks really good, in the way that is characteristic of Snyder's previous films, and chroma keying (green screen) is hence an important technique in achieving this. The new batman heavy-armour suit looks very cool also and works well within the fight scenes it is incorporated. The fight choreography was gritty and involved hand-to-hand combat that looked fairly realistic. Additionally, the impending confrontation between the two leads was solved in a nice way, without giving away any leads.So the action is good, it entertains, but better writing wouldn't go amiss. The script by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer is overdramatic and self-important, and narratively speaking it relies more on showmanship rather than craftsmanship. Comparing Batman v Superman to any of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight instalments, although perhaps an unfair comparison, reveals a motion picture of lesser complexity and gratifying scope. It does enough however to sustain interest over 2 hours and 31 minutes and should be complemented for doing so.The acting by Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck in particular, stood out to me as memorable performances. Gal Gadot playing the character Diana Prince who moonlights as Wonder Woman, also gave a performance that I think will help female superheroines appear more frequently in films in the future. A role that I feel people are very divided in their opinion of however, is Jesse Eisenberg as villain Lex Luthor. Some think he was great; others think not so much. I definitely belong to the latter category and whilst I acknowledge Mr. Eisenberg is capable of incredible feats of acting, I thought he gave an overacted, terribly silly performance that annoyed me beyond belief. His way over-the-top approach to the role was not at all necessary and took away a lot of the joy from the watching experience. Sometimes less truly is more!It should be said that an intriguing component of ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is that it introduces DC characters that will have new films of their own, as well as platforms for all these to assemble in the coming Justice league films, where Zack Snyder is set to direct. This is ""alluded"" to in the film, somewhat blatantly, and builds up expectation around the projects in question. Hopefully these films will fare well, as this one more or less managed to do.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Not great, not bad...Simply O.K.","This was the movie that everyone has been waiting for. So it's completely natural to have extremely high expectations for this movie. Given that it's the 2 most iconic superheroes colliding in one huge blockbuster movie. Especially after ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" , people were very anxious to see Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman. Unfortunately, this movie certainly does not deliver. It had all the elements of becoming such a great movie, but ended up being extremely sloppy and poorly edited. Of course, there are some positive about the movie, but they do not outweigh the negatives. Here are the DetailsLet's begin with what's good about this movie. Ben Afflecks portrayal as Batman was incredible. This version of batman is a much more dark, menacing, and merciless Batman than that of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. He absolutely proved doubters wrong (myself included). Definitely looking forward to the upcoming movie ""The Batman"", which will be directed by Ben Affleck as well. The action sequences in the movie were really well choreographed, with stunning CGI. Will keep you on the edge of your seat and remind you a lot of the action sequences in 300 and Watchmen.The BAD... Let me start of by saying that the 3 trailers for this movie are too revealing, taking away some of the element of surprise and some key moments in the movie. So if you haven't watched any of them, then you just might like the movie a lot more. The way the story jumps from one scene to the next is unbelievably sloppy. A moment keeps building up and just when you think that a climatic moment is about to occur, it doesn't. Instead, it takes you to a completely unrelated and slow scene which kills the momentum. You almost feel like it's a mash-up of 2 different directors in 1 movie. One of the most disappointing things about this movie is that it doesn't focus on the main plot of the story, which is why Batman and Superman are fighting. Instead, they keep focusing on characters which really do not have any real impact on the audience. The audience wants the main focus to be on JUST these 2 iconic characters, but they fail to do so, leaving the audience with a very poor story. The audience is supposed to have a hard time deciding which superhero is right and wrong. Instead, you actually reach a point where you don't even care which superhero wins the conflict due to the very poor buildup. Another disappointing point is that this movie is DEFINITELY not for everyone (especially children), unlike ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"", which is definitely a movie that both comic fans and non- coming fans (and children). I would say that the only people who would love this movie are the hardcore comic fans.Overall, I definitely feel like this movie has NOT lived up to its hype and expectation. The movie has its good moments, but mostly bad. I definitely feel like Zack Snyder will not be too happy about the way he made this movie. It's a shame, because this should have been a 9/10, but to me it barely qualifies as a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Truly Awful,"Plot was incoherent, difficult to follow, nonsensical, and boring. Neither Batman nor Superman had any redeeming personal qualities. You really couldn't like either character. Lex Luther was just too annoying to be evil. Gene Hackman he wasn't! When the movie finally reached the final scenes, you thought hopefully that each one would be the final scene, but the ending kept dragging on, and on, and on, and on as if it would never end. When the movie was over, none of us could figure out why Batman and Superman had animosity towards each other. We were all left guessing at to why they opposed each other, with the only conclusion being that the plot just called for it to be so.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The critics were right,"The critics were right. As a matter of fact, they were too nice and probably did not go far enough. This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie has no soul, no real depth of story, and an entirely weak premise.Executives who gave a pass on this should be fired. They are all great ""yes men"" who after spending a fortune to produce a steaming pile of garbage realized they had to release it anyway because there is a built in box office for tons of sycophantic fans who will shell out good money for any super hero movie. I would rather watch Plan Nine From Outer Space ten times in a row before ever having to watch this fiasco one more time.The real indicator is how often I have to check the time during a movie. During a good movie, I never check the time because I am engrossed in the movie and don't even think about the time. In a bad movie, I keep checking the time to see how much longer I am going to have to sit through the nonsense. Well, I was continually checking the time and this movie had plenty of nonsense and absolutely no charm. I relish the versions that hold to the charm of the original comics, like that no one, including Lois, being able to discern that Clark is Superman when the only differences are the glasses and the suit.The best thing about this movie is Wonder Woman who should have beat the rear ends of these two whiny and ornery little boys and sent them to their rooms without supper.Save your money. Stay away. The studios will continue to crank out garbage as long as you will pay for it. There should be a movement, a class action suit, or something for people to get their money back after having to pay for something that clearly wasn't worth it. Virtually no value for your money.

"Zack Snyder, Really?","Two Of The BIGGEST Superheroes Batman & Superman - come together in a magnum-opus, that is anything but entertaining. My only question to Zack Snyder, how in the world did you get this wrong? Synder's previous Superman adventure was good fun, but he ruins this once-in-a-lifetime cinematic moment, by delivering a film that fails on almost every level. Lacking soul & rush, This Biggie is one disappointment!'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' Synopsis: Fearing the actions of Superman are left unchecked, Batman takes on the man of steel, while the world wrestles with what kind of a hero it really needs. With Batman and Superman fighting each other, a new threat, Doomsday, is created by Lex Luthor. It's up to Superman and Batman to set aside their differences along with Wonder Woman to stop Lex Luthor and Doomsday from destroying Metropolis.The biggest problem with 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' is its weak Screenplay. Chris Terrio & David S. Goyer's Writing just doesn't excite or entice. I mean, come on! You've got the caped crusader & the man of steel battling it out & you're in 2016, graphics aren't new anymore nor can action-sequences hold beyond a point. You have to pen an engaging story. In those never-ending 160-minutes, this crowded superhero flick, barely offers anything remarkable. While the first-hour tries to develop an enmity between its heroes, while introduction some important supporting characters, the second-hour sees them fighting it out in a listless 5-minute battle, with an overblown culmination. I didn't bother for Clark Kent, but Bruce Wayne seemed a bit more darker. The Writing is definitely the biggest flaw here!And now coming to Synder. Were you even a fan of the idea of the heroes colliding? Visually, Synder has nailed each & every frame. But, he fails to give any soul to the narrative. The film goes on for long, but there is nothing spectacular even for once on display in terms of drama. This is Synder's least appealing hour.Cinematography, Editing & Graphics are amazing, no doubt. 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' is technically marvelous. Music by Hans Zimmer & Junkie XL, is absolutely brilliant.Now Coming To The Performances! Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne / Batman, has done quite well. Of course we shouldn't compare him to any of the previous Batman's, as every actor brings a newer edge & looking at Affleck's interpretation alone, he's convincing as the haunted Bruce Wayne & absolutely Tough as the legendary superhero. Henry Cavill as Clark Kent / Superman, is blank. Gal Gadot as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman, is hot & a delight in her brief bit. Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, is an eyesore. Seriously, Mr.Eisenberg? Of the supporting cast, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth, Holly Hunter as Finch, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White & Diane Lane as Martha Kent, lend adequate support.On the whole, 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' is a huge disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

However I must credit the acting as it is just fantastic, each character plays their role perfectly and they managed to keep it tied in for the next movie being justice league which will have other DC superhero's. This is better than man of steel, but do not expect it to be better than the dark knight trilogy because it is not. DC have not yet mastered how to make a good movie and they have nothing on marvel, so for marvel fans out there, don not bother with this movie if you want a nicely pieced together story.

Excellent Superhero Movie who can understand it.,"In my opinion it is an excellent superhero movie. Me and my friends really liked this movie. Many people like it movie too, many did not. I don't know why. But I think Most of the time people like to watch movies about something different, something unlike any other movie. That's why movie directors try to make a movie about something different. Zack Snyder tried it too in Batman v Superman. And He did it quite good I think. Do we have any idea how much money is cost and how many people worked hard to make this kind of movie. I don't think every people know that. Many people does not even understand the DC Universe. How can they understand this movie. Zack Snyder and his workers made this movie for people to enjoy it. But some people just can't enjoy it and they don't appreciate it. It is true that the movie is not perfect, But nothing is perfect we know that. About the critics, I don't think they know justice. Batman v superman deserve positive reviews but the critics did not like it. What about the people? Most people liked this movie. If 1000 people tell the lie 2000 time, the lie will not be true. Critics review need to be stopped. People don't want there opinion. Forgive me If I am wrong. I say to all the people of the world to watch this movie, I am not sure everybody will like it. But they sure can not hate it if they understand the movie. We can learn many things from this kind of movie. We can Increase our imagination and take technology ideas from this kind of movie. And from Batman we can learn that what a human could do with knowledge, technology, hard work and strong will power.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Grim to the point of breeding contempt, lacking in excitement, and an overwhelming feeling you've seen it all before","I may indeed be the only one who finds it fascinating that both ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" are released on the same weekend. The former is a heavily hyped film that has the ambition to finally kick off the DC Extended Universe while the universe's competitor likely doesn't even see them in its rearview mirror, and the latter is a sequel to a romantic comedy from fourteen years ago. The reason these releases are so germane is that both are highly likely not to leave much of an impact on pop culture, and that even accounts for the original ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" which, despite boasting the title of the ""highest grossing romantic comedy of all time,"" left no footprint either.I only mention this because the idea of Batman squaring off in an epic battle against Superman, in a time where comic book movies are more popular and some are more subversive than ever, with a nine-figure pricetag is something that should've been the battle of the ages. A remarkable duel between two of society's most beloved heroes that should've enthusiastically set up a universe. However, this is a film that will come and go like few superhero films of the last decade, I predict. This is a remarkably bleak letdown of a film, grim to the point of being effectively joyless, bloated and crippled by trying to serve as too many components to the stalled development of a universe, and unexciting while boasting one of the most exciting battles in movie history.The film takes place eighteen months after the events of ""Man of Steel,"" another horribly forgettable picture, where Superman (Henry Cavill) has become a hot topic of debate, so much so that even Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) can't stand the very sight and idea of him after he defeated General Zod, thanks to the onslaught of chaos he brought to Metropolis. Superman, however, cannot stand Batman and works to expose him while continuing to work for ""The Daily Planet"" newspaper as journalist Clark Kent.Meanwhile, LexCorp's new frontman Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) finds Superman to be the biggest threat facing humanity today and works with Senator June Finch (Holly Hunter) to help him recover Kryptonite in order to defeat the caped vigilante. This would also involve working to replicate the late Zod's DNA in order to help Lex wage a battle between two of the greatest heroes in history: a battle between man and God.Much has been made about the casting of Ben Affleck and Batman, and just to get that note out of the way, he's fine, and does a comparable amount of brooding to Christian Bale's Batman. Henry Cavill is still a relatively lesser presence mainly because, like Superman in general, his character is very archetypal and predicated upon moral good, two things that don't go over too well in a new age of superhero films based upon gloom and doom. And that's exactly what ""Batman v Superman"" is, two hours of nonstop gloom and doom that effectively robs the film of any conceivable excitement and momentum one had going into this picture.The film is unbelievably murky, and unlike with Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy, where character interest and relationships were pushed to the forefront with a superhero story existing in the background, this film can't keep either one straight. There's too much clutter that makes this film a bloated work of sonic noise and narrative exhaustion, such as the repeated focus on Eisenberg's convincing but wayward performance of the loose cannon Lex Luthor, in addition to questionable and rather unnecessary emphases on Bruce Wayne's schizophrenic dream cycle. Both are just perplexing additions to a film where its title could serve as a plot description.But the biggest problem facing screenwriters Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer is how much weight they have placed on this very film. While trying to serve as a followup to ""Man of Steel,"" Terrio and Goyer also try to make this film stand on its own while foreshadow the upcoming Justice League film. This means including Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) in on the chaos in the middle of the third act, as well as highlight Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash in cameos, making for a film that's crippled by a to-do list the lengthy of a grocery shopping list. I'm reminded of how ""Spider-Man 3"" found itself drowning in so many things to include that the only thing left to marvel was the visual scheme.And even with that, ""Batman v Superman""'s visual palette is so unattractive it winds up significantly lessening the excitement on-screen. By the time we get to the actual fight between our two titular heroes, a combination of fatigue and the idea that we've seen it all before coupled with the gray and black visuals sets in and makes for a film that underwhelms in nearly every sense.""Batman v Superman"" may indeed be one of the biggest letdowns of the year, save for a nicely handled conclusion and a memorable performance by Eisenberg, who seven months ago was a stoner superhero before becoming a psychotic supervillain. It packs everything we've become so accustomed to in superhero films, leaving nothing special for this particular installment, in addition to its grimness breeding contempt and an appalling lack of excitement and its agenda being cluttered to the point of alienation. Chalk up DC as 0-2 going into one of the biggest moves of the brand's existence.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Let's Rumble...and Grumble!,"(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A comic book fantasy that fancies itself a serious contender when it really needs to take itself less seriously.GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: As the world comes undone, two superheroes, with opposing views about saving the world, battle each other.￼Finally, the mystery is solved. That bothersome question that perplexed a nation comes to an end. Not since The Riddle of the Sphinx has a hypothetical query bothered so many and answered so few: In the ultimate battle between The Man of Steel and The Caped Crusader, who would rule victorious? In Zack Snyder's comic book blockbuster, both superheroes come to blows and the outcome is up there on the big screen in all of its CGI glory.￼In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the stage is set for this heroic showdown, although it takes over half of the film until the deed occurs. Just as our world has lost some of its innocence, so has this modern day retelling. Cynicism and despair seem to not only fester in our superheroes nowadays. It is obviously in our film directors and screenwriters as well. This is a darker vision, but aren't most action blockbusters? Comic book heroes are no longer comic. So follows our films, the essence of pop culture and pessimism with our popcorn.As its story unfolds, Superman (Henry Cavill) is an unpopular anti-hero. While previously fighting General Zod (Michael Shannon) to save the world, he has also systemically destroyed Metropolis in his battle of good v evil. Much destruction and many lives were mere collateral damage during this war to end all wars. One of these victims viewing the cosmic free-for-all is Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), who decides to take matters into his own hands. And the battle of egos begins...￼On hand are many faces that doted the mythology of both superheroes. On one side are Lois Lane (Amy Adams), Mrs. Kent (Diane Lane), and Perry White (Laurence Fishburne), reprising their roles and on the other, loyal servant Alfred (Jeremy Irons), and assorted Bat-gear and nifty gadgetry, all the money can buy. Watching the match-up, with rapt interest are Diana Prince (an underused Gal Gadot) and megalomaniac Lex Luther (an oddly miscast Jesse Eisenberg, substituting triviality instead of menace). Let's rumble! Or, at least, grumble.￼With the exception of the aforementioned Mr. Eisenberg, the cast acquits themselves rather nicely, giving their one-dimensional characters some depth. Both Mr. Cavill and Mr. Affleck fill their spandex with the right about of coolness and sex appeal, the former with a broad- shouldered charm and the latter wisely underplays the brooding millionaire playboy.￼However, script-wise, the film loses its footing, in the most logical sense. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice mixes political issues like racial profiling (in this case, alien v human), vigilantism, violence, religion, terrorism, and evil capitalism with its populist message. It's heady stuff, even if the screenplay by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer cannot bring together its own thought process with the numerous sub-plots that continually arise. The film relies on far too many dream sequences and flashbacks that only increase the film's length and confuse the main plot. Judicious editing would have only helped the film. Again, less is more.￼But in the hands of its director, restraint is non-existent. He fills every inch of the screen with crashes, explosions, and in-your-face CGI. Mr. Snyder, not one of my favorite directors, I must add, throws in everything, including a kitchen sink. (It's true!) Still, this may be his finest film to date, He does keep things moving along, although it is hard to tell if the film's many action sequence are well staged on his part, due to the frenzied editing by David Brenner and blurry hand-held camera-work by Larry Fong.With the film's superfluous multiple endings, justice may finally be served and a new sequel will arriving soon to a movie theater near you. (Many moviegoers in my audience wore Batman or Superman t-shirts and sat transfixed through the showing.) However, for this critic, the verdict for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is simply this: it may not be a misfire, but the evidence remains inconclusive. Call it a mistrial.￼Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Slugish pacing, a super let down.","A big action flick with action we have seen many a time, BvS hits with a dull thud which leaves the audience wondering what it has just seen. From the poor pacing and story set up too terrible cop outs, BvS is a perfect example of how not to make a super hero film, especially when you consider what has come before, both good and bad. Highlights include Batman's fight with some kidnappers and Wonder Woman's big fight introduction. Downsides range from the main battle itself which involves some truly hideous CGI and the performances of one half of the marquee name (Superman) and his nemesis Lex, as well as the inane reasoning for some pivotal moments, though the film is spared an utterly embarrassing crush thanks to the performance of Ben Affleck.

Disappointed,"As an adult it is an OK movie. But, it is to bad that the super hero movies have become so dark and violent and bloody. Where is the humor mixed in with the suspense?

It's just sad that they feel they have to. There were some flaws that were not true to the comic books that made me scratch my head. But, all and all it was entertaining...for an adult.

Some good moments but shares Man of Steel's pacing problems,"This movie had some very neat visuals, a few of them ripped right from the pages of some of Batman's most memorable comics, and the dynamic between Superman and Lois was great to watch. However, I kept waiting for the story to start. For all its explosions, this movie had me checking my watch.For a movie that is explicitly about Superman and Batman fighting, it skimps on foundation for why they would fight. The source material has plenty.While this is an improvement over Man of Steel (no weird birth scenes) I found myself comparing it to Superman Returns, which, for all its flaws, really felt like a Superman movie. The question of what gives Superman the right to interfere in human affairs, which is a major issue in Batman vs Superman, is there answered very simply--because people keep asking him to.Although Wonder Woman held her own, I would have liked to have seen more of her character and less sexy posing in skimpy costumes.If you have more than two dream sequences, you need a rewrite.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Couldn't have been worse,"I had high expectations, but the movie totally disappointed me! 1.the whole scenario was so confusing, no specific story. Everything was a little bit mixed up: too many different stories, too many characters. I guess the plan was to produce something strong causing strong feelings. But that didn't work out for me. 2. Sorry Ben, but you have been the worst batman I have ever seen: no expressions at all, a constantly sleepy mood, your face didn't change at all during a 150 minute movie. 3. For once again we were forced to see batman's childhood. OK, but unless you have to contribute a different glimpse to the story, don't do it. It seemed to me like a desperate effort to touch one's feelings. 4. I think that a repetition of a story, with new actors in the roles of batman and Alfred was doomed to failure from the beginning. Take the same actors as before if you want to give to the story the sense of continuing. 5.superman was classic, I didn't expect something more. He was way better than Ben Affleck! 6. But that didn't save the situation, since the acting was at least inadequate, making me think that the artificial beast could probably take an Oscar for its performance!!! 7.last but not least: marvel, in order to combine superheroes especially if they fight one another, you need a good script so tight and firm so that the audience will understand what you show. Moreover, if every year 4 to 5 movies of this kind are produced, the quality can't be high.

I give it a 7,"Batman v Superman should have been an engaging character study, but it's overstuffed - crowded with actors, jammed with plot, packed with mayhem. Look at the title. It promises a one-on-one showdown between two titans of the superhero world. Granted we do get that. If two physical specimens throwing each other around sounds exciting, then you will be pleased. But there's so much excess fat in this almost three hour film. Too many extraneous plot threads muddle a crowded adventure. Was it really necessary to present the Batman origin story yet another time? I got it, Zack Snyder. Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered. Sheesh! That scene has had more performances than Phantom of the Opera. Cameos from Charlie Rose, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Anderson Cooper are superfluous padding.We're talking about two guys that dress up in tights and run around fighting crime. The very idea is inherently silly, but you'd think we were detailing the most horrific chapters of World War II given this movie's utterly bleak tone. There's little room for ""fun"" when grim, depressing self-importance is the thrust of the DC agenda. The strident inability to ""lighten up"" must also afflict writers Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer who penned this ponderous screenplay. Batman v Superman isn't horrible. It's intermittently involving as it unfolds, but all these issues weigh it down upon reflection.

Great material -- atrocious editing,"I'll keep this spoiler-free.It's rare that the editing is the link that makes or breaks the chain of a blockbuster, but that seems to be what's happened here. ""Batman V Superman"" is a movie with some truly great moments, both emotive and cool, but it looks like it was cut together by a young teen training himself to use Premier Pro.Short story: beginning=good; end=good; middle=boring, badly-paced and mildly confusing.Long story. The opening 10-20 minutes were fantastic: we went though the whole murder of Bruce's family thing again, but it was montaged very well, and had Zimmer's emotive score combined with some (actually sensible, for once) Snyder slo-mo. We then cut to Grown-up Bruce in Metropolis, and see his perspective of the third act of ""Man of Steel"" as he tries to save his employees from a burning building. I liked this.Oh how we laughed at the idea of Batfleck! ""No!"", we thought, ""He'll be awful!"". But he's had the last laugh, it seems -- cause he was great! Ben's Batman is older -- early-forties -- and has evidently spent too much time doing what he does: he's much darker (even more so than Bale's) and conflicted; he kills people -- indirectly, but very deliberately. It was a fresh take on a beloved character, and I look forwards immensely to his stand-alone pictures. The sarcastic, no-nonsense Jeremy Irons as Alfred was also a pleasant surprise (you didn't know you wanted a cool Alfred until you got him).The rest of the cast is similarly strong, including Caville, but the movie really begins to fall apart a little way into the First Act. the editing was shocking: there was no tension or buildup, and the plot didn't even begin to exist, let alone take shape, for the first hour. Superman had little motivation for fighting Batman, and Batman's motivations, though much better, don't become clear until the Third Act. This movie is simply too long, and need re-editing (a common flaw with Snyder).That said, Snyder has grown up somewhat from the child who made ""300"", and the delinquent teenager trying to act cool with ""Man of Steel"". The stylising is less obvious, and the slo-mo is kept mostly in check. He was a little excessive with the CG in parts (very, in others), but the VFX team for the most part did a great job (with one exception -- you'll know it when you see it), and the graphics weren't quite ropey enough to detract from my immersion.Of the fight itself, so prophesied in the trailers, I'll say this: it's shorter than you might think, and it isn't the climax of the movie -- but it's good and carries a fair bit of weight as far as emotional investment goes. I said that the movie falls apart, but it does begin to piece itself back together in time for the end, and the last 20 minutes almost justify the preceding 100.Great moments; needs a re-edit; too long. It suffered from the long-known Snyder shortcomings: a slightly weak story and bad pacing, but it was by far and away his best movie yet, and I genuinely look forwards to the rest of the DC shared universe.This wasn't as clean as the launch of the MCU back in the day, but we're here now, with a surprisingly good Batfleck leading the team.

Incoherent....,"BvS with its superficially seriousness, made more apparent the ludicrous nature of Superhero comics in general. Don't get me wrong. I like (liked) comics like the next person, but when you read or watch Superman you must feel a tongue sentiment. I didn't felt that. Instead I felt cheated from this movie.The editing is incoherent and involves dream sequences, unneeded use of slow motion and flashbacks. The direction is blunt and the pace boring. I started to taking note for this review 1h:30' into the movie and still it hasn't build-up. The basic premise ""Batman sees Superman as a threat"" is OK but the script and the dialogs look hasty written.Despite the a quarter of a billion dollars budget, the movie still uses the TV-based ""air fan in the hair and face trick"" to Lois, to skip the cost of a CGI Superman fly. To tell you the truth I wonder where that money went since the movie doesn't excel in the visuals department. Just rewatched Terminator 3, a misunderstood movie if you ask me, and the big budget was evident in props, stages and cgi. BvS looks like they heavily misused the money.The cast, same as MoS, doesn't seem appropriate in this movie too. About Affleck I would agree he was a poor choice but overall didn't bother as other Batmen in the past. Gal Gadot looks nice in the WW suit though.Another problem is with the Music. Seems unsuitable. And I'm not talking about Superman's (??) theme which is a joke (the first appearance of S. in the movie uses Zimmer's theme like it is suppose to be a well known litemotif and fails miserably), but also the ""functional"" music in almost every scene. It also bothered me the rip-off Mozart's requiem-like theme that used in some supposedly dramatic scenes. Sounded really out of place too. *sigh* For me John William's iconic Superman theme(s) will be always my favorite by far.Overall: ""You got me? Who's got you?"" Lois Lane said in Donner's Superman in the original scene which this movie tried to copy or remind. The thing is that we never forgot that line and Amy Adams's ""You came back"" is as forgettable as it should be. S I and S II despite the many arbitrary elements and b-class effects were touching and noble and fun. I don't like Zack Scnyder's vision at all. He did an excellent job in ""300"" but after that... BvS falls in that category. Superheroes are like the goose with the golden eggs nowadays, so this movie will be successful too. Financially. Artistically no. I have already forgot about it. I will always remember S I and II, though.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Takes an inordinate amount of time to the finale .,"I expected more out of this film solely based upon the concept that two of my favorite superheroes are trying to beat each other .

In the end the film did fall short of my ( many will agree) expectations . I think the CGI technology would not satisfy the fans when the movie runs for 2.5 hours with may be 30 minutes of real fight . Not what I expected but definitely not the worst I have seen .

Implausible and boring,"I was pleased when I heard Ben Affleck was going to be the new Batman and in this film I think he does a good job. I can't think of an actor working today who looks more like how I imagine Batman. Unfortunately he's stuck in this horrible mess of a movie.Good points - As well as Affleck who does wonders with no decent dialogue, Wonder Woman is also very good but she's not in it much. In fact if you've seen the trailer you've seen the best bits of her. And that's it really. I can't think of anything else that's good about this film.Bad points - Jessie Eisenberg is terrible as Lex Luthor. Seems like he thought he was playing the part of the Joker. He's all nervous ticks and zany humour (none of which is funny). Lois Lane has nothing of any interest to do other than be saved by Superman once every half hour. And as for Superman, well he's just miserable which doesn't help when he's played by an actor who has no range. He doesn't come across as a good guy at all. Where I could accept Batman being angry and vengeful all the time, Superman is supposed to be more of a clean cut guy with morals. Cavill's Superman cares not a jot if hundreds of innocent people die as long as Lois is okay. Then there's the script. It makes no sense. There are so many occasions when characters do things without reason or motive. Such as why Lex Luthor creates Doomsday. There is no explanation about why he would do this, or what he will gain from it.And finally there's the three dream sequences that seem to have been inserted into the movie just because they look awesome. They might as well have stuck in the opening scene of the Star Destroyer in Star Wars just because it looks good, then cut to Ben Affleck waking up in a cold sweat because he's had another irrelevant dream.If Zack Snyder continues to direct these movies I'll be checking out.

A hollow story presented in an explosion of special effects...,"This was a movie that had been long awaited by many. But I wasn't one of them, because I don't really care much about superhero movies and such. But still, I had the chance to sit down and watch ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"", so I decided to take out two and a half hours of my life to do so.First of all, I must say that I was entertained by the sheer amount of action and destruction that there was in the 2016 Zack Snyder rendering of the two classic iconic superheroes. And it was presented to the audience in a myriad of impressive visual and sound effects. It looked so real, actually, and that was one of the most impressive things.As for the story in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"", well I can only say three words: are you kidding? This was one of the most shallow story lines I have ever had to sit through in a superhero movie. The story was so pointless and ridiculous that hadn't it been for the amazing CGI, then I would have gotten up and found something else to watch.Essentially this was a movie about two self-centered and egotistical men who were crying to themselves and trying to show off who had the biggest... Well, you get the idea. And that was really a laughable storyline, and it surprised me that Zack Snyder was behind this movie after I saw how shallow the movie actually was.The effects in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" are off the charts. Literally, be prepared to be blown away. Especially if you have a good sound system. For me, then the visual and sounds in this movie was an overload of stimuli. It was amazing what the special effects and sound team had come up with here.One thing that I had dreaded about the movie was Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman. I will say that he handled himself fairly well, although I can't really claim to be impressed. But still, he fared well enough and got the job done where it counted, but then again, he had very, very little to work with script-wise here.While we are on actors, then I wasn't particularly impressed with the choice of Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He just didn't strike me to be plausible enough for that role. It was like he was a spoof on the Lex Luthor character.And as for this movie being the beginning of the Justice League, well, sure it was nice to see Wonder Woman back on the screen. But then again, that whole Justice League thing is wasted on me, as I don't really care much for superheroes.But all in all, an entertaining enough movie for what it turned out to be. Just a shame that the storyline was as shallow and ridiculous as the sound and effects were impressive. ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" really could have been so much more with a better script.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worse than I expected,"When I first heard Ben was playing Batman I had the same reaction most people did. Right away I assumed it would be crap, but then after awhile I started thinking, ""well the last Christopher Nolan Batman was so good, and the Superman movie wasn't too terrible, and with all the good Marvel movies maybe they will actually pull this off."" They didn't. They just kind of jumped right into things. No explanation for things. The story is just not put together well. The ""creation"" of Doomsday was just plain stupid. And all of a sudden Wonder Woman is just there like ""oh hey guys i'm gonna join you now"" Just an overall bad story with little explanation. I understand these kinds of movies have to cater to both children and adults, which is a very hard balance to find. Inevitably if you're catering to children, adults are going to be somewhat disappointed. The recent Marvel movies seem to have found a good balance. I feel like this Batman v Superman movie might just seem like it caters more to children because the story line is just so silly only a child could enjoy it. I hate to keep comparing to the Avengers franchise, but that's technically the equivalent as DC builds up to the Justice League movie. I like how Marvel did the solo movies first then built up to The Avengers. DC kind of did that with Man of Steel, and then adding in Batman and Wonder Woman in this movie, but it just seems like they rushed it big time. It's not Batman & Robin 1997 bad, but this does not hold up to today's comic book movie standards. It really sucks to think that this is just the beginning and this is going to be the foundation for the future of the Justice League. I'm not giving it a 1/10 rating because I did actually sit through the whole movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron man errr Batman vs Superman,"If you can get over the fact that Batman is essentially Iron man then you can enjoy a decent super hero flick.

So Ben ponies up for one more ride, but he is going to need a medal suite and of course kryptonite baby! So he does and the battle ensues to epic proportions.

I believe this film to be a masterpiece, and for me, the finest example of a comic book film.

"Too long, too much slow exposition, but props to Affleck's Batman.","I feel this film had much potential that simply wasn't exploited.Batman was solid; kudos to Ben Affleck for his performance as the Dark Knight. Aside from the several cookie-cutter stern-faced grimaces, he did quite well. Superman, though... weak. Far from the rich character that was Superman in 'Man of Steel', a rather stilted delivery (was that Henry Cavill's Scottish roots peeking out in his pronunciation of ""been"" a few times?) and sort of wishy-washy to boot, quite disappointing. The supposed villain, Lex Luthor, seemed more a juvenile, awkward nutjob than a world-class arch criminal; wrapped up in social awkwardness attributed to insanity, but that illusion simply doesn't work. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman was okay, but that Israeli accent really got in the way of seeing her character as an Amazon princess.The obvious and poorly-crafted mannequin of General Zod defused any remaining faith I had in what at that point was at least a halfway good flick. The strange dream flashbacks experienced by Bruce Wayne were out of left field and made no sense; who was the dude with the Robin-esque mask, was that Robin? Was that some projection from an alternate universe? No clue, and no elaboration is given, thus making it clutter.It's as if this film served to set the foundation for Wonder Woman's future films, using Batman and Superman as pawns in her game, as if she looped her magic lasso of influence around those ""super"" heroes like they were accessories rather than core members of the ensemble.Glad I didn't pay to see this. Hopefully Affleck's forthcoming Batman and Gadot's upcoming Wonder Woman will make up for this rather long, drawn-out, predictable ""superhero"" yarn.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a mess!,"This takes place 18 months after the events in ""Man of Steel"". Superman (Henry Cavill) is still around performing good deeds but people are unsure of him. Batman (Ben Affleck) especially doesn't like him. Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) discovers kryptonite--the one thing that can kill Superman. He wants to use it against him...but so doesn't Batman. Luthor also develops a monster called Doomsday that Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) have to battle before it destroys Metropolis.What a waste! The script makes little sense and is slow-moving and dreary. There's plot holes big enough for the Batmobile and no real point. There's also these sequences where Supes and Bats are complaining and moping about being heroes. Since when have they been so whiny? The whole movie is depressing and needlessly violent. Acting doesn't help at all. Cavill is terrible as Superman. He LOOKS the part but always has a blank expression on his face. Eisenberg is even worse as Luthor. I still can't figure out WHAT the hell he was trying to do. He's not funny, cute, interesting or sinister. Just stupid and puzzling. Amy Adams is wasted as Lois Lane. She has nothing to do in this except get rescued by Superman. Only Gadot and Affleck (who's superb) give good performances. However they can't save the film and the plot really weighs down everything. By the time the big battle came by the end I was too bored to even care. Director Snyder knows how to direct action sequences but when it comes to dramatics he's clueless. A boring, depressing and utterly pointless movie. VERY disturbing ending too.

"Awesome Batman flick, and great action movie! **Spoiler free**","First and foremost, I'd like to state that I was on board the Batfleck train as soon as he was cast. I knew he would be perfect for the job and he delivered a phenomenal performance as the Dark Knight. As someone who really enjoyed the first installment of this film (Man of Steel), I quite enjoyed the film, but didn't necessarily love it.Summary: In this movie, Bruce Wayne/Batman is fearing the actions of a god- like being that could essentially wipe out the entire human race if he wanted to. All of the chaos that happened at the end of Man of steel, is coming back to bite Superman in the ass, per-say, as the world is trying to determine what kind of hero it really needs. This leads to Batman and Superman going head to head in a epic battle between the two, as depicted in the Dark Knight Returns graphic novel by Frank Miller. While the two are fighting, Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg), is constructing a mischievous plan to make the world see who Superman really is.Now my opinion on the movie. Remember - this is MY OPINION on the film.They're were some things i really enjoyed seeing and was glad to see, and some other things in which i thought they could've elaborated a bit more on the story and characters. Some things I wished weren't even in the film cause i thought it could've been in its own other film (we all know by what I mean here). Sometimes there was stuff that was happening at the same time of other things which made the film a bit rushed and choppy by 60% into the movie. I know that the pre-final cut of the film was about 3 hours long before they cut some scenes out for a two and a half hours final theatrical cut of the movie, which i guess meant some sacrifice would have to be made on the story. I really wished they would've done a closer adaptation to the Frank Miller comic - I think it would've been WAY better, but, what can you do :PAll and all, I really enjoyed the action sequences, the tone, and feel of what they were going for. Zack Snyder is a great director and visually, this film is just gorgeous. I will have to go see this movie multiple times just to digest whats actually going on in some places and to get my final thought on it.P.S. I will change my vote after multiple views.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

But in some moments looks like that this movie was made for people with 10 IQ in best case. I gave 1 to this movie but actually 1 is too much, just cant give less rating. Didn't expected much, but still i am disappointed from what we got. And one more thing: Ben Aflek never again for Batman! He is really good actor, but Batman is for someone else, not for Ben.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016),"What can I say that has not already been said, I was extremely disappointed with this movie as I was with Man of Steel. The Characters were so dark and brooding that it took away the joy of seeing a Good Superman movie and Superman as he was written in the comics. It sees writers and directors are so hell bent on creating these dark brooding super hero movies that they end up missing all the key elements that made us fans. There was nothing likable about this Superman and Batman or this movie. I never really cared for the actor who played superman. It Lacked, Humor, Heart & Joy and Zack Snyder was responsible for this mess of a movie. A stink bucket of disappointment, a sad and unnecessary PG-13 orphan fight that director Zack Snyder believes is an homage to DC Comics' most iconic heroes, but is more along the lines of a home invasion perpetrated on comic book culture."" So it would seem from this mess that Snyder was half asleep when he read the comics of the characters. There are arguments that would suggest this was a great movie and I can agree that some will have liked it but I have seen more including myself who hated it, one could say it has already made a lot of money, that's true only because you had so much publicity on this that almost every fan flocked to see this on opening day/week-end after that who knows. I think if it were possible all of us should forget this movie and Man of steel ever happened and start again and never let Zack Snyder direct or even be apart of it, he destroyed it! total garbage Then ending was so horrible. I suggest to WB or DC before they do another movie or Justice League I would suggest they re-think it before making it and hopefully it won't be so dark and lacking spirit. I can only imagine if Snyder is directing the 2018 version of the Flash we are all already disappointed especially with the casting of the Flash but perhaps Snyder's choice of not choosing Grant Gustin maybe a blessing for Grant because if I were him after seeing this mess I would have been ashamed to be apart of it. Personally I think Superman movies for the big screen have tired out and ran its course. DC needs to bring Superman back to TV and make it a combined mixture of the Flash and Arrow setting, perhaps Tom Welling could step into that role either way I think Superman needs to be a TV show again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Zack Snyder had a story to tell, and this movie clearly shows.","It's become clear to me that Zack Snyder had his own ideas on how to portray these beloved comic book superheroes, and provided you're watching the Ultimate Edition, this movie really delivers! As grim, nihilistic and morose as the film is, it is also very action-packed. Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot both steal the show as the Dark Knight and Wonder Woman, respectively, and the rest of the cast give it their all, especially Jeremy Irons as Alfred. The visual style and cinematography are great; the opening sequence alone is beautifully shot, and the score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL does its job well, adding plenty of emotion and intensity to the film.If you were to put a gun to my head and ask if I have any nitpicks with the film, I do have a few, and they are perfectly reasonable:The obvious: this movie is a very misguided attempt to set up the Justice League a mere two movies in, which is all the more evident in the title alone. It is abundantly clear that the heads at WB were trying desperately to play catch-up to Marvel and their established cinematic universe. Bringing in the Justice League midway through the film ultimately feels like an afterthought, as does Doomsday, who looks nothing like he does in the comics. It's sad to see the DCEU wasn't properly developed.As much as I personally admire the storytelling efforts, it is literally adapting two big comic book events in one movie with barely enough time to fully flesh out the characters and their motivations, which by themselves are somewhat nonsensical and over-the-top.Being a three-hour movie, the pacing can take a dip in some spots. I don't really mind the length of the UE, but I understand that this will either make or break the movie for others. I hear there exists a four-hour cut of BvS. I wonder if we'll get to see it at some point?Jesse Eisenberg, I think, is entertaining as Lex Luthor, but he embodies none of the key characteristics of the Man of Steel's archenemy and he often comes across as a mix between Jim Carrey's Riddler and Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka.Bottom line, Zack Snyder really knows how to make his movies epic and grand in scale, and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is no exception. This is one of the most divisive cinematic ventures ever made, but one that I can highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not outright awful, but a massive disappointment.","Disclaimer: rant mode activated. In the relatively short history of comic-book movies, no other showdown between (and teaming-up of) beloved heroes has garnered as much anticipation and fan fervour as that between the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight. It's the Holy Grail not only of the DC cinematic universe, but that of the entire superhero genre. So how in the name of Zeus' butthole did Warner Bros – and specifically DCCU spearhead Zack Snyder – mishandled it this badly? Now I'm not talking Fantastic Four level awfulness, but that movie also had zero expectation and hype attached to it hence came and went with barely anyone batting an eyelid. Not so for BvS, its potential for greatness makes its failure all the more disappointing.It begins with a redundant opening credits sequence (we get it, Bruce Wayne witnesses his parents' death and is forever tormented by it) and zigzags through varying levels of messiness to arrive at a CGI-drenched climactic battle that makes the Transformers finales look subtle. It's not just the concluding skirmish that hits us over the head with a visual and aural sledgehammer though, majority of the action sequences are edited with unrelenting rapidity and cloaked in unnecessarily gloomy cinematography. The inevitable melee between our title characters is a gem amongst boulders, but with a 2.5-hour runtime it barely scratches the surface of what this epic premise could have delivered. It also boasts one of the only moments of levity, an element sorely absent from this drab affair.Snyder has to shoulder a large portion of the criticism aimed at this bloated misfire, yet even he can't be blamed for the screenplay (from David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio) unravelling into a convoluted and uninteresting story. Marvel has mastered the lighter side of big screen comic-book outings and Nolan reinvented a whole genre with his dark and gritty Batman trilogy, but instead of striking a balance between the two, BvS goes full-tilt serious. Serious, and bonkers, as demonstrated by one utterly unwarranted dream sequence featuring an apocalyptic future, time-warping weirdos and winged devil-creature-thingies; because, you know, that's definitely what has been missing from these movies for way too long.Considering the amount of whinging caused by his hiring, it's ironic that Ben Affleck is one of the most positive elements in this garbled wreck. His performance as Bruce Wayne / Batman is suitably moody, portraying depth in an iconic figure that is otherwise lumped with a clichéd plot. Many of the other cast members – Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Amy Adams, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeremy Irons – are adequate without justifying a special mention; although some – Holly Hunter, Scoot McNairy, Diane Lane – are given such short shrift it's a wonder why they are there in the first place. The inevitable setting up of future films within the franchise (the hint is in the title) isn't handled too badly, although there's an unshakeable feeling that DC's game of catch-up with Marvel is going to be a long and bumpy road.Not the nadir of superhero flicks, but what should've been a crowning achievement for DC's cinematic world is instead a massive misstep that could be this year's biggest bummer.

A movie that struggles to find an identity and suffers serious pacing issues,"BvS is a perfect example of a movie being over hyped to being something greater than it actually is. Going into the theater I excepted this movie to be about Batman vs Superman, however, I have never been more wrong. Throughout the entirety of its run time, BvS just can't seem to get the stone rolling. Pacing is a huge problem in this movie. At times it was painstakingly slow, especially the end after the climatic fight scene. Dialogue is also another key problem with this movie. The way some of the characters speak in this movie is just plain annoying and even weird at parts. This is mainly do to Lex Luthor who, arguably, is the second biggest problem with the film. In order for a villain to be a ""good"" villain, the viewer needs to have some sort of resentment or fear of them. Lex is neither of these and instead he is just plain annoying. By far the biggest issue I had with this movie was the climax. The whole concept was that Batman and Superman were going to go at it throughout a good portion of the film. But when the fight finally does happen it lasts a solid 5 minutes and then never happens again. The fight scene is visually impressive but not much really happens during it. Overall, I felt this film was more of a forced prequel about the formation of the Justice League then a separate film about Batman and Superman. It is visually impressive film with some of the best CGI done to date. But what it has in visuals is overshadowed by its flaws. BvS could have been so much more and I can't remember the last time I have been this mad at a film for being mediocre. Just don't go into the movie with high hopes and you should at least enjoy parts of the film. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An enjoyable superhero flick.,"Due to pressure from the studio, Snyder was forced to edit down this movie to make way for a more acceptable film-length. This resulted in a less coherent experience for the viewer and ultimately the reason why the film received such mixed reviews.At its heart, it's a love letter to the story of Batman. Affleck nails the performance and Snyder clearly loves riffing off the star's bleak interpretation of the Dark Knight. Outside of that character, the movie struggles to tell its story, mainly due to lightning-quick jumps from one sub-plot to the next. It's not really until almost half-way through that the movie find its gear.Because of this, the Ultimate Edition lifted the experience for me, the opening hour or so is far more digestible and allows the movie to grow.There are some amazing, jaw dropping scenes in this film, though. The fight between Clark and Bruce is exceptionally crafted and the Batman fight-scene, where Batman single-handedly breaks the bones of twenty thugs is wonderful stuff to see.Overall, this is a fairly good film. Unfortunately though, it can't be anything more. The editing is the biggest issue, that and the casting of Lex Luther and a rather disappointing CGI-laden Doomsday.Snyder and Affleck deserved a shot at a solo Batman outing after this, in my opinion, as when this movie shines on the Bat, it is very good indeed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I don't even know where to start but Batman v Superman fails in almost every aspect a movie could. Script, editing, direction, sound editing, some camera work and the list goes on. While some of the action scenes deliver there are some other that go exactly the opposite. I cannot say how disappointed I was by the Batman vs Superman part of this film. Even worse, in the script which was, certainly a total mess, there are good things to be seen here and there, ideas that just fade out in this overlong, two hours and a half mess. The tone of the movie is just overall wrong and becomes stale after a while, the lack of contrast and repeated camera-work OCDs of mr. Snyder driving the viewer away from this world even further. Another problem, that we have seen constantly in recent years in products like The Amazing Spiderman 2 and Avengers Age of Ultron, the movie takes way too much time to set up future films and also does it in a very cheap, dull and shockingly dumb way transforming about half of this movie into a big budget bad edited trailer for Justice League. It is not a disaster but it is a mediocre film at best which is sad for a title like this. 5/10 just thanks to Ben Affleck's Batman, some of the cinematography which is already a trademark for Snyder and some of the soundtrack. I have to say I am really excited for the solo Batman movie directed and written by Ben Affleck but I'm anything but intrigued by the upcoming Justice League movies.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Would have been better if it was not so long.,"From the moment the movie starts, you get the feeling that this is going to be a long two and a half hours.Batman v Superman is filled with a lot of cool scenes that were so unnecessary. It was filled with flashbacks and dream sequences that just seem to over bloat the blockbuster. It works for a comic book,but not as well for a comic book movie.Speaking of which, as a fan of the comics, and equally a fan of movies, I'm caught in a huge dilemma. The inaccuracy of the characters sometimes got in the way of my movie pleasure. That should not be a big deal and you might say they have to change a lot of things to fit a comic to a movie. Not in this day and era, and not with these two guys who have been movie stars (especially Bats) for more than 30 years.The story being told about Batman targeting superman for being a threat to the globe is a great one and told interesting, but this film dumbed down Batman and made Superman too dark, something I forgive director Zack Snyder for in Man of Steel but now he's butchering two comic book (and movie) Icons.And The Third Icon in the movie, Wonder Woman. She was a big help to the film in my book. Would have rather seen her in her own movie first, but there is an action scene in the film that makes up for it.The film is not as bad as the faults I pointed out. For those who doubted Ben Affleck's capability to play the Dark Knight, you're going to have to eat crow on this one. Batfleck was amazing. He was holding the movie on his shoulders. Good thing he got real jack up for the role, his shoulders were ridiculous, and the battle scenes when Batman is doing hand to hand combat were thrilling. He's a devoted actor who completely respected the character and brought it like Christian Bale did for Nolan.I also loved Jeremy Irons as Alfred. Makes me wish he had more scenes.Also thought Jesse Eisenberg could have been a better Lex Luther, but it feels like they were more adjusting Lex Luther to Jesse Eisenberg rather than the other way around. Big mistake.The action scenes in the movie was magnificent. This is something that I always like about Zack Snyder's style. He's just real good at making CGI look real good. When the superheroes fight, there is a lot of style to the movement that works for the overall picture, and it never feels that CGI is being used for a gimmick.As much as I like all the action and the story, and watching these two iconic characters go at, the movie's biggest issue was that it did not need to be so long. Just a lot of things going on that do not push the movie forward. You know how all those Marvel movies have those after credit scenes that make you cheer in excitement? Batman v Superman had those scenes within the movie and it did not make me cheer.It's always a bad sign when all I can think about is going to the bathroom during the film (it's like they are trying to evolve the human race to have bigger bladders with these comic book films). If the movie was really that good I would be only focus on it.Good, not great and could have been better. C minus.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Oh, boy... I just... I had mediocre expectations, and those were far too high.","Well... I'm actually of the opinion that Zack Snyder can deliver as a director, and I wouldn't slate this move as an exception to that notion, but it's baffling to me that he didn't find the lack of plot and congruence amid characters alarming. It didn't help that he put his foot in his mouth by being brazen enough to liken his film to the work of Nolan.To Snyder's credit, there were beautifully shot scenes, and the cinematographer complimented the grittiness that Snyder was working towards, but those achievements pale in comparison to the drab, unimaginative script that was presumably written whilst Terrio and Goyer fervently attempted to ""outdo"" each other in the pursuit of getting canned from the project. Lois Lane is just... paper thin. Her ""relationship"" with Clark Kent has about as much chemistry as a crusty towel does with an avocado. Remarkably, even less sincere and passionate dialogue than the heart racing moments of blank stares exchanged in Man of Steel. Clark Kent/Superman does her no favours in returning her mundane advances with hollow assurances and fleeting exits. The movie could have done without the attempt entirely.Batfleck performed as well as he could with a script that was abruptly dropped at his feet and abandoned, leaving Affleck staring at the backs of fleeing men. He was one of the more enjoyable characters that brought a bit of life to the role of Batman, albeit there wasn't the sort of sophistication or off-beat humour that one would expect of Bruce Wayne. Batman's interaction with Superman was comical, regardless of the intended purpose. Their common enemy, Lex Luther, wasn't the low point for me as many have said. Eisenberg's casting was strange, but I found his take on the villain decent enough despite being a little more eccentric than what I was accustomed to in other portrayals. There's no way his wit could carry through given the material, so he did the best he could. Wonder Woman was fine.There may be potential and some promise for the DC future based on casting, but only if the execs can rip the wool from over their eyes and get new blood behind the camera and the pen. Otherwise, it will just be more crap being heaped onto an already massive pile of crap, perpetually becoming a pile so immense and acrid that Michael Bay's keen nose will find it to deliver the final steamer.

"One of the best ""out dated"" comic book movies","I didn't really care to watch this movie until 2024, and I recommend watching the ultimate edition.First of all the extended edition which I saw was well connected, had no major issues as movie and it's really entertaining, but..The problem is these kind of movies is so out dated, and it's so immature to keep the conflict saturated only on fight scenes and cgi characters and big booms, and people throwing things here and there, that was fine if we were still in 2007 and still craving to experience the best out come of these achievements in cinematography and computer generated images.You must as a director use all cinematic tool, the plot, the drama to keep the movie forward and the dialogue between characters, the ideas of every character and keeping the tension using everyone's trap for his enemies, and you may understand what I'm trying to explain if you watch the batman 2022 or the penguin tv series, they didn't rely on fight scene, that's the main issue, fight scenes don't work any more for audience and they won't keep the movie alive for a long time.The second issue with the movie is that they tried so hard to keep batman vs super for as long as they ever could, but it didn't happen !The build up was there but it was never convincing, batman and superman had the same purpose and it was a matter of one silly conversation between them to become friends, so why we spent 2 hours on building a conflict between them.There is no good scenario or a movie script without a good strong conflict of purposes between the characters, that didn't happen here.Last thing last I just want to say that it's a pretty basic comic book movie that would have been a hit in 2003.It's time to move on in general with super hero movies, they just need to get serious and use all the free materials the got to build strong entraining stories, and I think Matt Reeves is getting it right now.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ultimate Extended  Edition---Fantastic Masterpiece,"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the ""Extended Edition "" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a ""fan boy"" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too.The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good,"The film has an introduction to the story already told of Batman's origin in a quick and simple way. The script deals in a simple way to bring all the characters together, introducing little by little characters like Batman, Wonder Woman and Lex Luthor in this universe created in Man of Steel. The justifications for creating a clash between Superman and Batman are valid, no creating a struggle just to have destruction. Batman was a big focus of the film, but Wonder Woman stole the attention every scene that appeared. The fight scenes are very well done, they create a great emotion in the viewer. And we have an ending that gives an epic kick in the Justice League, much more than a post-credit scene, the DC Universe was established and with a great mystery to be unraveled over the years.Film reviewed on the 13th to the 14th day of September 2020.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
If you thought it would be bad - you were right,"The only reason I didn't give it a 1 (or Zero, if it were allowed) is that Ben Affleck is a pretty good Bruce Wayne. The plot is convoluted and illogical. The battle takes place in downtown Gotham, and Superman should have figured out from the last throw down that civilians are in danger. Jessie Eisenberg is a ridiculous Lex Luthor - he seems to be trying to channel Mark Hamill's Joker, both in mannerisms and voice. The various cameos of other DC characters were distracting, but I suppose were needed to set the stage for 'Justice League'Very disappointing overall.

Sets out to do too much & does not do most of it effectively,"BvS is just a classic example of a film trying to do to much; way to much & in the end not telling the story it set out to tell in the first place. A shame really if they had a different take on Lex & Doomsday plus removed all the unneeded new 52 stuff that sets up the Justice League, I think they could have had a very good Batman/Superman story. The fight between Batman & Superman is great; but there is a monstrosity of poorly edited explanation that we as the viewer have to sit through to get to it.Affleck's Batman is the high point of the film & in general the Batman stuff works very well, particularly with Irons' Alfred. Cavill's Superman tends to be very over shadowed in this film as when the film chooses to focus on him he just tends to stare with a blank expression on his face. Jesse Eisenberg's Lex is in a word just plain bad; I have not a clue why they thought a guy that acts like a delusional crack addict would make a compelling villain.Gadot's Wonder Woman seemed for the most part all right, kind of hard to tell because her roll is rather limited in the film. At least Wonder Woman was used far more effectively than the other future members of the Justice League that IMHO should have been left on the cutting room floor. If your a fan you should still see BvS to get a look at all the DC goodness coming down the pipe & as stated before the BvS fight is very good. I just hope in future films they don't try & cram in so much unneeded characters & elements into their stories.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Dawn of Disappointment,"Oh boy was this movie a mess. Now I can't say I really had high hopes going into this film because Man of Steel was a disjointed mess and Zack Snyder really isn't capable of bringing forth anything more than pretty action sequences and cool effects and that's all he really managed to do in BvS. I was really hoping he would prove me wrong but sadly he didn't. However I'll start with the positives because believe it or not there were a few:Batman. Ben Affleck flat out knocked my socks off with the coolest, most bad-ass Batman ever to grace the big screen. He was gritty, brutal, charismatic and just about everything you hope for in Gotham's dark knight, and his chemistry with Jeremy Irons' Alfred (who was also one of the few other characters done very well) was phenomenal. He has reasons for everything he does in the film and I really cared for him as a character and was able to really understand where he comes from.The only other positive was the first hour and a bit of this film which isn't all good but has its highlights. Without spoilers it's almost like a somewhat of a political thriller which did have me genuinely entertained for the most part and the second act fight scene between (MINOR SPOILER) Batman and Superman was SO COOL. Sadly after that the film lost any slight good it had going for it and really just made me sick to my stomach. There are so many plot holes in this movie, things that just happen and make no sense whatsoever and are covered up by dream scenes that try to fill these holes in. SO MANY DREAM SEQUENCES. The majority of the performances are awful especially Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, which is probably one of the worst performances I've ever seen. He is psychotic but not in a good way like Heath Ledger's joker, but in an annoying twitchy way like a little kid who ingested too much sugar. Amy Adams as Lois Lane is an annoying plot device used as nothing more than to propel the weak story and the negatives don't stop there.The Justice League setup sequences were SO forced it hurt and were so incoherent with the film it just completely took me out of the little immersion I was able to muster. Gal Gadot's role as Wonder Woman was short-lived and forgettable however I still preferred her over Henry Cavill's Superman who was as lifeless and boring as ever as to be expected for those who saw Man of Steel. The latter of the second act and the whole third act were a chore to sit through only heightened by the Batman fight scenes which were sadly few and far- between.Overall this is a shallow film filled with an incoherent story and bad performances that dragged for the majority of its 2 and a half hour run time. Zack Snyder delivers hardly more than pretty explosions and stylized fights, and a movie that sadly would've been better as another solo Batman film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Complete waste of money,Don't know how to say it. its a complete failure. Movie story pace was slow. Character build up was taken most of time in movie. Only last 30 min was worth watching. Unnecessary scenes that audience don't want to see. Apart from that Ben Afleck did awesome work as Batman.Gal Gadot also played Wonder woman pretty well. Some humor introduced by batman. Easter eggs for Justice League Movie. because of these small things I gave single star rating. If it was possible. I would've given negative ratings.

A Bittersweet Experience,"Almost certainly, fanboys of superhero films will most likely be pleased with Zack Snyder's second adaptation of the D.C universe. Unfortunately, despite beautiful special effects, the film is mostly uninspired, convoluted, and badly pilfered from some of D.C comics greatest titles.It's been 18 months since the appearance of Superman, and since the aftermath of his devastating battle in Metropolis. Immediately the tone is set in a world that is distrustful of Superman and his god-like abilities, as previously alluded in 'Man of Steel.' Society is divided between those who believe he is meant to be their saviour, and those who disbelieve his intentions are good. Superman is already worshipped by many around the world, and he has already saved the world once from General Zod's army. But Superman poses a very real threat to humanity, and is an alien in a world that doesn't belong to him with the power to rule it like a god if he wished. This is the division that ultimately sets up the titular battle that both heroes are drawn into. The theme is one of distrust. It's a good theme, but sadly the plot is too twisted and convoluted to follow.The plot itself was a fairly difficult and confusing experience, even for a regular moviegoer. Writer/ Producer David S. Goyer, and Chris Terrio, adapt so many different events from some of the best D.C titles, that the avid reader should be able to pick them out with ease. Most notably Frank Miller's 'The Dark Knight Returns', Grant Morrison's 'All-Star Superman', Geoff Johns and Andy Kubert's 'Flashpoint' (briefly), and of course I won't name the event in Superman Vol.2 from 1992 that gives away the ending of this movie. Unfortunately, this is a common problem in the Superhero genre, that any SINGLE title here could have easily been adapted as a film by itself, but filmmakers borrow and lend from ALL of them and never settle on one simple story. The result is a garbled story that is barely cohesive, with special effects layered on top in order to mask how badly devised this film really is.This movie lets itself be smothered in an avalanche of events and unnecessary plot devices. The first hour of the film is a barrage of flashbacks, 4 or 5 dream sequences, and poorly written dialogue. You never really have a chance to settle into this new world and take it all in. The story jumps around like a fish out of water, from character to character, event to unconnected event, and is rife with plot holes from the beginning (most notably for me was the geography between Gotham and Metropolis, and this new 'killer' Batman hypocrisy). The final half of the film is simply a grouping of loose references towards future movies in the series, so much so that it becomes an advertisement unto itself.On the positive side, there are some decent moments of acting in the film. The introduction of Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, was perhaps the best casting choice for the whole film. She exudes power in every scene, and I found myself hoping for more of her story in this film. Henry Cavil hasn't changed much since his first film as Superman, and does well reprising the role. He's perhaps more confused about his place in the world than before, and finds himself swayed by the people he protects. He's also more vulnerable in this film, which was nicely expressed at times. On the other hand, Ben Affleck was a surprisingly different version of Batman. I wasn't very impressed with this older and slightly broken Batman, and was very different from previous incarnations. He is a much more sadistic version, who enjoys the violence he inflicts on others, and you could easily argue is a straight up murderer. Jesse Eisenburg was an absolute miscast in this film, as the geeky version of Superman's arch-nemesis Lex Luthor (or the son, also named Lex Luthor?). He is a tiny, insane, fragile little ball of emotions. They dressed him up to look powerful, but he does not exude power. His character is supposed to be motivated and intelligent, but he comes off as obnoxious and annoying. Nor does he ever explain his motivations behind ANY of his actions. He was, to put it bluntly, terrible. I certainly hope he doesn't return in future films.Overall, it was a bittersweet experience. As a D.C fan I really wanted to like this movie. I wanted to leave the theatre with a sense of excitement and anticipation, but I was left confused and upset at the lack of storytelling from both writer and director. I hope future D.C entries learn from this blunder, and Snyder returns to the level of storytelling in some of his previous films.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Masterpiece modern superheros,"Discussions pertaining to philosophy and theology is a special feature of this movie. It makes you freaking think, about life and everything.

Made for the fans,"After marinating on it for a night, I think I can finally write a review for Batman v Superman. Let me preface by talking about the one major problem I had with the movie, Batman killing. At first this annoyed me because the Batman I grew up with would never directly take a life, but after giving it some thought, I've come to terms with it. Why would criminals who deal in extremes respond to anything less than extreme measures? If Batman kills then the best case scenario for a criminal in his sights is to be hospitalized, and that's scary. Get in his way and you might just lose your life. Anyways enough on that one aspect of one character, let's move on. The acting in the film was superb. Cavill is the definitive Superman. Gadot was exceptional in her limited screen time. Eisenberg's Luther was very much the string pulling, mad scientist who becomes obsessed with Superman, and his long-winded speeches were quite enjoyable. Irons might just be my favorite on-screen Alfred, and while I've covered an aspect of Batman, Affleck's portrayal overall was phenomenal. There are other fantastic performances from the rest of the supporting cast, but I'll suffice to say that all performances range from good to fantastic. The acting was not the only highlight of the film though. Arguably the two greatest elements in the film are the cinematography and the score. The score was exactly what you'd expect from a collaboration between Hans Zimmer (The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Lion King, Interstellar) and JunkieXL (Mad Max: Fury Road): epic. It was operatic, emotional, and bombastic. Every piece of music has become an instant favorite of mine, and this is the only soundtrack that I can and have listened to all the way through multiple times. The cinematography in the film is equally as beautiful. Every shot from the cold opening (now my new favorite from any film) to the Trinity preparing for battle was a work of art. Many of the shots were ripped straight from the comics, and the fight sequences will go down as some of the greatest ever brought to the silver screen. Now it may seem like I don't have any negatives, but I do have a gripe. That gripe would be the editing. Some of the choices just felt a bit strange. For example, a scene might cut away abruptly, one might be where it probably shouldn't, and there was at least one instance where it felt a scene was missing. However due to the fact that a director's cut has already been announced and that Snyder's director's cuts are very good, I'm sure most of these issues will be fixed. For now though, they are flaws. Now onto the writing. Overall the writing was solid. The dialogue felt crisp and you can definitely tell that Terrio reworked a lot of it for the better when he took over. A surprising amount of humor was present (though it never felt out of place like many Marvel films) and it worked quite well. I can't remember a single joke that didn't land. Another huge positive was that many lines were straight from The Dark Knight Returns. I couldn't help but mouth those lines (with a huge smile on my face) with the movie every time one was used. Another element of the movie that borrowed from the comics was the plot. Two comics to be precise: The Dark Knight Returns and another equally famous story. For the sake of limiting the spoilers in this review I won't mention the second. The movie balances both of these stories well and the transition to the second, while bashed by many critics, I thought was done well. Ultimately the movie spends most of the first half building up to the climax of both of these stories, and then letting both play out one after the other in one epic third act. The build up and philosophical speeches of the first half may be too slow for some, and the massively epic conclusion might be too bombastic for others, but ultimately it worked out perfectly for me. I'm probably a bit biased in my opinion on this film, but that's because of how important it has been to me. It isn't just the first ever film featuring my two favorite characters, or the first film to feature the Trinity. It was announced back in my Freshman year of high school, and I've been following it ever since. It was delayed multiple times, had many strange casting decisions, and many thought it would never come out. Now that it has, I couldn't be happier with it. Ultimately though, I'd highly recommend that everyone sees this film. The critics might not like it, but those are also the same people who gave Sharknado almost a 90%.

Another good day for the glaziers of Metropolis and Gotham.,"I went into the hugely hyped ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" with VERY low expectations, but came out with those expectations mildly exceeded.The film picks up at the finale of ""Man of Steel"" with the glass-shattering fight between Kal-El and General Zod in Metropolis. Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) clearly has a branch in Metropolis (never explained) and is caught up in the carnage at a very personal level, setting up a grudge with Superman that is set to fester for 2 years. Also with a grudge (there was apparently only these two connected individuals!) is security guard Wallace Keefe (Scoot McNairy) who ends up legless after the attack.Whilst most of the world still see Superman as a hero, there is growing discontent that he has great power without political accountability. Looking at this issue is US Senator Finch (Holly Hunter) with her committee and stirring the pot is 'one-bat-short-of-a-roost' industrial giant Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg). Meanwhile back in Gotham, Bruce Wayne is continuing his grudge campaign against the bad guys of the Gotham docks area, ably supported by his trusted manservant (here played by Jeremy Irons). Meanwhile (meanwhile) a mysterious and beautiful brunette (Gal Gadot) appears on the scene and pays a particular interest in Wayne and Luthor's business.Phew! As you might conclude from this 'brief' introduction to the plot, there a several films shoehorned into this two and a quarter hours. Unfortunately, this is its downfall in that the story is an incoherent mess. As a viewer you are constantly grasping for the motivation for the characters doing what they are doing: surely in the next scene it will all become clear? But all too often you are left grasping at air!This malaise can be demonstrated with a couple of examples: - the only rationale for Lex Luthor's story arc is that he is either a) 100% certifiable or b) omnipotent in knowing the events of future films before they have been made! - a dramatic change of heart by a lead character happens so quickly - and irrationally - that there may indeed by hope for the Middle East conflict! (For a comedic sketch on this topic see the full review at bob-the-movie-man.com!)Frustratingly, amongst the ludicrously convoluted story (by Chris Terrio (""Argo"") and David Goyer (""Man of Steel"", ""The Dark Knight"")) there is a good film struggling to get out. The cinematography by Larry Wong (""Super 8"") oozes quality and some of the individual scenes in the film are beautifully crafted. Some top moments:The death of the elder Wayne's (again!!);Wonder Woman's dramatic arrival (with a great musical motif by - presumably - Hans Zimmer)Each of Jeremy Iron's well-crafted lines.Also impressive is Ben Affleck's Batman - after all the fan-boy brouhaha at his announcement, he is really convincing in the role.But with $250 million of budget (TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY!) you can afford to craft beautiful moments. It's not enough and director Zack Snyder really should have done better. Just to put that into perspective, you could make over 16 ""Ex Machina's"" for that!!Given the volume of special effects, you can see where much of that money has been spent. It's never a good sign where each of multiple SF company's staff in the end credits need to be titled alphabetically. While the over-heavy CGI is very well done, we've seen it all so many times before, and that's just tiresome. (There must have been dozens of staff assigned to filming the bath scene with Amy Adams, which at first sight seems to manage to show absolutely nothing but will no doubt give hours of fun to fan-boys with their Bluray pause button in future months!)In summary, a blockbuster that was more enjoyable than I expected it to be, but still not a film that is going to trouble my top 10 of the year.(By the way, to save yourself 10 minutes of your life - and whilst in all expectation you would expect there to be something relating to 'Justice League' films - there is no post-credit scene in this film).(Please visit bob-the-movie-man for the graphical version of this review.

Disappointment of epic proportions,"I really wanted to enjoy it, I sincerely did, but the truth is that Batman v Superman was a monumental disappointment. Admittedly I was expecting something along the lines of Frank Miller's seminal graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and boy was I wrong.The film was literally a series of pointless explosions, maudlin navel gazing, bizarre dream sequences and the single most annoying super villain in the form of a manic and runty Lex Luthor, embarrassingly overacted by Jesse Eisenberg. I'm surprised that the two lead superheroes didn't just put aside their so-called differences and simply joined forces to beat the crap out of that whiny little turd.However, on the plus side, Ben Affleck did a good job of portraying the Bat. Built like a brick out-house and sporting a really menacing voice, Affleck's Batman was a dark and menacing figure. Well played. Henry Cavill is a beautiful man. Enough said, he does look quite perfect as the Kryptonian. Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonderwoman is also a stunning and enigmatic character, which left me wanting to see more of her.A measly 5 stars. This film is barely passable which keeps me wondering why DC simply can't get their superhero films right (other than Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy). Damn shame.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Ben Affleck is the best batman ever!!!Treat for comic books fan,"To be honest I really cant understand why people are bashing this movie.For people who have been reading and watching DC comics and animations since childhood this a treat to watch! Entire cinema hall was clapping and enjoying the movie to the core.People who like Man of Steel they are going to love this one. First half requires a lot of patience to understand the nitty-gritty but ultimately everything falls into place.It is a serious,dark and poignant piece of cinema. Don't go for it if you are expecting any kind of kiddish Marvel's type of humour or any humour at all.It easily outshines Avengers for me.Second half is WOW.Visuals are breathtaking. Only thing that could have been better was Lex's role. Overall you need to see it to believe it !!! Go for it...It will easily top 1.5billion $ globally.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ignore the critics,"Batman has always been mu favourite superhero so i was excited for this movie. I read many reviews, mostly bad, and my hopes were shot a little. I did not like Man of steel that much, I've always loved marvel movies, but this movie was really good. Although there are many stories, i think Snyder does a good job balancing them to get the audience to care about both aides.PROS: Great action scenes, with one of the best batman scenes ever Balanced many stories Luther was full blown crazy (reminded me of a joker) and was very well done Soundtrack was great Acting was greatCons: Too many stories, i would have liked to dig deeper into the characters Wonder woman was great, but she should have had a stand alone first Still had man of steel destruction, superman should know better Cameos of flash, cyborg and aquaman felt rushed and un neededOverall, great action movie with great acting. Story was rushed with so many characters, but overall i really enjoyed the movie and no way it should be taking so much heat....they need to stop comparing DC to marvel, marvel has a decade start, they feel different and i like thatWatch it, it was great...not perfect, but not as bad as the critics are saying",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Batman v Superman is a mess...but an enjoyable one.,"Batman v Superman is perhaps the perfect microcosm of both Zack Snyder as a director and also the Warner Bros. vision for Superhero movies as a whole. The movie itself is a glorious mess. The pacing is all over the place, lagging for large portions of the movie, to a degree that threatens to lull the audience to sleep, and then suddenly ramping up to a speed that moves too fast for the plot in many places. There is little to no narrative flow as this movie more or less strings along unrelated scenes, end-to-end, which takes an already murky plot and throws it into near-indecipherable territory. This seems to be the biggest point of consternation for critics and is honestly a decent reason for Warner Bros. to consider asking Zack Snyder to take a step back from the director's chair, as these are all career-long vices of his (Watchmen, Man of Steel being past evidence of this).And yet, despite all those fundamental mistakes, there's a lot to like here. Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot both proved to near perfect castings, despite early internet outrage directed toward both. If there's one major take away from this movie, it's that both character's solo movies in the DCEU have the ground work in place to be outstanding. Both Jeremy Irons and Laurence Fishburne were great too and hopefully as the DC Universe unfolds, we get even more of these ancillary characters. Also, as has become standard fare for Zack Snyder films, the film is beautiful. For everything he lacks as a story teller, the dude does some absolute magic with camera work.Condensed down into the most generalized version, this film is being crucified to an unnecessary degree. Sure, the film whiffs on many fundamental check lists but at the same time, the good largely outweighs the bad. It's by no means perfect (particularly if you're not the type to jump out of your seat at tiny little easter eggs embedded specifically to tease Justice League). That being said, there's enough here to not only watch this movie, but also be optimistic about DC's cinematic universe going forward.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not much better than FANTASTIC 4,"At least Fantastic 4 had me interested the entire movie, even though there was little to no action/fighting scenes. I kept dozing off the first 60-75 minutes of this Superman vs Batman movie. Then tease me with things at the end? I don't see how people can be so quick to over- analyze and criticize a sub par Fantastic 4 movie, but then turn around and praise a sub par Superman movie. The new Lex is TERRIBLE. The new Batman is even worse. That big head not clean shaven look is TERRIBLE. I mean, you can't even clean up for a white tie event? It did not at all correlate with past or present. His frickin head and chin is so big, the metal bat helmet looked like someone tried to stuff two heads into the helmet. The characters are a HUGE downgrade.

What a disappointment and missed opportunity,"Take out the only actual real fight sequence (which you pretty much saw most of via the trailers), whats left is a narration of two so-so written stories about who Batman is how he came about and then what happened to public opinion on Superman after his Zod fight in Man of Steel and the viewpoint of Batman on all of this. Quite frankly this was barely a movie in its own right, and more of extended piece of glue that is an attempt to gluing together Man Of Steel and the forthcoming Justice League. But even if that is all you expect from this movie and nothing more, it is still a mediocre 7 or very generous 8.

Thank You Foolish Critics!!!...,"...Because of so many of you and your horrible reviews I went into BvS with extremely low expectations. Instead, I was pleasantly rewarded with quite possibly the best Superhero movie I've seen and perhaps one of my favorite movies...period! As some of you reading this may have already noticed, BvS has not received rave reviews. Matter of fact, most of the so-called critics are trashing this movie; however, after the movie was finished, myself and everyone sitting around me were left asking: ""Why?"" We were all freaking out and pumped from the DC Trinity extravaganza we all just witnessed.BvS was a glorious experience that had not only myself, but everyone (I noticed) around me completely enthralled and joyously entertained! I was giddy as a schoolgirl with excitement, particularly because this Superman fanboy not only loved me some Man of Steel, but was absolutely floored by the Batfleck...like that bad guy that was face-planted by Bats in the movie...you know the one. Yes, Mr. Affleck's masterpiece portrayal of the Dark Knight is by far the best Batman ever!...sorry Mr. Bale, but it ain't even close.This is The Batman I loved from the comics! This is The Batman I loved from Batman: The Animated Series! This is the Batman that is the genius tactician that you could believe is finally capable of living up to the moniker of World's Greatest Detective! In addition, Wonder Woman kicks some serious ass and her appearance definitely received the biggest applause of the movie.I could go into more detail about what makes this movie great for me, I could go on and on and give you an overly analytical rant as to why I feel the way I do about this film, but let's face it, who am I to suggest what you may like?...which is the same reason why you shouldn't put to much weight in the critics' reviews either.Is the movie perfect in every way? Perhaps not. The best advice I can give in regards to BvS, is that if you are not already a fan of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, DC Comics or the superhero genre, you may not like the film (or perhaps become a fan yourself). However, if you are already a fan of those things I mentioned, then the movie is definitely worth the price of admission! And furthermore, even though I had already seen all of the trailers, I was still given enough to chew on in this film to feel like I hadn't already seen it all.Go see this movie with an open mind and remember that it's a piece to a bigger puzzle rather than a standalone movie. If you do that, then hopefully your experience, like mine, will be a BLAST! BvS is everything an action blockbuster of this type should be: being thoroughly entertained to the point where you and complete strangers around you in the theater, can't help but cheer and celebrate together at what you just saw on screen!I know I'll be going to see it a couple more times before it leaves the theater!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Dawn? No, *end*","America is trying to figure out how it feels about the two capes, they will have a fight, and this is entirely too convoluted, slow and... full of bafflingly poor decisions for their reasons for doing so to make sense, for it to be all that good, and for us to care when it does happen... even though this is, indeed, purely created for the purpose of that showdown. And this is two hours and 25 minutes, not counting the credits that you will not be rewarded for sitting through.Both of them are well-cast, acted impeccably, far too similar to one another, barely distinguished from their normal persona, strangely motivated and hardly seen doing their thing. Affleck really does sell it. It's not his fault that this Batman ends up clearly unstable, with us more eager to see him given help than fighting crime. This makes no case why we need more of the Dark Knight, in spite of how much of this version actually works. Cavill continues to be spot-on. Eisenberg's Luthor, twisted, manipulative, at times charming, fiercely intelligent, is the most compelling aspect about this. He's also one of the only ones that work. The little action is solid. Most of the climax is great.The 9/11 porn is back for no good reason, with Katrina and a failed space launch added in to add to the cheap and tasteless. The immaturity is never as obvious and unchecked as when a literal jar of urine is presented as tea. And what happens immediately after is just ugly. The story is all over the place, with the structure, approach to themes and lack of humanity as bad as Man of Steel. I can hardly imagine this won't kill the DCU, and as shoddily handled as the push for it has been throughout, it was nevertheless something I, and countless others, hoped would show the strength of the comics it drew material from, not to mention the dedication and love it has seen put into it.There is a ton of graphic violence pushing the PG-13 rating, disturbing content and some uncomfortable glorification of hyper-masculinity in this. I recommend this only to those who enjoy the much-referenced train-wreck. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Why laugh at one super hero when you can laugh at two?,"Combine a muddled story, cheesy acting, gratuitous special effects, canned violence, and an inept script, and what you have is this movie. Unintended laughter abounds as the Bat and the Man of Steel square off for reasons that only a Hollywood script writer testing the limits of credulity could concoct. Replete with numerous defects, which, among its many flaws, includes a massive and transparent rip off of the conclusion of the King Kong story (albeit with unintended amusing results), the movie struggles to try to pass itself off as serious entertainment. Yet the story is so goofy that after a while it can't help but provoke laughter. That Ben Affleck is able to deliver his lines without breaking into laughter is alone worthy of accolades to his power of self-control. As the movie goes on, and it's a long movie, one soon wishes that Adam West would enter to inject at least a small modicum of class into this messy production. Jesse Eisenberg plays Lex Luthor in one of Hollywood's more egregious, albeit hilarious, examples of miscasting. Yet, the star of the show is Henry Cavil whose cheesy, leaden performance as Superman borders on the ridiculous. Whenever Superman enters the scene it is sure signal that something inane will soon follow. In the middle of the fight scene, for instance, both heroes discover that both of their mothers are named Martha. Why this bit of trite is important to the story will not be revealed here. However, this revelation marks the height of drama achieved by this movie. What makes this movie especially noteworthy, however, is how it succeeds in reducing not one but two American comic book icons from heroes to buffoons and achieves this with little effort. Now THAT is an accomplishment. Why laugh only at one super hero when you can laugh at two? Of the two, the one who is more inane is Batman. Without Alfred, there can be no Batman. Superman at least has an excuse - he's not human, so we really can't expect that much from him. If you are expecting a serious drama involving two troubled super heroes, then you will be sorely disappointed. But if you like poorly made movies with quirky lines, stagy acting and cartoon-like special effects, then this production will prove immensely satisfying.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Yes this movie is dark but it tells us the really struggle of our favourite heroes, it brokes them but in time they become what they known for. Superman arc was basically Joseph Campbell's hero's journey, Batman was tortured to his core but eventually he found the hope.

The long wait is over,"Films rarely get bigger then Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, seeing two titans of the comic facing off against each other for the first time on the big screen. Despite it weak critical reception Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice has proved to be box office success, making $468.6 Million in its opening weekend, shattering a record. But is it deserving of its box-office or the critical reception.Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is set two years after the events of Man of Steel. Superman (Henry Cavill) has divided opinion, some see him as a saviour, others a threat. The US Senate are running an investigation into Superman and his actions around the world. Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) saw the destruction of Metropolis and prepares to face the Last Son of Krypton while also investigating a human trafficker in Gotham. But as Superman and Batman prepare for battle the industrialist Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) is coming up with his own sinister plans, gaining access to General Zod's Earth Engines and Zod's body to achieve this.Batman v Superman is a very problematic film, it's writing is all over the place, director Zack Snyder believed that being dark is being violent and Warner Brothers are rushing to set up their own explained universe so they can catch up to Marvel. But the film is not without fun - Batman v Superman much more like a Zack Snyder film, he is not trying so much to emulate the realistic style and look of the Christopher Nolan Batman series. The Man of Steel sequel felt more like Snyder's adaption of Watchmen, showing the wider impact of a man with the powers of a god descending upon Earth, resulting in shifts in society and politics. This is when the film is at its most interesting. It's not like this material has been untouched by superhero films, the MCU and X-Men films have looked at similar issues, yet Batman v Superman does it well, even if Senate Committees are not exactly the most thrilling thing to watch but it does set out a world that has changed. There is a mix of people being in awe at Superman and others in revulsion.When Ben Affleck was cast as Bruce Wayne/Batman it was met with distain because of his role in Daredevil 13 years prior. Following Christian Bale was a tough act to follow but Affleck was able to pull it off. He had the physique for the role, being in great shape and he brought a darkness to the role. His Bruce Wayne was an older than previous incantations and an even more lonely figure, yet still willing to fight and as Bruce investigate, being perfectly suave. He is also more violent and sadistic then previous Batmans, which is disloyal to the character, but that is the fault of the writing, not Affleck. Affleck did prove the doubters wrong. He was the more interesting hero out of the duo, sidelining the Man of Steel.Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor was the other major addition and he is without a doubt the worst portrayal of the character ever. He was just a hype brat that had no menace to him. All he did was speak quickly and asked like he was child on sugar rush. Eisenberg was just unbearable.Gal Gadot as Diane Prince, AKA Wonder Woman was also someone that fans were keen to see, being the first cinematic iteration of the most famous female superhero. Gadot role as Wonder Woman was really just a teaser but she did well in the action scenes and it does whet the appetite for her first solo film.The writing is where the film suffers greatly. There were reports that the screenplay was troubled and Argo writer Chris Terrio was brought in to do re-writes. When the film starts it tries to set up numerous plot threads that it is surprisingly difficult to keep track. The film throws in too many characters investigating too many things when a more straight forward approach would have worked. The writers were mandated to set up the upcoming DC Cinematic Universe so had to throw in references to other characters for the Justice League film. The dream sequences could easily have been cut, even if the post-apocalyptic Batman fight was one of the best action sequences in the film, feeling like an action scene from Watchmen or Sucker Punch.Snyder's long time cinematographer Larry Fong works on Batman v Superman, replacing Amir Mokri from Man of Steel. And Fong's inclusion lead to a huge improvement to the action - Man of Steel suffered from having too much shaky cam and sudden zooms that made it hard to follow what was going on at times. The action in Batman v Superman was much more fluid, from when Batman goes into action to Superman's first proper appearance. When Batman was in action it felt very similar to the fight scenes in Watchmen.Also Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL do deliver with the music, just like they did with Man of Steel. There are some beautiful tracks in the film. Zimmer said recently that Batman v Superman would be his last superhero score and he at least goes out with a good one. It would be great to see what Junkie XL can on his own, seeing he has done good work on 300: Rise of an Empire and Mad Max: Fury Road.Batman vs Superman is nowhere near as bad as the critical response has suggested it is. It does deliver on action and builds on the foundations that Man of Steel set out. It was a tough to try and set up the DCEU and all its characters in one film and a few lighter moments wouldn't have gone a miss - even The Dark Knight Trilogy had occasional jokes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Ben affleck is good as Bruce and Batman both, I am not comparing with him Christian Bale Batman as both of them played a different version of Batman and different age of Batman. So Ben gets 8 or 9 . The story is good.Now the Bad part, Direction and Edition is bad. I mean scenes could have better interlinked. The first part was dragging on with no sense of what is happening ,feels as if the scenes were put randomly.It just seems to drag on and on. Superman was also not good, I am sure Henry Cavil is a better actor than this, the portrayal of Superman should be like the Justice League animated Superman.Lex luthor portrayal was disaster , I just hated his scene and dialogue delivery.Conclusion:If you are a superfan like me, you will watch it anyways and will love the last half an hour.

"It's not perfect, but what is?","The first set of reviews that came out for Dawn of Justice (I'm refusing to call it Batman v Superman, cause it's anything but a versus movie, that title may as well be click-bait) were extremely positive, some calling it the greatest superhero movie ever made and ""the bar"" that every other superhero movie will be judged on. Then pretty much every major critic in the world... slated it.I went to see it at midnight after reading both sets of reviews not sure what to expect and to be honest, I was satisfied. Granted, it isn't an amazing film and you can sort of see where the critics are coming from in certain aspects, but it's by no means a bad film.We got some things we didn't need (ANOTHER Batman origin story and about 7 dream sequences too many) but I was happy with what I'd seen walking out. Ben Affleck was amazing as both Bruce Wayne and Batman, Jesse Eisenberg gave a fun and unpredictable portrayal of Lex Luthor, Jeremy Irons was brilliant as Alfred, and the rest of the cast (Cavill as Superman, Adams as Lois Lane, Gadot as Wonder Woman to name the highlights) all got at least a B- in my book.The score was fine, not Zimmer's best work, but Junkie XL's inclusion seemed to slow him down slightly. Zack Snyder will (to some degree) deservedly get some stick for this movie, but at the same time there are many amazing shots in Dawn of Justice and whilst he's no Christopher Nolan, I didn't think he did too bad of a job. There's a lot of plot to follow and it can get hard at times to do so, but for every bad point this movie has, there's an equally good point to balance it out on the scale of determining whether this is a good or bad movie.Advice to people about to go watch the movie: Don't let the reviews influence your opinion. Go into it with your own expectations and make of it what you will. If you dislike it, fair enough, but don't just dislike it to be part of the ""Let's all hate Dawn of Justice"" bandwagon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A TRUE SUPERHERO MOVIE,"Loving this movie is undeniable, I thank not only Snyder, but also Goyer and the other artists involved, this movie perfectly portrays how Superman, despite adversity and even rejection, is able to give his life for those who cannot defend themselves. , showing us a Batman submerged in the deepest darkness, recovering the faith he once lost, and a Wonder Woman being the toughest warrior princess in history, as well as being the letter of presentation of Apokolips.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Son of Krypton vs. Bat of Gotham!,The biggest Gladiator fight comes to life! To understand the storyline in this movie you would have to watch Man of Steel. Overall I loved this movie from beginning to end. I actually found it hard to believe that many were disappointed. Ben Affleck was a better choice for Batman than what I actually thought. Also this movie paved a path for Wonder Woman and the Justice League. Once you understand the story you would appreciate this movie.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perfect Superman portrayal.,"What makes this movie so good in my opinion is that you see the consequences of two gods fighting and destroying cities. That's a thing that marvel never does. I also like how Batman is portrayed, he's an old, dark Batman and has been Batman for 20 years. I think that is the thing that people that dislike the movie don't get. Superman just became Superman and Batman has been Batman for 20 years. Great movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the worst films I have ever seen and I am a huge Batman fan,"Let me start with some background. I am a Graphic Novel and Comic reader and have been for over 35 years. I am not a fan boy of the likes of ""the comics are always right"" I had seen bad reviews from the critics of this film but I went to the cinema with an open mind and I really wanted to like this movie.Unfortunately I was more disappointed than I thought I ever could be from a film. The first third of the film is just boring. Then some of the action starts and it is all shaky in your face camera so you cant see what is going on.Batman vs Superman part is lame short and stupid and through out the hours of dullness that this film runs for it was disappointing that the third hero hardly gets any on screen time.Overall a poor poor movie, with a messy plot, badly scripted heroes and awful acting by the main villain, terrible action sequences.I would strongly recommend everyone skips seeing this movie so Hollywood realises people will not put up with this sort of rubbish.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitely a big surprise for me,"Every once in a while a film comes along that I very much disagree with the majority of critics on. Last year it was Ryan Gosling's much-maligned directorial debut Lost River. This year, I guess it's Batman v Superman.I remember watching the trailer months before the film came out and thinking it looked like, well, not good. Then it came out and it was mostly blasted. Yet I still had interest in it. I still expected a completely bloated, overwhelming, extremely messy and awkward film that had glimpses of quality. Instead, I saw a good superhero film through and through. Yes, it had some stretches of being too busy for its own good, but it was nowhere near the mess I expected it to be. It reminded me of The Dark Knight Rises and The Dark Knight in many ways. Perhaps it does focus too much on CGI in its last hour (and perhaps some of the turns in the story, particularly between Batman and Superman in that last hour, are a bit too sudden) but it has that same driving force and energy and the same sprawling ambition. I can sometimes like Marvel films, but my biggest problem with them is that they always play everything for comedy and end up playing it way too safe. This is an example of a superhero film that goes a bit further than that and really raises the stakes. Even Jesse Eisenberg was a surprise. From what I had heard, I expected an incredibly cartoonish, over-the-top, embarrassing performance. Compared to what I had read and heard, he was pretty subdued.I never saw Man of Steel but luckily did some research before watching it so I wasn't lost much. However, I do think Henry Cavill limits how great a character Clark Kent could be. He has the look (oh boy does he) but compared to his other cast members, he's probably one of the weakest links. Still, doesn't drag it down significantly or anything.I did see the Ultimate Cut, so perhaps that's a reason... but I just didn't see the mess that reviews made me believe I would. Then again I'm a fan of Watchmen, so who knows. But this is definitely the biggest surprise of the year so far for me. I don't see how it's inferior to Civil War. In terms of some messiness, sure, but wow.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An endlessly rewatchable epic,"This extended cut is truly the only way to watch this film and it's a crime so many only saw the chopped up version. The Ultimate Edition restores many crucial plot elements, cut scenes and story arcs, as well as connective tissues between scenes.The movie itself I've seen countless times since home release in 2016 and it still holds up so well. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition is a true action drama and stands apart from the Marvel fare of the time which was (and mostly still is) a series of action comedies.The characters may differ from what many expected them to be , but that doesn't impact how perfect Henry Cavill, Ben Affleck, Jesse Eisenberg, and the rest of the cast were in this film.If you haven't seen it or if you've only seen the 2 hour 30 minute theatrical cut, do yourself a favor and watch this film with an open mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very convincing for DC fans. Might be confusing for non-DC fans.,"""Batman V Superman : Dawn Of Justice"" is a movie we have been waiting for since 3 years and has been the most anticipated movie for me. Seeing the huge criticism this movie is receiving and the dividing opinion of the moviegoers whether you love it or hate it , compelled me to write this review. This movie was disappointing for me. It has some really cool moments and will never make you feel bored. But I have to acknowledge the fact that there are some really understandable flaws in this movie. Lets talk about the good first.> The opening shot. I'm not talking about the opening credits (which was great too and shot really well). I'm talking about the scenes in which the events of Man of Steel are seen from the eyes of Bruce Wayne. It adds a lot to his character. You understand what he's feeling. Overall great scene which kept me on this movie.> Ben Affleck killed it as batman. He was great as the more experienced Batman and was definitely the highlight of this movie. His story arch and motivation was clear. Although I don't really hate the fact that this Batman, in fact KILLS people, the fact that this movie doesn't acknowledge this, frustrated me. Just when you see that Batman has exploded a car and the people in are obviously gonna die , they cut the shot to another one. If you had to make Batman kill people at least acknowledge it. Still , looking forward to his future movies.> Henry Cavill as Superman. Although we already have seen him in MoS as Superman and we know his role in the movie, he doesn't get m much screen time or importance compared to Batman , when he should obviously get more role and motivation for his character , because in fact this is BvS movie! Cavill though, plays his part efficiently and is a great Superman for me.> Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman was great and though she doesn't get much screen time , has a great impact on this movie. Her fight scenes are great. Her conversations with Bruce Wayne was interesting. Looking forward to her solo movie.> The score by Hans Zimmer is great as always and really added to this movie.> The action. I loved the action scenes in MoS and it is even better in BvS. I was on the edge of my seats during the BvS fight as well as the final fight and the CGI and the choreography is just magnificent and gives a lot of bad-ass moments. Lot of one-liners in this movie too which is also good.> Zack Snyder's themes in this movie. I personally don't have a problem with the dark and gritty feel of the movie unlike other people. The 1st half is more focused on a political aspect on whether Superman should be there on not. I think this was well done although it was scrambled by other mini sub plots. Some scenes (like the Court scene when Supes testifies) were the standouts of this half for me.> The cameos was really cool (especially the Flash one earlier in the movie) but could've been a lot lot better made. Wonder woman reads an email about them? Really? Could'nt have thought something better?Now to the problems> Messy. The plot is messy. You really think about it you can just find plot holes everywhere. Lex's motivation is unclear. Some scenes are just pointless and confusing. Just that when you watch these scenes,I personally thought a lot of ways where that particular scene could've been done better and much convincing.> The focus is completely off the Batman V Superman fight. It felt very rushed and will leave you doubtful. The story had many other subplots of which no one really cared and just crumbles this into this movie. It would've been better if they named the movie ""Dawn Of Justice"" instead of Batman V Superman.> The trailers reveal a lot. Almost all the cool moments in this movie has been revealed in this trailer. I would've been a lot lot satisfied for this movie if they didn't reveal Doomsday or the Batman fight scene. A movie is'int much fun when you know how the movie ends.> Lot of unanswered questions. I don't really know if they'll get to the answers in the future movie but there are a lot of unanswered or maybe plot holes in this movie.The movie is definitely worth your money and should be watched in a theater , but I just hoped it would have been a lot better. I understand why critics are angry but I really think it is a lot. It isn't bad by any means. It's not perfect but its great. Only problem, it could've been much much greater.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unacceptable,"Man of steel was far better than this. Dawn of justice is just ridiculous. The plot could have been a lot more intriguing and less predictable. While the 2 main actors seem to be a very good choice, Jesse Eisenberg is definitely not adequate for Lex Luthor. Too young and inadequate. Apart the several errors which every good fan will easily spot (one above all: batman using fire weapons twice), the plot is the main problem here. Why are batman & superman fighting against each other? For a very futile and avoidable reason. The role of wonder woman is almost absent and pointless, a beautiful woman that is basically there just to show off, she maybe speaks 3 or 4 times in the whole movie. The final battle is awful and a complete waste of special effects and precious movie-time which could have been used in a much more efficient way.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Overall worth it.,"I went to the cinema expecting the same senseless material battle as in man of steel. But the movie impressed me in its proportionate simplicity. Since the first scene my focus was on the atmosphere, which managed to maintain itself throughout the entire movie. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time. And this comes from a DC-skeptic. The soundtrack was great and the fan-service very startling indeed. Ben Affleck surprised me as well. Even though I can't agree with Bane on some terms, he did an overall impressive job portraying the dark hero.Aspects I didn't enjoy were the length of the movie and the permanent damsel in distress aka.

The studio is trying make their own avenger movie without building a good foundation.

It was quite messy in regards to the way the scenes were ordered and at times downright confusing. The acting on both Henry Cavill's and Ben Affleck's part made up for the lack of story filling.The movie definitely did a great job in filling in blanks in both Superhero's lives.Overall, I say the movie is well worth the watch.

It's pretty good but it could have been a lot better.,"I am trying not to be bias, as I am a pretty big DC fan. The film had many good things in it like bafleck and the cinematography and the score worked really well also I liked the way they set up the justice league the action was also pretty cool. There was somethings that didn't work for me like Superman's motivation to fight batman and the the plot did drone on a bit after the opening sequence and it felt a bit out of place and confusing. I would recommend you to go watch the film it's worth the watch in not great but its OK. I think critics are going a bit over the top with there reviews. The film isn't great but I find myself to be exited for the future of DC but I would like Snyder to step down as director and get a better director to do it as I feel if the justice league is received like this than we will loose out on such a great universe that is beginning to form.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best Comic Book Movie out,Man this movie is great. Watch Man Of Steel first. This is a sequel to that movie but it also a DC world building movie. It touches on the importance of characters like Lois Lane and General Swanwick. Lex Luthor pinning the U. S. government against Superman and Batman against Superman as well. Showing off Luthor's prowess and using KGBeast as his muscle. Featuring one of the best performances of an on screen Batman by Ben Affleck and the ultimate performance of Superman on screen in over 40 decades. The movie deserves the appreciation. It must be watched after Man Of Steel and followed up with Zack Snyder's Justice League. These movies make me cry from the emotion it's stirs up as well as the cinematic beauty these characters are shown in. It's a comic book come to life into a movie in a A++ way.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bleak and miserable,"You can have Superman and Batman in the same shared universe. Stylistically they're at the opposite ends of the spectrum, but they can coexist and you can even have them sharing a story. But the thing is that they're still at the opposite ends. Batman is dark and brooding, his stories filled with corruption, fallibility of man and the inevitable doom that looms over every victory. Where as Superman is all about nobility, rising above mortal failings, hope and potential. Which is why you cannot have a decent Superman story told as a Batman story with a sloppy paint job applied!But, even with that, I could live. Henry Cavill is a decent actor and this movie franchise has some seriously talented people working behind the scenes. But unfortunately DC is in too much of a hurry to get its own cinematic universe off the ground and thus this movie is filled to the brim with subplots, foreshadowing scenes and characters beyond counting. It's bad enough that we get the Batman versus Superman plot, but we also have to cram in the ramifications of Man of Steel, Batman's introduction, Wonder Woman's introduction, Lex Luther's introduction and concurrent evil scheme, and finally the final woe, who I shall not spoil here. Any two of these elements would have been enough for a movie. Put all them in a single movie and it's a mess. There's very little rhyme or reason behind the various elements and they don't come together in a graceful manner. Wonder Woman feels especially out of place here, which is a shame because Gal Gadot is surprisingly believable as the Amazonian warrior princess. The complete opposite of Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, in fact. Who though this was good casting? The man couldn't pull off suavely menacing if his life depended on it.Sure, there are good things as well. Ben Affleck pulls off both Bruce Wayne and Batman beautifully, the visuals, while too dark and grim, are very impressive, the fight scene between Superman and Batman is excellent and I do applaud the film for trying to address the moral ramifications of having almost limitless power in the hands of a literal outsider.But yeah, it's not a very good film overall. It has good things in it, but the structure is not suitable for showcasing any of them in a favourable light. I hope they slow down, take a deep breath and decide that if they are to continue, they need to do it properly.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not a great movie, but better than what most people are saying","With all the bad reviews, I was prepared for the absolute worse. But guess what? The critics got it so wrong.This was not a great movie. It was a good movie, well put together and pretty well written. If you go into it with preconceived ideas of how bad DC is doing their movies (and I had some of those) and compare them to Marvel's amazing cinematic universe, then you can easily be disappointed in what is going on this movie. But if you take this for what it is and actually WATCH what happens, you get a very solid representation of the DC superheroes in a modern context. For example, I heard bitching about Batman using guns and knives, killing people, etc. yet none of what Batman did in this movie was inconsistent with the Batman I know from the comics I've read and other movies. He doesn't ""use guns"" in this movie, he appears to follow the same rules of engagement any police or military would (such as being shot at first before reacting with deadly force) and he goes way out of his way to NOT kill people. Where he legitimately goes off-the-rails is when he brands two criminals with a ""bat brand"" and it is clearly stated during the course of the movie that this is an extreme action he's been engaged in because he's been mentally/emotionally losing it since the incident from the first Superman movie.There were also some complaints about Superman not saving people and acting only in his own best interests, yet it's obvious in the context of the movie that he is doing a whole lot of saving and people are very grateful for him doing so. Just because it happens off camera doesn't mean it's not happening. Meanwhile, the story moves forward that this movie intends to tell, about the conflict of Mankind to accept someone like Superman amongst us and I thought it got pretty real about that. Some critics come down so hard on what Superman was or was not doing, they miss some of the broader questions being raised, such as do we deserve to even have someone like that amongst us? Do we deserve Superman in the first place? Mankind is so petty and quick to judge and hate, should someone like that with such superpowers even bother with us? There's a lot more that could be said on that particular argument but when Superman receives the brunt of the blame because he's not doing what ""we"" think he should be, it kind of proves the argument's premise right there.As for the movie itself, it was entertaining, well made and actually had a lot more thought put into it than I think many viewers are seeing. If you watch this movie closely, there are tons of easter eggs and details throughout that show a lot of planning being done for the DC universe. It's a darker and harder universe than the Marvel universe, but it's got its own sort of legitimacy because they are trying to do something different with their superhero movies. There were some complaints about scenes that didn't make any sense, didn't belong in the movie, etc. I think those complaints were just plain wrong and made by people who just aren't following what is going on. This movie does require that you think about what is happening or you could get lost. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. If you are the kind of person who needs everything spelled out for them in exposition, then this movie probably isn't for you.Just to say it plain and straight, Wonder Woman is awesome in this movie. Very powerful - like Superman powerful - and there is so much back story and earlier shenanigans she gets up to - tons of foreshadowing that definitely have me very interested in seeing the Wonder Woman movie when it comes out. And as for strong female characters - if she hadn't shown up than certain bad-ass male superheroes would have had their asses handed to them badly and things would have gone into extinction level for Mankind as a whole. So I think they are doing Wonder Woman right in this one.All of the production values are top-of-the-line, the actors do great and I had no problem with the direction. The ONLY exception - and this is a big one - is Lex Luthor. Jesse Eisenberg is channeling a sort of Mark Zuckerberg/Joker hybrid in this movie, not Lex Luthor. This was basically a total waste. I felt these were the only places where the script was not well thought out and disappointed. Luthor's plans were evident by the end as having influenced everything that happened during the course of the movie, and that played to his supposed genius, but his on-screen moments were just...weird. I thought they could have done a LOT better.So, if you are willing to not listen to some of the critical nonsense and give this movie a chance, I think this movie can be very entertaining and interesting and, in its own way, a fun experience. That's my take on it. Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just like a group of fans on acid brainstormed!,"Well, when you're a fan of the genre, no matter how much a movie sucks, you still find it hard to rate below 6. That's my case here. I went to the cinema on the premiere day for the 3D version, psyched about what I was about to see. In the end, I kind had half a smile on my face about it.Wow moments? Lots! Ben Affleck (CGI or not), was pumped! I am on the side of those that think that he was a decent, even more than that, batman. Have seen lots that were worse, I think Affleck is No2 behind Christian Bale. Another wow moment came with Wonder Woman. Nicely casted, gorgeous, almost taken out of a comic book!Other than that, superman was OK, but Jesse Eisenberg was awesome. I mean, this guy can act. From Social Network to Now You See Me, he has been so good! Overall, it seemed like the story was too much and too overloaded with stuff. The story of superman, the story of batman, then Lex Luthos with his plots, the story of Wonder Woman and so many additional things that paved the way for the sequel.It was too much to follow and it kind of broke the action and the storyline in too many fragmented pieces that you could barely follow. The fight in the end was nicely done although it could have been better and more realistic. It was too many explosions here and there and too much noise rather than good old fashioned fighting. Batman was poorly incorporated in it and only Wonder Woman kept her part.Don't go to the movies, wait for the DVD, but on the other hand, rating it below 6 is just mean on my part.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A Great, Misunderstood Superhero Movie","It seems as if I'm caught in another Deadpool situation. While many others really loved this movies others have trashed it and hated it. I ignored both sides and cleared my head before watching this movie. I set my expectations at 0. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece or a piece of crap. I was middle ground and after being burned with a recent rewatch of Man of Steel which really was a jar of Granny Smith's Peaches I didn't know what to expect from this movie. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was really great. I liked it a lot and it had some great moments but a few missteps. It's things that may make or break the film for others but didn't bother me in the long run.First let's start with the good. Ben Affleck as Batman was awesome. I thought I'd always think of Ben Affleck being Ben Affleck in this film but I sincerely believed him as Batman. He was epic, scary, dark, tormented, sassy and many other adjectives. The way they introduced him was excellent. I also didn't mind that he killed people. I could honestly care less about Batman killing people. But enough Batfleck talk, let's talk about the main character himself, Superman. Henry Cavill was great in the film, especially near the middle and the end. He actually portrayed emotion and empathy for humans which was lacking in Man of Steel. Everyone else was great but the 2 performances I got to mention in this review are Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman and Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. They were both great. I don't get why people said Eisenberg was annoying because he did a phenomenal job as Lex Luthor Jr. When I first heard the casting I was skeptical but after finding out he was playing Lex Luthor's son I was okay with him having Eisenberg tendencies throughout the film. He can off as menacing and fun. He isn't as annoying as other people have said he is. Gadot did a great job and had a excellent take on her. I like the cockiness of the character and how awesome she was. It also shouldn't go without saying how great the rest of the cast is. It seems as if Snyder finally brought life to the lifeless characters from Man of Steel because I was so happy with how Fishburne played Perry White and Amy Adams as Lois Lane and especially Jeremy Irons as Alfred. Phenomenonal job from a great cast that never disappoints.But I can't blame Zack Snyder for Man of Steel because I completely blame David S. Goyer's script. It was extremely weak and had some pretty terrible dialogue scenes and poorly written scenarios. It didn't come as a surprise to me when they added Chris Terrio to the screenplay. It seems he took control over all of the screen writing because this movie is written very well. Sadly it seems Goyer did get a crack at how this film should be structured because that's something that fell flat in this film. The story structures its events in a Goyer way where they'll constantly keep moving back and forth, back and forth, back and forth and made the film stagger at points. But it didn't stop from some great scenes in the movie and some awesome dialogue from Affleck and Cavill. Honestly Snyder isn't the problem with the DCCU. The problem is Goyer. If anyone needs to be taken out of this franchise it's Goyer who needs the boot.Snyder's direction is fantastic on this film. He's able to direct these shots that seem to come out of a Malick film. There also seemed to be a lot of Malick influence in the film, especially in the amazing opening. Snyder really knows how to open a film. It's breathtakingly beautiful and was very nice to watch the intense, stylized and different. That's the biggest compliment I can give Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is that it isn't the typical Marvel film. This is a bold and visionary superhero film from DC that goes against the grain like these films should instead of feeling the same.As I've already mentioned the biggest problem with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is its structure. It breaks the flow of the film at points and gets really annoying. Another problem was one shot of CGI at the beginning. It's in an ocean scene and I honestly was stunned that this made the final cut for how shitty it looked. Luckily the CGI improved as the film progressed.Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice gives Superman the redemption needed after Man of Steel and shows us what we wanted as an intro to a larger DC Cinematic Universe. The cast was great, the direction was great, the writing was sloppy at points but was also great, and the fight scenes were amazing. Definitely see this film. It's not for everyone but for someone who loves comics and film in general this was a treat.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

If this movie had come out a few years earlier it probably would have received Better reviews.I enjoyed this movie as I went in with low expectations like I did with Avengers. It is a tough balancing act having some many characters in one movie so you cannot expect perfection. The movie was a mess but there were a lot of great moments in the film as well. I admire Snyder and the writers for being different than Marvel. Snyder was handed a difficult task to try and setup up a new universe in one movie. If you enjoyed Watchmen and Man of Steel you will like this movie.In the end this was a Batman and Superman movie with high expectations.

Mass Destruction happen again like Man of Steel.Directing & Editing : Jack Snyder failed to deliver a good movie. first half too slow and bored u. some scene are there without no plot detail and seems unnecessary. editing is also disappointed.Overall : Finally they gave a movie in which u can see your two favorite hero. Enjoy the epic Fight B/W Superman and Batman. Nothing else.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
brooding,"Metropolis is recovering from the Kryptonian invasion and has a guarded attitude to its new alien protector. Gotham criminals are hunted down by a bat-like vigilante who brands them, a mark that is as good as a death sentence. Batman versus Superman does a decent job of meshing these two characters in a plausible narrative that foregrounds the inner demons both men carry. Affleck's gritty, slightly creaky Batman is a more psychotic, sadistic iteration than Bale's. His drinking is more problematic, even if it is Château Margaux, and his womanising a sordid footnote. Superman is more moral, upstanding, and in a monogamous relationship with Lois Lane. That naivety (he isn't human, after all) makes him fall victim to the machinations of Lex Luthor, Eisenberg at his quirky, irascible best. The film overtly evokes post 9/11 sensibilities and there is a clear motif of Christian iconography threaded through the images. Critics will hate it simply because it is another superhero film in a seemingly endless conveyor belt of them. That's a valid concern, but putting that element aside, this one works with complex characters that do not always get overwhelmed by the CGI, not until the final 20 minutes anyway. You'll have to tolerate some heavy-handed moments as they set up the coming films in the DC Comics/Warner Bros franchise, but these do not intrude too much on a narrative that is intriguing and, despite all the fantasy and machismo on display, all too human. Go with it, and you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"DC has no clue on how to make an action movie. This was suppose to be the answer to the Avengers of Marvel but this is really a bad show. Entire movie you will be waiting for the action. There are no Avenger kind of classical scenes, most of the scenes are in dark, shadows. Wonder woman comes in to the picture in last 10 min or so. I felt like I was watching a documentary and not a superman movie. lot of dragging and ample time for you to check face-book, read whats-app or even you can go out for a popcorn in the middle. It is more of a drama than action. Lot of importance is given to the superman girlfriend. DC is trying to portrait her as even a part of the justice league. There is no clear definition of the roles of the characters. Just one man capturing the mother of superman can make superman do what he wants him to do. Over all it was really a terrible show. Please wait to see it on TV than wasting your money in theater.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Surprisingly, I really liked it","Let me start by saying, unequivocally, I LIKED this film.I know, I'm as surprised as you are.Now, I'm trying to figure out why. Sometimes, when you watch a movie, you catch the mood and internal thinking of the film from the start. In BvS, I understood what was going on during some head scratching moments early on and had a theory as to the reasons behind some of these scenes. That understanding helped me get through the slow, grim first part of this film, I sensed there was a greater whole and it paid off for me later on.The surprise to me is that BATMAN vs SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE is really two movies. There is the first hour and a half - BATMAN vs SUPERMAN and then there is the last hour DAWN OF JUSTICE (League).The 2nd movie is the better of the two.Picking up at the tail end of the grim MAN OF STEEL, BvS shows us the aftermath of that film through the eyes of Bruce Wayne/Batman - and boy is he angry. Ben Affleck ably dons the scowl (of Bruce Wayne) and the cowl (of Batman) and grimly picks up the pieces. Affleck is a good choice for Batman (and future JUSTICE LEAGUE films) as Batman needs to be less of a loner and more of ""team player. Meanwhile, Henry Cavill's Superman (a portrayal of the Man of Steel that I like) is trying to make sense of his new world and his relationship with Lois Lane (a strong Amy Adams).Not coincidentally, this film really picked up upon the arrival of Wonder Woman (a perfectly cast Gal Gadot), she brought an energy that helped lift the last hour of this film. When we finally got Batman, Superman AND Wonder Woman on the screen, I kept thinking ""now THIS is how a Comicbook Superhero should be"".Director Zach Snyder toned down the endless carnage that was overdone in MAN OF STEEL. Don't get me wrong, there is still PLENTY of carnage, but it is only a fraction of what was in MOS. I would have preferred this film to be less dark and moody, but Snyder has a strong vision that he had the nerve to stick with, so ""good for him"".Snyder does benefit from a strong cast. In addition to Affleck, Cavill, Gadot and Adams, BvS also includes stalwarts Lawrence Fishburne (Perry White), Holly Hunter (Senator Finch) and Diane Lane (Martha Kent). The highlight for me was Jeremy Irons' portrayal of Alfred, he was a breathe of fresh air. Only Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor didn't work for me - though I blame the writing more than I blame Eisenberg's performance.Did this movie earn it's 2 1/2 hour run-time? Well...no. I could tell director Snyder where he could trim some time out of the first hour and a half. HOWEVER, to speak out of the other side of my mouth, I'm looking forward to the 3 hour DIRECTOR'S CUT where some scenes that seemed chopped up will be fleshed out.The action in this film works well. The fight scenes are well choreographed and the motivations and actions and goals of the characters during the action scenes were clear. I didn't once wonder why someone was doing something nor did I ever tell myself ""I have no idea what is going on, so I'm justing going to roll with it"".It is with great surprise that I recommend this film to you. 7 (out of 10) stars and you can take to the Bank (of Marquis).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Zach Snyder is Dr. Frankenstein and this is his monster.,"This is by far one of the most chopped up movies I've ever seen...by ""chopped"" up I mean the movie just goes scene to scene without transitions or clear context. I'm not one of these people who are on the Zack Snyder hate-train but I really can't defend him this time, the editing and pacing is just wrong. I also get the feeling that Zach Snyder is not capable of keeping a consistent tone which is why his movies come off as disjointed and awkward. BvS frequently raises your hope and then quickly crushes it because all the neat ideas either fizzle out or just have a really dumb pay off. The only redeeming factor was Batman, quite frankly he's the only character that's actually likable. Superman just comes off as an angry teenager type. BvS is truly a Frankenstein movie...it's a lot of disjointed parts made into one stitched-up movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A blockbuster film!!!,"I watched this film after reading the critics reviews And went in with a mindset of the film not going to be that great and based on that mindset which the critics exhumed negativity had caused me to feel the film pleasantly surprised me. Actually it's didn't just pleasantly surprise me it blew me away. The film was awesome. Afleck as batman was great. Wonder Woman as gal was good. Cavill was good. Jesse as lex Luther Was probably the worst performance for me. One thing that Snyder still hasn't done is inject some humour, I don't expect it to be deadpool but It wouldn't go amiss.

Batman and Superman Winners,"Just like the critics and fans, Batman and Superman duke it out for supremacy in the DC Universe. Despite its flaws, the Dawn of Justice does justice to the two heroes. Batman is on a vendetta against Kal-El/Clark/Superman. The collateral damage from the most recent Superman has cost many lives, many of whom were close to Bruce Wayne/Batman. He now worries about the unchecked power of Superman. So does the United States. When Superman has to save Lois (big shock, right?), some more collateral damage happens somewhere in Africa. Now the U.S. Congress wants to meet with Superman and discuss this immense power, since they think with great power comes great ... wait ... wrong franchise. Still, you get the idea. As Batman investigates some strange activities of Lex Corp and its founder, Lex Luthor, he meets the reporter, Clark Kent. Of course, he has his own agenda, wishing to investigate the Bat Vigilante who operates outside the law. In fact, when Wayne and Kent meet, the young reporter is already on to him. Also, a new casual observer is growing curious, as well as stirring up curiosity: a meta human who will be known as Wonder Woman. Finally, we have a Lex Luthor who has created an elaborate plot to pit the two against each other. We have a battle, a team-up, and the defeat of a bigger threat known as Doomsday. Fresh from the genes of General Zod, it wreaks havoc in Metropolis, so only the two heroes, I mean three, stop him. First, I want to get my gripes out of the way. First, the trailer for the movie pretty much gave away the whole plot - so thanks a ton, Warner Brothers. Second, Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor will have people considering him for a prestigious award: a Razzie. While Gene Hackman went with camp and humor, and Kevin Spacey went with more sinister, Eisenberg gives us a loopy Lex Luthor who has Tourette's Syndrome. There is also some lazy writing within the screenplay, as they could not execute the story as well Marvel writers have. Instead of focusing on our three superheroes, they pull some tricks out of left field to introduce Flash, Aquaman, and another hero I am unfamiliar with. However, it has a lot going for it. The most controversial casting decision, Ben Affleck as Batman, was the best choice. He owned that role, playing it to perfection. It even rivaled Christian Bale's take on the role. Henry Cavill as Superman is no Christopher Reeve, but he plays the role more for complexity and not so much as comical. Clark and Superman are much closer to each other. Moreover, unlike Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth, Cavill and Adams have a good chemistry as Lois and Clark/Superman. Another good aspect was the fights and the action. While Doomsday went a little over the top, at least it was entertaining and fun to watch. And the fights between the two leads are both entertaining and done with a much greater level of believability than the Doomsday fight. The movie was drawn out a little long, especially the ending that will still pique the audience's attention. So that part did work for me. I just wish the writers could have found a way to shorten the path. Overall, despite these mistakes, Batman v Superman is one to watch for the ages. I look forward to the next one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"As bad as feared. Honestly, it's too dumb to enjoy.","Maybe not as bad as Man of Steel but still quite bad. As expected, it's poorly written on every level. Despite the bloated run time, every single character feels shallow and one dimensional. It's as we all feared.Word of mouth will hurt this thing because it's mangled and dumb with no heart at all. Quite frankly, too dumb to enjoy. I know fanboys everywhere are circling the wagons to praise this movie but that in and of itself proves what I'm saying. Fanboys wanted to like it and apparently will look past all of its flaws.Everyone else is saying or will soon be saying that BvS is a dumb popcorn flick at best but really nothing special and just as bad as Man of Steel. How can a film follow something that bad but still give anyone high expectations? Yet, thanks to good trailers, that's exactly what happened.Well, the actual movie is going to lead to general disappointment especially if you're not already a fan. Campy, cheesy fluff pretending to be dark and serious usually fizzles out fast. Yet, as MOS proved this may be an indestructible franchise that won't die no matter how bad the stuff they churn out. No spoilers but trust me, the ending won't leave a good taste at all.BVS falls into the abyss of most summer movies even though it's only March. It delivers excellent advertising for an at-best mediocre product. Just think, some people thought they were disappointed by Man of Steel. If that's the case, then wait until they get a load of this thing. They added Batman but dragged that cool character down to this level.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
As real as it could be.,"I have never seen ever, a superhero movie that deep since Watchmen. Details on the plot were outstanding. Man of Steel couldn't have asked for a better sequel than this. The Ultimate cut was way way better than the theatrical one. A perfect setup for Justice League. As Henry Cavill's Superman continues to find his place in the world of strangers. His existence becomes a conspiracy theory. Normal beings on earth having mixed reviews about whether their should be a Superman or not? Or whether he should answer to anyone? A Rigid Broken Man who got hurt in the events of Man of Steel takes things in his own hands. As he thinks he is the only person planet who could fight this probable threat to Human kind. Batman's Portrayal as Batman is beyond perfection. He doesn't just portray the Pain of Bruce Wayne but also his rage and rigidity. The balance Ben's Batman and Bruce had in BvS with limited screentime which was shared with Superman and Wonderwoman in a Superman centred plot, was tremendous. Ben was clear about being Batman and using Bruce Wayne as a maskup and a perfect one. He was likeable and inspiring as Bruce Wayne for his employees. As Batman he was serving his mission well without any second thoughts. He was not searching for an escape even after a 20 year reign of crime fighting. I think as a whole, Batman/Bruce was perfectly written and portrayed in BvS. This completel and concrete portrayal of Bruce/Batman's character was missing even in Nolan Trilogy. Gal's Wonderwoman was inspiring as she had a cameo, still she managed to make fans around the planet. Cinematography of this Superhero flick is out of the park. Zack Snyder delivered the punch again. The Score was on point. Hans Zimmer's and Junkie XL's genius written all over it. Plot was spread wisely and provided every necessary detail. Dialogues were written well, executed well. It kept the Dark and gritty tone as well as the Heart of the characters from DC Comics. Its a delight for a true Movie lover.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A DC Cinematic Crisis? I don't think so.,"I'm surprised at how I actually liked the movie despite all the negative reviews it seems to be having all over the internet. More often than not I've found myself in agreement with the consensus.I was skeptical of this movie at first, to the point that I set my mind that I'll only give this movie the time of day if not for how Batman is going to be portrayed this time around. After watching it, I'm glad that I got more than just that.You see, I wasn't impressed much by Man of Steel but I didn't hate it either. And as far as Zack Snyder's body of work goes, none of it has really impressed me as well, but I did enjoy them all immensely. From Dawn of the Dead to this latest outing, oh I enjoyed them all, yes indeed.I once described Zach Snyder's directorial abilities by comparing him to a certain type of rock song - the kind that has lots of guitar solos, shifting time signatures, and over-the-top drum fills, but no catchy CHORUS to sing along to. He's all technicality and virtuosity that comes so naturally, but when it finally comes to a part when you need to put some heart in order for it to have some semblance of a song, the execution is left a tad bit forced. Oh but it's there. My experience on this movie is pretty much the same, which is why I'm giving it the 8 stars. I anticipated this movie as a test of how much Zach Snyder's story-telling capabilities have evolved this time around, and judging from what I saw, meh, still not by much, which is why most critics and wannabe-critics hated it. I can look past all of that though. I enjoyed this movie immensely, and one big factor for me in considering that a movie is good is if I was immersed in it during the viewing. I look at the repeat viewing possibility, and for this movie I consider it pretty high for myself. I'd definitely watch it again when given the opportunity.One thing I loved about it (which is weird I guess), is I felt that Zach Snyder really, really, REALLY, really wanted to make a Batman movie all his life. I could see signs of this as early as his take on The Watchmen. He seemed really eager and excited. It's just too bad that when the opportunity finally came for him, Warner Bros. had different plans. The big company wanted a piece of the cinematic universe cake and so Zach was caught between juggling his chance to finally direct his Batman piece, and at the same time sowing the seeds for a much demanded Justice League silver screen debut. Oh and there's the little blue & red guy's story that he has to continue as well. It was an unfair challenge, but the business demands and so you gotta have something.It is a testament to Marvel's success in recent years that their work have become the benchmark of a superhero movie's entertainment value, at least as far as the general movie-going audience is concerned. So when the same group views a DC movie, the reactions are often divided. The fans though, oh they will definitely get this movie, yes they will, hardcore DC fans especially. The rest however? The critics? The general movie-going audience? Let them be divided. Let them suffer the loss of such simple pleasures. It may be a riot, yes, just like what's happening all over the internet right now, where opinions are as polarized as north and south poles on a really bad solar storm. DC's still gonna rake in the cash on this one despite the negative press, and their cinematic universe is underway either way, with or without you (queue U2 song into...).The thing with DC is that they have always done it their own way, and that means just basically putting their content out there and letting people be the judge, and they've been living by this approach for the past two decades. Just look at the huge body of work they've accumulated with animated features and shows which has become highly respected along with their never ending supply of TV shows. They can do this because they know that their characters are more popular and have been household names far longer than Marvel's or any other comic book company's. The burden of introduction is not so heavy with DC, unlike with Marvel where a lot of time and careful thought goes into setting the background and managing possible perceptions of the target viewers/audience before committing a character or storyline to a live action adaptation.I know I may be in the minority on how I feel about this movie. Again, it's probably because I didn't really expect a lot from it. There were a lot of flaws. Maybe it was because I didn't have the wife with me when I watched it, just our 8 year old, who was obviously bored on the exposition parts but was very much alive during the beatdowns obviously. Maybe it's really just the Batman fan in me, and seeing him finally realized in those action sequences that I've so long been waiting for is more than enough reason for me to rewatch this movie. The way I see it, I got a good Batman movie with commercials of other Justice League members on the side, with Wonder Woman being the main feature trailer.If my reception to DC's cinematic universe may have been lackluster before, I'm definitely more excited now.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best CBM (Extended Cut only),"This is a beautiful movie. Zack Snyder really has done a brilliant work on this movie. His take on Superman and Batman is the not very different, it's how people who have been through what these two characters have, should be. Ben Affleck has excelled at his role, the best Batman in live-action cinema till now. You can really feel the pain that Batman has gone through his life, his portrayal is accurayete for a man who has everything yet does not have what he wants, he's had close one's die and the fact that he has spent nearly 2 decades in a undying city of crime has changed him right to the core. Then comes Henry Cavill's Superman, possibly the best take in the character's long history in movies. He kills it with his act. Superman is still confused about his part in this world and Cavill just shows that in a brilliant manner. Every actor including Gal Gadot, Amy Adams, Jeremy irons, etc have done a splendid work. The visualisation is brilliant, cinematography is top notch, the score is obviously outstanding. Plus, this OST for Batman really describes the damaged person that he his.

Good movie if you're not expecting the Avengers,"I'm always amused at how people react to the new crop of DC movies. It seems some have a negative opinion before they see it. They do try to be darker than I think they should be, but that is the curse of the Dark Knight movies. But going in to these DC movies, I keep my expectations to a minimum, and unlike, apparently, more than a few people I don't go in with expectations to hate on the movies. This one could have been better if it would have followed the early 90's animated movie and had the vs. part held to more of a minor plot point, but it was enjoyable and did good enough job of introducing the DC trinity to a wider audience. If you do come into the theater in this or future DC movies looking for a Marvel spectacle movie, perhaps you should stick to just the MCU movie package.

MORE dawn of justice LESS  batman vs superman,"Batman and Superman are the most iconic superheroes in the world and a movie having a plot which will make them come against each other is bound to be epic but what if the director decides to avoid this conflict and concentrate more on the insane villain,the follow up movie and the personal crisis of the two character rather making them actually fight with each other. This is what Dawn of justice is all about. The movie opens with the death of the parents of Bruce Wayne and the next scene takes of from the climax scene of Man of steel.The movie seems to be shot parallel to the story of the two iconic characters which will later result in a combat.Then later the doomsday element and the annoying Lex Luthor element which completely destroys the base of the plot and which results in only 8 minutes of batman v superman in a 2 and a half batman v superman movie. The story is too mediocre for this epic movie.It has many things in it which seems too irrelevant with the plot.The story has a bad time making the characters of Lois lane and Martha Kent fit into it the story. The screenplay of the movie is awesome in the first half having batman to do anything to steal the Kryptonite and superman being accused for something very bad.But in the second half the film looses its simplicity and remind us that something really big is going to happen and yes those big things happen at the end but that 30 minutes from the interval seems rushed and not so interesting.At the end it is packed with three action sequences which is enjoyable and you cant really count that part where there is action in the screenplay. Background of the movie is just awesome having the perfect background score at the perfect time so for that thanks to Hans Zimmer and Xunkie XL. Now acting wise I think everybody acted just fine and Jessie Eissenberg overacting a little at the end, though he started of well.But the Affleck-Iron duo just won it for the audience.Seriously this movie showcased the best batman and Alfred till date.Those one liners from Jeremy Irons was brilliant.Ben Affleck acted the best of the lead and nothing to say for Henry Cavill, he was just OK. And in the action and direction department this movie also wins.The scenes at the time of opening credits was brilliantly short.And the last 50 minutes was full of action and the VFX was great and doomsday does not look so bad as other reviewers are saying though you will find that the ending is dragged. At the end Dawn of justice is a movie which shows that the there will be a Justice league movie coming, they showed that superman has been accused for multiple reasons in this movie, they showed that lex luthor is insane and can do anything to weaken kryptonite cells and Bruce Wayne thinks that superman is a threat and he should be killed but they don't really any BATMAN VS SUPERMAN stuff. At the end I want to say that it is a good movie but if you want to watch those iconic characters fight really hard then you will have to wait for the Pre climax sequence and if you want a good looking action movie it is perfect for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The epic showdown between Batman and Superman has to be this frustrating to endure.,"Back when I was a kid, I truly wished for DC Comics' prime superheroes, Superman and Batman, to clash together. I got the cartoon but I truly wanted for them to meet in real life. And as we finally get a titanic clash of two of the greatest superheroes, what I get...is a mixed bag.Okay, to be honest, it is a noble task for ""300"" director Zack Snyder to set up a cinematic universe from the divisive ""Man of Steel"". Of a flawed telling of Superman's origins, there needs to be corrections be done to justify a setup for a ""Justice League"" movie. Too bad the same mistakes are done in this effort, from its dark and gritty tone to its plot excesses. However, you can forgive them as they tend to highlight the epic showdown between DC's greatest properties; if not too much.As for the plot, there are times that it feels forced or designed to set up DC's other properties. For it is easy to tell a growing rift between the Son of Krypton and the Bat of Gotham, it is baffling that the execution is flawed. The best storyline comes from Bruce Wayne/Batman. Ben Affleck does an impressive performance as Wayne and his alter ego, with Jeremy Irons' Alfred Pennyworth in full support. And although I commend Affleck for impressively embodying Batman, his performance is tad too similar from his predecessors and his motivation goes south.The supposed backbone of the movie, Superman's subplot, fails to fulfill the personality missing from ""Man of Steel"". As both Clark Kent and Superman, Henry Cavill was able to pull off a fine act but he was given no room to develop more for both identities. And his storyline feels a little constrained to learn of his character journey to justify ""Man of Steel"". At least Amy Adams' Lois Lane is given further credit, more than she was previously.The true breakout and delightful surprise comes from Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince. While the Amazon warrior princess feels phoned in, she makes a striking impression from her limited screen time. Gadot is impressive, making me wish for more room for her to shine.While I can post more compliments, I cannot but feel frustrated as to how disappointingly this ""Justice League"" setup was staged. Some scenes are thrown in like pies. The action scenes were hard to follow. The pacing is flagging. The main villain, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, is a balance between witty and exasperating. The Easter eggs end up too visible like billboards. The introductions to other DC characters are too much forced. And the showdown that the movie truly sells isokay. And expecting an okay reaction from a showdown between Batman and Superman is not okay.After a preview, I heartbreakingly realized that a trailer for ""The Lego Batman Movie"" made a better impression than the actual movie itself, making this one of the most frustrating movies I could ever review. All the while, I was still hyped to see where Snyder and company will go from this one. And I hope it is not surely a recollection of what the movie was. Now, we can all lay our hopesto the ""Suicide Squad"".",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Why All The Hate? It's Not That Bad,"Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice is directed by Zack Snyder and stars Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill as Batman and Superman. This movie mostly follows Bruce Wayne as he begins to feel uneasy about Superman, and what he may be capable of when it comes to the existence of the human race. Bruce feels that if this ""alien"" wanted to, he could wipe out the Earth's population, and nobody could stop him. Due to this disagreement between the two, they end up in physical quarrel that could level monuments...literally.Now, since this film hit theaters, I have heard nothing good about it, besides the praise around Ben Affleck's Batman. Although Ben Affleck does extremely well, I feel that Batman V Superman is actually a very good film, and a fun superhero movie. Like said earlier, everybody has been praising Affleck's Batman, and for such good reason. Ben Affleck plays one of the, if not the, best live action Batmans we have ever seen. Everything Affleck does in his portrayal as the caped crusader is fantastic, and he plays this character near perfectly. However great the performance, I do have a complaint with the character.Now, anyone who has seen a former Batman movie, read the comics, or watched any of the animated series' then you know that Batman has a single rule when it comes to crime fighting...he doesn't kill. Not in Dawn of Justice. This dude just mows people down. He uses machine guns, grenade launchers, you name it. He kills people left and right, and it doesn't exactly do the legendary character justice; no pun intended. It does add affect to the character himself, but it doesn't stay true to the comics like it should. As a casual movie goer, it won't do harm, but as a comic book fan, it's a bit hard to swallow, in seeing the abrupt change in Batman's moral code.Henry Cavill's performance as Superman didn't really change since Man of Steel (2013); he's fine. He doesn't do bad, but he definitely isn't Christopher Reeve. I personally like him better as Clark Kent than I do as Superman, but, like I said, he doesn't do bad. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman was a really good casting choice. Although she doesn't have the biggest part in the film, she does pretty good. As far as the character goes, she seemed to just pop up randomly throughout the film, as if the filmmakers tried to keep her character bobbing above water, that way she didn't sink under, but she didn't exactly stay afloat either, if that analogy makes any sense.Now, Amy Adams does good as Lois Lane, and I still stand by that casting choice. However, when it comes to Lois' actual character, it doesn't work. Throughout the entire film, Lois is on a wild goose chase, trying to figure out some dirty deed that Lex Luthor may or may not have had a hand in (more on him in a minute). Once her mindless subplot is finally over with, she gets involved with the final fight, and basically becomes a damsel in distress. It's at this point in which I realized that the filmmakers really just didn't know what to do with her character. They had her go on some unwarranted quest, just to occupy her character in one way or another. This upset me, because this whole factor took away from the film majorly.A big controversial topic about Dawn of Justice is Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He's been getting a lot of hate recently, and I can see why. He's a bit over the top, and crazy at times, and I really can understand why this doesn't work for some people. However, this was not the case for my personal experience. I really enjoyed Eisenberg as Lex, despite him being nothing like Lex Luthor from the comic books. This didn't bother me, however, because he actually isn't Lex Luthor, he's Lex Luthor Jr. He's the original Lex's son, and that's why he's so different from Lex in the comics, so it works for me. I like the wackyness to him, even though it's a little over the top at specific moments.The action in this film is absolutely amazing. Every moment of the battle between Batman and Superman is gut wrenchingly exciting. All of the directing was also top notch. Many people know Zack Snyder for his style over substance, and that applies to Batman V Superman. Although the script is lacking a lot, the direction and action look beautiful, as true with most Snyder films.Doomsday. Just like everybody speculated, he looks stupid. He looks like a Michael Bay ninja turtle mixed with the character of Abomination from The Incredible Hulk (2008). He also causes too much destruction in the city, and basically cancels out what this film tried to make up for with the destruction caused in Man of Steel (2013). His battle with the three heroes doesn't work out too much, considering he was created to ""kill Superman."" I say this because he also tries to kill Batman and Wonder Woman as well, which doesn't make too much sense.The last topic I'll hit is really hard to discuss. All I'll say is that the film made a very ballsy choice towards the end of the movie, but then repeals the decision. It's hard to say without spoilers, but once you see the movie you'll know what I mean. The ballsy decision should have either stayed in effect up until the end, or not have happened at all. If either of this two outcomes would have been, the ending would have been better by a whole lot.In conclusion, Batman V Superman isn't a bad film, and was very fun to watch on the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best interpretation of Batman suffers from a mediocre movie,"""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is a mediocre movie but contains some of the best scenes and moments of any DC movie. The best parts of this movie are the score and Affleck's interpretation of the caped crusader. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL have created one of the best scores in any comic book movie ever. Ben Affleck is a great actor and it's a shame we never got to see him in his own solo Batman movie.The movie is very ambitious and tries to set up too many things. They are trying to do what Marvel has done. ""Batman v Superman"" does set up upcoming projects but it sometimes feels crammed in there and too obvious. Due to unforeseen and tragic events, Zack Snyder could not proceed with his plans and therefore these hints and setups do not work as well as they should have.Jeremy Iron's Alfred is great. He is witty, sarcastic, and clever. His chemistry with Bruce Wayne is great. There are some great characters but there are too many characters introduced which could and should have been cut. Doomsday, Wonder Woman, and the other metahumans should not have been in the movie. There should have been more focus on Batman and Superman.Superman is almost an unstoppable force with only one weakness. There are some interesting scenes where scientists, politicians, and religious people discuss and argue about Superman. Superman can be a great, compelling, and frightening villain when executed right (which is why ""The Boys (2019-2022)"" is such a compelling show). He is almost unkillable and he could destroy all of humanity if he chose to.Bruce Wayne is neatly introduced at the beginning of the movie. The montage showing the death of his parents is exceptionally executed. The opening sequence when Bruce is running around in Metropolis while Superman is fighting in the sky is epic to watch. It's interesting to see the destruction and terror which Superman leaves behind after his fights. It is clear and understanding why Bruce fears Superman and sees him as a threat.Wayne's alter ego, the caped crusader is also established in a great way. He is a legendary, horrifying, and violent crime-fighting vigilante whom everyone fears. The women fear him, the police fear him, and the criminals are frightened of him. Batman's voice modulator is cool and is not as silly as Christian Bale's attempt to sound intimidating.Batman is a menace in this movie. He brands criminals with his Bat symbol which leads to them getting killed in prison. Affleck steals every scene that he's in. His dialogue is clever, and he delivers some of the best lines in any Batman movie. The movie does a good job of showing his physical strength as well as his intelligence in an epic training montage.Ben Affleck is one of the greatest actors to ever put on the cowl. He is great in the role of the caped crusader, and I wish we got to see more of him in a grounded world. He is older, more brutal, and cynical and he is the most skilled fighter of any Batman interpretation which has been put on screen. This movie features the best fight scene in any Batman movie and it's not even close. It would have been great to see Affleck's Batman in a grounded world with less CGI and more practical effects. It's not easy to mix Batman and Superman and get a realistic movie, but they did a decent job.This movie suffers from incoherent storytelling but excels in other areas. Ben Affleck is arguably the best Batman ever and Henry Cavill's Superman is also great. The movie features some of the best fight scenes of any movie inspired by the DC comics. If you are a fan of the DC comics, Superman, Batman, or superheroes in general then you will enjoy this movie (or at least parts of it).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The ultimate edition is the better version of this film.,"Having seen the extended cut of the film on my ps4 , i think this version is a much improved version of the theatrical cut. There's extended scenes and a much more mature theme with more violence between Batman and Superman. This is also true for the extended version of Suicide Squad. Thankfully Wonder Woman doesn't have an extended version but the theatrical cut is the preffered one by its director. Wonder Woman is the saving grace of this movie and in it she's kinda pale compared to her origin story that followed this year. I'm looking forward to seeing the Super friends vs the Legion of Doom in the upcoming Justice League movie this fall.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It wasn't as bad as critics are saying.,"I am not a huge fan of DC and I prefer Marvel however this was a really good superhero movie overall.I wasn't sure about Ben Affleck's superman, but he was alright. The star for me was Henry Cavill. I found Man of Steel extremely boring even though I love Henry Cavill and Amy Adams. This movie was a huge step up for Superman.PLEASE DO NOT LET THE CRITICS AFFECT YOUR DECISION TO WATCH THIS. If you like superheroes in general you will like it regardless. The start was slow and it was a bit all over the place but it tied up pretty well at the end and the little bit of hope you get at the end of the movie is well worth the watch.Oh yeah didn't think I was going to like Gal Gadot as WonderWoman but she was pretty great.

A low point for DC Comics.,"Compared to any of the previous Christopher Nolan films this, the newest DC offering, must be an embarrassing effort for all involved.First of all, I just don't think anything can make Superman a character that anyone can relate to in the 21st century. On top of that, the plot is a hard-sell that just totally misses the mark. The theme of a demigod vs. a man (with gimmicks) is absurd.The film came off as contrived and dry, without any passion. In my opinion, this is at least partly due to the selection of Ben Affleck being cast as Batman, though he is certainly not to blame for the horrible screenplay or bad directing.For me, this film was a total failure. At least, in the Richard Donner/Richard Lester Superman films, the comic relief provided by Gene Hackman and Ned Beatty made the flicks worth watching. This lackluster dud could have used some of that brand of comic relief to at least break up the boredom.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Well crafted film---a relatively long film , but well worth it!!!","I saw the Ultimate Edition which is 3 hours long.There was just the right amount of darkness to keep it intriguing throughout.The Visuals and Sound (Kudos to Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL)add to that and make it a good one for the theater.Ben Affleck as Batman doesn't disappoint.He brings his own style to it in his physique and temperament and its definitely different from the earlier people who've played Batman but it's fresh and holds promise for the future movies with him in it.Henry Cavill builds on what he did in Man of Steel and Gal Gadot's introduction as Wonder Woman doesn't take much screen time but does raise curiosity as to what Wonder Woman's going to be up to in the future.Lex Luther played by Jesse Eisenberg is the right amount of annoying,if there is such a thing.It may not be a commercial movie for the mass audiences but it definitely is a piece of art made for the core superhero believers.The fight scenes are many and long and beautifully choreographed and timed with the right music to evoke as much emotion as possible.A theme which Zack Snyder seems to try to carry out throughout the movie,fight scenes or not.I wasn't sure after Man of Steel,but having seen Batman vs. Superman,I am now a DC person.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Like the old saying goes, ""You get more with less!""","I was so looking forward to watch this movie, but only to find out that it was a waste of my time.The movie for me was me-eh!I just think that, they tried too hard by overloading this movie with 3 different story lines and because of it, it really lost that WOW factor, well for me it did anyways.Maybe should take notes like how MARVEL did their movies. Made a single movie per character to explain the superheros life story/background.To me i couldn't help stop thinking that the only reason for this movie, was to see how could we put 3 well known superheros together, just to confuse the heck out of people, because i was.To me the movie was too cluttered, rushed and kept jumping around a lot, from one character story line to the next.If you ever wanted to watch 3 movies into one, now's your chance.After watching ""Man Of Steel"" i had actually thought this would of been a pretty good movie, but boy was i wrong.I would probably wait for it to come on DVD and don't waste your $$$ going to the cinemas's to watch it, very bad idea.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Zack Snyder must be stopped!,"Who keeps giving Zack Snyder money to make these enormous mediocrities?!The actors were all doing a fine job, and Affleck - as I predicted - was particularly excellent as an older, embittered Bruce Wayne/Batman.Other than that, this is a bloated mess of a film in which character motivations and plot developments are plucked out of a hat. Meanwhile, desperate to catch up with Marvel, DC have tried to cram as many characters in to this one as possible in order to set up their Justice League project.Worth seeing for Batfleck, as a standalone Batman film is very likely - I just hope they don't let Snyder anywhere near it, and that Goyer gives his head a good shake.To paraphrase Rossini talking about Wagner, Batman v Superman has some wonderful moments, but awful quarters of an hour.yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Good movie, entertaining, but...","It is a very good film, especially from a special effects, musical and artistic perspective. The actors are excellent, the universe is very grim and the director captured the dark side of batman very well. Batman kills people (not a spoiler don't worry) as does superman which is rather surprising as it goes against the traditional batman style. The negatives are rather small, the film is long (I don't mind that) but it needs to be longer, one feels as if the story line is rushed at times, there are too many subplots to fit in, clearly this film is preparing us for others. The director really likes to link Superman to Jesus Christ, with many visual and audio references during the film, which can be slightly offensive and inappropriate, it would have been better to compare him to a Greek mythological god, but the director did a good job at it from a purely artistic perspective.What this movie excels at is that you can just sit back and enjoy a very pleasant visual treat with an excellent soundtrack. It entertains, which is what a movie should do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
5.5/10 - Plot % 9.9/10 Fighting,"This movie had potential, I'll make this brief, the hype was real and everyone was excited, fans screaming and haters wailing.. both left and right.. For me, I wanted to loved this movie, and this review should give people from either side of the screaming and wailing as well as for the people inbetween like me the rightful judgement for this Highly potential movie.I'm a comic reader, I've read some DC comics and for Marvel, more so. When this was announced to happen in Cinematic Theater, I was blown away, I literally thought this would have been the end of Marvel's onslaught of comic genre movies or so I thought.Simply put, people who liked a new approach on Jessie's Luther in the trailers would be quenched of their thirst, his performance was superb with how he portrayed Lex, but then again it comes to personal preference, people who didn't like the approach Jessie showed in the trailers, then you'll have a cringe-worthy time of your life.Wonder-Woman, f****ing fantastic, nothing else to say without spoilers but, Gal Gadot did a fantastic job as her and this leans me toward the reason of how the plot was bad.. because we simply did not get a wonder woman movie to establish her into this.Batman Afleck, new approach and he killed it, why and how? well because 'He's Batman'.Superman - improved a lot with his character from Man of Steel.TL:DR = The characters are lovable and they portrayed their acts within this movie with flying colors.The plot is what got me disappointed, it got me confused with the editing, and because of it, the plot was screwed, the writing was great but with bad editing things that I would like to love in this movie wasn't met to their rightful perfect placements. So in a sentence for me to rate this movie - Choreography and Action were at their greatest. Plot - Too many spoons to feed from.I suggest to watch it and see for yourself.

"A Bit Meandering, But Good Overall","This is the first time that I've ever decided to see a movie twice before writing a review. Normally I'd want my first reaction to be the thing that I write up, but with this movie there was so much going on with the story line that I felt like it deserved a second viewing before sharing my thoughts. That said, the first thing you should know about this film is that it's jam packed with lots of story and lots of action--indeed, some critical commentaries from comic book fans have said that the film tries to morph too many stand alone comic book stories into one cohesive narrative.That may well be the case, but when trying to judge the movie based on its own merits, I must say that my second viewing left me presently surprised with how much I liked this film. Yes, there are things that I could nitpick about: the dream sequence was completely lost on me (though it evidently made the cut to set up future films in the DCU franchise); the film is less ""dark"" than some are saying, and I found the score to be annoying in a way that conjures up the worst of comic book adaptations; the finale is a huge display of CGI effects that went a bit overboard; and Gal Godot just doesn't do it for me as Wonder Woman--and by that I mean nothing heinous, just simply that she doesn't resemble the character.Still, all things considered, this is far from a bad movie. I don't think it's quite as good as ""Man of Steel"" (another film that it took me a second viewing to truly appreciate), but it's certainly not a bad superhero flick. Indeed, I rank it higher than last year's ""Age of Ultron"", a film which also suffered from an overcrowded plot. Unlike ""Ultron"", ""Dawn of Justice"" has better pacing and better storytelling conventions.There is one thing that I do feel that makes the film suffer a bit, though, and that is its choice of real world targets for the main dramatic disaster scene of the movie. No spoilers here, but let's just say that a notable landmark is destroyed, and dozens if not hundreds of people are murdered in the process. That scene really bothered me. It was just a bit too realistic, and it made it hard for me to like that portion of the film.All that said, I'm going with 7/10 stars for this one. A good movie, but just a bit short of great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very disappointing,"Now that im awake I can talk about batman v superman, ill try not to spoil anything, I didn't like the movie that much, the badness of the movie outweighed the goodness of it, To start off I didn't like how there were a lot of story lines to follow, it made it hard to be empathetic with any of the characters This meant when there was an emotional scene I just didn't care, I didn't get sucked into the movie. Another thing I hated about it was when there was a superman scene they used the same theme (flight, ideal of hope) at least x8 altogether. The themes became stale and boring, even though I love them, they over used it so much that when a real emotional scene comes on with superman, I don't actually care because I have heard it so much, I kind of wish they held the theme back and used when actually appropriate would have made it way more enjoyable and emotional. Another thing I hated was that when they show the scene with Bruce Haynes parents being killed, I couldn't stand it because its been used so much in batman movies, also they use his parents death for his emotional drive, its hard to take this seriously due to Bruce Wayne in dark knight has gotten over his parents death and understands he cares more about Gothem, so this makes BvS version of batman just boring, even annoying. If I say more im spoiling, so I wont, but there was some very brilliant scenes, I enjoyed lex luthor a lot and thought Wonderwoman was good, I enjoyed there themes a lot, especially Wonderwomans.

Know your enemy's weakness before challenging to a fight!,"It is known that critics have no brain. It is the best Superman film as Henry Cavill in the red and blue suit. Yep, I know it is always DC versus Marvel, so it is then DC's reply to the 'Avengers'. I don't care their rivalries, as a film fanatic, I enjoy good films and I found it was so good. But I was a bit worried after the Superman was shown in a dark shade in the trailer, especially after Batwan was overly stylised by Nolan, I thought the black suit would take over. After watching the film I was relieved and happy that Batman was exposed.Batman fans might have been disappointed, but for the superhero and DC fans, this film is a great treat. You can't compare it with 'Avengers', it had its own style. It follows the 'Man of Steel' and directed by the same director. Excellent cast. I have never been the Ben Affleck hater, so I had no objection to his role in this. He did good along with Cavill and others. He would do better in his solo Batman films if Zack Snyder is retained to script and direct them.I'm not a comic book reader, so I did not know the story before the watch. I was surprised for the Wonder Woman's part in the film. The visuals were awesome, the story was unpredictable, well developed characters, cleverly composed scenes, wonderful stunt sequences and the film's overall tone was kind of dark and gloomy, a very satisfying superhero film. The content balance was perfect, but the characters did not do the same as we know Superman is a father of all superheroes.I already watched it twice and I can't wait for its sequel. Especially looking forward for Jesse Eisenberg, because he was kind of stayed low in this and I hope his character Lex becomes much stronger. It is a PG13, and there's nothing botherable stuffs in it for the underage audience, but I felt it is targeted for adults because of the matured flavour.

If You are A Big Fan You Might Get Upset,"So from a purely technical standpoint the movie is very strong. There is solid cinematography, great audio, well choreographed fight sequences, strong special effects, and very appropriate costume design.The acting is a bit rigid and the character development gets lost quite a bit in the re-hashing of the previous Batman and Superman movies. Ben Afflek makes a good Batman, delivering the dark broodiness you expect, but as Bruce Wayne he just seems boring and unimpressive. Henry Cavill does the same, presenting a strong Superman character struggling to balance his ""humanity"" with the fact that he is not human, but as Clark Kent he seems flat and boring.The film is also clearly rushed. Too much plot development is just cast aside in order to conveniently fit their narrow plot into the 2+ hours allotted for the film. There are large plot holes that make little sense but are there for convenience and they even seem to run trailers for other DC Super Hero movies in the middle of this movie, as if advertising ""Yea, we know there could have been a lot more here, but we want to rush this story out first"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Henry Cavil is a great superman but it just appears at times that the writers are having trouble capitalizing on this character. They try to make him interesting by making him vulnerable but by doing that, they take away from the greatest attributes about superman's character. This movie also has a hard time providing the motives for each of these characters. Batman appears to be the only one who has a motive that makes sense. As for positives for this move... Almost Everything Batman related in this movie is amazing. All of the fight scenes are awesome. Alfred and Batman's relationship is great and something fresh. Wonder Woman in this movie is AMAZING!

Batman v. Superman: A Swing and Several Misses,"I had the opportunity to see this film on opening day. Based on the trailers it looked like it was going to be a great roller coaster ride to the finish. Sadly that roller coaster went off track and never found it's way back on.The Good: Ben Affleck was a great Batman. He really put a lot of effort into the role. There is nothing negative about his performance. He is the only saving grace of this mess of a movie.The Bad: Where to start? First, this is a Zach Snyder film so you know the story line will be terrible. Before you see thing, understand that very little effort was put towards character backgrounds or anything story related. This is a punch something movie.In what is the biggest let down of the film is that the trailer revealed everything about the movie. Honestly if you have seen the trailer for the film you know the entire story this movie is following. Bad Guy gets two good guys to fight. The fight then realize it is stupid. They then turn on bad guy and his hired thug. Third character comes out of no where, kills hired thug as the two good guys make up.The film throws away all the iconic images from the comic book. Batman is not the comic book Batman. He ruthlessly murders innocent people throughout the film with a machine gun, which goes against everything the character is about. Superman is 'meh' throughout the film. Lastly Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor is the worst actor to ever play the role. A wooden and unimpressive performance leads the film to smile like a trip to the city dump.If you are on the fence about seeing the film you are better off staying home or going to see Zootopia (excellent film, a must see).

"The extended cut is much better, but still flawed.","It really is worth the extra time to watch the extended cut, because the normal release is much more convoluted and riddled with plot and technical issues. The extended cut gives a little more clarity, but still is one of the worst written from having too much filler and lacking in more substance. Many critics weren't a fan of Eisenberg's character/performance, but without him, there would hardly be any substance to the film. I for one enjoyed his performance as well. Other than that, the casting and performances were great, and the S/VFX and score on point. If you haven't seen Man of Steel, I really emphasize you should watch that first, otherwise you'll be lost. Then watch Zack Snyders Justice League for the trifecta of the main guts of the DCEU story-lines. To me, none of the Wonder Woman's, Harley/Suicide Squad's, Aquaman's or Shazam are canonical or have much effect on the main 3 DCEU movies, only having a few quick cameos and non-canonical backstories. The almost 10 hour binge investment on just the 3 aforementioned films will satisfy any super-hero DC fans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I wanna die.,"My review may not be the most helpful in terms of providing a fair critique of the film, but it will be helpful in terms of saving you time and money. If you think that the Marvel films are making other films worse and you loathed Man of Steel, (like me) avoid this one. If you like the Superman and Batman characters, oh god.. please don't see this movie. No one, not even casual superhero fans deserve this. I don't read comics or anything and I wanted to die. This film is so jumbled in its story and pacing that i honest to god thought that my theater's projector was broken and rolling the film out of order. At one moment, I thought another film entirely was being shown. Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor? What happened, man? It's not the actor's fault; the direction was totally bizarre. Lex was like an obnoxious 14 year old attempting to appear witty and charming but totally falling on his face. *Minor Spoiler* ---- Batman goes around mutilating people and shooting guns. It got overly dark, even for the dark knight. I don't care about violence in film, and I felt like it was ridiculous (for this movie anyway). *Done* ----- The two stars I give this film are for a couple decent shots, and the fact that the seats in my theater were really comfortable. They reclined and everything. It was dope. Movie was awful, though.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

meh,"For a movie like this I normally ignore the very first reviews as there are too many ""10""s many of whom I assume are connected to it one way or another. Its definitely not a 10. Pros - The CGI is pretty good but nothing really cool that wasn't in the trailers. Ben Affleck did a good job as Batman. Gal Gadot was good in the action scenes. This version of Lex Luthor is unique which was a good way to go.Cons - The make up department. Superman with a receding hairline, Lois with a blotchy complexion and crows feet. This is supposed to be a comic book movie right? But that is minor. The main con is that it seemed to drag, the build up to the big fight was a lengthy process. Doomsday started out looking like a cave troll from Lord of the Rings.One thing I did notice was that it seemed like an unusually large amount of people got up to use the head toward the end of the movie which tells me it wasn't holding their interest very well.It is worth seeing one time, but it's not something I will pay for a second time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Ultimate Cut is the true experience, an epic and superb story - My Ultimate Review","After watching it for the fifth time, forth with the Ultimate Cut I can say I love the story, tone and almost everything about the movie except for the writing for Lex and some minor things but the overall feeling of the movie makes up for it. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL created a soundtrack that fits the movie perfectly. The characters from Man of Steel is improved and is overall better and the addition of Ben Affleck's Batman, Jeremy Irons' Alfred and other characters creates a great ensemble cast and the actors bring great and memorable performances. My take on the story is that it is really realistic, Superman would be seen as a god in a way and I agree fully with Batman's thoughts, look at the Injustice games/comics, simply great writing. The production design has the same quality of ""Man of Steel"", in other words quite brilliant production design. I'll say the same about the costume and prop department. The cinematography is another highlight of mine.The premise goes like this: Fearing the actions of a god-like super hero left unchecked, Gotham City's own formidable, forceful vigilante takes on Metropolis's most revered, modern-day savior, while the world wrestles with what sort of hero it really needs. And with Batman and Superman at war with one another, a new threat quickly arises, putting mankind in greater danger than it's ever known before.The fighting sequences are well choreographed and the warehouse scene, one of my all time favorite live action Batman scenes! There are more powerful action sequences, but the movie is about the politics and drama and not as action heavy as Man of Steel. But when the action does hit, it hits strong and is extremely entertaining.Henry Cavill is great in this film but Ben Affleck really steals the spotlight, but the character development that Clark Kent receives is worth it as he's one step closer from becoming the superhero we love and know so well. Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne and Batman is brilliantly played and written, the character has been criticized for killing as Batman never kills. I understand and I got a problem with it to but I know why he kills in this movie, he's angry but everything comes down to all the loss and depression he suffers. He doesn't have anything good left in the world, Dick Grayson got murdered by The Joker. His only family and probably only friend is Alfred, and when Zod's attack on Metropolis happened, Bruce Wayne saw it up close and witnessed allt he death that these God like beings could do and realistically, he wants to do something to prevent from more harm and its a human thing to do, to hate. Zack Snyder's Bruce Wayne is more flawed than any other portrayals of the character but it might also be the most realistic portrayal of Batman. Lois Lane have always been the heart to Zack Snyder's DCEU (now this trilogy) and Amy Adams returns to portray the iconic character, her role is larger here than the previous film and her performance is even better. About her role, Adams stated that ""Lois is still sort of like the key to the information. She's the girl going out and getting it and figuring it out and putting it together and all of that, so she's very much involved."" Lex Luthor's big plan isn't really what you expect from a villain in a comic book movie. It's political and well thought out, something that can highly likely happen in the real world. It's another element that makes the film so great in my eyes, how the writers and Zack Snyder wanted to make the movie realistic and portray Superman in a way that would happen in real life. Jesse Eisenburg plays Lex in a fresh and unique way, not really comic book accurate but I strongly believe that after the character development from this movie he will then become the Lex Luthor we know and love. But I have to admit it, I like Zack Snyder's version of the character and Jesse Eisenburg did a terrific performance as the iconic villain.Many people doesn't appreciate the dream sequence that's called the Knightmare, I understand why as it drags down the pacing. But why did Zack Snyder choose to place it into the movie? It all comes down to his 5 film plan that he never got to finish, the dream sequence shows us what would possibly happen if Darkseid wins in the future and that means Superman will turn bad. In my opinion it's smart writing.I understand that this movie isn't for everyone and that's alright, but I love it. The visual storytelling, gritty and realistic tone, original and simply fascinating to look at as the imagery is perfection. Zack Snyder nailed it with the Ultimate Cut and have created an epic superhero film about two of my favorite heroes.If you have only seen the theatrical cut, I completely understand how you can think of this film as bad or below average. The story is grand and the ultimate cut adds everything the film needed to tell a great story that makes sense.This was the first time I watched the 4k version of the film, it works extremely well here like it did in that film. The IMAX scenes are truly mesmerizing in this 4k blu-ray, everything in this release brings the film to Zack Snyder's vision. The 4k resolution, the HDR and especially the Dolby Atmos track. Visually, this version is better than any other version of the film, it has that sense of epicness. This might be one of the best 4k releases (of mine) I've seen.(Edited this after my 5th watch)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good not great movie.,No real spoilers but only read ahead unless need more convincing . gal Godot did a real good job for just an extended cameo really. Her movie should be better then caps origin story. Irons is great as Alfred. Bale is still the man but Ben was OK. I think cavill is all wrong as superman.kinda miss Brandon even if was a clone. Kinda felt sorry for Adams Lois lane she just came off as Superman's love monkey and she seemed not as good as she was in man of steel.If there is more films there needs be new direction and a new superman or DC will never beat marvel being just OKWith cap 3 civil war coming I feel that DC only hope is suicide squad is received well. Or civil war is not as good as winter soldier.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Disappointing story, disappointing movie","""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" was released last weekend (3/25) after much anticipation from comic book fans around the world. The movie comes as part of a much larger collection that began in 2013 with ""Man of Steel"" and will continue next year with ""Wonder Woman."" So, did it live up the the hype? Or will the Justice League movies fall short of matching ""The Avengers"" success? The movie starts out – sigh – like any other Batman movie, an origin story. I definitely feel that we have reached a saturation point in the retelling of Batman's origin story and going over it again at this point is just plain overkill. Nevertheless, it was told anyway – but, like many aspects of this movie, it was told for no apparent reason.Directed by Zack Snyder, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" tries to be more than it should. After the movie let out, I found myself wondering if something was missing, or perhaps there was too much. If the fluff was cut out, this could have been a great movie. Instead, we're left with scenes that feel as though they were stitched together without rhyme or reason other than to eventually lead into further Justice League movies.The overarching plot to the movie also seemed rushed, while at the same time the movie itself seemed to drag on forever. The continuous foreshadowing of what's to come in the movie will leave the viewer knowing the next move of every character ten-minutes before it happens, so feel free to take a bathroom break at any time during this one.The character portrayals in this movie were what stood out as something excellent. Ben Affleck takes the Batman character and makes it his own in a morose, melancholy kind of way while Henry Cavill continues as Superman. Both leading characters portray their characters in ways that comic book fans will not be displeased with.Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot also makes an appearance in the movie. Gadot portrays the character well, despite the fact that the character could have been completely removed without much change in the outcome. It would suffice to say that the Wonder Woman appearance served only to assist in the promotion of the 2017 title.Finally, the standout for me was Jesse Eisenberg in his portrayal of Lex Luthor. Eisenberg gave Luthor a somewhat Joker-esque crazy spin that seemed to work out for the character, now if only the story had given him more to work with.For me, it may have been my expectations going into the movie that soured the experience. I did not care too much for ""Man of Steel"", but I had hoped that it was just a fluky bad spot for Snyder. Unfortunately, it would seem that yet again Snyder is attempting to tell too many stories in too little time and the viewer is the one who suffers.For the great, dark, cinematography we have come to expect from DC Comics movies by Larry Fong, and for the great character portrayals by all involved, I give this movie a 5/10. Given a better tied together story and less of a committee driven push to promote the future movies there's no reason this couldn't have obtained The Dark Knight status of nobility amongst comic book fans.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

not nearly as terrible as the trailers make it look / feel,"Seriously -- some truly terrible trailers did this film a disservice. I really expected to hate it. But it turned out to be pretty good. The actors did solid work. The FX work was top notch. And Snyder actually upped his game and only got *stupid* with the Bat vs. Superman fight (when characters have the opportunity to kill each other, which is their goal, but instead opt for a ""cool"" wrestling move or to spin the other one around in a circle and smash stuff ...)I honestly thought this would be a flaming turd. Seriously. I'm not an Affleck fan unless he's directing, and I felt like MoS was ham fisted, and that Zack Snyder was all sizzle and no steak. But the narrative on this one felt streamlined and focused for the most part. It feels like Snyder was patient and let things breath a little bit, and certainly should be commended. So good work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A super-sized mess of a super-hero film. ""Batman V Superman"" fails to thrill or enthrall despite a fun climax and a few very strong sequences involving Ben Affleck's Batman.","""It's fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure."" -Bill Gates...let's just hope Zack Snyder really ponders this quote before his next film.""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is without doubt a film that has been hoisted up by years of anticipation from fans of film and the comics that have been built out of these iconic characters. A whisper on the lips of audiences the world over. A dream of a motion picture event that everyone has wanted to see since they've heard of these pop-culture legends.So why'd it have to suck?Peppered with only a handful of moderately entertaining or engaging sequences while otherwise being overfilled with borderline- nonsensical filler. Gifted with only one or two stand- out performances while others fall flat to their face. Given only a few key visual sequences of competent direction while other scenes fall apart from terrible guidance. And filled to burst with some of the laziest writing I've ever seen in a major release; where convenience, coincidence and pretentious dialog take precedence over honest character and plot development.It's a heartbreaking failure. Unable to live up to even a modicum of the limitless potential.Frankly, it's almost impossible to give a plot summary of the film, as it lacks any sort of cohesive narrative. Instead the experience is made up of a seemingly random array of sub-plots that are tied together in only the vaguest of ways. Something about Batman being against the idea of Superman because he's kind-of responsible for the death of some of his friends? And Superman being against the idea of Batman because he views the Dark Knight as nothing more than a crooked vigilante? And Lex Luthor kind-of being against both of them for no reason whatsoever? (Luthor has no motivation whatsoever. Sorry, but he doesn't.) And there's some tenuous connection between Lex and a generic-evil-Russian-guy that involves a bullet Lois Lane finds in the desert, I guess? And there's some senator who can't decide if she's pro-or-anti Superman? And some guy who lost his legs and gets all of three scenes to show he's mopey? And a few Kryptonian ships that pop up here and there but don't matter for 90% of their scenes? And Wonder Woman is around for... some reason the film never explains? And Lex has secret government documents on Meta-Humans that don't really tie into anything? And Batman has recurring anti-Superman dreams that are wholly unnecessary? And Alfred keeps alluding to things involving Batman's character that the film never establishes or pays-off?...And that's not me being sarcastic. That's me trying to give an honest summary after viewing the film for a second time.Kinda insulting that the creative team behind the film implied their movie was ""too smart"" for people to get when the real cause of the audience backlash and confusion was a bizarrely contrived script that felt like a first-pass rough draft cobbled together from three different story treatments and haphazard directorial choices.Speaking of direction, it's the same old boring ""let's shoot everything in close-up shaky cam and desaturate the colors!"" that makes up the bulk of modern action films. It's visually indecipherable from 99% of the other sub-par crud that passes for entertainment these days, looking more akin directorially to a bad direct-to-video B-movie than a mainstream release. And it's made all the worse because these are such beloved and iconic characters who deserve something better. It's insulting and it makes the reported $250 million budget look non-existent on-screen when we don't see that money thanks to everything looking so falsely artificial thanks to its textbook attempts at being ""gritty."" Zack Snyder's claim at being a visionary- something he genuinely earned at the beginning of his career thanks to much-better earlier credits such as ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""300""- has been completely destroyed by this type of schlocky, condescending trash that has encompassed his more recent work.And on the subject of the pink-elephants- Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman and Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor are a hit and a miss respectively. While I won't spoil much of Gadot's presence to avoid spoilers, she's a lot of fun. But Eisenberg... well, by now you know. He's a hammy mess. Every second mugging for the camera and chewing the scenery to the point of being grating and hilarious for all the wrong reasons. I'm sure he thought he was being a fun, giddy, nutcase version of the character... but the thing is, he goes so far over-the-top that we're no longer laughing with him... we're laughing AT him. A catastrophic performance.If there's any saving grace to this film, it's in the small handful of truly decent performances from the likes of Amy Adams and particularly Ben Affleck, and for it's admittedly fun climax.Adams is a joy as Lois Lane, and is able to give the film it's only real dramatic grounding in her somewhat-limited screen time. And Affleck is a phenomenon as our new Caped Crusader. Affleck injects a lot of organic pathos into the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman, and also gives us a really good vision of Batman's detective-side. He also just kicks some major butt when he's under the cowl! The fact he's not only starring in, but allegedly directing his stand-alone Batman feature makes me excited. He's one of the finest on-screen portrayals of the character thus far, and his incredibly gifted sense of film direction will do the character much better than the disservice that Snyder achieved here.And without spoiling anything, the climax is wickedly entertaining from a pure and visceral level, and it's the one section of the film I'd say is worth seeing. It's just a shame you have to slog through about two hours of aimless garbage to get to it.""Batman V Superman"" is a 3 out of 10. A heartbreaking failure.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"This movie is good.  Seriously, don't listen to the haters, this is why we can't have nice things.","Batman V Superman was surprising. Surprising because I expected another horrible superhero movie. It was different, didn't follow the paint by numbers narrative we're used to and yes, did feel a little too episodic for a feature film. But it was good.The characters were well-cast, the tone was dark and different (not another Marvel movie)-- I tuned out during the fight scenes (but I'll be honest, I do that for every superhero movie... which is the problem with these movies.)Although the major plot points were predictable, scene by scene it was not, which is well more than I can say for the Avengers. The dream sequences were filled with symbolism. There were actual relationship stakes in this movie- I BELIEVED that Batman had anguish upon hearing ""Martha"" which is a testament to the writing and proper execution. So much is ridden on that moment, and you know what? They pulled it off.Everyone wants something different, original, but then whines when it's given to us. This is exactly why we can't have nice things.So, shoot me. I thought it was good. I appreciated the risks they took and I really appreciated that they steered away from the same popcorn tone from the Marvel movies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great perspective on classic heroes; comic book fans will appreciate,"Despite all of the bad critic reviews (many are theorizing that these are coming from critics who have been paid off by Disney/Marvel), I really enjoyed this film. Zack Snyder and all the writers clearly read their sources and did their research. This was obviously a comic book movie, and to me, was obviously inspired by Frank Miller's work as well as some others. I am very anxious to see how Snyder plays out the rest of the Justice League members' stories and what character twists they will have. Ben Affleck plays a Bruce Wayne that is part his own and part Frank Miller's Bruce Wayne, but definitely plays Frank Miller's Batman. I thought that Henry Cavill's performance in this film was even better than his in Man of Steel. We get to see many sides of both Clark Kent and Superman, for better and for worse. The best performance of the film, however, was that of Jesse Eisenberg. Eisenberg plays the classic Superman villain Lex Luthor, but puts a new twist on the character. Luthor is usually a well respected business man who knows how to play the game of politics to his favor. While Eisenberg's Luthor is a respected business man, he also seems to be teetering on the edge of insanity; almost a cocktail of 3 parts Luthor, and 1 part Joker. Regardless of whether or not this was intentional, the cocktail definitely packs an impressive punch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Would someone please fire Zack Snyder,"Now I don't lay all the blame on the director, but a good portion of it should be directed at Snyder and the film's writers. They've taken what could have been the best superhero movie of all time, and turned it into an attempt to compete with the Marvel machine. And DC has failed miserably.The acting from the male leads was pretty standard (still on the fence about Affleck as Batman). Eisenberg's Luthor is a little tough to swallow at first, I mean the guy is known for playing weird characters. The real scene stealer is Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Best casting decision ever as far as the DC movie universe goes. Makes me even more anxious for the standalone film next year.But back to this movie. It definitely doesn't help DC fanboys and girls. The entire movie is basically about two grown men making angry faces and trying to kill each other. The movie simply doesn't live up to expectations. Granted the film is visually spot on, but technical prowess alone can't save this movie. Half the problem lies in the writing. And that's something wrong with almost all of Snyder's films. It's as if he values the ""look"" of a film over the quality of story and characters.Take Man of Steel for example. The movie's production was exactly how we'd want a superhero movie to be. Clean, sharp, with some great effects. But the story was so generic, and had so many holes it was hard to enjoy anything. Same problem with Batman V Superman. You have the 2 most iconic superheroes in the comic book industry, the stage set for an epic showdown, and then go and write a story that even a middle school English teacher would give a D.And the most upsetting thing about the film, for me, is that it's like no one read the actual comics. It's obvious most of the story came from the limited run series ""The Dark Knight Returns"" (the government puts pressure on Superman to apprehend the aging Bat). But the majority of the film to Batman and Superman punching and kicking.Long story short, this movie doesn't offer much of anything. It's great for someone who just wants to watch two guys in capes fight (i.e. little boys), but in the wake of the successful string of Marvel movies, this doesn't stand a chance. And if you go as far as to compare it to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, this film is even more of a let down.I'm hoping and praying the studio reconsiders letting Snyder direct another installment of the DCEU. Let someone with more experience handle the film. Snyder's movies have a track record for being more visually interesting than having any real narratives. And for making poor casting decisions (thinking Bryan Cranston would have been the better choice for Luthor).At least we have Suicide Squad to look forward to.Summary - There an online petition to remove Snyder from the DCEU yet?

Lots of effects with taped together story,"There is lot going on visually, but the characters seem completely changed from the comic books and the story itself is barely holding together. It is trying to fit too many things in. Introduce the Justice League, show the S v B conflict, show some character backgrounds etc. All together an awful movie.There were similar problems in Man of steel when they are trying to fit in lots of character background and then the actual confrontation, but neither is done well enough or connected well enough in the story to make an impact. Add to that the changes in character in Superman and Batman. For some reason Batman is now fine with killing people indiscriminately etc. Based on the interviews I've read I am not expecting this kind of changes to stop. Snyder doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on the characters or the stories. I think he'd be better suited to concentrate on the special effects only since that is the only part of the movie that works.

The Worst Superhero Movie Ever Made,"The PlotFollowing his titanic struggle against General Zod, Metropolis has been razed to the ground and Superman is the most controversial figure in the world.While for many he is still an emblem of hope, a growing number of people consider him a threat to humanity, seeking justice for the chaos he has brought to Earth.As far as Bruce Wayne is concerned, Superman is clearly a danger to society. He fears for the future of the world with such a reckless power left ungoverned, and so he dons his mask and cape to right Superman's wrongs.The rivalry between them is furious, fueled by bitterness and vengeance, and nothing can dissuade them from waging this war. However, a dark new threat arises in the form of a third man: one who has a power greater than either of them to endanger the world and cause total destruction!What a stupid plot. And why do we have to re-live Batman's origin with a terrible find actor who should be in school and who will never act again, when we've just seen the BEST Batman trilogy ever?Ben Affleck is painfully mis-cast has Wayne/Batman. he really can't act and his screen time is laughable. Plus the dialog is idiotic. Let me give you an example that happens in the first three minutes of the film. Metropolis is being destroyed and Wayne calls someone in a building he presumably owns. The guy picks up the phone and we can see through the window behind him the entire city of Metropolis coming down. Building are falling, fire everywhere and Wayne says ""I want you to get everyone out of the building now.' Really? On the first fireball I'd be running.

Cavill IS The Best Superman,"But Zack Snyder was still the dude who made this film.Snyder's films are heavy, dark (story wise and visually) and sad. So is this movie. Superman is about truth, justice and the American way. Problem is, our current generation can't quite decide what the American way is, or what that even means. So, in that vacuum Snyder jumps in and gets out his black and blue paint brushes and goes to work.When that gets combined with unfortunately consistently sketchy DCEU CGI we get a film that is frequently a muddled mess.Fans of the ""Snyderverse"" will disagree, and that's fine. But there's no arguing that none of these Superman films killed with the critics or at the box office. Not Cavill's fault. And really Affleck isn't to blame either. He definitely redeemed the mess that was Daredevil. Gal Gadot serves well, if underwritten once again, but the rest of the cast are not great, and not well cast (which continues in Justice League). Jesse Eisenberg in a jumbled mess of a spacey mojo infused plot of nonsense and drowns in bad dialogue. Amy Adams, a towering talent, turns in a muted performance. Lane and Costner, as good as they are, have been relegated to being plot devices without enough room to shine.So, worth watching for sure, but with lowered expectations, and don't watch it when you're already feeling a little depressed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Bats vs Sups,"Hey everyone Connor here again, and this time with my personal review of Batman v Superman.First off I don't know why the negative reviews, I personally thought the film was very entertaining and kept me engaged in the entirety.The characters were very good, Ben Affleck gave a stellar Batman and I'm glad to see him succeed. Henry Cavill gives good again as Superman, Gal Gadot's screen time is short but nevertheless gives a good performance as Wonder Woman, and its so huge and special to see the character because women now have a iconic super heroine in film , and I think that's great! Finally Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor...the steal of the show in my opinion, Jesse is one of those actors who captivates in everything he's in, and I can see an Oscar future for him. But in Batman v Superman he took Lex Luthor and did to it what Heath Ledger did to Joker...evolutionized it, and his performance was superb!The action sequences were very well done, in the final battle a lot of CGI was used especially, but that's to be expected.There were plenty of Easter Eggs in this film to catch your eye so be on the look out!Overall I give Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice a 7.5/10. I list it at 8 because i can't rate 7.5 but i thought the film deserved an 8 versus a 7 big time, but my honest opinion is a 7.5/10.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would honestly see it a second time, so I recommend this film to anyone who is curious.

"The death of DC, too bad","I went to this movie with very low expectations and got exactly what I thought. You know what was so great about the LOTR's? Well it was Peter Jackson loving the story and the characters, his ability to bring that story, not some random piece of the trilogy, to life. This is the failure of DC. Unlike their success on TV they continue to let movie makers who don't care about their heroes make their films. They continue to let people make movies about a broody Batman who wasn't so brooding in the comics or Justice league cartoons (some of the best stories and animation of all time). They had a pretty good Superman until the end of his first movie and I wont' say anything about the ending of this travesty. The others (Green lantern, this upcoming dumb suicide squad) they're just going to ruin outright. So let me just go through why its too bad that DC will never make it to the heights of Marvel. Too many villains who are nothing like their personas in the comics, too much Lois Lane, too much silly dialog, too fragmented, too much unwarranted destruction, too little sticking to the stories that people know really well. Even the music was bad. I have been waiting for DC to learn what Marvel learned but I guess not. So Marvel will continue to thrive by not insulting the audiences' intelligence or love for superheroes. They will continue to thrive by making their heroes interesting and well more human which is what we have always looked for in our heroes.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It wasted my time and money. Cant Trust IMDb anymore. Why is everyone giving high ratings for this movie???. Seriously I felt really really sad and angry at the cinema during the credit scenes.

I also liked seeing Holly Hunter in the role of The Senator, she really gave the role a professional business women feel to it. However as for Jesse Eisenberg, I do think the way he portrayed his role of Lex Luthor did not fit with the rest of the movie. His Lex Luthor was over the top, over acted and somewhat cartoon like. It didn't fit into the rest of the movie which is dark and serious. Overall I really enjoyed the movie, the special effects and the story line. I loved Ben Affleck as Batman most of all.

"Damn good performance by B. Affleck, H. Cavill, A. Adams & J. Irons","The expectation was big, the actors/cast was perfect. Ben Affleck is a damn good Brue Wayne, for me a better one than Christian Bale. Henry Cavill was better as in Men of Steel, A. Adams was as always good and Jeremy Irons was a perfect Alfred. This movie would be better if the first third was longer, more detailed (f.e. how they build this massive Batsuite, why batman is back, why some enemies hate superman and so on). J. Eisenberg was in my opinion a disappointment. I had the impression that he tries to be like Joker, played by H. Ledger, in Nolans Dark Knight.

Overstuffed,"1. Batman v Superman feels like one of those films your friend made and you want so badly to ignore all the bad stuff and point out the good with compliment sandwiches.2. Ben Affleck is a badass Batman. I wish there had been more of him. He is just not around enough. He's fine as Bruce Wayne but I wanted to see more of them. The best scene in the movie is where he's throwing down against those Russian henchmen in the vein of Arkham Asylum. Just goes to show, dark and gritty always goes well with Batman.3. There is way too much going on in this movie. There's Batman hating Superman. There's a Congressional inquiry. There's crazy Lex Jr. There's Diana Prince. There's the bullet subplot. There's Wally, played by Scoot McNairy. And they still manage to chuck in the Batman origin story in the opening credits. The problem with such an enormous cast is that you need everyone to be doing things at all times. Amy Adams is shunted into the bullet subplot because she's Amy Adams and you can't have a Superman movie without Lois Lane. Holly Hunter's Senator Finch has a lot of promise, but she becomes an antagonist to Luthor for some strange reason. There's a half-baked explanation as to why Wally is antagonistic to Wayne. While we're trying to keep track of a dozen plot lines, important hints relating to the actual fight are lost.4. The titular fight does not go on nearly long enough. Their initial clash during the high- speed Batmobile chase was tantilising but the fight itself was over like *that*. We all knew they'd end up being pals but boy does it just feel like a giant middle finger. The fight with Doomsday ends up being pretty cool (especially with the intervention of Wonder Woman, who kicks ass), even though Batman is predictably dumped on the sidelines for lack of power.5. I'd love to give Chris Terrio (Oscar winner for Argo) credit for the good moments in the screenplay (some awesome lines, great political subtext, etc) and then forgive him for the overstuffed mess by the fact that Snyder was trying to cram an entire Phase One into this one movie. I went nuts for that ""Martha"" connection. The best written moment in the movie happens in Superman's Congressional hearing, and it devastates me that they weren't brave enough to follow through with it completely, but it was still hugely powerful and the clues were spread like Chris MacQuarrie. The worst moments are the dream sequences, which make absolutely no sense and ultimately play like Thor's lightning bath fantasy in Age of Ultron.6. Henry Cavill is flat as Superman. Lord help us if he ends up as James Bond. Amy Adams tries her best but suffers from underwriting. There's only so much a talented actress can do with ""be damsel in distress"". She sees horrifying executions at the start of the film and kinda gets over it. Laurence Fishburne and Jeremy Irons get barely anything to do but provide a few bits of humour. Eisenberg gave a great performance, as long as you don't get bogged down trying to reconcile him with the role of Lex Luthor.7. I love Callan Mulvey and was thrilled to see him get a good role in this movie, but his allegiances are so confusing. I have no idea what was going on at the start of the movie with him in the desert.8. It amused me how much Snyder just kinda did his thing all over again. Everyone smashes up buildings and have those long distance punches. But what amused me were the occasional shoe-ins like ""good thing this part of town is deserted"" and ""that island is uninhabited!"" Someone needs to smash his slow-motion button, especially when he just uses it on people walking towards graves.9. The stakes always feel high in this movie, which I give credit to Chris Terrio. The opening stuff from Man of Steel feels like it could have come from a 9/11 documentary. The scene where Batman lures Doomsday away I felt like I was watching as a helpless spectator.10. That music was beast! I loved the guitar riff.There's too much going on in this movie for me to love it or even like it. But the bits I loved I LOVED, and I'm thrilled to see a Batman reboot under Ben Affleck's control.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Uhhh... is it... bad that... I kinda liked it?,"EXTENDED CUT
68/100Though it starts with the weirdest piece of dialogue, poor CGI and contains some of the most uncanny directing decisions I've seen from Snyder -which already says a LOT-, the first act of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice: Ultimate Edition innovates in the superhero genre, which feels almost impossible to do these days, until Snyder pits his own film into the standard most of these movies reside in.But i guess that's the hardest thing to do in a film... when you construct a conflict, how do you finish it? But also add to that equation the fact that these movies must follow a continuity regime that forces them down the rabbit hole even deeper... what's interesting to me, though, is that Snyder dug his own pit this time around, from the very beginning too with the highly divisive Man of Steel (2013). It leaves me to think that, not even a director's cut could've avoided the inevitability of that final act in order to give the other directors that stepped into this world enough material to keep constructing the DCEU. One that, apparently, didn't matter in the first place on account of the recent speculations that mention Warner Brothers completely binning it from existence.I suppose that's where my conflict starts, where could you have possibly taken these characters after this movie? It would definetly be downright impossible to overcome the challenge of doing something even more radically distinct, as this movie feels in some instants... Turns out, this exactly happened.The other movies from the DC universe depend fully on each other since this franchise built itself out with a lack of planning and preparation, that same thing has diminished the bigger picture.Which leads me to believe if a different outcome could've been a possibility to begin with... Just like with this movie, people are just uncapable of coming up with a different alternative to a natively complex story with even more convoluted limitations and, righfully so! The problem resides in the only alternative left, which is to wipe all the work out and give themselves a second chance, an opportunity to start from scratch... something tells me, though, history will repeat itself if the studio in charge keeps limiting its filmakers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The word Underrated gets thrown around a lot these days!,"This film is the most underrated movie I have actually seen. Going into this film knowing about all the negative reviews, the Rotten Tomato score, etc... I still was excited to see my two favourite superheroes on the big screen for the first time. I left the theatre wondering how in God's name did the critics get this so wrong?Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but mine is this: this movie exceeded my expectations. Ben Affleck is honestly the best Batman I've ever seen (Keaton close second; also not including voice acting - the amazing Kevin Conroy). I loved every second of Bruce Wayne/Batman, and his dynamic with Jeremy Irons' Alfred. Everybody knows about the warehouse scene, which is the best Batman fighting scene ever put to screen.Henry Cavill is a great Superman. I do feel like Batman may have taken the spotlight away from him, but I am looking forward to see where they go with him. The returning cast from Man of Steel was great, with a heart felt cameo appearance!Gal Gadot was terrific as Wonder Woman, my only complaint with this has to do with the marketing. It would have been much better to have not known anything about Wonder Woman appearing in the film until release (would have made an epic entrance even better).Jesse Eisenberg as Lex is... different. I wasn't a fan at first but then after repeat viewings he grew on me as I realized, this is a fresh take on the character (though I could not help but picture Michael Rosenbaum delivering those lines.... man that would have been special).One of the best characters in this film was the score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL. ""The Beautiful Lie"" is the most powerful song in the film, appearing at the beginning- the Wayne murder (which by the way was probably the best interpretation of it to date), and the famous ""MARTHA"" scene (which is one of the most powerful scenes in the film with Affleck's line delivery partnered with the music). Wonder Woman's theme also kicks some major arse and all the returning music from Man of Steel was great!To date I have seen this film 3 times, and each time I enjoyed it more and more. Is it perfect? No, no film is. I rated this a 10 because that is simply how much I enjoyed it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Visually dazzling, quite entertaining","That Batman V Superman is nowhere near the level of Nolan's Masterful Dark Knight Trilogy is a given, so even trying to compare the two is ludicrous. However, on its own merit, it manages to deliver; mostly. Trying to make Superman a brooding and complex character is largely nonsensical, and a lot of the themes the movie tries to play with aren't incorporated very well, instead of being introduced through dialogue or the plot itself, it's conveyed through News stories or the like. But when it comes to the overall style of the movie, it's much better. The distinctive Snyder cinematography and direction, coupled with Hans Zimmer's and Junkie XL's music is all definitely great. Ben Affleck isn't too shabby either, in his own right, even though Christian Bale shall always remain the true Batman for me, and maybe now Robert Pattinson in the upcoming The Batman movie. Definitely entertaining, 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ultimate Edition (Extended Cut),"As I only saw 2/3 of the theatrical cut (which was on a small, dark screen on a plane), the Ultimate Edition was incomparable to the original cut.That may have changed my opinion, but I remember seeing it on the small screen and thinking by myself: ""What is this story about?"". I never watched it in a decent way because, to be honest, it didn't interest me anymore.Then the Snyder Cut of Justice League arrived, making me want to rewatch Snyder's trilogy. As I said, I wasn't in the mood for another Batman v Superman anymore, but then I read about the Extended Cut. I read some pretty good reviews and gave it a shot.I'm still shocked about the amazing result.This cut really adds some critical elements to the whole storyline (as other reviews probably already told you), but it also fixes the 'mood' of the movie. It's an interesting and cool way to watch the movie how you should watch it. Of course, characters and actors stay the same, but even they can be seen in a new way.The theatrical cut would have probably been a 6-7 for me, the Ultimate Edition is a big 8.Of course, that's my opinion and I know I'm quite subjective as I didn't see the original in a proper way, but the only thing I can do is encourage all of you to watch the Ultimate Edition.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
DC fails once again,"Well, there was an era when Bolly Wood movies and Malayalam movies (BOTH FROM India) shares the story of two brothers who was separated in the childhood and they fights each other. And the villain always makes them fight for his personal gain and before the climax they will come to know that they are brothers because of a small clue or a common factor and fights together against villain. And happy ending. I think the writers David S. Goyer (batman begins, the dark knight,fury, Da Vinci's demons) and Chris Terrio (Argo) was inspired by the above said Bolly wood and Malayalam movies. The story is messy and the screenplay is ridiculous. Zack Snyder is back with another messy movie just like his previous Man of Steel. I don't know how the producers and DC comics vouched their precious millions on this stupid thing.Ben Affleck as Batman,he looked very massive whole throughout the movie and Henry Cavill was well-build. Ben Affleck was totally awesome in the new version / avatar of BATMAN. The furious, heart filled with vengeance, aggressive Batman. Henry Cavill's Superman looked handsome but was not up to the mark in terms of performance and till end his facial expressions were the same. Wonder woman, another superwoman just to add spice but was totally wasted. Jeremy Irons as Alfred was a letdown (we really miss Michael Caine here). Jesse Eisenberg who played the baddie reminded me of Indian actor SRK.. The style, dialogue delivery was same as Shah Rukh Khans gestures. The casting, i would say it was overcrowded. Some characters were not even justified a single moment. Just wasted. The acting of almost all the actors were boring. Numerous scenes in the movie had some moments. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL who carried out the music department was total let down. It was loud and not arranged in a good manner also created a negative impact.DC ONCE AGAIN FAILS BIG TIME.My clear rating is 5.5 on 10 An avoidable one.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Supreme Quality,"Easily the best superhero movie(there was a couple of solid movies, but they not even remotely close to this one like Unbreakable or Joker ), over the top shooting and action, solid dialogues, huge subtext and sense, good acting, amazing atmosphere and maturity. I'm probably the most doubting guy ever, but without a doubt this movie in some sense is a huge mastepriece. Ideally i'd prefer much more dialogues that have not direct attitude to the plot and it's events, full of character's thoughts, content and development, but in that case BvS would become my fav film). P. S. This was my first Snyder movie and surprisingly the only one that i liked, i'm still so impressed by it. And even more surprising thing, that my opinion about this movie growing with every other movie i watch. It's grown so much that of all my 370+ movies/series ratings this is my 11th 10 star rating for movies and 12th overall. I've already had this opinion for some time, and still technically it is my first 10 stars of last 110+ projects right after The Wolf of Wall Street, ironically that movie was also my first movie of Scorsese and i was again amazed by it and disliked everything else of him.

A dizzying mess,"My partner and I saw this film on a whim last week while on vacation, as we saw it was playing at the local IMAX theater. That right there should tell you that we're not fanboys who were anticipating the release of the film for months, unlike some of the other (both positive and negative) reviewers. I have however seen many of the modern-era (1978+) live-action Superman and Batman films, but not, notably, Man of Steel.Do *NOT* see this film without having first watched Man of Steel. I was completely bewildered for the first half-hour at least. I ended up watching Man of Steel a week later just to get a better understanding of what the hell was going on in the opening. I came away feeling the prior film was a much better movie, but seeing it did not improve my assessment of Batman v Superman at all; if anything, it made it seem even worse in comparison.This film was almost nonstop action, which I am not a fan of even in movies that have comprehensible plots and solid characters. This film had neither, so I felt like I was strapped into a roller coaster ride without my prior knowledge or consent for two and a half hours. The Hans Zimmer score was good, but the directing and editing made the film nearly unwatchable, independent of the visual effects.Besides the music, the only redeeming factors of the film for me were the casting of Affleck and Eisenberg as Batman and Luthor, respectively. Since I'm not a fanboy I had not read any prior criticism of the casting of either of these actors, both of whom I'd enjoyed in other films. I thought they did just fine here, given the limitations of how their characters were written.My partner, who is much more inclined to like action films, couldn't stand the directing or editing either. We spent the whole half-hour walk back to our hotel talking about how bad it was. Unless there are drastic changes down the line, I doubt I'll watch any further films in the Justice League series.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Really, really good","I was greatly impressed by this movie, much more than I thought I would be. I actually thought Ben Affleck was great in the role of Batman, contrary to pre-release public angst. Henry Cavill, of course, is awesome as Superman. Jeremy Irons is perfect as Alfred, the scolding father-figure-conscience that Bruce Wayne needs, although every time he opens his mouth I hear Scar (Jeremy Irons' iconic Lion King role). Laurence Fishburne was a welcome surprise as Perry White
This movie touches on a lot of subject matter, and takes its time nicely to develop back-story, side-plots, and flesh out Batman's violent and evil side. He's really a sadistic vigilante. But that's why we love him. Ben Affleck plays it gritty and angry, and it works. The casting of Eisenberg as Luthor was a little iffy and more annoying than evil, but he makes up for it in craziness. I don't want to give away anything else. This movie is definitely worth a watch. Really, really good!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than what people say,"Dark and brooding. This describes both Batman and Superman. It's also very similar to how the film is shot. This colossal movie takes the opposite approach to Marvel and The Avengers, but that's pretty much how they want to compete with them anyways. A follow-up to Man of Steel, Zack Snyder is once again at the helm. I'm thinking his visual style should be the opening topic.First, let's talk about the introductory 10 minutes. The opening credits is a stylish way to bring Batman's story back, and I enjoyed how it was kept brief with only the highlight moments (if you consider a double-homicide of his parents a highlight) since we all know the story already. The slow-mo works well in opening credits, and it's certainly cool, but Snyder definitely gets excessive with it. My favorite part of the film is what follows immediately afterward-- excluding the fact that Bruce Wayne was driving a Jeep Renegade. My favorite shot as well is in the 9/11-like destruction during the Man of Steel climax, but this time from a different perspective; and as the people dash away from the rubble, Bruce rushes towards it. The entire sequence, in fact, is powerful, for the film does a great job of playing off of one of my biggest complaints about Man of Steel, the destruction. Not only does this introduce the political aspect, but it also provides sound motivation for Bruce as he is unable to save the innocents from the crashing towers. This type of storytelling worked well, and maybe Snyder tried using it more in the form of those dreams/premonitions, but the vague references to comic book story lines didn't pull through in those scenes that may have been added just to put in the trailers. I will say, the one awesome moment is in the Batcave, and off to the side is what is presumed to be a Robin costume with a message from the Joker; don't worry, Snyder, I see you being clever.All right, let's talk us some superheroes. The movie toys with interesting moral dilemmas with Superman, and I still love Henry Cavill, but the overall impact isn't there. There are some cool shots with him still: the people surrounding him with their arms outstretched, and then when he's in space with the sun behind helping to rejuvenate him. On the other side of the two-headed coin (Batman reference), I mean, c'mon, Ben Affleck is awesome. I have always been a firm believer that his directing is far superior to his acting, but don't let that take away from what he does. With the Dark Knight himself, I love the branding. I'm all for it. I was slightly taken aback, however, by the free-spirited use of lethal force employed to take out the goonies. Maybe more interaction would have me more willing to simply say bye-bye to the baddies, but it does retract a little from what Batman usually represents and is used more of a way to set up conflict with Superman. I have no issues with the bulkier suit either; it makes more sense to me as they play with this older version of Batman. Which reminds me, I wasn't as much of a fan as some of my friends were and how they will say how awesome it is, but watching The Dark Knight Returns (animated but still dark) is highly suggested to get more of a full circle of Batman. Oh, and brief shout out to Jeremy Irons. You weren't fully utilized as Alfred, but I look forward to what you will give us in the future.Now we all know this sets up Justice League. And I was the most skeptical about cheap, forced ways of introducing the rest of the lineup, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was smart and to the point. Not sure how their looks are going to turn out, particularly when they get stand-alone films, but that will be a discussion for when the time comes.The other very, very smart move was having Gal Gadot be Diana Prince for the majority of the film instead of Wonder Woman even if how it was handled still felt clunky in areas. The reveal worked in to their favor. But it does leave much to look forward to with future outings.One of the issues I've noticed people have been most split on is Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. The best way I can describe his performance is as unconventional. At moments he was trying too hard to bring a more psychotic, schizophrenic approach, but in the context of the film it was a contrast vastly needed.And that ties into the next topic: Hans Zimmer. When we last saw him in the previous caped entry, his dull performance led me to miss the John Williams theme. One of the best parts of the movie was Zimmer bringing out his creative soundtrack; each superhero got a unique theme, and Luthor's blend of quick violins was pure awesomeness and was a redeeming grace to every scene featuring him because it brought out the character Eisenberg desperately tried to portray.To go back to the visual style, the film is too bleak; the lack of lighting renders some scenes as less effective, like the climax I will describe later. It caused too much straining to know what was presented on the screen instead of doing something like drawing attention to details to treat the observant, smart viewer. There are moments, but there's still a feeling that Snyder had to make sure he appealed to a wide audience, so the more hopeful viewer ends up being dumbed down to size to fit with the marketing. This isn't a dumb film, but a lack of deeper meaning behind visuals doesn't do much to stretch the brain.Before we move closer to the climax, lets talk about Batman scenes versus Superman scenes. I enjoyed Snyder's use of Bruce. Sure, some scenes dragged the run time out a little, but you could tell he was having fun working with such a different character. This is most evident in the action sequences. You know what I'm talking about from the trailers when I say I loved the Batman: Arkham style fighting. As a slight downer, in one of those weird vision scenes, there's a really long, circling take where Batman tosses bad guys all around as they take him on one at a time for the most part. While the long takes are always appreciated, the delicate nature of not wanting to mess up the fight choreography did lead to a held-back effort from the stuntman and actors.With glasses-wearing Clark Kent (still find the disguise lame, but I've had it explained that donning the glasses changes Kent's entire appearance, making it full disguise-- I like that explanation more, but it still seems kind of half-hearted), you'll get your fill of Diane Lane, Amy Adams, and Laurence Fishburne; but nothing better than from Man of Steel comes out, only scenes to propel the plot.Maybe this is a slight spoiler coming in after 2 hours, but if you don't know that Batman and Superman fight and that Doomsday makes an appearance, then you're already a lost cause. Go be like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, but change up the story and stay on the island. And now that I have tossed out the people that must have put life on mute for the opening weeks of the film, let's talk. This movie has my favorite use of kryptonite. It makes sense, and Batman uses such a cool array of gadgets during the fight. I will say that the fight was totally unnecessary, but if I'm like anybody that paid to see this, I wanted a fight, and a pretty darn good one I got. I also enjoy the idea of putting Doomsday in. But if you've seen Godzilla, King Kong, or even Clash of the Titans (not the laughable original, doesn't count) and its older brother Wrath, then nothing new is added honestly. Big, huge, ginormous, CGI creature with a menacing roar threatens total destruction. I guess teaming up on him can satisfy the nerd in us, but it went too far over-the-top.I am pleased with the outcome of the film, but the end has its predictable moments. If I had to summarize in one sentence, I would say that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a large improvement over Man of Steel and a very entertaining watch, but it doesn't hold the substance seen in The Dark Knight.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
given the gravity of the occasion it should've been a lot more fun,"Second installment in the new 'DCEU' is the long anticipated matchup between comic goliaths Clark Kent, aka Superman, and Bruce Wayne, aka Batman. Majority of the incoherent story consists of a buildup to their inevitable encounter as the Gotham City billionaire and socialite—having seen firsthand the destructive repercussions of the battle of Metropolis—attempts to preemptively combat the man of steel whose otherworldly abilities have made him a controversial figure in the eyes of government officials. Dark, grim comic book adaptation succeeds at bringing the two iconic superheroes to the big screen, but strips away all traces of humor and humanity, can't seem to decide which story it wants to tell, and ends in anticlimactic fashion. Not only that, but the action scenes are presented with such bombastic overkill that they fail to generate any real tension or excitement. Affleck and Cavill carry their weight admirably, but there isn't much in the way of character arc or development, and a woefully miscast Eisenberg certainly can't fill the shoes of Hackman or Spacey as Lex Luthor. Delivers on its promise, but a showdown of this proportion deserved a much better script. **",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Extended cut Is a masterpiece,"Although the theatrical version lacks the elements and scenes that give overall meaning to the film........director's cut of it is a masterpiece, Cuz literally you are gonna loose 30 mins of the film in theatrical version and complain that Film isn't good and doesn't make sense",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Contradictory filmmaking approaches hold 'Batman v Superman' back,"***This is a review based on the Ultimate Edition cut of the film***Arguably the two biggest heroes in comics have come together for ""the greatest gladiator match in the history of the world,"" a pretty tall order for DC Comics and Warner Bros., who have struggled to build the cache of their superhero universe over the years and watched in anguish as Marvel has become an unstoppable force of blockbuster hits that's changing the game for Hollywood.2013's ""Man of Steel,"" introducing Henry Cavill as Superman, was supposed to course-correct DC and Warner's ways, and while it was definitively better than, say, ""Green Lantern,"" its inability to reach the bar set by Marvel and Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy led to divisive opinions.And ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" is experiencing a similar fate.That shouldn't be a total surprise. DC Comics and Warner Bros. keep hitching their dreams of critical acclaim to director Zack Snyder and writer David S. Goyer, who both worked on ""Man of Steel"" and other comic book projects such as ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" (Snyder) and ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" (Goyer) and have yet to truly follow through on the promise their names once held.Yet neither Snyder nor Goyer can be entirely blamed for the negative reactions to ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman v Superman."" The craftsmanship is just not adding up to a cohesive vision, and what makes it on screen simply isn't resonating with fans.""Batman v Superman"" begins on a compelling enough of a foot. After giving us a visually striking montage retelling Batman's origin story, we see Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) navigating the destruction of the final sequence in ""Man of Steel."" As he looks to the sky in horror, we immediately get a sense of how his ideology will put him at odds with Superman.It also helps that this sequence meaningfully addresses a chief criticism of ""Man of Steel"" – all the reckless destruction of Metropolis trying to pass for a riveting climax. We see the impact of the devastation, and it sets a tone for the issues we will grapple with throughout the movie, about whether Superman is a god and a hero or poses a continuous danger to the world.Of course the ending of ""Batman v Superman,"" ironically involves even more reckless destruction trying to pass as meaningful entertainment. So the film contradicts itself, and therein lies the biggest problem – a crisis of tone and identity.Snyder and Goyer opt for a grim and gritty film, presumably continuing in the mold of Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" trilogy (Nolan had a story credit on ""Man of Steel""), but the seriousness doesn't gel with its other priority: being a flashy, digital effects-heavy blockbuster. There's a reason Nolan's films didn't feature excessive CGI grand finales. The story is actually rather thoughtfully constructed with some nice plot points that provide a handful of surprises for the audience. It's definitely more than a little messy having two main characters, arguably a third in Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and also wedging in Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and the setup for the ""Justice League"" movie, but it's compelling and creates some thought-provoking moments (at least in the ultimate edition).The other clash of tones comes in humor vs. seriousness. On one hand, you have a brooding Bruce Wayne and on the other, a theatrical Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg). Eisenberg's performance is good as a psychopath, but wrong for the movie and wrong for the character. The role attempts to emulate Heath Ledger's Joker but forgets that that was a man without a past dressed as a clown, not a famous billionaire in hipster garb. This Luthor would fit better in a more playful, Marvel-like movie.You could pick apart ""Batman v Superman"" in any number of ways, but you could do the same of a lot of superhero movies, some that are well-praised, even. The difference is these conflicts in tone. The incongruence opens the film up to our scrutiny because it keeps us from getting lost in the story and reminds us we're watching a film that's trying so hard to make sense.Because up until the very final moment in a big battle between our two heroes who greatly misunderstand each other, ""Batman v Superman"" gets the job done. Not in the smoothest of ways, but enough, much like ""Man of Steel"" did. The real sin is not learning from what held that film back.DC and Warner Bros. have already launched into ""Justice League"" with Snyder at the helm, but they'll continue to make the same mistakes unless someone can step in with a guiding vision. If there was enough of a singular vision in ""Batman v Superman,"" those mistakes wouldn't have happened. That's the difference between Marvel and DC's film universes – let's just hope there's still time for DC to catch up. Now that ""Justice League"" is happening, it's now or never.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Confused, muddled mess.","For a while I've been treating this film like religion, if it works for you great, I don't want to take your joy. Seeing so much praise for this film, and obviously bitter fans crapping all over Civil War has forced me to say my piece.I wanted to LOVE it. These are 3 characters that matter to me. On a surface level there are cool scenes, and cool images. Enough bombast and use of religious/mythological touchstones to overwhelm the senses. If you were to take a shot every time someone referenced gods/God/Angels, etc. you'd die of alcohol poisoning.Batfleck was great, though this was a decidedly brutal version of Bats, that should work as a great contrast to the optimism of the Big Blue Boyscout. Except that character was nowhere to be found (a smile is hard to be found in this film), which is sad because Cavil is a perfect choice for Kal-El. At least we get Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman (I guess) on film together for the first time right? Except, strangely I don't think Superman and Wonder Woman ever talk to each other, in a movie that's more than 2 and a half hours long!Those are personal gripes, but from a story/filmmaking standpoint the film is weak, and doesn't stand up to modest scrutiny. It confuses complicated with complex, and has plot lines that could be pulled out entirely without changing the story one bit. It relies on the fact that these characters exist in our minds as whole concepts. You know them even if you've never read a comic in your life, and you don't even realize we've gotten 2 movies now with Super Sadman. It does troubling things with these characters and it doesn't have the deftness to pull off the grim depths it was plumbing. Wonder Woman was great, in the few moments we got of her. This movie was ambitious, I'll give it that. It swung for the fences. But in doing so it whiffed hard and tossed the bat into the stands knocking out a fan. Also it was juicing and got a 10 game suspension.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

6.5. Tough to like after Nolan's trilogy,This movie got a lot of hate. A good portion of it justified but some not. I didn't hate it and thought it did some things well but DC is not handling the whole shared universe in movies thing well. Like marvel or not they worked on their formula for years and properly developed the characters. For me it was jarring to go to a fantasy like film after the Nolan bat trilogy. Some say it was too dark but I found that to be one of its strong points and something that sets DC apart from marvel characters. Man of steel was an overall better film than this I'd say which shouldn't be the case given the story. I think Ben affleck did an overall good job at an older angry Batman. Same with cavils Superman I think he played it well just don't think either of them have been given a strong story or direction to work with. It's worth a watch just for the nerd in you to see Batman and Superman dueling it out but that's not enough to carry the rest of the film,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dreadful film-making with no understanding of original characters,"This movie was probably the most awful superhero movie since Green Lantern. It's very hard to find a point to begin with, what makes this wannabe homage to iconic comic books such a dreadful experience. Maybe we can start with the absurd and weird dream sequences, which are very hard to distinguish from scenes in the ""real world"". They made no sense whatsoever and seemed completely out of place in this movie.What bothers me the most is, that Zac Snyder doesn't seem to understand the characters he is dealing with. The Batman in this movie is completely overwritten in his anger, hate and dreadfulness. Though the opening scene is handled OKish, I found it quite hard to understand, why Wayne would feel such rage against Superman. At least, Superman has done good stuff, as we are shown throughout the movie. Why Batman/Bruce Wayne wouldn't try to talk to Superman in the first place is beyond me. Instead he wants to outright murder him, which is not something Batman would do. Despite being cruel and quite vengeful, he still feels himself bound to justice. That's a very important part of his character, Snyder isn't able to grasp. And by the way: The whole opening premise collapses like one of the many buildings in this movie during the final fight, which is so ludicrous, even Wonder Woman cannot make it look exciting.On the other hand there is Superman/Clark Kent. Both roles are severely underwritten. Clark Kent has - in contrast to Bruce Wayne - basically nothing to do and remains a blank sheet throughout the hole movie. Unfortunately, Superman doesn't show to be a richer persona, as well. His lines of dialogue must fit on paper napkin, the meaningful ones should find enough space on a post-it-note. The biggest problem of Snyder is, that he doesn't find many ""Supermany"" things to do for Superman. His unique abilities are, much like in Man of Steel"", not really put to use. Instead, Superman ends up being thrown into and flying out of buildings a lot of the time. There is some punching, some eye-beams, then some throwing again. It's so tedious.In the end, Superman and Batman should find themselves on the same side, arguing about the means to reach their goal of bringing justice to people. It's this conflict, that makes Frank Miller's iconic graphic novel ""The Dark Knight"" so gripping. This movie is anything but.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fresh take on the genre,"This is the type of movie that doesn't take you the world of superheroes, rather it brings those god like icons to OUR world. I know people were not necessarily happy with this take, but this is exactly how the world would react if a super powered alien shows up, but despite all the doubting, all the hate, He sacrifices his life, to protect the people who could never understand them, only to finally inspire them, and a broken, lost Batman, he inspires bruce to believe that ""men are still good"". Truly a gem of a movie.PS. The cinematography and visual effects are on a different level.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A misunderstood film,"'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' is by no means a perfect film. But while I do understand why it is receiving some hate, it should not be looked upon as one of the worst superhero movies ever made.First off, Ben Affleck may be the best Batman we've ever had. He's an aged man with a troubled past, and you can completely understand his motivations. Affleck's performance is a fantastic introduction to the character, even without the benefit of an origin story. However, not to be overlooked is Jeremy Irons, who turns in a unique and almost sarcastic version of Alfred. He is witty and comical, even while being a father figure to Bruce Wayne. Henry Cavill is once again decent as Superman, and as Clark Kent. The directing is top-notch...in usual Zack Snyder fashion, the film is gorgeous, and reminiscent of the scenery of his previous films, and that is not a bad thing.Where this movie falters is the writing. It is sometimes poorly paced, and not every character seems important to the story. For example, Wonder Woman seems shoehorned into this film just to set up 'Justice League', and is not given much depth. Lois Lane seems to always be the damsel in distress, contributing almost nothing noteworthy. The film's biggest con, though, is that of Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. He seems incredibly cartoonish, and is the sore thumb in an otherwise well-cast ensemble.That being said, the film is a blast, especially in the third act. The CGI may not be perfect, the writing may be subpar, but the pure spectacle of it all makes 'Batman v Superman' a good film with some flaws. It is still extremely entertaining, and the positives of the film overshadow the negatives.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""All that is powerful can't be good""","Proceed with caution.""All that is powerful can't be good. And all that is good can't be powerful"". Deep. Dark. A logical paradox. Impressed? So was I...but not for long. What started off as a promise of a big bang ends with fluttering flare put out by an incoherent and weak plot. It's Batman Vs Superman. But what we get is a rouge Batman and a distracted Superman settling their petty squabbles with a brief fist fight that ends before it even starts.Without any comparison to the standards set by The Dark Knight - a dark and gritty take of a hero battling his own demons to outwit another demon, Batman Vs Superman plays upon the concept of dark and gritty excessively that the plot crumbles in its own weight and gets lost. You get disconnected as an audience. A superhero movie with great potential turns out to be a big emotional and psychological noise.Batman has a purpose. He knows what he is doing. He doesn't have pretentious thoughts or notion about anyone. He is smart. He is meticulous. But here we see a sloppy batman, haunted by nightmares, whose motive to start a vengeance against Superman makes no sense at all.And Superman, well let's not go there. How his will can be broken so easily is beyond me. And Doomsday? Felt more like a finale from a Power Ranger movie.Henry Cavil is as charming as ever. A perfect Superman. Ben Affleck's chest had more expression than his face. But then again, an aging batman can't be the excuse, or can it?Yes the effects were good. Yes the cinematography blended in with the actions like poetry, were good. But that is all you are going to get. After waiting for 3 years, a movie that promised to leave you wanting for more ends up in a sad afterthought, ""that's it?"" Maybe the movie is right after all...""All that is powerful can't be good.

Not bad,"I watched this one also on a long flight of seven hours. So, although sometimes long movies can be a bore, I was thankful that this one was well into two hours and something.The film is entertaining. That is what I asked for and what I got. It made me sit through it for two and something hours and I was not bored and kept my attention.Henry C as a Superman here was a bit less convincing than in Man of Steel film - for me. Amy A was the same as if it was the same movie ( and that surprised me that she was neither better nor worse than in previous one). Ben A as Batman ... do not what to say. He kinda did not fit ( in my mind) into that role. But, can not say he was bad. He was OK.The rivalry between them was kinda artificial for me. I did not get it actually. I was even more puzzled by the 'warrior woman' or whoever she was - maybe coz I am not familiar with the films where she is a 'star'.The soil did move on Superman's grave ...so, there will be 3rd part. As with this one, I will not probably watch it at home - maybe on some other flight - I hope it will be entertaining.Seven from me.

I envy everyone who liked this movie so much!,"Just to be clear I did not go into this movie with high expectations and that's the reason I'm disappointed. I went to a prescreening, fully prepared to be disappointed after seeing the trailers, but still in a good mood and hoping for the best. And to be clear, this movie isn't completely awful. But I went home disappointed and canceled my tickets for a second screening. I'm glad for everyone who liked this and wish they would stop dishing hate on people who didn't. The following is my opinion, you don't have to agree with me, but I'm not bought off or just hating on principle. This is how I feel about BvS: If we want to save Justice League, Snyder has to go.This movie is a jumbled mess. It tries to do too much. There's a Man of Steel sequel in there, they're introducing a new batman, setting up the Justice League and then they've got to cram some villain motivations in there too. Guess what? It doesn't work. If you try to cram three and a half movies into one, you can't properly flesh out what's going on. It's possible to follow the plot, but every time you start to get emotionally invested in a scene, it skips to somewhere else and doesn't pay off. Also, because we don't get to spend enough time with the characters, the motivations are inadequate. There is no real reason why the Batman vs Superman fight needs to happen except miscommunication which two hyperintelligent men like Batman and Superman would not have, and the reason it stops is paper thin as well. The major players only have a handful of scenes together. It's not enough. It is very easy to tell that the movie was cut down and it is glaringly obvious sometimes that pieces are missing. Characters refer to something as if they had talked about it before, even though they haven't, which tells you that scenes were cut. But even so, with all that stuff going on, the movie manages to drag. There's so much that we don't need to see, and it's disappointing that they chose to give us that instead of more time with our heroes. Another thing that angered me: if you're gonna put one stray joke in your movie, why spoil it by explaining the punchline? How stupid do you think your audience is? I found that offensive.It's not all bad of course. The cast is solid throughout. Batfleck is fine, so are Cavill, Gadot, Adams and Irons. But the dialogue they are given is so inauthentic it really bothered me. It's just exposition or pompous pep talks and not the way real people behave. I didn't like Eisenberg, but if the rest of the movie had been better, I would have been able to live with him. Visuals are great, as you would expect. Some of the action is good too, but not all of it. Those good points are where my three stars come from.All in all: This movie is setting up so much stuff that it fails at one crucial thing... being a standalone film. It's disjointed and choppy and we don't get to spend enough time with the characters to actually care about them or understand their motivations properly. To everyone out there who liked it: I'm happy for you. I envy you. You have no idea how lucky you are. But I just couldn't.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was pretty entertaining much of the time,"I admit I dreaded this movie since I first heard of this being made and while watching it, part of me still wasn't too enamored of some of what was going on concerning the characters of Superman and Batman. Let me also admit that I have yet to watch the previous Zack Snyder/Henry Cavill Superman movie, Man of Steel. Still, there's plenty of cool action and also many touching scenes especially those between Supes and Lois Lane, who in this one already knows Clark Kent's identity unlike what I previously knew of them from comics thorough the '70s-'80s not to mention the Christopher Reeve movies. My movie theatre-working friend possibly liked it more than I did (he clapped during some of the action scenes) but I didn't come away from this thinking it was worthless...just wondering why certain scenes were done the way they were. Really, I'll just say that for much of the time, I enjoyed Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and leave it at that. Also, Ben Affleck was as good as he could be as Batman and I felt he was okay as Daredevil way back in '03 as well. Okay, I'm done...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cardinal Sin was making characters stupid,"I just re-watched this leaden, disappointing movie, but decided to give the Ultimate Edition a chance.The overall experience was better, and this time around I realized the real problem with the film was that to get the ""big battle,"" they needed to make Bruce Wayne/Batman stupid and easily manipulated...and they needed to make Superman kind of thick, too. I liked Affleck's Batman, but hated that he was a moron, subject to a lot of Dramatically Convenient Stupidity(tm) which dragged the story toward the inevitable Superhero Showdown!As such, the peripheral characters were a lot more interesting than the putative leads. Alfred (Jeremy Irons) sarcastic asides about Bruce Wayne's mental health and social life made him feel like a real character. Holly Hunter as a crusading Senator was equally compelling. And yeah, Gal Godot's Wonder Woman made the entire film, that's no lie.Is it as awful as you heard? Probably not, but it's painful to see the missed opportunity for a good film. They were also handicapped by trying to ""make the entryway film to the DCU!"" by shoehorning in unnecessary cameos of heroes yet to come. The far more entertaining (critically and commercially successful) Wonder Woman seemed to have learned from B v. S's failures, and made a single movie that still managed to be open to other adventures and possibilities.And, that being said ""Justice League"" was a huge improvement, and worth watching, as well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Connection. The most under-appreciated film of our generation,"A completely unique take on America's two most famous comic book superheroes. An aggressive and ruthless Batman who is older and jaded. A sensitive and reserved Superman who has to deal with the pressures of being a hero and a villain by the world (as seen in a montage in the film known as the ""Day of the Dead"" scene.) The films major antagonist is Lex Luthor who is also a new, younger, and more psychotic take on the character. Calculated, but keeps up a very charming and humorous appearance.A common complaint in this film is that the plot and characters are ""messy"" and not well characterized. But if you take a deeper look, in a realistic situation, Bruce Wayne would develop major aggression and fear after 20 years of fighting crime (as well as the death of his parents at age 10.) And Clark Kent would logically feel a level of guilt for having caused damage to Metropolis following the fight at the end of Man of Steel, though he had no choice since the fight was to save the world. Collateral damage would be inevitable with two superhuman-like figures (Superman and Zod.)The performances in this film only add to the well written characters. Ben Affleck gives us an enticing interpretation of Batman that is smooth out of the costume and gritty and raw in it. Henry Cavil gives us a nuanced Superman and shows much emotion at times without saying a word, much like Affleck. Jesse Rosenberg gives us a humorous, but mysterious performance with implied past traumas making him the monster he is, also showing so much with facial expressions and not words.A complaint that is also very common for this film is the cinematography and visual effects. The films stylistic choices in this respect are actually quite fitting for the atmosphere of the film. Dark, with a sense of color and stylistic visual effects (since it is a comic book film.)The music in this film is as important as anything else. It truly makes you feel the majestic nature of Superman, the dark nature of Bruce Wayne and Batman, and the conniving nature of Lex Luthor. And the motif that has followed itself into the most recent DC film for Wonder Woman.The films polarizing, but in my mind BRILLIANT director Zack Snyder has sculpted his vision into film. It feels like the film Stanley Kubrick would have made if he loved superheroes. Much that is implied but not directly put into words, which works here because it adds depth and details to be discovered upon in different viewings.All in all, this film when seen with an open mind, is filled with depth and detail on virtually all levels. It is much more than surface level intrigue. I'd go into it more, but I don't want a spoiler filled review. This is my personal favorite comic book film, and cracks my top 20 favorite films. A unique cinematic experience that leaves me completely satisfied after every viewing.One last note. This film may never be recognized for the depth I believe it has, but I hope in time it does, the way many of the films recognized as classics now we're received when they were first released, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, and even Citizen Kane. So go into this film with an open mind and you might find there is more to it than many give it credit for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"If Batman is the film's conscience, Superman is its struggle.","Twenty years in Gotham as a crime fighting vigilante have brought more greyness for Bruce Wayne than just his hair. Amid glimpses of his burnt ancestral manor, memories of his slayed partner, insomnia due to nightmares, Alfred's criticism of him leading a life of solitude and his ruthless delivery of justice upon criminals, the ambiguity of Batman's moral stance quickly forms the film's conscience. It's a return to the gritty drama of the DC comics involving powerful politicians, twisted Businessmen and other-worldly beings that become villains for the righteous heroes. Zack Snyder ('300', 'Watchmen', 'Man of Steel') tests the heroism in the protagonists by pitting them against each other. Batman's brutal justice is questioned by a Daily Planet reporter whose alter- ego struggles to justify his act of good to skeptical citizens who only measure his actions by the collateral damage it causes. The greatest gladiator showdown thus features the more seasoned yet angrier Bat of Gotham vs the God-like Son of Krypton whose tremendous power leads to distrust among the very humans he is trying to protect. The clouds burst over Metropolis and Gotham with resounding thunder against the backdrop of a destroyed part of the city as Zack Snyder's 'Dawn of Justice' explodes with brute force.18 months ago, chaos and destruction ensued in Metropolis during the battle against General Zod. Unaware of the forces at play and their intentions, the citizens and Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) had a cynical approach to their savior. Mankind was thus introduced to the Superman. Burdened by the trauma of his childhood losses and frustrated with decades of crime fighting, Bruce Wayne is exhausted. Yet he remains determined to get to the bottom of Lex Luthor's dealings with a weapons trafficker and the code white Portuguese. This is when he is outwitted by the mysterious Diana Prince and the two end up with Luthor's secret files revealing the existence of a few metahumans. Meanwhile, the Man of Steel (Henry Cavill) busies himself saving lives across the globe. On one such instance, he rescues Lois Lane (Amy Adams) from African mercenaries, only to be framed for killing several innocent villagers. This brings him to a Senate hearing that seeks to limit his powers. For some, he is a symbol of hope for the lives he saved and for others including Bruce, he is a being whose limitless powers need to be in check. A clear distinction in each hero's approach leads to a divided stand which is connivingly manipulated into hatred by Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg). Annoyed by the Bat's meddling in his own affairs, he orchestrates the great Gladiator match while exposing Superman's weakness to his advantage. On a stormy night in Gotham and Metropolis, the epic showdown includes an all new Bat-suit, kryptonite, Martha, a demonic force created for annihilation and of course, Wonder Woman. This, is also what DC comics were all about. Absolute mayhem.David Goyer, who co-wrote Nolan's Batman trilogy, retains the elements of darkness, frustration and anger in this Batman but a more ruthless version of him. This knight of Gotham has endured enough evil for two decades to now brand all goons and thereby intimidate criminals. In contrast, the alien superhero has come to terms with his identity that shall bear a significant responsibility to save mankind. Yet the opinion of a few powerful individuals is more cynical and that adds another burden upon the red cape. Snyder captures the Batman in gritty noir fashion whereas Superman's globally heroic deeds are more epic.The action is bolstered by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL's rousing score and along with some exemplary visual effects that keep the characters closer to their comic roots, Snyder just throws everything at the audience till it overwhelms.Henry Cavill gets more absorbed into Superman's responsibility but finds himself at the crossroads of being a savior and a destructive force. The latter, is of course the result of manipulation and misunderstanding but the conflicted reception of him on Earth still weighs down heavily on him even though Martha (Diane Lane) suggested that he didn't owe the world a thing. In understanding the character's struggles, Cavill is by far, the best Superman to wear the cape. Jesse Eisenberg was an unlikely choice for the bald Lex Luthor we are used to seeing but as his younger version, his take of the psychotic, astute and manipulative millionaire is fun and lively. Amy Adams' Lois Lane has come to realize that fighting evil is her way of life as well now but we may not want Amy being involved in a superhero fight again. People were quite literally apprehensive about what Ben Affleck would do to their beloved Batman but he has pulled it off in the most convincing manner. As an ageing, exhausted and troubled vigilante, Affleck showcases a very different Batman and fits into those big shoes with remarkable ease. By far, the most dynamic entry and mesmerizing revelation has been that of Gal Gadot's Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She is a badass warrior who is deemed the most powerful of them all and it's her theme and entry that will have you whistling and cheering with excitement. Gal was a fantastic choice for such a powerful character and it will be exciting to witness her abilities in the future.If Batman is the film's conscience, Superman is its struggle. Zack Snyder distinctly creates sides for you to choose including your option to love or hate his decisions. Subtlety was never an option for this epic clash. With numerous references and clues to the big DC Universe, he sets the right tone with a more serious, gritty and cynical look at the heroes who make sacrifices to save mankind but are constantly criticized for the effect of their actions.

Awful,"This movie sucked donkey-balls. I would've probably rated it 5/10, but since 'someone' apparently speculates in boosting the scores on IMDb, I've taken the liberty of going all in on the opposite side of the scale. Notice how practically everyone who's written a review with a top-scale rating has created their IMDb- user within the last few days. With a Metascore of 44 and a Rotten Tomatoes-score of 33% (same as Paul Blart) you KNOW this sucks, but I went ahead and saw it anyways... Don't make the same mistake as me! It's a sad world, where people try to save a movie that sucks. Instead of owning up to the fact that you've made a terrible movie, you try to boost it up to make money. It's also very sad, that IMDb apparently doesn't have any type of security when it comes to booster-scams, since it takes 10 seconds to realise that the scores on this ""movie"" are just waaaaaay distorted (check out the average score, by clicking the number of votes below the overall rating) and if you click a couple of the top rated reviews you can see just how resent the ""user"" have created the profile.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A misunderstood departure,"BvS manages to assert its own tone and completely unique atmosphere, after the success of marvel DCs efforts to do something new must be commended rather than put down for not ""ticking the typical superhero flick boxes"" set in a world centred on the idea of how these heroes could exist in a real world, in which areal commentary on current situations weather they be underbaked or not, is used, is entirely fresh contrary to the over arching tale told by reviewers, and while the third act may be a little numb and uninteresting after the tense dark ""reality"" of the world being fleshed out as our 2 titular titans prepare to clash... The action in places is spectacular and in others is overdone leading to it coming off as bland do to overdramatisation.

Worse than the worst superhero movies Ghost Rider and X Men 3,"There are few experiences horrible than watching a bad movie. The last time i felt this uncomfortable and horrible in a theatre was while watching Ghost Rider -1 . Now i think that movie at least has some fun moments.I thought comic book movies are improving and becoming smart. This movie is awful. The whole movie is a funeral march. Not the kind where you feel sad. No, this funeral march is very irritating and just wrong !!!.Jesse Eisenberg should have been a awesome Lex luthor ! We already got a Joker. Why the hell did the movie makers made him into another joker ?Ben Affleck - Everybody kept praising him as Batman. This batman, it didn't matter who played this awful Batman. You never see Bruce Wayne in this movie only Batman. This Batman is old and cranky ! Again its not Ben's fault. The fault is that this movie makers are on crack and dunked their heads in toilet while making this movie.Henry Cavill - I thought he was a great Superman. I didn't like Man of Steel, but i never hated it. This superman is awful.The only good thing i have to say about the movie is Gal Gadot. She seems to be enjoying her role in the movie and the few little time she was on the screen, she was great.I hate Zack Snyder. I thought he was brilliant after watching 300 and Watchmen. No, he is not. He is like a bad candy. The first few bites tastes awesome but if you eat more than that, it will upset your stomach.I like comic book movies but don't read many comics. So, I assure you this hatred is not coming because i am a comic book fan. This movie is just bad. There are so many awful things that i want to say about this movie but i think lot of people covered it. The one thing I want to say is, DC movies could have been something.

Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice Was Flawed But Respectful,"7.5/10
This review comes from the person who never watch the theatrical version of the movie, and watch the Ultimate Edition instead, even with that i think Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice was a very big, huge, and wide complete film, it is one of the most darkest Superhero movie i've seen, not even The Dark Knight trilogy, but the difference between those two are that The Dark Knight trilogy while it still has it humor, the rest of the film was still execute way better than this, BVS was still very flawed, mostly from the runtime that are felt, Jesse Eisenberg horrible performance, and too long sequences, i'm pretty sure with the extended version, the consistency and the situation of the story was better even without watching the theatrical version, the in depth between two main characters was superb, the performance by all the cast especially Henry Cavill and Amy Adams performance that are way better than Man Of Steel, didn't have a problem with them, and of course Ben Affleck as both Batman and Bruce Wayne was great, and god i wish Lex Luthor played by another actor, it's too bad, the action sequence was good enough, overall BVS still not as amazing as what Marvel have been coming out at that time even The Ultimate Edition, it still a pretty good movie, and it's still an achievement of Superhero comics to get this movie happening just like The Avengers, flawed but respectful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Even worse than it is made out to be,"After saving Lois Lane from a terrorist group, Superman is accused of killing innocent civilians in the process, leading him to no longer be universally viewed as a benevolent force. Meanwhile Batman is dispensing his own justice, and is branded a vigilante. Batman views Superman as a threat to humanity, and Lex Luther is happy to fan the flames...I wasn't expecting much, but was initially pleasantly surprised by this movie. The background was interesting, and the whole ""Clark Kent meets Bruce Wayne but they don't know they're Superman and Batman"" interaction was intriguing.However, this quickly unraveled. Superman fighting Batman was always a preposterous idea, both in its likelihood and inevitability of the result. The logic and events behind them confronting each other is incredibly contrived and lame, and the fight and its result even more so.From then on it's just your usual comic book movie CGI and fight scenes, and even more mindless than normal, if that was possible. Well, the director is Zack Snyder...you weren't expecting any substance with that rather expensively generated style, were you?Throw in a script that seems written by a 10-year old and incredibly irritating acting by Jesse Eisenberg and you have a pretty poor movie. The only positives are the performance of Ben Affleck and the appearance of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman.

Ultimate Edition,"By the time I wrote this I did not have much time, so let's put it like this:The theatrical release was, to me, a 6-6.5 out of 10, because it was a little clumsy and slightly confusing at timesI finished watching the Ultimate Edition (3 hours) and it is indeed better than the one we had to watch in cinema... Well organised and the additions were clear and fit the story better, so it is an 8 for meLet's hope we'll have at least the quality of the Ultimate Edition release in the upcoming DC movies, and while I want them to be plausible, dramatic and somewhat dark movies, I think there's no need to such a try-hard serious tone, IMO...Thanks for reading and make sure you catch up with the Ultimate Edition",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Critics will always criticize, in the end it's what true fans think about the movie is what matters. I can't wait for the upcoming movies! All the actors did good.

Hero from above vs Hero from below,"Zac Snyders redemption from Man of Steel. In this 2nd installment to the DC Extended universe we see the raw emotion from billionaire Bruce Wayne as he watches the world crumble around him and lives destroyed of the people he was responsible for, this all comes from war brought to Earth chasing after the life of Superman we saw in the series' first instalment. As the two vigilantes hate grows more for the other a new enemy rises from the shadows.In this film we really get to see great story making come to life from characters we are already very familiar with. These new story lines for each character give a new look and emotional connection to each character. For Example: In this movie Batman does not gloat around with his riches but yet struggles throughout the film with the wound of his parents death and inability to save those he cares for the most in both his childhood and present. With Clark we get to see true bravery and selflessness shine through as he gives up all he has multiple times to save those who he is is closest to. We get a much more realistic role from Lois in this movie, the relationship she has with her boss really helps bring her character to life as she stays rebellious but holds the heart our story revolves around. She has the characteristics and morals that our heroes wish to posses but cant because of their already amazing abilities.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Zack Snyder should be banned from making movies, for crimes against entertainment.","This film is an endurance test, with no pay off. Soulless, dull and boring. I really wanted to like this film but its a stinker. No thrills, no humour and you don't care for anything or anyone. Its a real mess of a watch, it flat lines from the start building up very slowly,to the end fight. Which by then after watching 2hrs plus its a small relief to watch some thing abit more interesting that then goes back to flat lining. #Martha there are big flaws in the film but I wouldn't have minded if the film had been entertaining.The good- Ben Affleck can play batman.The bad- no humour, no thrills, totally disconnected from the movie.The ugly- 2hrs 30mins of a stodgy watch.

"Mediocre story, rather long film, dull action scenes","I am a comic book fan since I was a teenager. I am more fond of Marvel than I am is DC, however I have read some great stories published by DC, most of the featuring the Batman. Naturally, I like super-hero films. I am thrilled by the realism and the intensity that some instances of CGI may add to a good story. Because if the story is not good, there is not much to do in order to save the day. I was looking forward to Batman vs Superman (""BvsSP"" henceforth). I followed the updates and the controversy concerning some cast choices. I watched the teasers, they had a positive effect on me, since they made me want to go and watch this film. I have seen some of Zach Snyder's films. I thought his work in Watchmen was honorable, but then, that was a terrific story, not to his credit, of course. I liked what Christopher Nolan's Batman's trilogy and I must say I liked MOS. I read some of the reviews for BvsSP, I decided to try and make my own opinion. I will keep it short and pretty much spoiler-free. I thought this was a mediocre film. The story was rather inconsistent, notwithstanding the cast's efforts, the film felt as mediocre to me. I found there was too much slow motion and aestheticism (maybe a bit of Zack Snyder's trademark?), which meant that some touching scenes soon became cheesy and action lacked rhythm throughout the film. A medium zone between Michael Bay and Zack Snyder may be where action scenes are truly efficient. 3D and music did bring some intensity to the whole atmosphere, although some artistic/musical choices did leave me in wonder - a bagpiper at a funeral in Kansas? I found Kevin Costner's presence comforting (anything I should worry about?) and Jessee Eisenberg made for an interesting and convincing Lex Luthor. I have nothing either positive or negative to say about Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill. I think they did the best they could to play a fundamentally inconsistent script. Their characters' motivations seemed somewhat unclear to me at times, as much as some elements of the plot. Contrary to Disney/Marvel's The Avengers franchise, BvsSP failed to present interesting, developing characters. All in all, towards the end of the film, I felt the whole thing was a pretext to set up a new franchise. Yet the story felt really mediocre.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Bad, but not through lack of trying","Let me start off by saying that this movie is very poor indeed. The plot is nonsensical and barely even present, the action scenes are few and far between and every character lacks depth and development. That being said, Ben Affleck puts in a very good performance as a slightly cocky yet troubled Bruce Wayne/Batman. He is one of the few actors to portray both egos of a superhero character well and has definitely come along way since Daredevil (2003). Jeremy Irons also has a solid portrayal of Alfred and manages to do it without copying the fantastic work of Michael Cane in the Dark Knight Trilogy. My problem with this movie is not with Batman, I would still very much like to see a solo Batman movie starring Ben Affleck. My problem with this movie is not even with Superman or Wonder Woman despite the fact that both characters lack all discernible traits and are essentially just generic hero #1 and generic heroine #1.My real problem with this movie is the writing. The reason for the feud between Batman and Superman is nonexistent and is only really held together by pointless (albeit visually impressive) dream sequences that are never truly explained. It also doesn't help that teasers for upcoming DC movies Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg are so painfully shoehorned in.While I am a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and how they intertwine their movies I am not a fan of this dire attempt at it by DC. Not every movie has to be filler until the next one, I thought we had learned that from Iron Man 2.If the next movie in this universe is to improve on this, it has to be a movie. That means it can't just be a set up for the sequels as this so clearly is. Develop characters. Develop the plot. Make something that can be enjoyed on it's own, something that isn't just there to keep fans busy until the next one.In conclusion, I think this movie had potential that was wasted in trying to set up a franchise. Learn from your mistakes DC, nobody was expected Citizen Kane but we were definitely expecting better than this. If Green Lantern (2011) didn't exist then this would be the biggest misstep DC have ever made.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

bizarre story,"I'm not going into what is right and wrong concerning comics and the flick itself because I'm not into those comics. I went to a private screening at the world premiere, the place was full with Batman geeks vs Superman geeks, the T-shirts showed it all so their reaction could tell a lot.I did like Batman, The Dark Knight (2008). For me the best so far into the franchise. Superman wasn't my thing but to see those two together it was worth the wait. Have seen it once over at the reception you could easily spot two camps, the pro's and the contra's and no in-between. And I must say that i really had to think about what I just saw. The opening I could dig with, again, the history of Bruce Wayne seeing his parents being killed. But then Bruce falls into some kind of cave and is levitated by bats. From there on this flick takes a weird turn. You move over to Doomsday and the world being destroyed and then suddenly Superman appears from the sky, a bit hard to take.Of course they become enemies but towards the end they do fight together against Lex the bad guy. Once they are out for a fight the story goes really awkward with monster coming in and Wonder Woman showing up.The effects used are stunning but sometimes it's really dark, especially in the world (Gotham) of the Bat. And things are filmed in extreme close-ups so you don't know exactly what you are seeing. When Batman is fighting that is great with all his moves and equipment used. Superman is great too, flying away and having his special eyes but I can understand that some will have their doubts about this flick.Not the thing I thought I was going to see but above mediocre, that I can tell.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0,5/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Spectacular,"I will admit this up front, I was skeptical of this film going in. Ever since it started production, I have doubted it. From the title to the casting to the score, I judged every single thing.I had the opportunity to attend a pre-screening earlier tonight. My review won't contain spoilers.This film is not what I expected at all. From the trailers, it looked like it was going to a be massive CGI mess. And even though it heavily relied on CGI, it was not a mess. The opposite, actually. One of the strongest super-hero films produced.I'll begin with the negatives:CGI usually doesn't bother me, but the final battle in this film was a little overdone. So much destruction and mayhem that it pulled me out of the story for a few seconds. I was not convinced that Wonder Woman or even Superman could survive the damage Doomsday was causing.And . . . that's it. Honestly my only complaint about the film.Now for the positives:I'll begin with the cast.Jesse Eisenberg/Lex Luthor - Let's just say that Eisenberg drives this film. His psychotic attitude isn't overdone, and honestly, I found myself kinda liking the guy throughout the film. He's funny. His timing is brilliant. And he has some of the most chilling lines in the film. This is one of the biggest surprises I experienced.Henry Cavill/Superman played Clark Kent perfectly. The emotions that Superman faces throughout this film are extreme, and yet Cavill doesn't overplay them. He doesn't use tears to show you he's upset. It's in the way he stands, in the way his face moves, in the way he looks at the world. There are two scenes that really blew me away with his acting. One time when he's in physical pain, and the second time when he's in emotional pain.Amy Adams/Lois Lane did really well. Some of the lines she was given were a little cheesy, but she pulled it off. Surprisingly, I really connected with her character.Gal Gadot/Wonder Woman - Holy crap. Fabulous. That's all.Ben Affleck/Batman - He's a very different Batman and a very different Bruce Wayne than any we've seen before. He was definitely the casting choice I was most skeptical of, but Affleck pulls it off. More than once, he got me to hate Superman even when knowing Superman's side of things. This film focuses a lot on Batman. It's almost a Batman solo film, really, but that's besides the point. Affleck gets you to hate Superman when you know that Superman only means well. It's amazing and what makes this whole film work.As for Cyborg, The Flash and Aquaman, well, their introductions are executed perfectly. It wasn't forced at all, and it doesn't bog down or overwhelm the rest of the film. Batman v Superman is a perfect, and I mean a *perfect*, setup for the Justice League films.The Story - The trailers don't show you most of what the actual story is. I was blown away beginning with the opening scene. This is a deeply emotional story. There's a scene in this film between Batman and Superman that's the most powerful and emotional exchange I've ever witnessed in a superhero film before. It focuses a lot on Superman's and Batman's tragedies (but again, does not bog down the story). And there's a moment where both of their tragedies come together, and ultimately, I believe, it's what's going to be driving their friendship and teamwork for the rest of the DCEU.The film's resolution is well done. Again, a smooth setup for the Justice League.And the cliffhanger, though a little bit expected, is exciting.Overall, the film probably deserves a 7/10 or an 8/10, but I'll give it a perfect 10, because never have I seen Batman and Superman portrayed so humanely. It's the first Superman film that I've loved, and a perfect and fresh execution of Batman as well.Enthralling, action-packed, emotional, suspenseful, deep and a little bit ridiculous, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is the ultimate super-hero film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Crap movie, partial character development spoilers and a few spoilers about scenes, so don't read if you haven't seen the film yet","I gave this a 5 out of a 10 for the good special effects (minus the crappy looking CGI at the end) and also for the way Batman and Wonder woman look on screen, but everything else was average at best. Overall I found this movie to be boring and emotionless, especially the first 90 minutes of the film, a lot of it was not needed. They could have spent time building Lex Luthor and the other characters instead. However, there is no character build up, so when things happen you don't feel any emotion for any of the characters or their decisions. It all feels like it's just jumbled together. The opening scene was not needed and doesn't fit the rest of the movie, that would have been fine if it were a batman movie, but how many times do we need to replay the same story? We know Batman's origins already. The scenes felt very choppy and there was no flow in this film whatsoever. It really just felt like a slide show of photos. Just when you think something might happen, it just went right back down to more talking and scene switching. Eisenberg is horrible as Lex Luthor, and there is no explanation as to what he's doing or why. If they expect everyone to be aware of who he is just from the comics or past movies, then that was a mistake as well. He's not scary, he isn't a threat, he's a joke on screen. I don't see how people can view this as a good movie, it's not a good movie at all. Biased fans will say it's great, but that is because they are there to support DC, and not give a realistic view about the movie. For any fan of DC, Marvel, or any type of film about superheroes, you will be very disappointed with this film, just like I was. Maybe Marvel set the bar too high for movies now, but this is not even close to being comparable to one of the Marvel films. They are so much better. I also felt that The Man of Steel was a much better film than this one. At least that movie had some cohesion from scene to scene, and you felt emotion for the characters. I also have no interest in watching this movie a 2nd time, no replay value at all. Maybe the extended cut will be better, but I doubt a half hour can save this movie. As for the future, if someone other than Snyder directs the justice league, then it likely will be better. However, I don't see any hope of success for solo movies involving Cyborg or Aquaman. Wonderwoman and Batman are the only hopes for DC going forward. I hope this review helps.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One CGI Mess of a Dull Movie,This was simply one large CGI mess of a dull movie. There was NO character developed in this film at all. Not even Affleck's Bruce Wayne and that's the true let down. After Man of Steel we all kind of knew we'd get a wooden one dimensional Superman. We were all hoping that those reported Affleck re- writes on set would mean he was adding depth to his character the way he's done in the past with films he directed. I guess even a seasoned guy like Affleck couldn't make chicken soup out of chicken feces.I don't mind the camera angles or even the bad video game CGI shots because at least they tried to be different. That's understandable. What I hate is that they wrote such a terrible story and that every character was horribly shallow and under developed. Bruce Wayne is shallow and as one dimensional as Superman and that alone is part of the crime this film is most guilty of perpetrating. They never justify or connect to ANY character and that makes the stakes almost meaningless which is exactly what cartoonish films like Batman & Robin did with the character. It's as bad here because everything is just as shallow and as stupid but with none of the intended cheese of that Shumacker disgrace.This movie is truly a waste of film.,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
REAL,"In my opinion, I adore of how Superman is perceived by the humans in this movie. I also love the CGI, and the end battle with doomsday. I love how, even though Superman tries to do good, the world always second guesses him, or treats him like a god. I like it because it feels so REAL. Like that's how people would actually treat him if he was real. Debated about, worshipped, or hated. People always say that this Superman is evil, and that he's a killer! But he isn't! He always tried to do the right thing, even then, he got ridiculed. And people only say that he's evil because he got the cool heat vision and has a lot of shots with it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A disappointing mess,"Contrary to most people I actually enjoyed Man of Steel. While I objected to certain option the filmmakers took, I found it to be a thorughly enjoyable super hero movie. My positive reaction to ""Man of Steel"" gave me some hope for this oddly titled semi-sequel, despite the involvement of the likes of David S.Goyer and Zack Snyder. Sadly I found the movie to be a sprawiling, poorly scripted and paced mess that took itself too seriously - it's dudes in capes, not Nietzsche. The attempts at philosofy and depth were laughable, but nonetheless approached by the Director as if the script was intelligently written, which certainly was not. The action (of which there was very little until the dumb mess at the end) was poorly constructed, excessively CGI'd and very unexciting. A movie featuring such iconic characters of popular America culture should have been carefully and efficiently planned out. Such a massive gathering of iconic DC comics characters could have been, if handled right (as it has been before in comic books and animated movies and TV series),been something truly special. Instead we have this mess of a movie that does not deliver in any counts. Such a wasted opportunity. I regret deeply having awarded the people involved in this mess with the price of a theater ticket - they'll actually think they have done a good job and make a equally awful semi-sequel.I haven't been this disappointed with a movie in a long time.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Favorite Superhero Movie,"Give it a try, the initial reviews were wrong. Highly recommend the Ultimate edition for your first time watching the movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"You will Watch, but Nothing will Happen","This is my first review. That's not significant or anything, but I felt compelled to write a review for this movie. I won't bore you and say it was incredible, nor will I use unnecessary hyperbole and tell you it is the worst film in humankind's history. No, I'll say something even more damning than that: the movie was merely average. Spectacularly dreadful movies or remarkably well-done movies leave impressions on the viewer. No matter which way the film went, somehow, in some way, something resonated with the audience. Not so with this film. It was singularly unmemorable. In a word, it left me feeling nothing.To start off, the acting was passionless. By literally everyone. Henry Cavill was predictably dull. I thought Man of Steel was a major disappointment, but I couldn't put my finger on why. And now I know: it's Cavill. He's incessantly boring. I think I'd get more entertainment watching the blades of a fan. Ben Affleck gave it the old college try, but he was unconvincing as Batman. I just didn't believe him. Maybe I was too entrenched with Christian Bale, honestly, I don't know. But something about seeing Ben Affleck don the suit did not make me believe he was the Dark Knight. Ben is great in movies like Gone Girl and Argo, but he absolutely should not be one of the faces of an action movie. Amy Adams did her best I'm sure, but her portrayal of Lois Lane left a lot to be desired as well. She didn't appear inquisitive as Lois is supposed to. Instead, she just was in the way a lot, a nuisance if you will, and the scenes where she took the lead inspired deep sighs and eye rolls from me. Jesse Eisenberg was decent in most of his scenes and to be fair, he's generally a very good actor. But he must have been drinking the same water of mediocrity that Cavill, Affleck and Adams sipped from because he was very underwhelming. It seemed like he was trying to channel Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight Rises, but again, theme of this movie: it was not believable. He didn't seem insane or terrifying or deranged. He just seemed fake. In one scene, he hums a song in a psychotic way, and I found myself laughing at how hard he was trying to convince us he was a crazed mastermind. But it fell flat, very flat, just like everything else in this movie. I will say this though: Gal Gadot was superb. It's true what the critics say, she steals the show when she's on the screen. She made me believe she was truly Wonder Woman. She's a spectacular actress that doesn't get enough credit. Think back to her and the Fast and Furious movies. Doesn't she just OWN and command your attention when she's speaking? I'm looking forward to Wonder Woman, but after this movie, I'm unsure if it'll get green-lit.Another thing that makes this movie not unlike most other action movies is the utter preponderance of explosions. I get Superman is immensely fast and powerful, but why on earth does his very presence incite such destruction ALL THE TIME? I don't mean in a few scenes either, or at the very end during the climax, but I mean all movie, there's nothing but crazy bombs going off or rapid gunfire from automatic weapons or buildings exploding or the earth being devastated. It gets old quick. I don't recall seeing Michael Bay's name in the credits. It's all unnecessary, and it makes the movie both very messy and very unbelievable. I get you suspend belief but come on. If I want inane explosions, I'll just watch Bad Boys II. At least that has some comedy and good actors. One question lingers from me: how can a movie have such intense action and yet still remain immeasurably boring?Furthermore, this movie did not seem to have a real identity. Was it a dark film? It didn't seem that dark or brooding, again, just boring. It certainly did not have any comedic elements to it. The theatre was completely silent the entire movie. No cheers, no applause at the end, no enthusiasm, no laughs, no nothing. That's pretty hard to do when you imagine the amount of Superman and Batman fanboys we have on this planet. That's how uninspiring this movie was. It elicited no emotion. After it was over, I just slunk away to my car, numb. Not happy, not sad, not excited, not overly disappointed. I just felt nothing. That's what this movie does to you: nothing.That's what you should prepare for when you go to watch this movie: nothing. Just go see it. Temper your expectations and clear your mind and just sit there for 2 and a half hours. When you emerge, don't be disappointed, don't be angry, just continue to live life as you've been, because chances are, this movie will have no effect on you whatsoever.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Watch Ultimate extended version..,"For all those not liked the movie please watch Ultimate Remastered version aka director's cut.., you will like the film then.WB just messed it up for theatrical cut cutting 35mins just to get more shows, they didn't cared about soul of movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worth watching only for special effects,"The script of the movie is extremely poor. Even though this movie had two immense superheroes, the story is similar to most of the other generic movies. According to me, Ben Affleck was not an upright choice for the Batman character, he was dressed less like batman but more like the samurai. Henry Cavill has given exactly the same performance as his previous one, however, I still don't understand why most of the superheroes have to be newspaper reporters. The movie does have flaws and it was hard to follow what was going on, and the second half of the movie has bit predictable. Action scenes and special effects were definitely better, I truly enjoyed the 3D version of the movie. The most surprising stunning performance was by Amy Adams I was not anticipating. The villain (Jesse Eisenberg) was not at all terrifying or doesn't have elements of a bad guy. And at the end, the huge creature shows a lack of creativity, as it could have been much like a man from krypton. The fight between superman and batman seems unnecessary, just show- off their super power and the funny part was they just stop fighting because their mother's name was same. This movie has debilitated the standard-bar of old batman and man of steel movie. The movie is worth watching only for special effects.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I made an IMDb account because its that bad,If I could do it all over again I would of waited to watch it on red box there is nothing special or good about this movie. Wonder women is hot and an interesting character but batman and superman don't stay true to there characters and have very different personalitys than all the other superman and batman movies. The ending was so bad and they ruined batman and supermans values and characters. The fights where bad the story line was worse. The opening scene with batman as a child was paranormal. Also batman has supernatural powers and scenes in the episode that are so unrealalistic its not even entertaining. I really hope suicide squad is better if not im not going to see anymore of these movies in theater. Overall this was the worst movie I have seen in a while. I guess I got spoiled see the new star wars movie.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Don't listen to the critics, this is actually a fun movie.  Finally Batman and Superman team up in a movie.","For the past 10-15 years there has always been talk of a Batman v Superman movie but with the usual big questions of: Who will play Batman? Who will play Superman? Who will be the director? What will the movie be about? Fast forward to 2016 and finally this has come to life with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. This time Henry Cavill returns as Superman/Clark Kent after the huge success of Man of Steel (2013) and Ben Affleck takes over from Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Zack Snyder returns as director and he does a good job extravagantly teaming the Man of Steel and The Dark Knight for the first time on the big screen.Batman v Superman begins with the end of Man of Steel however this time it is from the view of Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) who witnesses the carnage, chaos and destruction of downtown Metropolis during the titanic battle of Superman (Henry Cavill) and General Zod (Michael Shannon). While Bruce Wayne does battle in Gotham City as Batman with the help of his faithful butler Alfred Pennyworth (Jeremy Irons), he still believes that Superman should be held accountable for all the collateral damage caused in Metropolis. Meanwhile Clark Kent, as his role as a newspaper reporter in the Daily Planet, believes Batman is nothing more than an intimidating vigilante and seeks to expose his identity, putting him at loggerheads with his boss Perry White (Laurence Fishburne). Clark Kent has also romantically linked up with fellow crusading reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams). At the same time a young businessman from LexCorp Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) is fixated on defeating Superman and tries to recover the kryptonite from the now deceased General Zod via Senator Finch (Holly Hunter) and with the help of terrorist Anatoli Knyazev (Callan Mulvey). While Batman/Bruce Wayne and Superman/Clark Kent prepare for a titanic clash against each other, little do they know that Lex Luthor is scheming to create the undestructible Doomsday. Batman and Superman also find themselves gaining a secret ally known as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot).Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is more of a spin off to Man of Steel (2013) with a majority of the actors returning from the original movie. I liked Henry Cavill as Superman/Clark Kent and he was very admirable in the role that immortalised Christopher Reeve. Ben Affleck was actually a very surprising casting as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He had very big shoes to fill considering Christian Bale set the bar extremely high following The Dark Knight trilogy. Surprisingly, Ben Affleck was very impressive and he did a terrific job. Despite being in his 40's, Ben Affleck was in fantastic shape and he filled the Batman suit very well. Gal Gadot had a small yet pivotal role as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman and I'm looking forward to seeing her return in future movies. Jesse Eisenberg follows in the footsteps of Gene Hackman and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor as a young criminal mastermind. Jesse Eisenberg's eccentric take on Lex Luthor was more similar to Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight although he was satisfying to watch.Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is getting an unfair mauling by critics yet I left the cinema very happy and content. I enjoyed the experience and without a doubt I was glad to see Batman and Superman finally team up in a movie. It looks like further sequels are going to eventuate with Zack Snyder getting things moving further down the track.All fans of Batman and Superman will enjoy this experience. I certainly had a fun time from start to finish.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but not so much action,"The overall movie is enjoyable. but the 1st half of the movie hardly had any action scenes at all, which is not preferred (and kind of strange) for a superhero movie. particularly one featuring 2 major superheroes and especially when they were expected to fight with each other (from the title and trailers etc). to be fair, this part of the movie is not boring, just won't feel much like a superhero movie. the later about 1/3 rd of the movie has quite good action, but buy this time you would have waited a bit too long. Lex Luthor also doesn't seem that impressive and sometimes feels like a common villain rather than a super-villain. if you watch the movie ignoring it to be a superhero movie, then you'll enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing film!,"I am not sure whether I had set my expectations too high after watching the marvel assemble films but I was very disappointed!The story is very poor indeed. Plus, batman's hatred of superman comes across as childish. The story behind the reason of why he turns against him is ridiculous and the reason behind why they settle their differences is even more ridiculous. Plus, This is the weakest Lex Luther performance seen in any superman film to date.It is an overly long film for such a poor story line. Saying that, the second half is more enjoyable and the ending fight scenes are very good.Despite all of this, I am a huge supermen fan and look forward to seeing him in his own films in the future! In my opinion, this film makes batman look like a stupid little child with a grudge against his more popular brother. It's a shame that batman would be portrayed in such a manner after the superb batman films of recent years!",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This movie is about as good as Ben Afflecks chubby face in the Batman suit,"There was excitement in the air upon hearing that a fully fledged movie would be created based on the DC animated movie ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2"", in which Batman has the ultimate fight with Superman. Upon seeing this film, I realized why some movies go straight to DVD over others, because they're garbage. Director Zach Snyder left no stone unturned for a horrible rendition of a classic DC animated movie, sure change things a little, not the entire plot. Zach has worked on other movies such as Dawn of the Dead, Watchmen and I'm guessing had some input on those infomercials late at night. Ben Afflecks portrayal as Batman was comedic, his face at times was spilling out of the Batman mask, not to mention the stubble mustache that materializes itself during the most critical scene in the movie. Batman also uses a ""robotic"" voice in order to speak, this isn't revealed as to why but it just is. Maybe they couldn't live up to the voice that Christian Bale used. Jesse Eisenbergs first appearance in the film had me asking what sort of role he was going to play, as time went on I kept telling myself ""this must be Lex Luthors son?"", no, Jesse Eisenberg plays the joker! Wait, hold on a second, he's Lex Luthor? With a full lock of hair. Lastly, Wonder Woman swings into action with a European accent. Wonder Woman is meant to portray all things American and she practically comes into the film speaking fluent Espanyol. Amy Adams is the only real positive to this movie, not particularly for her acting but you could say everyone came down to her level for it, so it felt OK? The story line is absolutely botched and follows the animated films plot line for around all of 20 minutes and then branches off into some ridiculous Micheal Bay themed ending. When I say ridiculous, I mean, this is utterly stupid and makes no sense. I feel like the director watched the animated film and thought ""how can I ruin this completely"". The story ends up being the complete opposite to the animated film and then some. It seems the film is only created in order to depict a larger DC universe that is sure to expand onto the big screen over the next decade, however, if these films are also built around a timely classic to gain the audiences attention, only to take a tangent off into a storyline the director forms in his head in a matter of days in order to make his mark on the franchise, I think I'll wait for the VHS version of them. Do they still make those anymore?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cartoony Script,"If you are any sort of fan of comics or super hero movies, you'd watch this anyways, so there's no reason to dissuade you. But if you're not, then I have absolutely NO REASON TO RECOMMEND YOU to watch this movie.The movie sacrificed pacing, character building, and plot, for ""comics fan-service."" If you're a fan of well-written movies with engrossing plot and intriguing characters, this movie has nothing for you. Arguably very few super-hero movies have memorable plot, but this one has nearly a unlikeable plot. (very minor spoiler): Batman hates Superman until a point he just changes his mind. (spoiler ends)If you've ever watched one of those Justice League cartoon/animated movies when you're younger, BvS is EXACTLY what it felt like: I had fun watching heroes in action, but who cares why they're doing it? It's a carton!! -That's pretty much the expectation you should have for BvS.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Most Underrated Comic Book Film Ever Made...,"First time watched it, instantly loved it! don't understand why it gets so many unnecessary hate. i think people just love to jump on the hate wagon because it's fun... they don't put their opinions to the side to know the quality.
so quality-wise, this was really a well-made film. considering how comic book films are made these days, this one was incredible! from the beginning to the ending, a non-stop art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Entretaining, but it's mistakes stop it from shinning.","This is by no means a bad movie. If you haven't seen it and you enjoy comic book movies you should see it and you will enjoy it. This is probably the best Batman we have ever had on the big screen, the action is great, and the movie was beautifully shot as any other Snyder movie, but you will often find yourself with a sour taste in your mouth from scenes that feel completely out of place because the movie was trying so hard to set up an upcoming movie, or scenes that don't make any sense at all that make the movie feel like it was rushed or the writers just didn't know how to join the upcoming movie and all the subplots form this movie together. Some parts are amazing, but they are eclipsed by the mess the script and plot are. Entertaining, but a complete waisted potential.For me this movie was as disappointing in it's depth as Man of Steel, but it still leaves me excited for the upcoming movies because this universe has a lot of potential.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
